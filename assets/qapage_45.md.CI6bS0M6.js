The Seahawks compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) West division. The Seahawks joined the NFL in 1976 as an expansion team. The Seahawks are owned by Paul Allen and are currently coached by Pete Carroll. Since 2002, the Seahawks have played their home games at CenturyLink Field (formerly Qwest Field), located south of downtown Seattle. The Seahawks previously played home games in the Kingdome (1976ÿ1999) and Husky Stadium (1994, 2000ÿ2001).\\r\\nThe Seahawks are the only NFL franchise based in the Pacific Northwest region of North America, and thus attract support from a wide geographical area, including some parts of Oregon, Montana, Idaho, and Alaska, as well as Canadian fans in British Columbia and Alberta.[6]\\r\\nSeahawks fans have been referred to collectively as the \\"12th Man\\",[7][8][9] \\"12th Fan\\",[10][11] or \\"12s\\".[12][13][14] The Seahawks' fans have twice set the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event, first on September 15, 2013, registering 136.6 dB during a game against the San Francisco 49ers[15] and again on December 2, 2013, during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints, with a then record-setting 137.6?dB.[16][17]\\r\\nOver the years several notable players have been Seahawks, including Shaun Alexander, Michael Bennett, Brian Blades, Brian Bosworth, Nate Boyer, Chad Brown, Dave Brown, Nate Burleson, Kenny Easley, Joey Galloway, Russell Wilson, Jimmy Graham, Jacob Green, Matt Hasselbeck, Steve Hutchinson, Walter Jones, Cortez Kennedy, Dave Krieg, Steve Largent, Marshawn Lynch, Joe Nash, Paul Richardson, Sheldon Richardson, Eugene Robinson, Michael Robinson, Sidney Rice, Richard Sherman, Michael Sinclair, Mack Strong, Golden Tate, Lofa Tatupu, Marcus Trufant, Curt Warner, Chris Warren, Fredd Young and Jim Zorn as well as, for a brief time, Hall of Famers Carl Eller, Franco Harris, Warren Moon, John Randle, and Jerry Rice. Largent (1995), Kennedy (2012), Jones (2014), and Easley (2017) have been voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame primarily or wholly for their accomplishments as Seahawks. Brown, Easley, Green, Jones, Kennedy, Krieg, Largent, Warner, and Zorn have been inducted into the Seahawks Ring of Honor along with Pete Gross (radio announcer) and Chuck Knox (head coach).\\r\\nThe Seahawks have won 10 division titles and three conference championships. They are the only team to have played in both the AFC and NFC Championship Games. They have appeared in three Super Bowls: losing 21ÿ10 to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XL, defeating the Denver Broncos 43ÿ8 for their first championship in Super Bowl XLVIII, and losing 28ÿ24 to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX. They are also the first, and to date only, post-merger expansion team in NFL history to play in consecutive Super Bowl games.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs per one of the agreed parts of the 1970 AFLÿNFL merger, the NFL began planning to expand from 26 to 28 teams.[18] In June 1972, Seattle Professional Football Inc., a group of Seattle business and community leaders, announced its intention to acquire an NFL franchise for the city of Seattle.[19] In June 1974, the NFL gave the city an expansion franchise. That December, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle announced the official signing of the franchise agreement by Lloyd W. Nordstrom, representing the Nordstrom family as majority partners for the consortium.[20]\\r\\nIn March 1975, John Thompson, former Executive Director of the NFL Management Council and a former Washington Huskies executive, was hired as the general manager of the new team. The name Seattle Seahawks (\\"Seahawk\\" is another name for Osprey) was selected on June 17, 1975 after a public naming contest which drew more than 20,000 entries and over 1,700 names.\\r\\nThompson recruited and hired Jack Patera, a Minnesota Vikings assistant coach, to be the first head coach of the Seahawks; the hiring was announced on January 3, 1976. The expansion draft was held March 30ÿ31, 1976, with Seattle and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers alternating picks for rounds selecting unprotected players from the other 26 teams in the league.[21] The Seahawks were awarded the 2nd overall pick in the 1976 draft, a pick they used on defensive tackle Steve Niehaus. The team took the field for the first time on August 1, 1976 in a pre-season game against the San Francisco 49ers in the then newly constructed Kingdome.\\r\\nThe Seahawks are the only NFL team to switch conferences twice in the post-merger era. The franchise began play in 1976 in the aforementioned NFC West but switched conferences with the Buccaneers after one season and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both expansion teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once (the ones in their conference at the time) during their first two seasons. The Seahawks won both matchups against the Buccaneers in their first two seasons, the former of which was the Seahawks' first regular season victory.\\r\\nIn 1983, the Seahawks hired Chuck Knox as head coach. Finishing with a 9ÿ7 record, the Seahawks made their first post-season appearance, defeating the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round, and then the Miami Dolphins, before losing in the AFC Championship to the Los Angeles Raiders. The following season, the Seahawks had their best season before 2005, finishing 12ÿ4.[25] Knox won the NFL Coach of the Year Award.\\r\\nIn 1988, Ken Behring and partner Ken Hofmann purchased the team for $79?million or $99?million (both numbers have been reported). The Seahawks won their first division title in 1988, but from 1989 to 1998 had poor records; their best record in that span came in 1990, when the team finished 9ÿ7, and the lowest point came in 1992 when the team finished with its worst record in team history, 2ÿ14.\\r\\nIn 1996, Behring and Hoffman transferred the team's operations to Anaheim, California, a widely criticized move, although the team continued to play in Seattle. The team almost relocated, and was in bankruptcy for a short period. The NFL threatened Behring with fining him $500,000 a day if he didn't move the team's operations back to Seattle;[26] with this, Behring and Hoffman sold the team to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in 1997, for $200?million, and in 1999 Mike Holmgren was hired as head coach. He would coach for 10 seasons. The Seahawks won their second division title, as well as a wild card berth in the playoffs.\\r\\nIn 2002, the Seahawks returned to the NFC West as part of an NFL realignment plan that gave each conference four balanced divisions of four teams each. This realignment restored the AFC West to its initial post-merger roster of original AFL teams Denver, San Diego, Kansas City, and Oakland.\\r\\nIn the 2005 season, the Seahawks had their best season in franchise history (a feat that would later be matched in 2013) with a record of 13ÿ3, which included a 42-0 rout of the Philadelphia Eagles on December 5, a game since referred to as the Monday Night Massacre. The 13-3 record earned them the number one seed in the NFC. They won the NFC Championship Game in 2005, but lost in Super Bowl XL against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The loss was controversial; NFL Films has Super Bowl XL at number 8 on its top ten list of games with controversial referee calls.[27] Referee Bill Leavy later admitted that he missed calls that altered the game.[28] Before 2005, Seattle had the longest drought of playoff victories of any NFL team, dating back to the 1984 season. That drought was ended with a 20ÿ10 win over the Washington Redskins in the 2005 playoffs.\\r\\nIn the 2009 NFL season, the Seahawks finished 3rd in the NFC West with a 5-11 record. Shortly after his first full season with the Seahawks, head coach Jim L. Mora was fired on January 8, 2010.[29] Mora was replaced by former USC Trojans football head coach, Pete Carroll. Shortly thereafter, Mora became the head coach for the UCLA Bruins football team.\\r\\nIn the 2010 NFL season, the Seahawks made history by making it into the playoffs despite having a 7ÿ9 record. They had the best record in a division full of teams with losing seasons (Seahawks 7ÿ9, Rams 7ÿ9, 49ers 6ÿ10, Cardinals 5ÿ11) and won the decisive season finale against the Rams (not only by overall record, but by division record, as both teams coming into the game had a 3ÿ2 division record). In the playoffs, the Seahawks won in their first game against the defending Super Bowl XLIV champs, the New Orleans Saints, 41ÿ36. The Seahawks made even more history during the game with Marshawn Lynch's 67-yard run, breaking 7 or more tackles, to clinch the victory. After the run the fans reacted so loudly that a small earthquake (a bit above 2 on the Richter Scale) was recorded by seismic equipment around Seattle.[30] The Seahawks lost to the Bears in their second game, 35ÿ24.\\r\\nThe 2012 NFL season started with doubt, as the Seahawks lost their season opener against the Arizona Cardinals, after the highly touted Seattle defense gave up a go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter, and rookie quarterback Russell Wilson failed to throw the game-winning touchdown after multiple attempts in the red-zone. However, Russell Wilson and the Seahawks went 4ÿ1 in their next five games en route to an 11ÿ5 overall record (their first winning record since 2007). Their 2012 campaign included big wins over the Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, and San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks went into the playoffs as the #5 seed and the only team that season to go undefeated at home. In the Wild Card Round, the Seahawks overcame a 14-point deficit to defeat the Washington Redskins. This was the first time since the 1983 Divisional Round that the Seahawks won a playoff game on the road. However, in the 2012 Divisional Round, overcoming a 20-point, fourth quarter deficit wouldn't be enough to defeat the #1 seed Atlanta Falcons. An ill-advised timeout and a defensive breakdown late in the game cost the Seahawks their season, as they lost, 30ÿ28. QB Russell Wilson won the 2012 Pepsi Max Rookie of the Year award.\\r\\nIn the 2013 NFL season, the Seahawks continued their momentum from the previous season, finishing tied with the Denver Broncos for an NFL-best regular season record of 13ÿ3, while earning the NFC's #1 playoff seed. Their 2013 campaign included big wins over the Carolina Panthers, New Orleans Saints, and the San Francisco 49ers. Six Seahawks players were named to the Pro Bowl: Quarterback Russell Wilson, center Max Unger, running back Marshawn Lynch, cornerback Richard Sherman, free safety Earl Thomas, and strong safety Kam Chancellor. However, none of them was able to play in the Pro Bowl, as the Seahawks defeated the New Orleans Saints 23ÿ15 and the San Francisco 49ers 23ÿ17, in the playoffs to advance to Super Bowl XLVIII against the Denver Broncos. On February 2, 2014, the Seahawks won the franchise's first Super Bowl Championship, defeating Denver 43ÿ8.[31] The Seahawks' defense performance in 2013 was acclaimed as one of the best in the Super Bowl era.[32]\\r\\nThe following season, Seattle advanced to Super Bowl XLIX, their second consecutive Super Bowl, but they were dethroned of their title by the New England Patriots by a score of 28ÿ24.\\r\\nThey got off to a slow start the next year starting 0-2 and 2-4 through 6 games but finished 10-6 on the year clinching a wild card berth. They beat the Minnesota Vikings 10-9 to advance to the divisional round. Against Carolina, they were down 31-0 at halftime before scoring 24 unanswered points. Their comeback attempt fell short and they failed to make the Super Bowl.\\r\\nMost recently, the Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers have begun to develop a rivalry, starting with the 49ers hiring of coach Jim Harbaugh for the 2011 NFL season. Harbaugh had coached against Seahawks coach Pete Carroll before in college at Stanford and Southern California, respectively. The 49ers won the first contest between the coaches at the NFL level, then proceeded to win a close game at CenturyLink Field to eliminate the Seahawks from playoff contention. 2012 brought a new season and another Seahawks loss, week 7 on NFL Network's Thursday Night Football at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, as they dropped a 13ÿ6 game where the offense failed to score a touchdown and 49ers quarterback Alex Smith did just enough to survive. Week 16 brought a fever anxiety as the Seahawks and 49ers prepared to face off in primetime on NBC Sunday Night Football. The Seahawks entered the game at 9ÿ5, with back-to-back blowouts in which the team scored more than 50 points in games against the Buffalo Bills and Arizona Cardinals. Quickly, the Seahawks imposed their will with a Marshawn Lynch 24-yard touchdown run, two of quarterback Russell Wilson's touchdown passes and a blocked field goal return had the Seahawks lead at halftime 28ÿ6. The Seahawks continued in the second half, eventually winning 42ÿ13 capped off by Seahawks strong safety Kam Chancellor's hit on former 49ers tight end Vernon Davis. The 49ers, however, won the following week, locking up the division title for the second consecutive season. Since rejoining the NFC West, the Seahawks lead the series 18ÿ15 versus the 49ers, including playoffs. Colin Kaepernick and the 49ers lost their first 2013 season matchup against their NFC West rivals 29ÿ3, with the help of Marshawn Lynch's three touchdowns, with the fans setting a new Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd roar at 136.6?dB.[33] However, the Seahawks were defeated 19ÿ17 in their second 2013 game with the 49ers at Candlestick Park. This was largely due to a late game 51-yard run by Frank Gore. The Seahawks had not won in San Francisco since 2008 until defeating the 49ers in convincing 19ÿ3 fashion on Thanksgiving Day in 2014. In the 2013 NFC Championship Game, the Seahawks defeated the 49ers 23 to 17,[34] thanks to Malcolm Smith's interception, which was tipped by Richard Sherman. This clinched the Seahawks' berth into Super Bowl XLVIII.\\r\\nThe Seahawks have developed a rivalry with the Carolina Panthers. The two teams have played each other in the NFL playoffs three times: during the 2005 NFC Championship Game, which Seattle won 34ÿ14; the 2014 NFC Divisional playoffs, which the Seahawks won 31ÿ17; and the 2015 NFC Divisional playoffs, which the Panthers won 31ÿ24. The Seahawks lead the Panthers in the all-time series 8ÿ4.\\r\\nFrom the 1980s to the 2002 league realignment, the Denver Broncos were a major rival for the Seahawks. With John Elway, the Broncos were one of the best teams in the NFL, going 200ÿ124ÿ1[35] overall, and were 32ÿ18 against the Seahawks. Since 2002, Seattle has won two of four interconference meetings, and the teams met in Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014, where the Seahawks won 43ÿ8.[36]\\r\\nDuring the Seahawks' first ten seasons (1976ÿ85), the team's headquarters was at Carillon Point on the shores of Lake Washington. The summer training camps were initially held at Eastern Washington University in Cheney, just southwest of Spokane. When the team's new headquarters across town in Kirkland were completed in 1986, the Seahawks held training camp at home for the next eleven seasons (1986ÿ96), staying in the dormitories of the adjacent Northwest College. In Dennis Erickson's third season as head coach, the team returned to the hotter and more isolated Cheney in 1997, where they held training camp through 2006. In 2007, training camp returned to their Kirkland facility, because of the scheduled China Bowl game that was later canceled. In 2008, the Seahawks held the first three weeks of camp in Kirkland, then moved to the new 19-acre (92,000?sq?yd) Virginia Mason Athletic Center (VMAC) on August 18 for the final week of training camp, where the team has held their training camps since. The new facility, adjacent to Lake Washington in Renton, has four full-size practice fields: three natural grass outdoors and one FieldTurf indoors.[37]\\r\\nWhen the Seahawks debuted in 1976, the team's logo was a stylized royal blue and forest green osprey's head based on Northwest Coast art.[38] The helmet and pants were silver while the home uniforms were royal blue with white, blue and green arm stripes. The road uniform was white with blue and green arm stripes. Black shoes were worn for the first four seasons, one of the few NFL teams that did in the late 1970s. They then changed to white shoes in 1980.[39]\\r\\nIn 1983, coinciding with the arrival of Chuck Knox as head coach, the uniforms were updated slightly. The striping on the arms now incorporated the Seahawks logo, and the TV numbers moved onto the shoulders. Helmet facemasks changed from gray to blue. Also, the socks went solid blue at the top, and white on bottom.[40] In the 1985 season, the team wore 10th Anniversary patches on the right side of their pants. It had the Seahawks logo streaking through the number 10. Starting in the 1989 NFL season, jerseys were no longer sand-knit. In 1994, the year of the NFL's 75th Anniversary, the Seahawks changed the style of their numbering to something more suitable for the team; Pro Block from then until 2001. That same year, the Seahawks wore a vintage jersey for select games resembling the 1976ÿ82 uniforms. However, the helmet facemasks remained blue. The logos also became sewn on instead of being screen-printed. In 2000, Shaun Alexander's rookie year and Cortez Kennedy's last, the Seattle Seahawks celebrated their 25th Anniversary; the logo was worn on the upper left chest of the jersey. In 2001, the Seahawks switched to the new Reebok uniform system still in their current uniforms, but it would be their last in this uniform after the season ended. Previously, the team's uniforms were made by Wilson, Wilson/Staff, Russell Athletic, Logo Athletic, and Puma.\\r\\nOn March 1, 2002, to coincide with the team moving to the NFC as well as the opening of Seahawks Stadium (which would later be renamed Qwest Field, then CenturyLink Field), both the logo and the uniforms were heavily redesigned. The Wordmark was designed by Mark Verlander and the logo was designed by NFL Properties in-house design team. The colors were modified to a lighter \\"Seahawks Blue\\", a darker \\"Seahawks Navy\\" and lime green piping. The helmets also were changed from silver to the lighter \\"Seahawks Blue\\" color after a fan poll was conducted. Silver would not be seen again until 2012. The logo artwork was also subtly altered, with an arched eyebrow and a forward-facing pupil suggesting a more aggressive-looking bird. At first, the team had planned to wear silver helmets at home and blue helmets on the road, but since NFL rules forbid the use of multiple helmets, the team held the fan poll to decide which color helmet would be worn. The team had usually worn all blue at home and all white on the road since 2003, but late in the 2009 season, the Seahawks wore the white jersey-blue pants combo. The blue jersey and white pants combo has been worn for only one regular season game, the 2005 season opener at the Jacksonville Jaguars, while the white jersey and blue pants combination has not been worn regularly since late in the 2002 season, with the exception of late in the 2009 season. In 2009, the Seahawks once again wore the white jersey and blue pants combination for road games against Minnesota (November 22), St. Louis (November 29), Houston (December 13) and Green Bay (December 27).\\r\\nThe Seahawks wore their home blue jerseys during Super Bowl XL despite being designated as the visitor, since the Pittsburgh Steelers, the designated home team, elected to wear their white jerseys.\\r\\nSince the Oakland Raiders wore their white jerseys at home for the first time ever in a game against the San Diego Chargers on September 28, 2008, the Seahawks are currently the only NFL team never to have worn their white jerseys at home.[41]\\r\\nOn September 27, 2009, the Seahawks wore lime green jerseys for the first time, paired with new dark navy blue pants in a game against the Chicago Bears. The jerseys matched their new sister team, the expansion Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer who wear green jerseys with blue pants. On December 6, 2009, the Seahawks wore their Seahawks blue jersey with the new dark navy blue pants for the first time, in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks broke out the same combo two weeks later against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and two weeks after that in the 2009 regular season finale against the Tennessee Titans. In December 2009, then-coach Jim Mora announced that the new lime green jerseys were being retired because the team did not win in them, because he liked the home jerseys better, and added that the home jersey is a better match for the navy pants.[42] In the same press conference, he stated that the new navy pants \\"felt better\\" on players as opposed to the Seahawks blue pants. For the 2010 season, Seattle returned to the traditional all \\"Seahawks Blue\\" at home and all white on the road.\\r\\nOn April 3, 2012, Nike, which took over as the official uniform supplier for the league from Reebok, unveiled new uniform and logo designs for the Seahawks for the 2012 season. The new designs incorporate a new accent color, \\"Wolf Grey\\", and the main colors are \\"College Navy\\" and \\"Action Green\\". The uniforms incorporate \\"feather trims\\", multiple feathers on the crown of the helmet, twelve feathers printed on the neckline and down each pant leg to represent the \\"12th Man\\", referring to the team's fans.[3][43] The Seahawks have three different jersey colors: navy blue, white, and an alternate grey jersey. The Seahawks will have three different pants: navy blue with green feathers, gray with navy blue feathers, and white with navy blue feathers. Their new logo replaces the Seahawk blue with wolf grey. Altogether, there are nine (9) different uniform combinations possible.\\r\\nThe Seahawks wore their Nike home blue jerseys for the first regular season game on September 16, 2012 against the Dallas Cowboys. The uniform Marshawn Lynch wore in that game is preserved at the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[44] On September 9, 2012, the Seahawks wore their Nike white away jerseys for the first regular season game against the Arizona Cardinals; on October 14, 2012, with the Carolina Panthers wearing white at home, they wore their blue jerseys with gray pants (and would do so again against the Miami Dolphins seven weeks later); and on December 16, 2012, they wore their Alternate Wolf Grey jerseys for the first time against the Buffalo Bills.\\r\\nAs of the end of the 2017 season, the Seattle Seahawks have competed in 42 NFL seasons, dating back to their expansion year of 1976. The team has compiled a 334ÿ323-1 record (16ÿ15 in the playoffs) for a .508 winning percentage (.516 in the playoffs). Seattle has reached the playoffs in 16 separate seasons, including in the 2005 season when they lost Super Bowl XL to the Pittsburgh Steelers, the 2013 season when they defeated the Denver Broncos to win Super Bowl XLVIII, and the 2014 season when they lost Super Bowl XLIX to the New England Patriots. In the 2010 season, the Seahawks became the first team in NFL history to earn a spot in the playoffs with a losing record (7ÿ9, .438) in a full season; this was by virtue of winning the division. The Seahawks would go on to defeat the reigning Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints in the Wild Card round, becoming the first team ever to win a playoff game with a losing record. Until Week 7 of the 2016 season, the Seahawks had never recorded a tied game in their history.\\r\\nRunning backs\\r\\nWide receivers\\r\\nTight ends\\r\\nDefensive linemen\\r\\nDefensive backs\\r\\nSpecial teams\\r\\n\\r\\nRoster updated April 16, 2018\\r\\nDepth chart ?

The team's first home stadium, the Kingdome, was one of the loudest and most disruptive environments in the NFL. Opponents were known to practice with rock music blaring at full blast to prepare for the often painfully high decibel levels generated at games in the Kingdome.\\r\\nIn 2002, the Seahawks began playing at what is now CenturyLink Field. Every regular season and playoff game at CenturyLink Field since the 2nd week of the 2003 season has been played before a sellout crowd.[51] Like the Kingdome before it, CenturyLink Field is one of the loudest stadiums in the league. The stadium's partial roof and seating decks trap and amplify the noise and reflect it back down to the field. This noise has caused problems for opposing teams, causing them to commit numerous false-start penalties. From 2002 through 2012, there have been 143 false-start penalties on visiting teams in Seattle, second only to the Minnesota Vikings.[52]\\r\\nThe Seahawks' fans have twice set the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event, first on September 15, 2013, registering 136.6 dB during a game against the San Francisco 49ers[15] and again on December 2, 2013, during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints, with a roar of 137.6?dB.[16][17] As of September 29, 2014, the record of 142.2?dB is held in Arrowhead Stadium by fans of the Kansas City Chiefs.[53]\\r\\nPrior to kickoff of each home game, the Seahawks salute their fans by raising a giant #12 flag at the south end of the stadium.[54] Current and former players, coaches, local celebrities, prominent fans, Seattle-area athletes, and current owner Paul Allen have raised the flag. Earlier, the Seahawks retired the #12 jersey on December 15, 1984 as a tribute to their fans.[55] Before their Super Bowl win, the Seahawks ran onto the field under a giant 12th Man flag.\\r\\nIn September 1990, Texas A&M filed, and was later granted, a trademark application for the \\"12th Man\\" term, based on their continual usage of the term since the 1920s. In January 2006, Texas A&M filed suit against the Seattle Seahawks to protect the trademark and in May 2006, the dispute was settled out of court. In the agreement, which expired in 2016, Texas A&M licensed the Seahawks to continue using the phrase, in exchange for a licensing fee, public acknowledgement of A&M's trademark when using the term, a restriction in usage of the term to seven states in the Northwest United States, and a prohibition from selling any \\"12th Man\\" merchandise.[56][57][58] Once the agreement expired, the Seahawks were allowed to continue using the number \\"12\\" but were no longer permitted to use the \\"12th Man\\" phrase.[59] In August 2015, the Seahawks decided to drop their signage of the \\"12th Man\\" term and shifted towards referring to their fans as the \\"12s\\" instead.[60]\\r\\nStarting in the 1998 season, Blitz has been the Seahawks' official mascot. In the 2003 and 2004 seasons, a hawk named Faith would fly around the stadium just before the team came out of the tunnel. However, because of her relative small size and an inability to be trained to lead the team out of a tunnel, Faith was replaced by an augur hawk named Taima before the start of the 2005 season. Taima started leading the team out of the tunnel in September 2006.[61] Beginning in 2004, the Seahawks introduced their drum line, the Blue Thunder. The group plays at every home game as well as over 100 events in the Seattle community.\\r\\nAs of 2017[update], the Seahawks' flagship station is KIRO (AM) 710 kHz ÿ KIRO-FM 97.3 MHz. Games are heard on 47 stations in five western states and Canada. Microsoft holds naming rights for the broadcasts for their web search engine under the moniker of the \\"Bing Radio Network\\". The current announcers are former Seahawks players Steve Raible (who was the team's color commentator from 1982 to 2003) and Warren Moon. The Raible-Moon regular season pairing has been together since 2004 (during the preseason Moon works for the local television broadcast so the color commentary is split between former Seahawks Paul Moyer, Sam Adkins, and Brock Huard). Pete Gross, who called the games from 1976 until just days before his death from cancer in 1992, is a member of the team's Ring of Honor. Other past announcers include Steve Thomas from 1992 to 1997, Lee Hamilton (also known as \\"Hacksaw\\") from 1998 to 1999, and Brian Davis from 2000 to 2003.\\r\\nPreseason games not shown on national networks were produced by Seahawks Broadcasting and televised by KING-TV, channel 5 (and, in 2008, also on sister station KONG-TV since KING, an NBC affiliate, was committed to the Summer Olympics in China). Seahawks Broadcasting is the Emmy Award Winning in-house production and syndication unit for the Seattle Seahawks. Curt Menefee (the host of Fox NFL Sunday) has been the Seahawks TV voice since the 2009 preseason. Since the 2012 season, KCPQ-TV, which airs most of the Seahawks regular season games (as the Seattle-Tacoma area's Fox affiliate), is the television partner for the team and has replaced KING 5 as broadcaster for preseason games, while simulcasts of any Seahawks games on ESPN's Monday Night Football or NFL Network's Thursday Night Football airs on either KONG-TV or KZJO.[62] In addition, any Saturday or Sunday afternoon games broadcast by CBS (with the Seahawks hosting an AFC opponent) will air on local CBS affiliate KIRO-TV.\\r\\nSource:[63]\\r\\nExplanatory notes\\r\\nCitations","context":"What are the colors of the seattle seahawks?"},{"output":"Dave Evans","context":"AC/DC are an Australian hard rock band, formed in Sydney in 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young.[1] A hard rock/blues rock band,[2] they have also been considered a heavy metal band,[3][4][5][6] although they have always dubbed their music simply \\"rock and roll\\".[7]\\r\\nAC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, in 1975. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist.[8] Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller.\\r\\nThe band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was their first album to reach number one in the United States. Drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and replaced by ex-A II Z drummer Simon Wright, who left to join Dio in 1989. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip, released in 2000, was well received by critics. The band's studio album, Black Ice, released in 2008, was the second-highest-selling album of that year, and their biggest chart hit since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide.[9] The band's line-up remained the same until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement due to early-onset dementia and Rudd's legal troubles. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring on account of worsening hearing loss and Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose stepped in as the band's vocalist for the remainder of that year's dates. Long-term bass player Cliff Williams retired from the band at the end of their 2016 Rock Or Bust world tour.\\r\\nAC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 71.5 million albums in the United States, adding them to the list of highest-certified music artists in the United States and the list of best-selling music artists.[10][11][12] Back in Black has sold an estimated 50?million units worldwide, making it the second-highest-selling album by any artist ÿ and the highest-selling album by any band. The album has sold 22?million units in the US, where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time.[13] AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the \\"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\\"[14][15] and were named the seventh \\"Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time\\" by MTV.[16] In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the \\"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\\".[17] Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as \\"the greatest rock and roll band of all time\\".[17] In 2010, AC/DC were ranked number 23 in the VH1 list of the \\"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\\".[18]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBrothers Malcolm, Angus, and George Young were born in Glasgow, Scotland, and moved to Sydney with most of their family in 1963. George was the first to learn to play the guitar. He became a member of The Easybeats, one of Australia's most successful bands of the 1960s. In 1966, they became the first local rock act to have an international hit, with the song \\"Friday on My Mind\\".[19] Malcolm followed in George's footsteps by playing with a Newcastle, New South Wales, band called the Velvet Underground (not to be confused with the New York-based Velvet Underground).[20] Their older brother Alex Young chose to remain in Britain to pursue musical interests. In 1967, Alexander formed and played bass in the London-based band Grapefruitinitially called \\"The Grapefruit\\"with three former members of Tony Rivers and the Castaways, John Perry, Geoff Swettenham, and Pete Swettenham.\\r\\nMalcolm and Angus Young developed the idea for the band's name after their sister, Margaret Young, saw the initials \\"AC/DC\\" on a sewing machine. \\"AC/DC\\" is an abbreviation meaning \\"alternating current/direct current\\" electricity. The brothers felt that this name symbolised the band's raw energy, power-driven performances of their music.[21][22] \\"AC/DC\\" is pronounced one letter at a time, though the band are colloquially known as \\"Acca Dacca\\" in Australia.[23][24] The AC/DC band name is stylised with a high voltage sign separating the \\"AC\\" and \\"DC\\" and has been used on all studio albums, with the exception of the international version of Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.[25]\\r\\nIn November 1973, Malcolm and Angus Young formed AC/DC and recruited bassist Larry Van Kriedt, vocalist Dave Evans, and Colin Burgess, ex-Masters Apprentices drummer.[26] Pushing hard for the band's success were Australia's legendary roadie Ray Arnold and his partner Alan Kissack. Gene Pierson booked the band to play at Bondi Lifesaver on New Year's Eve, 1973.[27]\\r\\nBy this time, Angus Young had adopted his characteristic school-uniform stage outfit. The idea was his sister Margaret's. Angus had tried other costumes: Spider-Man, Zorro, a gorilla, and a parody of Superman, named Super-Ang.[20] In its early days, most members of the band dressed in some form of glam or satin outfit.\\r\\nOn stage, Evans was occasionally replaced by the band's first manager, Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with Sherbet prior to Daryl Braithwaite. Evans did not get along with Laughlin, which also contributed to the band's ill feeling toward Evans.[28] By the middle of 1974, the band had built up a strong live reputation which led to a support slot for the visiting Lou Reed.\\r\\nSome time in 1974, on the recommendation of Michael Chugg, veteran Melbourne promoter Michael Browning booked the band to play at his club the Hard Rock. Browning had previously managed Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, unsuccessfully trying to break them into the UK market. He did not like their glam rock image and felt that Evans was the wrong singer for the band, but was impressed by the Young brothers' guitar playing. Shortly afterwards, he received a call from the band; Laughlin had quit as manager, and they were stuck in Adelaide with no money. Browning agreed to bail them out and booked them for another gig at the Hard Rock. Following the gig, they agreed to take him on as their new manager, with the co-operation of their older brother George and Harry Vanda.[29]\\r\\nThe Young brothers decided to abandon the glam rock image which had already been adopted by Melbourne band The Skyhooks and pursue a harder blues-rock sound. To this end they agreed that Evans was not a suitable frontman for the group.[28] Around this time, they also moved their base to Melbourne, where they frequently played at the Hard Rock.\\r\\nIn September 1974, Ronald Belford \\"Bon\\" Scott, an experienced vocalist and friend of George Young, replaced Dave Evans[30] after friend Vince Lovegrove recommended him to George Young.[8] Like the Young brothers, Scott was born in Scotland and emigrated to Australia in his childhood. The band had recorded only one single with Evans, \\"Can I Sit Next To You, Girl\\" / \\"Rockin' in the Parlour\\"; eventually, the song was re-written and re-recorded with Bon Scott as \\"Can I Sit Next to You Girl\\" [Track 7 on the Australian album TNT (1975), and Track 6 on the international release of High Voltage (1976)].\\r\\nBy October 1974, the Australia-only album High Voltage had been recorded. It took only ten days[31] and was based on instrumental songs written by the Young brothers, with lyrics added by Scott. Within a few months, the band's line-up had stabilised, featuring Scott, the Young brothers, bassist Mark Evans and drummer Phil Rudd. Later that year they released the single \\"It's a Long Way to the Top\\", for which a well-known promotional video was made for the program Countdown, featuring the band miming the song on the back of a flatbed truck. The song is regarded as their perennial rock anthem.[32] It was included on their second album, TNT (1975), which was also released only in Australia and New Zealand. T.N.T. featured the song \\"High Voltage\\", which was the first song written and recorded for the album. Because \\"High Voltage\\" was released as a single before T.N.T. was released, some people thought it was the title track to AC/DC's debut album.\\r\\nAC/DC were scheduled to play at the 1975 Sunbury music festival, however they went home without performing following an altercation with the management of headlining act Deep Purple.[33]\\r\\nBetween 1974 and 1977, aided by regular appearances on Molly Meldrum's Countdown, the ABC's nationally broadcast pop-music television show, AC/DC became one of the most popular and successful acts in Australia. Their performance on 3 April 1977 was their last live TV appearance for more than 20 years.[31]\\r\\nBrowning sent promo material to contacts in London, which came to the attention of Phil Carson of Atlantic Records. In 1976, the band signed an international deal with Atlantic Records. On arrival in London, their scheduled tour with Back Street Crawler was cancelled following the death of Paul Kossoff. As a result, they went back to playing smaller venues to build a local following until their label organized the \\"Lock Up Your Daughters\\" tour sponsored by Sounds magazine, the only major music magazine which was still relatively receptive to traditional rock music. At the time, punk rock was breaking out in London and came to dominate the pages of the major music weeklies, NME and Melody Maker. AC/DC were sometimes identified with the punk rock movement by the British press, however in reality they hated punk rock, believing it to be a passing fad - according to manager Michael Browning \\"it wasn't possible to even hold a conversation with AC/DC about punk without them getting totally pissed off\\".[29] Their reputation, however, managed to survive the punk upheavals of the late 1970s, and they maintained a cult following in the UK throughout this time.[7] Angus Young gained notoriety for mooning the audience during live performances.\\r\\nThe first AC/DC album to gain worldwide distribution was a 1976 compilation of tracks taken from the High Voltage and T.N.T. LPs. Also titled High Voltage, and released on the Atlantic Records label, the album has to date sold three million copies worldwide.[34][35] The track selection was heavily weighted toward the more recent T.N.T., and included only two songs from their first LP. The band's next album, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, was released in the same year in both Australian and international versions, like its predecessor. Track listings varied worldwide, and the international version of the album also featured the T.N.T. track \\"Rocker\\", which had previously never been released internationally. The original Australian version included \\"Jailbreak\\" (now more readily available on the 1984 compilation EP '74 Jailbreak or as a live version on the 1992 Live album). Dirty Deeds was not released in the US until 1981, by which time the band were at the peak of their popularity.\\r\\nAfter a brief tour of Sweden, they returned to London where they set new attendance records during their residency at the Marquee. However, their appearance at the 1976 Reading Festival failed to get a response from the crowd. They toured extensively throughout Europe, then returned to tour Australia in late 1976 to rebuild their finances and record the Let There Be Rock album.\\r\\nIn early 1977 they returned to Britain and began a European tour with Black Sabbath. While Bon Scott and Ozzy Osbourne quickly became friends, relations were less than cordial between the other members of the respective bands. In one incident, Geezer Butler pulled a knife on Malcolm Young.[36] Later in the year they toured with Rainbow.\\r\\nTowards the end of 1977, bassist Mark Evans was fired; purportedly to find someone who could sing backup vocals.[8] Evans described disagreement with Angus and Malcolm as a contributing factor.[8] He was replaced by Cliff Williams.[8] Neither of the Young brothers has elaborated on the departure of Evans, though Richard Griffiths, the CEO of Epic Records and a booking agent for AC/DC in the mid-1970s, later commented, \\"You knew Mark wasn't going to last, he was just too much of a nice guy.\\"[20] Mark Evans' autobiography, DIRTY DEEDS: My Life Inside/Outside of AC/DC, released in 2011, predominantly dealt with his time in AC/DC, including being fired.[37]\\r\\nAC/DC were a somewhat formative influence on new wave of British heavy metal bands who emerged in the late 1970s, such as Saxon and Iron Maiden, in part as a reaction to the decline of traditional early 1970s hard rock bands. In 2007, critics noted that AC/DC, along with Thin Lizzy, UFO, Scorpions and Judas Priest, were among \\"the second generation of rising stars ready to step into the breach as the old guard waned.\\"[38]\\r\\nAC/DC's first American exposure was through the Michigan radio station AM 600 WTAC in 1977. The station's manager, Peter C. Cavanaugh, booked the band to play at Flint's Capitol Theater. The supporting act was MC5, who had just briefly reunited and agreed to play at the event. The band opened with their popular song \\"Live Wire\\" and closed with \\"It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\\".[39] They gained invaluable experience of the stadium circuit, supporting leading rock acts such as Aerosmith, Kiss, Styx, UFO, and Blue ?yster Cult, and co-headlined with Cheap Trick.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1978 release of Powerage marked the debut of bassist Cliff Williams, and with its harder riffs, followed the blueprint set by Let There Be Rock.[40] Only one single was released from Powerage, \\"Rock 'n' Roll Damnation/Sin City\\". An appearance at the Apollo Theatre, Glasgow during the Powerage tour was recorded and released as If You Want Blood You've Got It, featuring such songs as \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\", \\"Problem Child\\", and \\"Let There Be Rock\\", as well as lesser-known album tracks like \\"Riff Raff\\". Powerage was the last album produced by Harry Vanda and George Young that had lead vocals by Bon Scott, and is claimed to be AC/DC's most under-rated album.[41]\\r\\nThe major breakthrough in the band's career came in their collaboration with producer \\"Mutt\\" Lange on the album Highway to Hell, released in 1979. Eddie Van Halen notes this to be his favourite AC/DC record, along with Powerage.[42] It became the first AC/DC LP to break into the US top 100, eventually reaching No.?17,[31] and it propelled AC/DC into the top ranks of hard rock acts.[7] Highway to Hell had lyrics that shifted away from flippant and comical toward more central rock themes, putting increased emphasis on backing vocals but still featured AC/DC's signature sound: loud, simple, pounding riffs and grooving backbeats.[43] The final track, \\"Night Prowler\\", has two breaths in quick succession at the start of the song, intended to create a tone of fear and loathing.[7]\\r\\nAs 1980 began, the band began work on a new album that would eventually become Back in Black, but Bon Scott would not live to see it finished. On 19 February 1980, Scott passed out in the car on the way back to friend Alistair Kinnear's house after a night of heavy drinking at the Music Machine club in London. Upon arrival at his home, Kinnear was unable to move Scott from the car into his home for the night, so he left him in the car overnight to sleep off the effects of the alcohol. Unable to wake Scott late the next morning, Kinnear rushed him to King's College Hospital in Camberwell, where Scott was pronounced dead on arrival. Pulmonary aspiration of vomit was the cause of Scott's death,[44] and the official cause was listed as \\"acute alcohol poisoning\\".[45] Scott's family buried him in Fremantle, Western Australia, the area they emigrated to when he was a boy.[46]\\r\\nInconsistencies in the official accounts of Scott's death have been cited in conspiracy theories, which suggest that Scott died of a heroin overdose, or was killed by exhaust fumes redirected into the car, or that Kinnear did not exist.[45] Additionally, Scott was asthmatic,[47] and the temperature was below freezing on the morning of his death.\\r\\nFollowing Scott's death the band briefly considered quitting, but encouraged by the insistence from Scott's parents that he would have wanted them to go on, they eventually decided to continue and went about finding a new frontman.[8] Various candidates were considered for his replacement, including: Buzz Shearman, ex-Moxy member, who was not able to join because of voice problems,[48] ex-Back Street Crawler vocalist Terry Slesser and then Slade vocalist, Noddy Holder.[49] The remaining AC/DC members finally decided on ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson.\\r\\nAngus Young later recalled, \\"I remember the first time I had ever heard Brian's (Johnson) name was from Bon. Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see if we can find him.\\"[50]\\r\\nFor the audition, Johnson sang \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" from Let There Be Rock and Ike & Tina Turner's \\"Nutbush City Limits\\".[22] He was hired a few days after the audition. With Johnson the band completed the songwriting that they had begun with Scott for the album Back in Black. Recording took place at Compass Point Studios in The Bahamas a few months after Scott's death. Back in Black, produced by Mutt Lange and recorded by Tony Platt, became their biggest-selling album and a hard-rock landmark; hits include \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" and the title track. The album reached No.1 in the UK and No.4 in the US, where it spent 131 weeks on the Billboard 200 album chart.[31]\\r\\nThe follow-up album, 1981's For Those About to Rock We Salute You, also sold well and was positively received by critics. The album featured two of the band's most popular singles: \\"Let's Get It Up\\"[51] and the title track, \\"For Those About to Rock\\", which reached No.13 and No.15 in the UK, respectively. The band split with Lange for their self-produced 1983 album, Flick of the Switch, in an effort to recover the rawness and simplicity of their early albums.[52]\\r\\nAfter having problems with drugs and alcohol,[54] drummer Phil Rudd's friendship with Malcolm Young deteriorated and eventually escalated to a physical confrontation after which Rudd was fired.[22] Former Procol Harum drummer B.J. Wilson was drafted in to help complete the recordings, but his drum parts were eventually not used, as Rudd had already completed his drum parts.[55] Rudd was replaced by Simon Wright in the summer of 1983 after the band held over 700 auditions in the US and UK.[56] Simon Kirke of Free and Bad Company fame, and Paul Thompson of Roxy Music were two of the drummers auditioned.[57]\\r\\nLater in the year, AC/DC released the self-produced album Flick of the Switch, which was less successful than their previous albums, and was considered underdeveloped and unmemorable.[52] One critic stated that the band \\"had made the same album nine times\\".[58] AC/DC were voted the eighth-biggest disappointment of the year in the 1984 Kerrang! readers' poll. However, Flick of the Switch eventually reached No.4 on the UK charts,[22] and AC/DC had minor success with the singles \\"Nervous Shakedown\\" and \\"Flick of the Switch\\". Fly on the Wall, produced by the Young brothers in 1985, was also regarded as uninspired and directionless.[59] A music concept video of the same name featured the band at a bar, playing five of the album's ten songs.\\r\\nIn 1986, the group returned to the charts with the made-for-radio \\"Who Made Who\\". The album Who Made Who was the soundtrack to Stephen King's film Maximum Overdrive;[41] it brought together older hits, such as \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" and \\"Ride On\\", with newer songs such as title track \\"Who Made Who\\", and two new instrumentals, \\"D.T.\\" and \\"Chase the Ace\\".\\r\\nIn February 1988, AC/DC were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association's Hall of Fame.[60]\\r\\nAC/DC's 1988 album, Blow Up Your Video, was recorded at Studio Miraval in Le Val, France, and reunited the band with their original producers, Harry Vanda and George Young. The group recorded nineteen songs, choosing ten for the final release; though the album was later criticised for containing excessive \\"filler\\",[61] it was a commercial success. Blow Up Your Video sold more copies than the previous two studio releases combined, reaching No.2 on the UK chartsAC/DC's highest position since \\"Back in Black\\" in 1980. The album featured the UK top-twenty single \\"Heatseeker\\"[51] and popular songs such as \\"That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll\\". The Blow Up Your Video World Tour began in February 1988, in Perth, Australia. That April, following live appearances across Europe, Malcolm Young announced that he was taking time off from touring, principally to begin recovery from his alcoholism. Another member of the Young family, Stevie Young, temporarily took Malcolm's place.\\r\\nFollowing the tour, Wright left the group to work on the upcoming Dio album Lock Up the Wolves, and was replaced by session veteran Chris Slade. Johnson was unavailable for several months while finalising his divorce,[22] so the Young brothers wrote all the songs for the next album, a practice they continued for all subsequent releases through Rock or Bust in 2014.\\r\\nThe next album, The Razors Edge, was recorded in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and was mixed and engineered by Mike Fraser and produced by Bruce Fairbairn, who had previously worked with Aerosmith and Bon Jovi. Released in 1990, it was a major comeback for the band, and included the hits \\"Thunderstruck\\" and \\"Are You Ready\\", which reached No.5 and No.16 respectively on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart, and \\"Moneytalks\\", which peaked at No.23 on the Billboard Hot 100.[51] The album went multi-platinum and reached the US top ten. Several shows on the Razors Edge tour were recorded for the 1992 live album, titled Live. Live was produced by Fairbairn, and is considered one of the best live albums of the 1990s.[62] AC/DC headlined the Monsters of Rock show during this tour, which was released on DVD as Live at Donington. During The Razors Edge tour three fans were killed at a concert at the Salt Palace in Salt Lake City, Utah in January 1991. When the concert began fans rushed the stage crushing the three and injuring others. It took 20 minutes before venue security and the group understood the severity of the situation and stopped the concert. AC/DC settled with the victims' families out of court. As a result of this incident, the Salt Palace eliminated festival seating from future events.[63][64] A year later, AC/DC recorded \\"Big Gun\\" for the soundtrack of the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie Last Action Hero, and was released as a single, reaching No.1 on the US Mainstream Rock chart, the band's first No.1 single on that chart.[31]\\r\\nIn 1994, Angus and Malcolm invited Rudd to several jam sessions. He was eventually rehired to replace Slade, whose amicable departure arose in part because of the band's strong desire to again work with Rudd. Recorded at the Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles by the reunited 1980ÿ83 line-up and produced by Rick Rubin, Ballbreaker was released in 1995. The first single from the album was \\"Hard as a Rock\\". Two more singles were released from the album: \\"Hail Caesar\\" and \\"Cover You in Oil\\".\\r\\nIn 1997, a box set named Bonfire was released. It contained four albums; a remastered version of Back in Black; Volts (a disc with alternate takes, outtakes, and stray live cuts) and two live albums, Live from the Atlantic Studios and Let There Be Rock: The Movie. Live from the Atlantic Studios was recorded on 7 December 1977 at the Atlantic Studios in New York. Let There Be Rock: The Movie was a double album recorded in 1979 at the Pavillon de Paris and was the soundtrack of a motion picture, AC/DC: Let There Be Rock. The US version of the box set included a colour booklet, a two-sided poster, a sticker, a temporary tattoo, a keychain bottle opener, and a guitar pick.[65]\\r\\nIn 2000, the band released Stiff Upper Lip, produced by brother George Young at the Warehouse Studio, again in Vancouver. The album was better received by critics than Ballbreaker but was considered lacking in new ideas.[66][67] The Australian release included a bonus disc with three promotional videos and several live performances recorded in Madrid, Spain in 1996. Stiff Upper Lip reached No.1 in five countries, including Argentina and Germany; No.2 in three countries, Spain, France and Switzerland; No.3 in Australia; No.5 in Canada and Portugal; and No.7 in Norway, the US and Hungary. The first single, \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\", remained at No.1 on the US Mainstream Rock charts for four weeks.[31] The other singles released also did very well; \\"Satellite Blues\\" and \\"Safe in New York City\\" reached No.7 and No.31 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks, respectively.\\r\\nIn 2002, AC/DC signed a long-term, multi-album deal with Sony Music,[68] who went on to release a series of remastered albums as part of their AC/DC remasters series. Each release contained an expanded booklet featuring rare photographs, memorabilia, and notes.[69] In 2003, the entire back-catalogue (except Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip) was remastered and re-released. Ballbreaker was eventually re-released in October 2005; Stiff Upper Lip was later re-released in April 2007. Also in 2003, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\\r\\nOn 30 July 2003, the band performed with the Rolling Stones and Rush at Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto. The concert, held before an audience of half a million, was intended to help the city overcome the negative publicity stemming from the effects of a 2003 SARS epidemic. The concert holds the record for the largest paid music event in North American history.[70] The band came second in a list of Australia's highest-earning entertainers for 2005,[71] and sixth for 2006,[72] despite having neither toured since 2003 nor released an album since 2000. Verizon Wireless has gained the rights to release AC/DC's full albums and the entire Live at Donington concert to download in 2008.[73]\\r\\nOn 16 October 2007, Columbia Records released a double and triple DVD titled Plug Me In. The set consists of five and seven hours of rare footage, and even a recording of AC/DC at a high school performing \\"School Days\\", \\"TNT\\", \\"She's Got Balls\\", and \\"It's a Long Way to the Top\\". As with Family Jewels, disc one contains rare shows of the band with Bon Scott, and disc two is about the Brian Johnson era. The collector's edition contains an extra DVD with 21 more rare performances of both Scott and Johnson and more interviews.[74]\\r\\nAC/DC made their video game debut on Rock Band 2, with \\"Let There Be Rock\\" included as a playable track.[75] The setlist from their Live at Donington live album was released as playable songs for the Rock Band series by means of a Wal-Mart-exclusive retail disc titled AC/DC Live: Rock Band Track Pack.[76]\\r\\nNo Bull: The Directors Cut, a newly edited, comprehensive Blu-ray and DVD of the band's July 1996 Plaza De Toros de las Ventas concert in Madrid, Spain, was released on 9 September 2008.[77]\\r\\nOn 18 August 2008, Columbia Records announced 18 October Australian release, and 20 October worldwide release, of the studio album Black Ice. The 15-track album was the band's first studio release in eight years, was produced by Brendan O'Brien and was mixed and engineered by Mike Fraser. Like Stiff Upper Lip, it was recorded at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia. Black Ice was sold in the US exclusively at Walmart and Sam's Club and the band's official website.[80]\\r\\n\\"Rock 'n' Roll Train\\", the album's first single, was released to radio on 28 August. On 15 August, AC/DC recorded a video for a song from the new album in London with a special selection of fans getting the chance to be in the video.[81] Black Ice debuted at No.1 on album charts in 29 countries and also was Columbia Records' biggest debut album (since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales data for Billboard in March 1991). Black Ice has been certified Multi Platinum in eight countries, including the US, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Germany and the Czech Republic. Additionally Black Ice has achieved Platinum status in twelve countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, UK, Argentina, Singapore and New Zealand) and Gold status in four countries (The Netherlands, Spain, Poland and Brazil). The 18-month Black Ice World Tour supporting the new album was announced on 11 September and began on 28 October in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.[82]\\r\\nOn 15 September 2008, AC/DC Radio debuted on Sirius Channel 19 and XM channel 53. The channel plays AC/DC music along with interviews with the band members.[83]\\r\\nWith the North American release of Black Ice on 20 October 2008, Columbia Records and Walmart created \\"Rock Again AC/DC Stores\\" to promote the album. In October 2008, MTV, Walmart, and Columbia created \\"AC/DC Rock Band Stores\\" in New York City, at Times Square, and in Los Angeles. \\"Black Ice\\" trucks were also dispatched on the streets of these two cities after the release, playing AC/DC music aloud and making various stops each day to sell merchandise.[84]\\r\\nIn late September 2009, the band rescheduled six shows when Brian Johnson underwent an operation for ulcers.[85] On 29 September, the band announced a collection of studio and live rarities, Backtracks, which was released on 10 November 2009 as a 3-CD/2-DVD/1-LP box-set.[86]\\r\\nOn 4 November AC/DC were announced as the Business Review Weekly top Australian earner (entertainment) for 2009 with earnings of $105?million. This displaced The Wiggles from the number one spot for the first time in four years.[87]\\r\\nOn 19 April 2010, AC/DC released Iron Man 2, the soundtrack for the eponymous film.[88] One month later, the band headlined Download Festival at Donington Park,[89] and closed the Black Ice World Tour in Bilbao, Spain on 28 June 2010, after 20 months in which AC/DC went to 108 cities in over 28 countries, with an estimated audience of over five million people.[90] Three concerts in December 2009 at the River Plate Stadium in Argentina were released as the DVD Live at River Plate on 10 May 2011.[91] An exclusive single from the DVD, featuring the songs \\"Shoot to Thrill\\" and \\"War Machine\\", was issued on Record Store Day.[92] In 2011, the band also issued on DVD and Blu-ray the concert movie AC/DC: Let There Be Rock, which had its theatrical release in 1980.[93]\\r\\nAngus stated in an interview in early May 2011 that the band was beginning to plan another world tour, saying, \\"Now we're thinking, 'How can we ever better the 'Black Ice' world tour?' But we will.\\"[94] At the band's Live at River Plate DVD premiere on 6 May 2011 at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, England, Angus said that there were plans for the group to release a new studio album \\"within the next couple of years\\", which the tour would support.[95]\\r\\nIn May 2012, Malcolm Young confirmed that the band were working on a potential follow-up to 2008's Black Ice. But he warned that fans were in for a longer wait than expected, after lead singer Brian Johnson suggested there would be new material the next year. Malcolm stated, \\"You know what Brian's like. He just says things and then walks away. It'll be a little while?ÿ a year or two anyway. I've been doing some jamming on some song ideas but I do that all the time, as do the rest of the band. We are still working. But we had a long rest between Stiff Upper Lip and Black Ice, so I think we need a couple of years to recuperate and work on it a bit more.\\"[96]\\r\\nOn 19 November 2012, AC/DC released Live at River Plate,[97] their first live album in 20 years.\\r\\nOn 16 April 2014, in response to earlier reports that the band may be retiring due to Malcolm Young being seriously ill and unable to perform,[98] Brian Johnson commented that AC/DC are not retiring, stating \\"We are definitely getting together in May in Vancouver. We're going to pick up guitars, have a plonk and see if anybody has got any tunes or ideas. If anything happens we'll record it.\\"[99] AC/DC subsequently announced in an official statement on their Facebook page that Malcolm Young would be taking a break from the band due to his ill health. It ended: \\"The band will continue to make music.\\"[100] In June, Johnson announced that AC/DC are \\"very likely\\" to be on the road again before the end of 2014.[101] In July 2014, AC/DC confirmed that they have finished recording their next album and that Malcolm's nephew, Stevie Young replaced Malcolm in the studio.[102]\\r\\nDrummer Phil Rudd released his first solo album, Head Job, on 29 August 2014. He confirmed that there would be another AC/DC tour, and stated that the band had no intention of retiring, adding, \\"We'll all have to be dead before it stops.\\"[103]\\r\\nOn 23 September 2014, Alberts management confirmed that founding member Malcolm Young had officially departed from the band and revealed that their new record entitled Rock or Bust featuring eleven new tracks would be released on 28 November 2014 as the first AC/DC album in the band's history without Malcolm Young on the recordings.[1] The band also announced plans for a world tour to promote the new album with Malcolm and Angus' nephew Stevie Young as Malcolm's replacement.[104]\\r\\nOn 6 November 2014 Rudd was charged with attempting to procure a murder, threatening to kill, possession of methamphetamine and possession of cannabis, following a police raid on his home.[105][106] The charge of attempting to procure a murder was withdrawn the following day, but the other charges remained.[107] AC/DC released a statement clarifying that the tour promoting Rock or Bust would continue, but did not say whether or not Rudd would participate, or if he was still a member of the band.[108]\\r\\nIn an interview on 13 November, Angus Young stated that the band had experienced problems with Rudd earlier in the year when recording Rock or Bust, and that his situation had taken the band by surprise. Rudd had also missed video and photo shoots, and with reference to Rudd's future in the band, Young added, \\"So, at this stage, it's a pretty tough call for us.\\"[109] He also said the band would continue: \\"He's got to sort himself out I think?... At this point it's kind of a question mark. But if we're touring, there will be a drummer in place, put it that way.\\"[110]\\r\\nAt the charity signing before the Grammy awards, the band was photographed together with former drummer Chris Slade. It was later confirmed that he had rejoined the band for the Grammys and upcoming tour.[111] In April 2015, Rudd pleaded guilty to drug charges and threatening to kill a former assistant.[112] Shortly thereafter, the band's web site removed Rudd as the band's drummer and replaced him with Slade.[113] On 9 July 2015 Rudd was denied a discharge without conviction and sentenced to eight months' home detention.[114]\\r\\nOn 7 March 2016, the band announced that the final ten dates of the Rock or Bust World Tour would be rescheduled as Johnson's doctors had ordered him to stop touring immediately, as his hearing loss had accelerated and he risked complete deafness if he persisted on the road. The ten cancelled dates would be performed \\"likely with a guest vocalist\\" later in the year, leaving Johnson's future in touring with the group uncertain.[115] Johnson himself later stated on The Howard Stern Show that his hearing loss didn't come from having performed for 36 years with AC/DC, but rather his love of auto racing and having forgotten to put ear plugs in during one race left him with a ruptured ear drum in his left ear.[116]\\r\\nHowever, on 15 March 2016, American comedian Jim Breuer (a friend of Johnson) revealed on his podcast that Johnson had received a second opinion on his hearing and it was not as bad as initially thought. Nonetheless, Breuer mentioned that Johnson told him that he was essentially fired from AC/DC and that he hadn't heard from the band since the announcement of the tour being postponed, adding that Angus Young wants to continue the band for at least another ten years and do at least one more studio album and world tour.[117] Breuer later clarified his comments on Facebook that did not end speculation on Johnson's future with the band.[118]\\r\\nOn 19 April 2016, Johnson made an official statement regarding his health problems and inability to tour. In the statement, he acknowledged his ongoing hearing difficulties but stated his intentions to continue recording and potentially resume touring if his health improves sufficiently. He also specifically thanked Angus Young and Cliff Williams for their support during his AC/DC tenure.[119]\\r\\nOn 16 April 2016, AC/DC released a statement announcing the addition of Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose as the band's lead vocalist for the remainder of their 2016 tour dates. The statement reads: \\"AC/DC band members would like to thank Brian Johnson for his contributions and dedication to the band throughout the years. We wish him all the best with his hearing issues and future ventures. As much as we want this tour to end as it started, we understand, respect and support Brian's decision to stop touring and save his hearing. We are dedicated to fulfilling the remainder of our touring commitments to everyone that has supported us over the years, and are fortunate that Axl Rose has kindly offered his support to help us fulfill this commitment. AC/DC will resume their Rock or Bust World Tour with Axl Rose joining on vocals.\\"[120][121]\\r\\nOn 8 July 2016, Cliff Williams indicated he was retiring from the band in an interview with Gulfshore Life, saying \\"It's been what Ive known for the past 40 years, but after this tour Im backing off of touring and recording. Losing Malcolm, the thing with Phil and now with Brian, its a changed animal. I feel in my gut its the right thing.\\"[122] At the end of the Rock or Bust Tour he released a video statement confirming his retirement.[123]\\r\\nFollowing the band's final show with Williams on 21 September 2016 in Philadelphia, PA it was announced that Axl Rose would be joining the band full-time and that he and Angus would continue AC/DC with different musicians.[124][125]\\r\\nAC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 10 March 2003.[126] During the ceremony the band performed \\"Highway to Hell\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", with guest vocals provided by host Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. He described the band's power chords as \\"the thunder from down under that gives you the second most powerful surge that can flow through your body.\\"[127] During the acceptance speech, Brian Johnson quoted their 1977 song \\"Let There Be Rock\\".[128]\\r\\nOn 22 March 2000, the municipality of Legans (near Madrid) named a street in honour of the band as \\"Calle de AC/DC\\" (\\"AC/DC Street\\"). Malcolm and Angus attended the inauguration with many fans. Later that day, the plaque with the name of the group was stolen, perhaps by an enthusiast or collector. The plaque was replaced two hours later, and stolen once again a mere three days after the fact. The plaque had since been stolen numerous times, forcing the municipality of Legans to begin selling replicas of the official street plaque.\\r\\nIn May 2003, the Young brothers accepted a Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Service to Australian Music at the 2003 Music Winners Awards, during which Malcolm paid special tribute to Bon Scott, who was also a recipient of the award.[129]\\r\\nOn 1 October 2004, a central Melbourne thoroughfare, Corporation Lane, was renamed ACDC Lane in honour of the band. The City of Melbourne forbade the use of the slash character in street names, so the four letters were combined.[130] The lane is near Swanston Street where, on the back of a truck, the band recorded their video for the 1975 hit \\"It's a Long Way to the Top\\".[32]\\r\\nThey sold over 1.3?million CDs in the US during 2007 despite not having released a new album since 2000 at that point. Additionally, the group's commercial success continues to flourish despite their choice to refrain from selling albums in digital online formats for many years.[131] However, in November 2012, the entire catalogue (excluding the TNT album and the Australian versions of the High Voltage, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap and Let There Be Rock albums) became available on the iTunes Store.[132]\\r\\nIn 2009 the Recording Industry Association of America upgraded the group's US sales figures from 69?million to 71?million, making AC/DC the fifth-best-selling band in US history and the tenth-best-selling artist, selling more albums than Madonna and Mariah Carey.[10] The RIAA also certified Back in Black as double Diamond (20?million) in US sales, and by 2007 the album had sold 22?million copies, which made it the fifth-best-selling album of all-time in the US.[13] It is currently the second-best-selling album worldwide.\\r\\nNote: Before their debut album, High Voltage (1975), AC/DC had several line up changes.

He died at the Qala-i-Jangi fortress in a Taliban prisoner uprising.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohnny Micheal Spann was from the small town of Winfield, Alabama, the son of a real estate agent and his wife. Spann graduated in 1987 from Winfield City High School, where he played football. At 17, he earned his private pilot license and later became a certified rescue diver and parachutist.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1991, while attending Auburn University, he joined the Marine Corps Reserve. After graduating from Auburn with a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice/Law Enforcement in 1992, Spann attended the Marines' Officer Candidates School at Quantico, Virginia. He had originally wanted to go into aviation, but became a field artillery officer and eventually served with the elite 2nd Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company.[1] He specialized in directing indirect fire and close air support. In 1997, he served as second-in-command for UNITAS, a joint exercise expedition in Latin America and Africa.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe served six years with the United States Marine Corps, including tours in Okinawa, Japan and Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, eventually achieving the rank of Captain. Spann joined the CIA in June 1999 and went on to serve in the Special Operations Group of the CIA's Special Activities Division.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpann was killed during a riot at the Qala-i-Jangi compound near Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan according to CNN reporter Robert Young Pelton.[3]\\r\\nEarlier that day, he and David Tyson, another SAD officer, questioned John Walker Lindh, an American citizen, and other prisoners.\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficials recovered his body after Afghan Northern Alliance troops, backed by U.S. air strikes, US Army Special Forces and British Special Boat Service members, quelled the uprising.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome sources say that he fought with his AK-47 until it ran out of ammunition, then drew his pistol until it, too, emptied, then resorted to hand-to-hand combat before finally being overcome.[4] In a news report by Time published shortly after the events reports, it is stated that Spann fought only with his pistol, killing three attackers before being overwhelmed by the more numerous prisoners. His colleague, Dave \\"Dawson\\" Tyson, an Uzbek-language specialist, opened fire with the AK-47 before running away.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime reported shortly after the events:\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to members of a German television crew who were later trapped in the fort with Dave, Spann asked the prisoners who they were and why they joined the Taliban. They massed around him. 'Why are you here?' Spann asked one. 'To kill you,' came the reply as the man lunged at Spann's neck. Spann drew his pistol and shot the man dead. Dave shot another, then grabbed an AK-47 from an Alliance guard and opened fire. According to eyewitness accounts given to the German team, the Taliban fighters launched themselves at Spann, scrabbling at his flesh with their hands, kicking and beating him. Spann killed seven more with his pistol before he disappeared under the crush.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpann is memorialized with a star on the CIA Memorial Wall at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia that commemorates individuals who died in the line of duty. Spann was posthumously awarded the Intelligence Star and the Exceptional Service Medallion.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the Intelligence Star is considered the equivalent of the U.S. military's Silver Star, Spann was approved for burial in Arlington National Cemetery.[7] Spann is buried in section 34 at Arlington National Cemetery.\\r\\n\\r\\nA small memorial to Mike Spann exists at Qala-i-Jangi.

The vast news resources available in recent decades have increased competition for audience and advertiser attention, prompting media providers to deliver the latest news in the most compelling manner in order to remain ahead of competitors. Television, radio, print, online, and apps for news all have many suppliers who want to be relevant to their audiences and deliver news first.\\r\\nAlthough all-news radio operated for decades earlier, the 24-hour news cycle arrived with the advent of cable television channels dedicated to news[1] and brought about a much faster pace of news production with an increased demand for stories that can be presented as continual news with constant updating. This was a contrast with the day-by-day pace of the news cycle of printed daily newspapers.[2] A high premium on faster reporting would see a further increase with the advent of online news.[3]\\r\\nA complete news cycle consists of the media reporting on some event, followed by the media reporting on public and other reactions to the earlier reports.

The novel and its sequel, The Silence of the Lambs, feature Lecter as one of the primary antagonists after the two serial killers in both novels. In the third novel, Hannibal, Lecter becomes a protagonist. His role as the antihero occurs in the fourth novel, Hannibal Rising, which explores his childhood and development into a serial killer.\\r\\nThe first film adapted from the Harris novels was Manhunter (based on Red Dragon) which features Brian Cox as Lecter, spelled \\"Lecktor\\". In 1991, Anthony Hopkins won an Academy Award for his portrayal of the character in The Silence of the Lambs. He would reprise the role in Hannibal in 2001 and in a second adaptation of Red Dragon made in 2002 under the original title.\\r\\nThe NBC television series Hannibal debuted in 2013, and focuses on the development of the relationship between Lecter and Will Graham, an FBI profiler. In the series, Lecter is portrayed by Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen, who won a Saturn Award for his performance.\\r\\nIn 2003, Hannibal Lecter (as portrayed by Hopkins) was chosen by the American Film Institute as the #1 movie villain.[1] In June 2010, Entertainment Weekly named him one of the 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRed Dragon firmly states that Lecter does not fit any known psychological profile. In The Silence of the Lambs, Lecter's keeper, Dr. Frederick Chilton, claims that Lecter is a \\"pure sociopath\\" (\\"pure psychopath\\" in the film adaptation). In the novel Red Dragon, protagonist Will Graham says that Lecter has no conscience and tortured animals as a child, but does not exhibit any other of the criteria traditionally associated with psychopathy; Graham explains that psychiatrists refer to Lecter as a sociopath because \\"they don't know what else to call him\\". In the film adaptation of The Silence of the Lambs, protagonist Clarice Starling says of Lecter, \\"They don't have a name for what he is.\\" In the novel The Silence of the Lambs, Barney Matthews, an orderly at the facility where Lecter is imprisoned, claims that the only thing Lecter fears is boredom.\\r\\nLecter's pathology is explored in greater detail in Hannibal and Hannibal Rising, which explains that he was traumatized as a child in Lithuania in 1944 when he witnessed the murder and cannibalism of his beloved sister, Mischa, by a group of deserting Lithuanian Hilfswillige, one of whom claimed that Lecter unwillingly ate his sister as well.\\r\\nAll media in which Lecter appears portray him as intellectually brilliant, cultured and sophisticated, with refined tastes in art, music and cuisine. He is frequently depicted preparing gourmet meals from his victims' flesh, the most famous example being his admission that he once ate a census taker's liver \\"with some fava beans and a nice Chianti\\" (a \\"big Amarone\\" in the novel). He is well-educated in Anatomy, Chemistry and Physics and also speaks several languages, including Italian, German, Russian, Polish, French, Spanish, and, to some extent, Japanese.[3] He is deeply offended by rudeness, and frequently kills people who have bad manners. Prior to his capture and imprisonment, he was a member of Baltimore, Maryland's social elite, and a sitting member of the Baltimore Philharmonic Orchestra's board of directors.\\r\\nIn The Silence of the Lambs, Lecter is described through Starling's eyes: \\"small, sleek, and in his hands and arms she saw wiry strength like her own\\". The novel also reveals that Lecter's left hand has a condition called mid ray duplication polydactyly, i.e. a duplicated middle finger.[4] In Hannibal, he performs plastic surgery on his own face on several occasions, and removes his extra digit. Lecter's eyes are a shade of maroon, and reflect the light in \\"pinpoints of red\\".[5] He has small white teeth[6] and dark, slicked-back hair with a widow's peak. He also has a keen sense of smell; in The Silence of the Lambs, he is able to identify through a plexiglass window with small holes the brand of perfume that Starling wore the day before. At one point, when Hannibal points out Clarice must have gotten a bruise lately, she suddenly remembers she has a band-aid on her covered leg, so she assumes he must have smelled it. He has an eidetic memory with which he has constructed in his mind an elaborate \\"memory palace\\" with which he relives memories and sensations in rich detail.\\r\\nIn the backstory of 1981's Red Dragon, FBI profiler Will Graham interviews Lecter about one of his patients who was murdered by a serial killer, before intuiting that Lecter is the culprit. Realizing that Graham is on to him, Lecter creeps up behind Will and slashes him with a linoleum knife, nearly disemboweling him. Graham survives, but is so traumatized by the incident that he takes early retirement from the FBI. Lecter is charged with a series of nine murders, but is found not guilty by reason of insanity. He is institutionalized in the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane under the care of Dr. Frederick Chilton, a pompous, incompetent psychologist whom he despises. Some years later, Graham comes out of retirement and consults Lecter in order to catch another serial killer, Francis Dolarhyde, known by the nickname \\"The Tooth Fairy\\". Through the classifieds of a tabloid called The National Tattler, Lecter provides Dolarhyde with Graham's home address, enabling Dolarhyde to disfigure Graham and attempt to kill his family. At the end of the novel, Lecter sends Graham a taunting note saying that he hopes Graham isn't \\"too ugly\\".\\r\\nIn the 1988 sequel The Silence of the Lambs, Lecter assists FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling in catching a serial killer known as \\"Buffalo Bill\\". Lecter is fascinated by Starling, and they form an unusual relationship in which he provides her with a profile of the killer and his modus operandi in exchange for details about her unhappy childhood. Lecter had previously met Buffalo Bill, the former lover of his patient (and eventual victim) Benjamin Raspail. He does not reveal this information directly, instead giving Starling vague clues to help her figure it out for herself. In return for Lecter's assistance, the FBI and Chilton arrange for him to be transferred to a lower security facility. He escapes while in transit, however, killing and mutilating his guards and using one of their faces as a mask to fool paramedics. While in hiding, he writes a letter to Starling wishing her well, and another to Chilton swearing gruesome revenge: Chilton disappears soon afterward.\\r\\nIn the third novel, 1999's Hannibal, Lecter lives in a palazzo in Florence, Italy, and works as a museum curator under the alias \\"Dr. Fell\\". The novel reveals that one of Lecter's victims survived: Mason Verger, a wealthy, sadistic pedophile whom Lecter had drugged, paralyzed and persuaded to mutilate his own face during a therapy session. Verger offers a huge reward for anyone who apprehends Lecter, whom he intends to feed to feral pigs specially bred for the purpose. Verger enlists the help of Rinaldo Pazzi, a disgraced Italian police inspector, and Paul Krendler, a corrupt Justice Department official and Starling's boss. Lecter kills Pazzi and returns to the United States to escape Verger's Sardinian henchmen, only to be captured. Starling follows them, intent on apprehending Lecter personally, but is instead also taken captive. After regaining control of the situation (if he ever truly lost it in the first place), he then rescues the wounded Starling and takes her to his rented lake house to treat her. One evening, he invites her to a formal dinner where Krendler is the guest and first course. Here, Hannibal and Clarice's relationship comes into a brighter light. A bond is seen, perhaps even on the cusp of being Lovers. At the very least, a deep connection and understanding exists between the two though each is facing each other on the opposite side of the spectrum.\\r\\nHarris wrote a 2006 prequel, Hannibal Rising, after film producer Dino De Laurentiis (who owned the cinematic rights to the Lecter character) announced that he was going to make a film depicting Lecter's childhood and development into a serial killer with or without Harris' help. Harris would also write the film's screenplay. The novel chronicles Lecter's early life, from birth into an aristocratic family in Lithuania in 1933, to being orphaned, along with his beloved sister Mischa, in 1944 when a German Stuka bomber attacks a Soviet tank in front of their forest hideaway. Shortly thereafter, he and Mischa are captured by a band of Nazi collaborators, who murder and cannibalize Mischa before her brother's eyes; Lecter later learns that the collaborators also fed him Mischa's remains. Irreparably traumatized, Lecter escapes from the deserters and wanders through the forest, no longer interested in speaking. He is found and taken in by an orphanage (his former family home now converted), where he is bullied by the other children and abused by the dean. He is adopted by his uncle Robert and his Japanese wife, Lady Murasaki, who nurses him back to health and teaches him to speak again. After his uncle's death, Lecter forms a close, pseudo-romantic relationship with his step-aunt. During this time he also shows great intellectual aptitude, entering medical school at a young age and excelling immensely. Despite his seemingly comfortable life, Lecter is consumed by a savage obsession with avenging Mischa's death. He kills for the first time as a teenager, beheading a racist fishmonger who insulted Murasaki. He then methodically tracks down, tortures, and murders each of the men who had killed his sister. His style of killing is influenced heavily by Lady Murasaki's ancestors. In the process of taking his revenge, he forsakes his relationship with Murasaki and seemingly loses all traces of his humanity. The novel ends with Lecter being accepted to the Johns Hopkins Hospital.\\r\\nRed Dragon was first adapted to film in 1986 as the Michael Mann film Manhunter, although the spelling of Lecter's name was changed to \\"Lecktor\\". He was played by actor Brian Cox.[7] Cox based his performance on Scottish serial killer Peter Manuel.[8]\\r\\nIn 1991, Orion Pictures produced a Jonathan Demme-directed adaptation of The Silence of the Lambs, in which Lecter was played by actor Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins' Academy Awardÿwinning performance made Lecter into a cultural icon. In 2001, Hannibal was adapted to film, with Hopkins reprising his role. In the film adaptation, the ending is revised: Starling attempts to apprehend Lecter, who escapes after cutting off his own hand to free himself from her handcuffs. In 2002, Red Dragon was adapted again, this time under its original title, with Hopkins again as Lecter and Edward Norton as Will Graham. Hopkins wrote a screenplay for a Hannibal sequel, ending with Starling killing Lecter, but it was never produced.[9]\\r\\nIn late 2006, the novel Hannibal Rising was adapted into the film of the same name, which portrayed Lecter's development into a serial killer. In the film, which was finished by 2007, eight-year-old Lecter is portrayed by Aaran Thomas, while Gaspard Ulliel portrays him as a young man. Both the novel and film received generally negative critical reviews.[10]\\r\\nIn February 2012, NBC gave a series order to Hannibal, a television adaptation of Red Dragon to be written and executive-produced by Bryan Fuller.[11] Mads Mikkelsen plays Lecter,[12] opposite Hugh Dancy as Will Graham.[13]\\r\\nFuller commented on Mikkelsen's version of Lecter: \\"What I love about Mads' approach to the character is that, in our first meeting, he was adamant that he didn't want to do Hopkins or Cox. He talked about the character not so much as 'Hannibal Lecter the cannibal psychiatrist', but as Satan ÿ this fallen angel who's enamoured with mankind and had an affinity for who we are as people, but was definitely not among us ÿ he was other. I thought that was a really cool, interesting approach, because I love science fiction and horror and ÿ not that we'd ever do anything deliberately to suggest this ÿ but having it subtextually play as him being Lucifer felt like a really interesting kink to the series. It was slightly different than anything that's been done before and it also gives it a slightly more epic quality if you watch the show through the prism of, 'This is Satan at work, tempting someone with the apple of their psyche'. It appealed to all of those genre things that get me excited about any sort of entertainment.\\"[14]\\r\\nThe first season amends the series' continuity so that Graham and Lecter first work together during the hunt for Garrett Jacob Hobbs (Vladimir Jon Cubrt), the \\"Minnesota Shrike\\", a serial killer who preys on college girls. During the investigation, Lecter secretly calls Hobbs to tip him off that Graham is on to him. As a result, Hobbs turns on his own family, killing his wife and trying to kill his daughter Abigail (Kacey Rohl) as Graham charges in and shoots him dead.[15] Killing Hobbs weighs on Graham's conscience and gives him nightmares, so his boss Jack Crawford (Laurence Fishburne) sends him to Lecter for counseling.[16] Throughout the first season, Lecter acts as Graham's unofficial psychiatrist, and they form a tenuous friendship. Lecter and Graham also become father figures to Abigail, and cover for her when they discover that she was her father's accomplice. Lecter is fascinated by Graham's ability to empathize with psychopaths, and he spends much of the series trying to undermine Graham's fragile sanity and push him into becoming a killer. To this end, Lecter prevents Graham from learning that he has advanced encephalitis, just to see how Graham would function under the circumstances.[17] In the first-season finale, Lecter reluctantly frames Graham for a series of murders that he himself committed throughout the season ÿ including, apparently, Abigail's ÿ but not before Graham realizes that Lecter is the Chesapeake Ripper, the very serial killer he has been trying to catch.[18]\\r\\nThroughout the beginning of the second season, Graham, who is now institutionalized, attempts to convince his skeptical former colleagues that Lecter is the real killer and begins pulling strings from within his cell in order to expose him. Meanwhile, Lecter begins to manipulate evidence from the outside, exonerating himself after the FBI's initial investigations into Graham's claims. Eventually, Graham persuades his friend and colleague Beverly Katz (Hetienne Park), a forensic scientist, to investigate Lecter in exchange for help on a case. She breaks into Lecter's house, where she find evidence of his guilt; Lecter catches her, however, and kills her. Angry and vengeful, Graham convinces a deranged hospital orderly (Jonathan Tucker) to try to kill Lecter, but the attempt fails.[19] Lecter retaliates by taking as his lover Alana Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas), a psychologist for whom Graham has romantic feelings.[19] Lecter then exonerates Graham by planting forensic evidence of Graham's alleged victims at the scene of one of his own murders, resulting in Graham's release. He also frames his colleague Frederick Chilton (Raul Esparza) by planting a mutilated corpse in his house and \\"influencing\\" his surviving victim Miriam Lass (Anna Chlumsky), into believing that Chilton had abducted and tortured her.[19]\\r\\nGraham resumes therapy with Lecter as an attempt to entrap him. Lecter quickly becomes aware of the ruse, but finds the experience fascinating and allows it to continue in order to explore the connection he feels with Graham. In an attempt to push Graham into becoming a serial killer, Lecter sends his psychotic former patient Randall Tier (Mark O'Brien) to kill Graham, but Graham kills and mutilates Tier instead ÿ just as Lecter hoped he would.[20] Later, Graham attacks tabloid reporter Fredericka \\"Freddy\\" Lounds (Lara Jean Chorostecki), who is investigating him and Lecter. Graham shares a meal with Lecter of what is implied to be her flesh, but it is soon revealed that Lounds is still alive and conspiring with Graham and Crawford to draw Lecter into their trap.[21]\\r\\nLecter and Graham acquire a common enemy in Mason Verger (Michael Pitt), a wealthy sadist whom they both despise for emotionally and sexually abusing his sister Margot (Katharine Isabelle). Verger has them both kidnapped and prepares to feed them to his prize pigs; however, Lecter escapes and takes Verger hostage in Graham's house. He gives Verger a hallucinogenic drug cocktail, and tells him to cut off pieces of his own face and feed them to Graham's dogs. With Graham's tacit approval, Lecter then breaks Verger's neck with his bare hands, paralyzing him.[22]\\r\\nIn the second-season finale, Graham and Crawford move to arrest Lecter against the orders of the FBI. In the ensuing struggle, Lecter seriously wounds Graham and Crawford, while a very much alive Abigail Hobbs pushes Bloom out of a window. Lecter then cuts Abigail's throat in front of Graham and leaves them to die as he flees before the police arrive. He is shown in a post-credits scene aboard a flight to France with his psychiatrist, Bedelia Du Maurier (Gillian Anderson).[23]\\r\\nThe third season amends the series' continuity to incorporate events from the novel Hannibal. It also changes Lecter's origin story: in this continuity, Lecter's sister Mischa was murdered, cannibalized, and fed to him by a peasant in his native Lithuania, who would eventually become his prisoner.[24] Certain episodes also suggest that, in his youth, Lecter was the unidentified serial killer known as \\"The Monster of Florence\\".[25]\\r\\nMonths after his escape, Lecter is living in Florence with Du Maurier, working as a museum curator under the alias \\"Dr. Fell\\" ÿ having murdered the original curator and stolen his identity.[26] Disgraced Italian detective Rinaldo Pazzi (Fortunato Cerlino) tries to apprehend him to collect a bounty placed by Mason Verger (Joe Anderson), who is also consulting with Bloom to capture Lecter. Lecter kills Pazzi and tries to flee the country, but is accosted by Crawford, who engages him in brutal hand-to-hand combat.[27]\\r\\nLecter manages to escape from Crawford and meet up with Graham. When Graham pulls a knife, Lecter's family servant Chiyoh (Tao Okamoto), who had helped him find Lecter, shoots, and wounds Graham. Lecter takes Graham back to his villa and tries to perform a craniotomy on him in front of Crawford, but is interrupted by Italian detectives on Verger's payroll, who deliver them both to Verger's estate in Maryland.[28] Verger's physician Cordell Doemling (Glenn Fleshler) tells Lecter that he will mutilate him until he dies, and prepare gourmet cuisine from his flesh for Verger to eat. Bloom frees Lecter, who suggests that Margot kill her brother, promising to take the blame. Lecter then kills Doemling, who is about to surgically remove Graham's face and graft it onto Verger's, and later instructs Margot and Bloom on how to milk the unconscious Verger's prostate to give Margot the sperm she needs to conceive a child and thus inherit the Verger family fortune. After Margot kills her brother, Lecter goes to Graham's house with a wounded and unconscious Graham in tow. When Graham wakes up, he allows Lecter to escape, but later that evening Lecter surrenders to Crawford, who takes him into custody.[29]\\r\\nLecter is found insane at his trial, and incarcerated in the Baltimore Hospital for the Criminally Insane, under Chilton and Bloom's care. Three years later, Graham visits him at the hospital and asks for help profiling a serial killer dubbed \\"The Tooth Fairy\\", who murders entire families.[30] Lecter helps Graham recover his gift for empathizing with psychopaths, and also begins communicating with the killer, Francis Dolarhyde (Richard Armitage). He gives Dolarhyde Graham's address, and Dolarhyde attacks and wounds Graham's wife, Molly (Nina Arianda). Bloom and Crawford threaten to take away Lecter's hospital privileges unless he lets them listen in on his conversations with Dolarhyde. Lecter complies, but then suddenly tells Dolarhyde they are listening. Bloom punishes him by taking away his books and toilet, and confining him in a straitjacket and muzzle.[31] After Dolarhyde burns and disfigures Chilton, he sends Lecter Chilton's severed lips, one of which Lecter eats.[32]\\r\\nIn the series finale, \\"The Wrath of the Lamb\\", Lecter and Graham develop a plan to catch Dolarhyde, using Lecter as bait. Lecter goes with Graham on a police convoy, pretending to be transferred to another facility in order to draw the killer out. Dolarhyde attacks the convoy, killing the guards but letting Lecter and Graham live. Lecter then takes Graham to a secluded clifftop cottage where he previously brainwashed Abigail Hobbs and Miriam Lass. Dolarhyde tracks them down and attacks them, shooting Lecter in the back and stabbing Graham in the face. Though they are both badly wounded, Lecter and Graham manage to get the better of Dolarhyde and kill him together: Graham slices open Dolarhyde's chest, while Lecter tears out his throat with his teeth. Lecter and Graham then embrace, before Graham pushes them both off a cliff. Their ultimate fate is left ambiguous; a post-credits scene shows Du Maurier dining on her own leg at a table set for three, which series creator Bryan Fuller has said is meant to suggest that Lecter and Graham survived and that Graham has joined Lecter. Fuller has stated that Season 4 would have covered Lecter and Graham on the run from the FBI in Argentina, mirroring Lecter and Starling's storyline from the novels.[33][34]\\r\\nThe emotional relationship between Will and Hannibal forms the foundation of the series. In season 3, their developing romance has been taken from subtext into text,[32] and to the question of whether it was a part of the initial plan, Bryan Fuller stated: \\"No, it naturally evolved because I guess I was absorbing so much of Mads and Hugh's performance, which felt like it was growing in intimacy, and it would have been inauthentic not to address it. Because all of these characters, and particularly Bedelia, was able to call out what she had witnessed [between Hannibal and Will], it seemed like a natural conclusion. I remember when I turned in the rewrite pages where Will asks Bedelia if Hannibal is in love with him, I got a note from Don Mancini, one of our writers who was always pushing for more homosexual text ÿ not just context or subtext but text, text, text ÿ and he was like, \\"I'm so glad you put that in there! They said it! They said it!\\" [35] Discussing what motivated him to verbally acknowledge the romance between Will and Hannibal, Fuller mentioned: \\"It felt like we had to sÿt or get off the pot, ultimately, because there had been so much going on between these two men that when Will asks, \\"Is Hannibal Lecter in love with me?\\" it is very much about death and the romance between these two men. There is a quality to connections that go above and beyond sexuality. You can have this intimate connection with somebody that then causes you to wonder where the lines of your own sexuality are. And we didn't quite broach the sexuality. It was certainly suggested, but the love is absolutely on the table.\\" [36] Remembering how the song for the finale of the series - \\"Love Crime\\" by Siouxsie Sioux - was created, Fuller said: \\"It was interesting. She [Siouxsie Sioux] was like, \\"I want to write this song, and what are the things I should really be thinking about?\\" And I was like, 'this is a love story. A love story between a full-fledged psychopath and someone who has nascent psychopathic abilities.' Actually, Hannibal Lecter is not a psychopath; he's something else entirely. But it's a love relationship between two men: one of them is a cannibal, and one of them understands those cannibalistic instincts all too well.\\" [37]\\r\\nHannibal Lecter is parodied in the 2005 musical, SILENCE! The Musical, with the character being originated by actor Brent Barrett.\\r\\nHannibal Lecter is portrayed by EpicLLOYD in the popular Epic Rap Battles of History series on YouTube in Season 4, which aired on December 1, 2014. He rap battles against another infamous serial killer, Jack the Ripper, the latter portrayed by YouTube user Dan Bull.\\r\\nThomas Harris has given few interviews, and did not explain where he got inspiration for Hannibal Lecter until mid-2013. Harris revealed that the character was inspired by a real-life doctor and murderer he met while visiting a prison in the city of Monterrey during a trip to Mexico in the 1960s when he was a 23-year-old reporter.[38] The doctor was serving a life sentence for murdering a young man, supposedly a \\"close friend\\", mutilating his body into several body parts and putting them in a very small box. Harris, who would only refer to the surgeon by the fake name \\"Dr. Salazar\\", described him as a \\"small lithe pale man with dark red hair\\". He added: \\"There was certain intelligence and elegance about him.\\"[39] Harris had gone to Mexico to interview Dykes Askew Simmons, a US citizen on death row for murdering three young people in the country, but he ended up also speaking to \\"Salazar\\", who saved Simmons' life after a guard shot him during an escape bid. \\"Salazar\\" revealed his dark side as he began discussing Simmons' disfigured face, tormented upbringing and how attractive his victims had been.\\r\\nSeveral reporters and investigators have traced the records and whereabouts of the Mexican prison doctor in later years and discovered that \\"Salazar\\" was in reality Alfredo Ball Trevi?o, a physician from an upper-class Monterrey family who was found guilty of murdering a close friend (and lover) and mutilating his body; he was also suspected of killing and dismembering several hitchhikers in the city outskirts during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Harris also incorporated some of these details into Buffalo Bill's development as a killer in Silence of the Lambs. Ball was initially condemned to death, but his sentence was later commuted to 20 years and he was released in 1981. After his release, Ball continued working as a physician in an austere office until his death by natural causes in 2009.[40][41][42]\\r\\nIn her book Evil Serial Killers, Charlotte Greig asserts that the serial killer Albert Fish was the inspiration, at least in part, for Lecter.[43] Greig also states that to explain Lecter's pathology, Harris borrowed the story of serial killer and cannibal Andrei Chikatilo's brother Stepan being kidnapped and eaten by starving neighbors (though she states that it is unclear whether the story was true or whether Stepan Chikatilo even existed).[44] The location of the book Hannibal was inspired by The Monster of Florence. While preparing the book, Harris traveled to Italy and was present at the trial of the main suspect, Pietro Pacciani, where he was seen taking notes.[45]","input":"Who was the character hannibal lecter based on?"},{"output":"Scottish","context":"Elizabeth Woolridge Grant (born June 21, 1985),[1] known professionally as Lana Del Rey, is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and model. Her music has been noted by critics for its stylized cinematic quality, its preoccupation with themes of tragic romance, glamour, and melancholia, and its references to pop culture, particularly 1950s and 1960s Americana.[2][3]\\r\\nRaised in northern New York state, Del Rey embarked on a music career in 2005 after moving to New York City, and first received widespread attention in 2011, when the music video for her single \\"Video Games\\" became a viral Internet sensation.[4] Del Rey received further recognition after her major-label debut Born to Die peaked at number two on the United States charts and was the fifth best-selling album of 2012. A remix of its single \\"Summertime Sadness\\", produced by Cedric Gervais, peaked at number six in the United States, and her extended play Paradise followed that November, garnering Del Rey her first Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album. Three of the EP's tracks were featured in her short film Tropico (2013).[5]\\r\\nIn 2014, Del Rey released her third studio album, Ultraviolence, which became her first album to reach number one in the United States. In 2015, following a North American tour with Courtney Love and Grimes, Del Rey released her fourth studio album, Honeymoon. Both albums received positive critical response. Her fifth studio album, Lust for Life, was released in 2017. It received critical acclaim, and also became Del Rey's second album to reach number one in the United States, while also reaching the top ten in almost every other country in which it charted.[6] Lust for Life also earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth Woolridge Grant was born in New York City on June 21, 1985[1][8] to Robert England Grant, Jr., a Grey Group copywriter turned entrepreneur, and Patricia Ann \\"Pat\\" (ne Hill), a former Grey account executive turned high school teacher.[9][10][11][12] She has one younger sister, Caroline Grant,[13] and one brother, Charlie.[14][15] Her paternal grandfather, Robert England Grant, Sr. was a Kidder, Peabody & Co. investment banker, a vice president for Plough, Inc and Textron, and venture capitalist.[16] She has Scottish ancestry from both her mother and father.[17]\\r\\nDel Rey grew up in Lake Placid, New York,[18] and was raised Roman Catholic.[19] She attended a Catholic elementary school[15] and for one year, a high school where her mother taught.[20] She began singing in her church choir when she was a child, where she was the cantor.[15][21] At age fifteen,[8][20][22] she was sent to Kent School by her parents[22] to resolve a budding drinking problem.[23] Her uncle, an admissions officer at the boarding school, secured her financial aid to attend.[a]\\r\\nAfter graduating, Del Rey was accepted to the State University of New York at Geneseo, but she decided not to attend and instead spent a year living on Long Island with her aunt and uncle while working as a waitress.[9] During this time, Del Rey's uncle taught her how to play guitar, and she \\"realized [that she] could probably write a million songs with those six chords.\\"[27] Shortly after, she began writing songs and performing in nightclubs around the city under various names such as \\"Sparkle Jump Rope Queen\\" and \\"Lizzy Grant and the Phenomena.\\"[27] \\"I was always singing, but didn't plan on pursuing it seriously\\", Del Rey said. \\"When I got to New York City when I was eighteen, I started playing in clubs in BrooklynI have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that pointand that was it.\\"[8]\\r\\nThe following fall, at age nineteen, she enrolled at Fordham University where she majored in philosophy, with an emphasis on metaphysics.[8] Del Rey has said she chose to study the subject because it \\"bridged the gap between God and science... I was interested in God and how technology could bring us closer to finding out where we came from and why.\\"[8][17][28] According to Del Rey, she had trouble making friends in both boarding school and college.[29][30] She lived in The Bronx and later moved to New Jersey while attending Fordham.[31] After graduating in 2005, she moved to Brooklyn, where she resided for four years.[22]\\r\\nIn college, Del Rey did volunteer work at homeless youth and drug and alcohol outreach programs, as well as helping paint and rebuild houses on an Indian reservation in Utah.[15] She would cite this trip as integral in her decision to become a songwriter: \\"I remember exactly when I decided that I wanted to be a singer. I was in college, [and] we went to the Indian reservation. That day I realized that I had only two options: either making music or volunteering for a good cause. I chose the first option. If it [had] not [worked], I would [have] probably [done] social work in any small town.\\"[32]\\r\\nOn April 25, 2005, a seven-track extended play was registered under Elizabeth Woolridge Grant with the United States Copyright Office. The application title was Rock Me Stable with another title Young Like Me also listed.[33] A second extended play, titled From the End, was also recorded under Del Rey's stage name at the time, May Jailer.[34] Between 2005 and 2006, she recorded an acoustic album titled Sirens under the May Jailer project,[34] which later leaked on the internet in mid-2012.[b]\\r\\nAt her first performance in 2006 for the Williamsburg Live Songwriting Competition, Del Rey met Van Wilson, an A&R representative for 5?Points Records,[40][41] an independent label owned by David Nichtern.[41] In 2007, while a senior in college, Del Rey submitted a demo tape of acoustic tracks titled No Kung Fu to 5?Points Records,[34] who subsequently offered her a recording contract for $10,000.[34] Del Rey used the money to relocate to Manhattan Mobile Home Park, a trailer park in North Bergen, New Jersey,[8][22] and subsequently began working with producer David Kahne,[41] with whom she released a three-track EP titled Kill Kill in October 2008 as Lizzy Grant.[42] She explained that \\"David asked to work with me only a day after he got my demo. He is known as a producer with a lot of integrity and who had an interest in making music that wasn't just pop.\\"[43] Her album, however, was shelved, causing her to shift her focus. Instead, she began to work in community service. \\"Homeless outreach, drug, and alcohol rehabilitationthat's been my life for the past five years\\", she told Vogue UK in 2012.[8] Her debut full-length album, titled Lana Del Ray, was released in January 2010.[44] Her father, Robert Grant, helped with the marketing of the album,[44] which was available for purchase on iTunes for a brief period before being withdrawn.\\r\\nDavid Kahne, who produced Grant and previous label owner David Nichtern have both stated that Grant bought the rights back from her label, 5 Points, as she wanted it out of circulation to \\"stifle future opportunities to distribute itan echo of rumors that the action was part of a calculated strategy.[45][46]\\r\\nDel Rey met her current managers, Ben Mawson and Ed Millett, three months after Lana Del Ray and they helped her to get out of her contract with 5 Points Records, where, in her opinion, \\"nothing was happening.\\" Shortly after, she moved to London, England and moved in with Mawson \\"for a few years.\\"[15] When choosing her stage name, she said: \\"I wanted a name I could shape the music towards. I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba ÿ Lana Del Rey reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue.\\"[47] She has said her lawyers and managers made up the name Lana Del Rey and persuaded her to adopt the stage name.[48] On September 1, 2010, Del Rey was featured by Mando Diao in their MTV Unplugged concert at Union Film-Studios in Berlin.[49]\\r\\nAfter uploading them to her YouTube channel in 2011, Del Rey's videos for the songs \\"Video Games\\" and \\"Blue Jeans\\" became viral internet sensations,[2] and she was signed by Stranger Records to release \\"Video Games\\" as her debut single.[50] She told The Observer, \\"I just put that song online a few months ago because it was my favorite. To be honest, it wasn't going to be the single but people have really responded to it.\\"[8] The song earned her a Q award for \\"Next Big Thing\\" in October 2011[51] and an Ivor Novello for \\"Best Contemporary Song\\" in 2012.[52] The same month, she signed a joint deal with Interscope Records and Polydor to work on her second studio album Born to Die.[27][53][54][55]\\r\\nDel Rey built anticipation to the album by doing a number of live appearances, such as promotional concerts at the Bowery Ballroom and at the Chateau Marmont, and with performances at television shows such as De Wereld Draait Door, and Later... with Jools Holland.[56][57][58][59]\\r\\nDel Rey also performed two songs from the album on Saturday Night Live on January 14, 2012 and received a negative response from critics and the general public. Del Rey's performance was defended by the evening program's guest host, actor Daniel Radcliffe, despite not having seen her performance.[60] She had earlier defended her spot on the program, saying: \\"I'm a good musician [...] I have been singing for a long time, and I think that [SNL creator] Lorne Michaels knows that [...] it's not a fluke decision.\\"[61] The following week on SNL, Kristen Wiig impersonated Del Rey where she humorously defended herself during Weekend Update.[62]\\r\\nBorn to Die was officially released on January 31, 2012 worldwide, and reached number one in 11 countries, though critical reaction was divided.[63][64] The same week, she announced she had bought back the rights to her 2010 debut album, and had plans to re-release it in the summer of 2012 under Interscope Records and Polydor.[65] Contrary to Del Rey's press statement, her previous record label and producer David Kahne have both stated that she bought the rights to the album when she and the label parted company, due to the offer of a new deal, in April 2010.[53][66] Born to Die sold 3.4?million copies in 2012, making it the fifth-best-selling album of 2012.[67][68][69] In the United States, Born to Die charted on the Billboard 200 album chart well into 2012, lingering at number 76, after 36?weeks on the chart.[70] In an interview with RTVE on June 15, 2012, she announced her new album would be out in November.[71] Mid-September saw the official announcement of Paradise's lead single, \\"Ride\\".[72][73]\\r\\nOn September 19, 2012, the music video for \\"Blue Velvet\\" was released through H&M.[74] One day later, on September 20, \\"Blue Velvet\\" became available for purchase as a promotional single. \\"Ride\\" became available for purchase on September 25, 2012. The music video for \\"Ride\\" was premiered at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica, California on October 10, 2012.[75][76] Some critics panned the video as pro-prostitution[76][77] and antifeminist, the latter being a word attributed to Del Rey's work since \\"Video Games\\".[78][79]\\r\\nDel Rey's Paradise Edition of Born to Die was set to be released on November 12. With the release of her third EP, Paradise, Del Rey spawned her second top 10 album in the United States, debuting at number 10 on the Billboard 200 with 67,000 copies sold in its first week.[80]\\r\\nAt the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards, Del Rey received nominations in the categories Best Alternative, Best Push, and Best New Act. Winning Best Alternative, Del Rey presented the award for Best Female to Taylor Swift.[81] At the 2013 BRIT Awards, she won the award for International Female Solo Artist, making it her second BRIT Award to date.[82] Her win surprised critics who highly anticipated Taylor Swift to win the award.[82] In March 2013, she recited Walt Whitman's poem \\"Song of Myself\\" for the French fashion magazine, L'Officiel Paris.[83]\\r\\nDel Rey's seventh single, \\"Dark Paradise\\", was released as a single in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland on March 1, 2013. Del Rey won the ECHO Awards for Best International Newcomer and Best International Pop/Rock Artist on March 21, 2013.[84] A music video for Del Rey's cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Chelsea Hotel#2\\" was released on March 27, 2013.[85] The following month, in April 2013, another self-produced video was released; it showed Del Rey and her boyfriend, Barrie-James O'Neil, covering \\"Summer Wine\\", by Lee Hazlewood. \\"Burning Desire\\" became available for purchase as a stand-alone download on March 19, 2013 as the second promotional single from Paradise; its music video was premiered the previous month on Valentine's Day of 2013.[86]\\r\\nAfter the release of Paradise, Del Rey penned the original song \\"Young and Beautiful\\" for the soundtrack of the 2013 film adaptation of The Great Gatsby with director, co-writer, and co-producer Baz Luhrmann.[87]\\r\\nFollowing the song's release, it peaked at 22 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Del Rey's highest peak on the chart.[88] However, shortly after its release to contemporary hit radio, the label prematurely pulled it and decided to send a different song to that format; on July 2, 2013, a Cedric Gervais remix of Del Rey's \\"Summertime Sadness\\" was sent there; a sleeper hit, the song proved to be a success, surpassing \\"Young and Beautiful\\", reaching number 6 and becoming her first American top ten hit.[89] The remix won the Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical in 2013.[90]\\r\\nAlongside Paradise, Del Rey announced plans to launch a short film titled Tropico.[91][92] Tropico was filmed in late June 2013 and directed by Anthony Mandler.[92]\\r\\nOn November 22, 2013, an official trailer for Tropico was released; at the end of the trailer, it was announced that the film would be uploaded to Del Rey's official VEVO account on December 5, 2013.[93] The short film premiered on December 4 at Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. Before showing the film, Del Rey told the audience \\"I really just wanted us all to be together so I could try and visually close out my chapter before I release the new record, Ultraviolence\\".[94][95] Journalists identified the phrase from the Anthony Burgess' dystopian novel A Clockwork Orange (1962), but reports were conflicting as to whether or not the title was stylized as one or two words.[95][96] On December 6, 2013, an EP, also titled Tropico, was made available for purchase via iTunes; it includes the film itself along with the three aforementioned songs.[97][98]\\r\\nOn January 23, 2014, it was announced that Del Rey would be covering the song \\"Once Upon a Dream\\" (from the 1959 film Sleeping Beauty) for the 2014 dark fantasy film Maleficent.

Eight of the shows featured Courtney Love,[111] and ten of the shows featured Grimes. Also in December 2014, in an interview with Galore Magazine, Del Rey revealed she began working on a new album, which she said would be released sometime in 2015.[112] She told Grazia Magazine about how she wanted to introduce orchestrations with monumental choruses with a touch of subdued grunge for the album, \\"I played Mark Ronson ten songs that I have composed for this next album. It explores a sound close to the golden age of jazz\\", she said.[113] Earlier that month, Del Rey also mentioned to Galore Magazine that she is already at the recording stage for the album and that \\"[she's] also always writing small pieces for independent films etc. Dan Heath and Rick Nowels are two of my dearest friends and producers and we are always up to something.\\"[114] In January 2015, Del Rey stated in an interview with the LA Times that a song on her new record would be titled \\"Music to Watch Boys To\\".[115] The same month, a song she recorded for Emile Haynie's album titled Wait for Life was released.[116] She also recorded \\"Life is Beautiful\\", a song featured in the trailer for the movie The Age of Adaline.\\r\\nIn June 2014, she said \\"I have this idea for this record called Music to Watch Boys To, so I'm just kind of thinking about that and what that would mean.\\"[117] Del Rey later confirmed in an interview with Billboard that her new record would be entitled Honeymoon.[118]\\r\\nOn January 15, 2015, Del Rey received a BRIT Award nomination for International Female Solo Artist, her second nomination in the category and third overall.[119]\\r\\nOn July 14, 2015, Del Rey released \\"Honeymoon\\", the first and title track from the album.[120][121] She revealed that the album would contain fourteen tracks, describing the songs with \\"a muddy trap energy and some inspired by late-night Miles Davis drives\\".[122]\\r\\nOn August 4, 2015, Del Rey revealed the first single \\"High by the Beach\\", which was released on August 10, 2015.[123] On August 4, 2015, The Weeknd also revealed the track listing for his upcoming second studio album Beauty Behind the Madness which features a collaboration with Del Rey, entitled \\"Prisoner\\".[124] On August 21, 2015, she released \\"Terrence Loves You\\" as a promotional single, available instantly with the pre-order of the album.[125][126] The title track was later released as a promotional single on September 7, 2015.[127] Honeymoon was released on September 18, 2015[128] to general acclaim from music critics,[129] who praised the music and Del Rey's sophistication and vocal performance.\\r\\nIn November 2015, Del Rey executive produced a short film Hi How Are You Daniel Johnston, documenting the life of Daniel Johnston.

The track is entitled \\"Living with Myself\\".[157]\\r\\nDel Rey's musical sound has been dubbed \\"Hollywood sadcore\\" by music critics.[158][159] Her music has been repeatedly noted for its cinematic sound and its references to various aspects of pop culture, particularly that of 1950s and 1960s Americana.[c] Del Rey elaborated on this in an interview with Artistdirect, saying \\"I wasn't even born in the '50s but I feel like I was there.\\"[167]\\r\\nAssociated with several styles, Del Rey's music has been tagged broadly as dream pop[168][169] or baroque pop[170][171][172] linked to various forms of rock,[173][174] indie music,[175] and trip hop,[176][177][178][179] and often touching on styles such as hip hop,[180] trap music,[181] and psychedelic rock on particular releases.[182] Of Born to Die, indie music journal Drowned in Sound wrote, \\"She likes that whole hip hop thing though, has this whole swagger thing going that not many girls like her got\\", adding that it sounded like a poppier Bond soundtrack.[183]\\r\\nIn \\"National Anthem\\", \\"Off to the Races,\\"[183] and \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\", Del Rey employs this alternative rapping technique.[176]\\r\\nDel Rey's subsequent releases would introduce variant styles, particularly Ultraviolence, which employed a guitar-based sound akin to psychedelic and desert rock.[184] Kenneth Partridge of Billboard noted this shift in style, writing: \\"She sings about drugs, cars, money, and the bad boys she's always falling for, and while there remains a sepia-toned mid-century flavor to many of these songs, [Del Rey] is no longer fronting like a thugged-out Bette Davis.\\"[185] Upon the release of Honeymoon, one reviewer characterized Del Rey's body of work as being \\"about music as a time warp, with her languorous croons over molasses-like arrangements meant to make clock hands seem to move so slowly that it feels possible, at times, they might go backwards.\\"[186]\\r\\nDel Rey has been described as a \\"self-styled gangsta Nancy Sinatra\\" and \\"Lolita lost in the hood.\\"[187]\\r\\nPrior to coming to prominence under the stage name Lana Del Rey, she performed under the names Lizzy Grant, Lana Rey Del Mar,[188] Sparkle Jump Rope Queen,[189] and May Jailer.[190] Under the stage name Lizzy Grant, she referred to her music as \\"Hawaiian glam metal\\",[191] while the work of her May Jailer project was acoustic.[190][192][193]\\r\\nDel Rey cites a wide array of musical artists as influences, including numerous performers from the mid-twentieth century, including Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, Bobby Vinton, The Crystals, Miles Davis, The Shangri-Las, Janis Joplin, Axl Rose, The Eagles, Lou Reed, and Bruce Springsteen.[194] \\"[I really] just like the masters of every genre\\", she told BBC radio presenter Jo Whiley.[195] Her favorite artists include Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra, Jeff Buckley, Joan Baez and Leonard Cohen. She covered Cohen's \\"Chelsea Hotel #2\\" in 2013.[85] Janis Joplin's live version of \\"Summertime\\" from the Cheap Thrills album is one of Del Rey's favorite songs. Del Rey has also cited \\"Time of the Season\\" by The Zombies and \\"Hotel California\\" by The Eagles as favorites and inspirations.[196]\\r\\nHer favorite films, The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, and American Beauty have also inspired her musical style.[197] Inspired by poetry, Del Rey cites Walt Whitman and Allen Ginsberg as instrumental to her songwriting; specifically, she named Leaves of Grass by Whitman and \\"Howl\\" by Ginsberg. Her song, \\"Body Electric\\" from her third EP, Paradise, alludes to Whitman in the lyric, \\"Whitman is my daddy\\". The song's chorus of \\"I sing the body electric\\" is a direct reference to Whitman's poem \\"I Sing The Body Electric\\".[196][198] She recited Whitman's poem \\"Song of Myself\\" for the French fashion magazine, L'Officiel Paris.[83] Del Rey has also cited the surrealist film directors David Lynch and Federico Fellini and the surrealist painters Mark Ryden and Pablo Picasso as influences.[167][199] Lynch's film Blue Velvet (1986) inspired both the imagery and style of Del Rey's \\"Blue Velvet\\" cover.\\r\\nDel Rey possesses an expansive contralto vocal range, which spans three-plus octaves and has been described as captivating and highly emotive, ranging from high notes in a girlish timbre to jazzy ornaments in her lower gesture with great ease.[200][201][202][203] Following the release of Ultraviolence, which was recorded live in single takes and lacking Pro Tools vocal editing, critics fell into favor with Del Rey's vocal ability, praising her large range, increased vocal confidence, and uniquely emotive delivery.[204][205][206] When recording in the studio Del Rey is known for vocal multi-layering, which, as it has been noted, is difficult for her to replicate within a live setting, especially with the lack of backing singers to fill out the original vocal style.[200] Stage fright has also been noted as a major contribution to Del Rey's struggles with live performances.[207] However, journalists noted in 2014 that her live performances had increased exponentially in confidence. Billboard deemed the Coachella debut of \\"West Coast\\" to be a \\"star-making performance\\" and lauded the singer's vocal abilities.[208][209] Contemporary music critics have called her voice \\"smoky\\",[210] \\"gravelly\\",[191] and reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe.[191] Upon the 2015 release of Honeymoon, her voice was compared by Los Angeles Times critic Mikael Wood to those of Julee Cruise and Eartha Kitt.[211]\\r\\nDel Rey started the use of her lower vocals on the tracks from Born to Die, claiming that \\"people weren't taking me very seriously, so I lowered my voice, believing that it would help me stand out.

Because of the way I look, I needed something to ground the entire project. Otherwise I think people would assume I was some airhead singer. Well, I don't think... I know. I've sung one way, and sung another, and I've seen what people are drawn to\\", she said on the topic.[21]\\r\\nCritics have noted Del Rey for her typically simple, but authentic live performances.[215] A September 2017 concert review published in The New York Times noted: \\"For more than an hour, Ms. Del Rey was eerily casual, singing and smiling with the ease of someone performing at singer-songwriter night at the local coffee shop.\\"[215] Another review by Roy Train published in The Hollywood Reporter in 2014 noted \\"a distance in her bonhomie, obvious even from my perch at the opposite end of the stage high above the fray, the chill still palpable.\\"[216]\\r\\nIn 2010, Del Rey acted in a short film called Poolside, which she made with several friends on a reported budget of $400.[217]\\r\\nOn January 4, 2012, it was reported she had signed a deal with Next Model Management agency.[218] H&M confirmed that Del Rey would be modeling and recording a cover version of the popular 1950s prom anthem \\"Blue Velvet\\" for their 2012 Autumn Campaign.[219][220] H&M's 2012 Winter campaign, featuring Lana Del Rey, was released on October 12. This is the second H&M campaign Lana Del Rey is featured in.[221][222][223]\\r\\nOn August 22, 2012, executives announced that Del Rey would endorse their new Jaguar F-Type which was unveiled by Del Rey at the Paris Motor Show in September 2012. Adrian Hallmark, Jaguar's global brand director, explained their choice, saying Del Rey had \\"a unique blend of authenticity and modernity\\".[224][225]\\r\\nThe song \\"Burning Desire\\", which was initially available for immediate digital download upon pre-ordering Del Rey's third EP, Paradise, was later made available for purchase on Amazon.com and 7digital as a stand-alone download on March 19, 2013, one month after its music video hit YouTube. The song serves as the title track to a 13-minute promotional short film for the Jaguar F-Type, called Desire. The film, directed by Adam Smith, was produced by Ridley Scott and stars Damian Lewis.[226][227]\\r\\nPrior to the release of her debut major label album Born to Die in 2012, Del Rey was the subject of several articles discussing her image and career trajectory.[d] One article by Paul Harris published by The Guardian just a week before the album's release noted the differences between Del Rey's perceived persona in 2008, when she performed under the stage name Lizzy Grant, and in the present, as Lana Del Rey.[229] Harris wrote:\\r\\nThe internet has allowed figures like [Del Rey] to come rapidly to the fore of the cultural landscape, whether or not their emergence is planned by a record executive or happens spontaneously from someone's bedroom. It has speeded up the fame cycle. It is worth noting that the huge backlash to Del Rey is happening before her first album has even been released. This reveals a cultural obsession with the \\"authenticity\\" that fans, artists and corporations all prize above all else.[229]\\r\\nTony Simon, a producer who had worked with Del Rey in 2009, defended her against the public claims of inauthenticity and allegations that she was a product of her record label: \\"To be clear, all the detractors saying she's some made-up-by-the-machine pop star are full of shit. While it's impossible to keep the businesses' hands out the pop when creating a pop star, the roots of where this all comes from are firmly inside of Lizzy Grant.\\"[34]\\r\\nDel Rey would later respond to this in a 2017 interview, stating: \\"I didnt edit myself [on Born to Die] when I could have, because a lot of its just the way it was. I mean, because Ive changed a lot and a lot of those songs, its not that I dont relate but A lot of it too is I was just kinda nervous. I came off sort of nervously, and there was just a lot of dualities, a lot of juxtapositions going on that maybe just felt like something was a little off. Maybe the thing that was off was that I needed a little more time or something, and also my path was just so windy just to get to having a first record. I feel like I had to figure it out all by myself. Every move was just guesswork.\\"[231]\\r\\nHaving been labeled as antifeminist multiple times in the past,[76][78][79] Del Rey dismissed feminism in June 2014, telling The Fader: \\"For me, the issue of feminism is just not an interesting concept. I'm more interested in, you know, SpaceX and Tesla, what's going to happen with our intergalactic possibilities. Whenever people bring up feminism, I'm like, God. I'm just not really that interested.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\nShe also defended herself against the accusations of antifeminism, saying \\"For me, a true feminist is someone who is a woman who does exactly what she wants. If my choice is to, I don't know, be with a lot of men, or if I enjoy a really physical relationship, I don't think that's necessarily being anti-feminist. For me the argument of feminism never really should have come into the picture. Because I don't know too much about the history of feminism, and so I'm not really a relevant person to bring into the conversation. Everything I was writing was so autobiographical, it could really only be a personal analysis.\\"[232]\\r\\nIn February 2017, Del Rey implied she had plans to take part in a magic binding ritual against Donald Trump on or about February 24, March 26, April 24, May 23,[233] which she again confirmed in July 2017.[234][235]\\r\\nDel Rey stated that she suffered from alcoholism at a young age, but has been sober since 2004.[14] In September 2012, she told GQ:\\r\\nI was a big drinker at the time. I would drink every day. I would drink alone. I thought the whole concept was so fucking cool. A great deal of what I wrote on Born to Die is about these wilderness years. When I write about the thing that I've lost I feel like I'm writing about alcohol because that was the first love of my life. My parents were worried, I was worried. I knew it was a problem when I liked it more than I liked doing anything else. I was like, 'I'm fucked. I am totally fucked'. Like, at first it's fine and you think you have a dark side ÿ it's exciting ÿ and then you realise the dark side wins every time if you decide to indulge in it. It's also a completely different way of living when you know that... a different species of person. It was the worst thing that ever happened to me.[236]\\r\\nShe was in a relationship with Kassidy member Barrie-James O'Neill from August 2011 until June 2014.[237][238][239] Previously, she was in a relationship with alternative rock and antifolk musician Steven Mertens, who produced her debut album, Lana Del Ray, before it was re-recorded by David Kahne.[15]\\r\\nDel Rey moved to a home near Hancock Park in June 2014 (after living in New York City and London, England in the previous years), and she resided there with her siblings, Caroline and Charlie, for some time.[240] She relocated to a secluded beach-front home in Malibu, California, in June 2015, after dealing with trespassers at her former house.[241] She also purchased two adjacent mansions (in addition to her Malibu home) in Studio City, Los Angeles in September 2016.[242] Del Rey is Roman Catholic.[243]\\r\\nDel Rey's left hand is tattooed with the letter \\"M\\", referencing her grandmother, Madeleine,[78] and the word \\"paradise\\".[244] Her right hand is tattooed with the phrase \\"trust no one\\".[245]\\r\\nDel Rey's work has earned her numerous awards and nominations; she has won the Q Award for \\"Best New Thing\\", a GQ Award for \\"Woman of the Year\\", two BRIT Awards for \\"International Breakthrough Act\\" and \\"International Female Solo Artist\\", and an EMA for \\"Best Alternative Act\\".\\r\\nIn 2013, she received her first Grammy nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.

Although this film has the same title as Van Lustbader's first Bourne novel, The Bourne Legacy, the actual screenplay bears little resemblance to the novel. Unlike the novel, which features Jason Bourne as the principal character, the film centers on black ops agent Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner), an original character. In addition to Renner, the film stars Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton.\\r\\nThe titular character Jason Bourne does not appear in The Bourne Legacy, because actor Matt Damon chose not to return for the fourth film, due to Paul Greengrass not directing. Bourne is shown in pictures and mentioned by name several times throughout the film. Tony Gilroy, co-screenwriter of the first three films, sought to continue the story of the film series without changing its key events, and parts of The Bourne Legacy take place at the same time as the previous film, The Bourne Ultimatum (2007).\\r\\nIn The Bourne Legacy, Aaron Cross is a member of a black ops program called Operation Outcome whose subjects are genetically enhanced. He must run for his life once former CIA Treadstone agent Jason Bourne's actions lead to the public exposure of Operation Treadstone and its successor Operation Blackbriar.\\r\\nFilming was primarily in New York City, with some scenes shot in the Philippines, South Korea, Pakistan, and Canada. Released on August 10, 2012, the film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the story, James Newton Howard's score, and Renner's performance, but expressed disappointment in Matt Damon's absence, as well as the lack of shaky camera work (a key element of Greengrass' directorial style) that the second and third films had used. The film was followed in 2016 by Jason Bourne, in which Damon and Greengrass reprised their earlier roles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSix weeks after Jason Bourne's (Matt Damon) escape from Moscow, Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), an operative belonging to a Defense Department black ops program called Operation Outcome, is assigned to Alaska for a training exercise. He is forced to survive weather extremes and traverse rugged terrain to arrive at a remote cabin as punishment for missing training and going off the grid for four days. The cabin is operated by an exiled Outcome operative, Number Three (Oscar Isaac), who informs Aaron that he has broken the mission record by two days. As an Outcome operative, Aaron uses experimental pills known as \\"chems\\" (chemicals) which enhance the physical and mental abilities of their users.\\r\\nReporter Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) of The Guardian, who has been investigating the CIA programs Treadstone and Blackbriar, is assassinated at London Waterloo station (a scene from the previous film). When the illegal adaptation of the programs is exposed by Bourne, the FBI and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence investigate CIA Director Ezra Kramer (Scott Glenn), Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), Blackbriar supervisor Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), and Treadstone medical director Dr. Albert Hirsch (Albert Finney).\\r\\nEight months after the mayhem in New York City and Bourne's escape, Kramer requests help from Mark Turso (Stacy Keach), a retired United States Navy admiral, who runs the National Research Assay Group (NRAG). Turso informs Eric Byer (Edward Norton), a retired Air Force colonel overseeing NRAG's research and development of various clandestine enhancement programs used by the CIA and Defense. Byer discovers a potentially scandalous video on the Internet showing Hirsch socializing with Dr. Dan Hillcott (Neil Brooks Cunningham), Outcome's medical director. To prevent the Senate investigation from learning about Outcome, Byer orders everyone associated with the program to be killed. He sees the sacrifice as acceptable to protect NRAG's next-generation \\"beta programs\\", including the supersoldier program LARX.\\r\\nByer deploys a drone to eliminate Outcome agents Number Three and Five (Aaron) in Alaska. Aaron hears the drone's approach and leaves moments before a missile destroys the cabin with Number Three inside. Aaron removes the radio-frequency identification implanted in his thigh and force-feeds it to a wolf which is then blown up by a missile, tricking Byer into believing Aaron is dead. Hirsch dies of an apparent heart attack before he can testify before the Senate. At Sterisyn-Morlanta, a biogenetics company supporting Outcome, researcher Dr. Donald Foite (?eljko Ivanek) shoots and kills all but one of his colleagues in the research laboratory. Security guards break into the lab and shoot him, though he seemingly does not feel the pain of the gunshots. Foite turns his gun on himself, leaving biochemist Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) as the sole survivor. Meanwhile, other Outcome agents are eliminated when their handlers give them poisoned yellow pills disguised as new chems.\\r\\nFour \\"D-Track\\" assassins disguised as federal agents visit Marta at her country house. After she states her belief of Foite having been chemically brainwashed into an emotionless killer, the assassins attempt to fake her suicide, but are killed by Aaron. He saves her life as she is his last link to the chems so that he can retain his enhanced capabilities and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Marta reveals that Cross has been genetically modified by a tailored virus to retain the physical benefits without needing the green chems anymore. He still requires regular doses of blue chems to maintain his intelligence, but he is running out. Aaron confides to her that he is Private First Class Kenneth J. Kitsom (reportedly killed by a roadside bomb in the Iraq War) and that his recruiter added twelve points to his IQ, enabling Aaron to meet the United States Army's requirements. Without his enhanced intelligence, Aaron believes they stand no chance of survival. Aaron and Marta travel to Manila, where the chems are manufactured, to try to infect him with another virus so he will not need the blue chems.\\r\\nAaron and Marta bluff their way into the Morlanta Pacific pharmaceutical factory where the program's chems are manufactured, and Marta injects Aaron with the live virus stems. Byer alerts factory security, but Aaron and Marta evade capture. Byer orders LARX-03, a chemically brainwashed super soldier, to track down and kill them. As Aaron recovers from the flu-like symptoms induced by the virus, he hallucinates about his Outcome training. When police surround their shelter while Marta is buying medicine, she warns Aaron by screaming. Aaron rescues her and steals a motorbike. They are pursued by both the police and LARX-03. After a lengthy chase through the streets and marketplaces of Manila to Marikina, they lose the police, but not the assassin. Both Aaron and LARX-03 are wounded by bullets, though LARX-03 is not entirely fazed by the wounds due to pain suppression induced by his brainwashing. As Aaron begins losing consciousness, LARX-03 is killed when Marta causes his motorcycle to crash into a pillar. Marta persuades a Filipino boatman to help them escape by sea.\\r\\nBack in New York, Vosen lies to the Senate, stating that Blackbriar was created solely to track down Jason Bourne, and that Landy committed treason by assisting Bourne and trying to sell Treadstone secrets to the press.\\r\\nUniversal Pictures originally intended The Bourne Ultimatum to be the final film in the series, but development of another film was under way by October 2008.[3] George Nolfi, who co-wrote The Bourne Ultimatum, was to write the script of a fourth film, not to be based on any of the novels by Robert Ludlum.[3] Joshua Zetumer had been hired to write a parallel scripta draft which could be combined with another (Nolfi's, in this instance)by August 2009 since Nolfi would be directing The Adjustment Bureau that September.[4] Matt Damon stated in November 2009 that no script had been approved and that he hoped that a film would begin shooting in mid-2011.[5] The next month, he said that he would not do another Bourne film without Paul Greengrass, who announced in late November that he had decided not to return as director.[6] In January 2010, Damon said that there would \\"probably be a prequel of some kind with another actor and another director before we do another one just because I think we're probably another five years away from doing it.\\"[7]\\r\\nHowever, it was reported in June 2010 that Tony Gilroy, who co-wrote each of the three previous Bourne films, would be writing a script with his brother, screenwriter Dan Gilroy, for a fourth Bourne film to be released sometime in 2012.[8] That October, Universal set the release date for The Bourne Legacy for August 10, 2012,[9] Tony Gilroy was confirmed as the director of the film, and it was also announced that Jason Bourne will not be appearing in the film.[10]\\r\\nGilroy said he did not get involved with the project \\"until the rules were that Matt [Damon] was gone, Matt and Paul [Greenglass] were gone, there was no Jason Bourne. That was the given when I had the first conversation about this. So it was very important to me, extremely important to me, that everything that had happened before be well preserved and be enhanced if possible by what we're doing now.\\"[11] He also said, \\"you could never replace Matt [Damon] as Jason Bourne. This isn't James Bond. You can't do a prequel. You can't do any of those kinds of things, because there was never any cynicism attached to the franchise, and that was the one thing they had to hang on to.\\"[12]\\r\\nGilroy \\"never had any intention of ever coming back to this realm at allmuch less write it, much less direct it. Then I started a really casual conversation about what we could do in a post-Jason Bourne setting. I was only supposed to come in for two weeks, but the character we came up with, Aaron Cross, was so compelling.\\"[13] After watching The Bourne Ultimatum again, Gilroy called his brother, screenwriter Dan Gilroy, and said, \\"'The only thing you could do is sort of pull back the curtain and say there's a much bigger conspiracy.' So we had to deal with what happened in Ultimatum as the starting point of this film. Ultimatum plays in the shadows of Legacy for the first 15 minutesthey overlap.\\"[13]\\r\\nIn speaking about the film's storyline, Gilroy drew a distinction between the fictional programs in the Bourne film series:\\r\\nOn a practical level, the Treadstone program was about assassination. They're basically assassins. They live in the worldyou can see Clive Owen [in The Bourne Identity] as a piano teacher, they have coversbut they're essentially assassins. There was nothing that would be described as espionage, [they're] basically a kill squad. The Outcome program that Aaron [played by Jeremy Renner] is part of, [Oscar Isaac's character] is one of them too... The conceit is that [Edward Norton's character] is the mastermind of this entire franchise. We're stepping back a little bit in time here, he's been a developer, he's been at the nexus of the corporate military and intelligence communities. There's a very large corporate element, pharmaceutical corporate element...[14]\\r\\nAlthough a large part of the film was set in and around Washington, DC, the real DC appears only in aerial establishing shots. Most of the film was shot over 12 weeks at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York, including all interior DC scenes.[15] The old house in Hudson, New York, used as Shearing's house was unable to accommodate the weight of equipment and crew, so it was used only for exterior shots, and all interior scenes were filmed on a Kaufman Astoria soundstage.[15] The scenes set in the \\"SteriPacific\\" factory in Manila were actually filmed in the New York Times printing plant in Queens.[16]\\r\\nSeveral scenes were shot overseas, mostly in Manila[17] and in the Paradise bay of El Nido, Palawan, in the Philippines.[18] Several train scenes at Garak Market Station on Seoul Subway Line 3 and nearby areas in Seocho-daero 77-Gil (1308 Seocho 4-dong), Seocho-gu, and Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea, were used in some scenes.[19] The Kananaskis Country region of Alberta, Canada, was used for the scenes set in Alaska.[15]\\r\\nGilroy said, \\"there are three deleted sceneswe just mixed them and color corrected them [...] but what I like about it is all three scenes happen in the movie. One of them's referred to and they're completely legitimate parts of our story, they absolutely happen in our film, we just didn't have time to show them to you so there's nothing off to the side. I think they'll be on the straight-up DVD.\\"[11]\\r\\nThe film portrays Cross and Shearing as traveling nonstop from New York JFK Airport to Manila on board an American Airlines Boeing 747-400. That particular 747 model was introduced in 1989; American Airlines has never flown one;[20][21] American Airlines has never served Manila as a destination; no commercial airline has ever flown from JFK to Manila nonstop with passenger service; the distance between the two cities exceeds the maximum range of any model 747.[22] In spite of these continuity lapses, American Airlines was actively involved in the production of the film in cooperation with NBCUniversal, and contributed its own airline employees and a Boeing 777-200 for the interior terminal and cabin shots at Terminal 8 of JFK International Airport.[23] The airline also heavily co-marketed the film throughout post-production.\\r\\nThe Bourne Legacy received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 56% based on 219 reviews with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"It isn't quite as compelling as the earlier trilogy, but The Bourne Legacy proves the franchise has stories left to telland benefits from Jeremy Renner's magnetic work in the starring role.\\"[24] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 61 out of 100 based on 42 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[25] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale.[26]\\r\\nLisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A-, commenting that \\"Gilroy, who as a screenwriter has shaped the movie saga from the beginning, trades the wired rhythms established in the past two episodes by Paul Greengrass for something more realistic and closer to the ground. The change is refreshing. Jason Bourne's legacy is in good hands.\\"[27] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2? stars out of 4, writing: \\"The Bourne Legacy is always gripping in the moment. The problem is in getting the moments to add up. I freely confess that for at least the first 30 minutes I had no clear idea of why anything was happening. The dialogue is concise, the cinematography is arresting and the plot is a murky muddle.\\"[28]\\r\\nPeter Debruge of Variety wrote that \\"the combination of Robert Elswit's elegant widescreen lensing and the measured editing by Tony Gilroy's brother John may be easier to absorb than Greengrass' hyperkinetic docu-based style, but the pic's convoluted script ensures that auds will emerge no less overwhelmed.\\"[29] Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice also wrote a scathing review of the film, saying: \\"The Bourne films have more than just overstayed their welcome and outlasted the Ludlum booksthey've been Van Halenized, with an abrupt change of frontman and a resulting dip in personality.\\"[30]\\r\\nKenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review, called the film \\"an exemplary espionage thriller that has a strong sense of what it wants to accomplish and how best to get there.\\" He especially commended Gilroy's work on the film: \\"Gilroy knows the underpinnings of this world inside out and appreciates how essential it is to maintain and extend the house style of cool and credible intelligence that marked the previous films.\\"[31] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter commented on his review that \\"the series' legacy is lessened by this capable but uninspired fourth episode.\\"[32]\\r\\nIn its opening weekend, The Bourne Legacy grossed about $38.7 million in the United States and Canada and debuted at #1 of the box office charts, surpassing Universal's expectation of $35 million. It grossed $46.6 million worldwide in its first weekend.[2] The film sold roughly 400,000 more tickets on its opening weekend than the first film in the series, The Bourne Identity. Studio research reported that audiences were evenly mixed among the sexes.[33] The film grossed $113,203,870 in North America and $162,940,880 in foreign countries, bringing the film's worldwide total to $276,144,750.[2]\\r\\nThe Bourne Legacy had its Asian premiere at Resorts World Manila in Pasay City, Metro Manila, on August 5, five days ahead of its opening date in North American theaters.[34]\\r\\nThe soundtrack to The Bourne Legacy as composed by James Newton Howard, unlike the previous films, which were composed by John Powell, was released digitally on August 7, 2012, by Varse Sarabande Records.[35][36] A new version of Moby's \\"Extreme Ways\\", entitled \\"Extreme Ways (Bourne's Legacy)\\", was recorded for the film's end credits.[37]\\r\\nThe Bourne Legacy was released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 11, 2012, in the United States and Canada.[38]\\r\\nUniversal Pictures stated at a media conference in Los Angeles, California, that they are likely to release more Bourne films, despite The Bourne Legacy being given mixed reviews by critics.[39] In a December 2012 interview, Matt Damon revealed that he and Paul Greengrass were interested in returning for the next film as Jason Bourne and the director, respectively.[40]\\r\\nDamon is reported saying that although he had not seen Legacy, he intends to do so because not only is he curious to see it, but also because he has enjoyed Jeremy Renner in everything he has seen him in. However, as of June 2014, executive producer Frank Marshall said that Matt Damon will not be returning to the big screen for the next Bourne film, contrary to earlier statements made by Damon and rumors surrounding his return to the franchise.[41] On February 21, 2013, it was confirmed that a Bourne 5 was being planned.[42][43]\\r\\nOn August 2, 2013, Universal hired Tony Gilroy and Anthony Peckham to write the film's script with Renner returning as Cross.[44] On November 8, 2013, The Fast and the Furious film series director Justin Lin was announced to direct the film.[45]\\r\\nOn December 2, 2013, it was announced that Renner will return as Cross, Lin will both direct and produce from his production company Perfect Storm Entertainment, and the studio announced an August 14, 2015 release date.[46] On May 9, 2014, Andrew Baldwin was brought in to re-write the film.[47]\\r\\nOn June 18, 2014, the studio pushed back the film from August 14, 2015, to July 15, 2016.[48] In November 2014, The Bourne Legacy sequel was put on hold in favour of Jason Bourne, which Damon confirmed that he and Greengrass will return to.[49]\\r\\nOn January 6, 2015, the studio pushed back the release date to July 29, 2016.[50] The first trailer for the film was aired on February 7, 2016 during Super Bowl 50, which also revealed its title as Jason Bourne.[51]\\r\\nProducer Frank Marshall said Universal Pictures is hoping to plan a sequel to Jason Bourne, making it the sixth Bourne film. However, in March 2017, Matt Damon cast doubt upon a sequel, hinting that people \\"might be done\\" with the character.[52] He also stated that a sequel to The Bourne Legacy featuring Renner's Cross is unlikely although he didn't explicitly rule it out.[53]","input":"Who is the actor who plays jason bourne?"},{"output":"tropical rain forest","context":"North America is the third largest continent, and is also a portion of the second largest supercontinent if North and South America are combined into the Americas and Africa, Europe, and Asia are considered to be part of one supercontinent called Afro-Eurasia.\\r\\nWith an estimated population of 460 million and an area of 24,346,000?km2 (9,400,000?mi2), the northernmost of the two continents of the Western Hemisphere[1] is bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the west; the Atlantic Ocean on the east; the Caribbean Sea, Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and South America on the south; and the Arctic Ocean on the north.\\r\\nThe northern half of North America is sparsely populated and covered mostly by Canada, except for the northeastern portion, which is occupied by Greenland, and the northwestern portion, which is occupied by Alaska, the largest state of the U.S. The central and southern portions of the continent are represented by the United States, Mexico, and numerous smaller states primarily in Central America and in the Caribbean.\\r\\nThe continent is delimited on the southeast by most geographers at the Darin watershed along the Colombia-Panama border, placing all of Panama within North America.[2][3][4] Alternatively, a less common view would end North America at the man-made Panama Canal. Islands generally associated with North America include Greenland, the world's largest island, and archipelagos and islands in the Caribbean. The terminology of the Americas is complex, but \\"Anglo-America\\" can describe Canada and the U.S., while \\"Latin America\\" comprises Mexico and the countries of Central America and the Caribbean, as well as the entire continent of South America.\\r\\nNatural features of North America include the northern portion of the American Cordillera, represented by the geologically new Rocky Mountains in the west; and the considerably older Appalachian Mountains to the east. The north hosts an abundance of glacial lakes formed during the last glacial period, including the Great Lakes. North America's major continental divide is the Great Divide, which runs north and south down through Rocky Mountains. The major watersheds all drain to the east: The Mississippi/Missouri and Rio Grande into the Gulf of Mexico, and St. Lawrence into the Atlantic.\\r\\nClimate is determined to a large extent by the latitude, ranging from Arctic cold in the north to tropical heat in the south. The western half of North America tends to have milder and wetter climate than other areas with equivalent latitude, although there are steppes (known as \\"prairies\\") in the central and western portions, and deserts in the Southwestern United States of Arizona, Colorado, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Oklahoma, and Texas; along with the Mexican states of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSeventy percent of North America is underlain by the Laurentia craton,[5] which is exposed as the Canadian Shield in much of central and eastern Canada around the Hudson Bay, and as far south as the U.S. states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. The continental crust started to form 4 billion years ago (Ga), and six of the microcontinents collided to form the craton about 2 Ga. This core has been enlarged by plate tectonics, most notably between 1.8 and 1.65 Ga when a piece currently stretching from Arizona to Missouri fused with the south and west portion of the craton. The craton started to rift about 1.1 Ga, and the fissure (now the Midcontinent Rift System) ran between Kansas and Lake Superior before stopping, perhaps due to the Grenville collision in the east. Otherwise the craton has remained relatively stable, with some rocks dating from 2.5 to 4 Ga, including what may be the world's oldest known rock: Specimens from the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt on the coast of the Hudson Bay have been dated to 4.38 Ga,[6][7] though the dating methods are disputed.[8] Periodic flooding by inland seas, most recently the Western Interior Seaway during the Cretaceous, caused the layer of sedimentary rock over the remainder of the craton. The Laurentia craton is the center of the Proterozoic supercontinent Rodinia in most models,[9] and was also part of the later Laurussia, Pangea, and Laurasia supercontinents.\\r\\nRoughly 3 million years ago (Ma), the volcanic Isthmus of Panama formed between the North and South American continents creating a bridge over what was the Central American Seaway and allowing the migration of flora and fauna between the two landmasses in the Great American Interchange. Starting 2.58 Ma, the Quaternary glaciation covered much of the continent with ice, centered west of Hudson Bay, the floor of which is slowly rebounding after being depressed by the great weight of the ice. Glaciers descended the slopes of the Rocky Mountains and those of the Pacific Margin. Extensive glacial lakes, such as Glacial Lake Missoula, Bonneville, Lahontan, Agassiz, and Algonquin, formed by glacial melt water. \\"Remnants of them are still visible in the Great Basin and along the edge of the Canadian Shield in the form of the Great Salt Lake, the Great Lakes, and the large lakes of west central Canada.\\"[10] The last glacial period of the current ice age caused a lowering of the sea level, exposing the Bering Land Bridge between Alaska and Siberia, which resulted in human migration from Asia to the Americas between 40,000 and 15,000 years ago.[11]\\r\\nNorth America may be divided into at least five major physiographic regions:[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Coastal Plain and the main belts of the North American Cordillera continue in the south in Mexico (where the Mexican Plateau, bordered by the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Sierra Madre Occidental, is considered a continuation of the intermontane system) to connect the Transverse Volcanic Range, a zone of high and active volcanic peaks south of Mexico City.\\r\\nThe vast majority of North America is located on the North American Plate, centered on the Laurentia craton. Parts of California and western Mexico form the partial edge of the Pacific Plate; the two plates meet along the San Andreas Fault. The southern portion of the Caribbean and parts of Central America compose the much smaller Caribbean Plate.\\r\\nThe western mountains have split in the middle, into the main range of the Rockies and the Coast Ranges in California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia with the Great Basin (a lower area containing smaller ranges and low-lying deserts) in between. The highest peak is Mount McKinley/Denali in Alaska. The geographic center of North America is approximately \\"6 miles west of Balta, Pierce County, North Dakota\\" at 48? 10north, 100? 10west,[13] and a 15-foot (4.5 m) field stone obelisk in Rugby, North Dakota (~15?miles or 25?km away) claims to mark the center.[citation needed]\\r\\nThree countries (Canada, the United States, and Mexico) make up most of North America's land mass; they share the continent with 34 other island countries in the Caribbean and south of Mexico.\\r\\nThe Great Plains is the broad expanse of prairie and steppe which lies east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. The narrow plains in the Mexican coast and the savannas of the Mississippi are analogous to, respectively, the Patagonian steppes and the pampas of the Piranha, Paraguay, and Rio de la Plata. Thus the Appalachians and the mountain chains of Brazil are regarded as creating similar interruptions to the plains community.[14]\\r\\nNorth America extends to within 10 of latitude of both the equator and the North Pole. It embraces every climatic zone, from tropical rain forest and savanna on the lowlands of Central America to areas of permanent ice cap in central Greenland.[14] Subarctic and tundra climates prevail in north Canada and north Alaska, and desert and semiarid conditions are found in interior regions cut off by high mountains from rain-bearing westerly winds.[12] However, most of the continent has temperate climates very favorable to settlement and agriculture. Prairies, or vast grasslands cover a huge amount in mountain ranges.[12]\\r\\n[15]\\r\\nThe average rainfall in North America is 76?cm/year, which produces some 18 petaliters of water.[16]\\r\\nNorth American rivers include:\\r\\nThe Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run along the entire Pacific Coast, acting as a barrier to the humid winds that sweep in from the ocean. The rising topography forces this air upwards, causing moisture to condense and fall in the form of rain on the western slopes of the mountains, with some areas receiving more than 70 inches (1.8?m) of rainfall per year. As a result, the air has lost much of its moisture and becomes hot and dry when it reaches the areas east of the coastal mountain ranges.[12] These arid conditions are, in some instances, exacerbated in regions of extremely low altitude (some near or below sea level) by higher air pressure, resulting in drier conditions and adiabatic heating effects, some of these pocket deserts exist in valleys well north of the CanadaÿUS border in interior British Columbia. What precipitation does fall generally does not last long, lost primarily to evaporation, as well as rapid runoff and efficient water uptake and storage by native vegetation.\\r\\nThere are various plant life distributions in North America. Plant life in the Arctic includes grasses, mosses, and Arctic willows. Coniferous trees, including spruces, pines, hemlocks, and firs, are indigenous to the Canadian and Western U.S. mountain ranges as far south as San Francisco. Among these are giant sequoias, redwoods, great firs, and sugar pines. Sugar pines are generally confined to the northwestern area of the United States. The central region of the country has hardwoods. Southern states grow extensive yellow pines. In addition, mahogany, logwood, and lignumvitae - all tropical in nature - are grown. The southwest has desert plants, including yucci and cacti. The cultivated native plants of North America are tobacco, maize, potato, vanilla, melons, cacao, gourds, indigo plant, and bean.\\r\\nNorth America is home to many native mammal species. Several species of deer, including elk, caribou, moose, mule deer, and the abundant white-tailed deer are found throughout various regions, along with the bison and musk ox in the central and northern plains, respectively. Three species of bear, several subspecies of wolf, and various other carnivores such as raccoons, skunks, and cats including cougars and lynxes are widely distributed. The family Mustelidae is well represented, including badgers, otters, ferrets, and wolverines. Numerous species of squirrels and other rodents, such as beavers and muskrats, can be found in virtually every region of the continent. Central America has adapted sloths, anteaters, and armadillos. Other animals includes the condor, among the heights of the Andes, the parrots and the monkeys of Tropical forests, the humming bird, rattlesnake, alligator, and Cayman of the banks of the streams, and swarms of mosquitoes on the wide plains.\\r\\nThe mining and petroleum industries are important in Canada, the United States and Mexico. These natural resources make the region one of the richest on the earth.[1][1][17]\\r\\nThe Rocky Mountain region is known for vast resources and rich mineral deposits including copper, lead, gold, silver, tungsten, uranium, and zinc. Coal, petroleum and natural gas are mineral fuels found.[1][17] Old mine tailings are present in the Rocky Mountain landscape.\\r\\nAgriculture and forestry are two major industries. Agriculture includes arid land and irrigated farming and livestock grazing.[1] Livestock are often moved between high-elevation summer pastures and low-elevation and winter pastures.\\r\\nMap and aerial photos","input":"What is a special geographic characteristic of central america?"},{"output":"the use of social media platforms and websites to promote a product or service","context":"","input":"What is social media marketing (smm)?"},{"output":"Percy Lavon Julian","context":"Percy Lavon Julian (April 11, 1899 ÿ April 19, 1975) was an African American research chemist and a pioneer in the chemical synthesis of medicinal drugs from plants.[1] He was the first to synthesize the natural product physostigmine, and a pioneer in the industrial large-scale chemical synthesis of the human hormones progesterone and testosterone from plant sterols such as stigmasterol and sitosterol. His work laid the foundation for the steroid drug industry's production of cortisone, other corticosteroids, and birth control pills.[2][3][4]\\r\\nHe later started his own company to synthesize steroid intermediates from the wild Mexican yam. His work helped greatly reduce the cost of steroid intermediates to large multinational pharmaceutical companies, helping to significantly expand the use of several important drugs.[5][6]\\r\\nJulian received more than 130 chemical patents. He was one of the first African Americans to receive a doctorate in chemistry. He was the first African-American chemist inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, and the second African-American scientist inducted (behind David Blackwell) from any field.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPercy Lavon Julian was born in Montgomery, Alabama, as the first child of six born to James Sumner Julian and Elizabeth Lena Julian, ne Adams. Both of his parents were graduates of what was to be Alabama State University. His father, James, whose own father had been a slave, was employed as a clerk in the Railway Service of the United States Post Office, while his mother, Elizabeth, worked as a schoolteacher.[7][8][9] Percy Julian grew up in the time of racist Jim Crow culture and legal regime in the southern United States. Among his childhood memories was finding a lynched man hanged from a tree while walking in the woods near his home. At a time when access to an education beyond the eighth grade was extremely rare for African-Americans, Julian's parents steered all of their children toward higher education.\\r\\nJulian attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana. The college accepted few African-American students. The segregated nature of the town forced social humiliations. Julian was not allowed to live in the college dormitories and first stayed in an off-campus boarding home, which refused to serve him meals. It took him days before Julian found an establishment where he could eat. He later found work firing the furnace, waiting tables, and doing other odd jobs in a fraternity house; in return, he was allowed to sleep in the attic and eat at the house. Julian graduated from DePauw in 1920 as a Phi Beta Kappa and valedictorian.[10] By 1930 Julian's father would move the entire family to Greencastle so that all his children could attend college at DePauw. He still worked as a railroad postal clerk.[7]\\r\\nAfter graduating from DePauw, Julian wanted to obtain his doctorate in chemistry, but learned it would be difficult for an African-American to do so. Instead he obtained a position as a chemistry instructor at Fisk University. In 1923 he received an Austin Fellowship in Chemistry, which allowed him to attend Harvard University to obtain his M.S. However, worried that white students would resent being taught by an African-American, Harvard withdrew Julian's teaching assistantship, making it impossible for him to complete his Ph.D. at Harvard.\\r\\nIn 1929, while an instructor at Howard University, Julian received a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to continue his graduate work at the University of Vienna, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1931. He studied under Ernst Sp?th and was considered an impressive student. In Europe, he found freedom from the racial prejudices that had stifled him in the States. He freely participated in intellectual social gatherings, went to the opera and found greater acceptance among his peers.[11][12] Julian was one of the first African Americans to receive a Ph.D. in chemistry, after St. Elmo Brady and Dr. Edward M.A. Chandler.[5][13]\\r\\nAfter returning from Vienna, Julian taught for one year at Howard University. At Howard, in part due to his position as a department head, Julian became caught up in university politics, setting off an embarrassing chain of events. At university president Mordecai Wyatt Johnson's request,[14] he goaded white Professor of chemistry, Jacob Shohan (Ph.D from Harvard [15]), into resigning.[16][17] In late May 1932, Shohan retaliated by releasing to the local African-American newspaper the letters Julian had written to him from Vienna. The letters described \\"a variety of subjects from wine, pretty Viennese women, music and dances, to chemical experiments and plans for the new chemical building.\\"[16] In the letters, he spoke with familiarity, and with some derision, of specific members of the Howard University faculty, terming one well-known Dean, an \\"ass\\".[16][18]\\r\\nAround this same time, Julian also became entangled in an interpersonal conflict with his laboratory assistant, Robert Thompson. Julian had recommended Thompson for dismissal in March 1932.[19] Thompson sued Julian for \\"alienating the affections of his wife\\",[16] Anna Roselle Thompson, stating he had seen them together in a sexual tryst. Julian counter-sued him for libel. When Thompson was fired, he too gave the paper intimate and personal letters which Julian had written to him from Vienna. Dr. Julian's letters revealed \\"how he fooled the [Howard] president into accepting his plans for the chemistry building\\"[18] and \\"how he bluffed his good friend into appointing\\" a professor of Julian's liking.[18] Through the summer of 1932, the Baltimore Afro-American published all of Julian's letters. Eventually, the scandal and accompanying pressure forced Julian to resign. He lost his position and everything he had worked for.[5]\\r\\nSome happiness for Dr. Julian, however, was to come from this scandal. On December 24, 1935 he married Anna Roselle (Ph.D. in Sociology, 1937, University of Pennsylvania). They had two children: Percy Lavon Julian, Jr. (August 31, 1940 ÿ February 24, 2008), who became a noted civil rights lawyer in Madison, Wisconsin;[20] and Faith Roselle Julian (1944ÿ ), who still resides in their Oak Park home and often makes inspirational speeches about her father and his contributions to science.[21]\\r\\nAt the lowest point in Julian's career, his former mentor, William Blanchard, threw him a much-needed lifeline. Blanchard offered Julian a position to teach organic chemistry at DePauw University in 1932. Julian then helped Josef Pikl, a fellow student at the University of Vienna, to come to the United States to work with him at DePauw. In 1935 Julian and Pikl completed the total synthesis of physostigmine and confirmed the structural formula assigned to it. Robert Robinson of Oxford University in the U.K. had been the first to publish a synthesis of physostigmine, but Julian noticed that the melting point of Robinson's end product was wrong, indicating that he had not created it. When Julian completed his synthesis, the melting point matched the correct one for natural physostigmine from the calabar bean.[5]\\r\\nJulian also extracted stigmasterol, which took its name from Physostigma venenosum, the west African calabar bean that he hoped could serve as raw material for synthesis of human steroidal hormones. At about this time, in 1934, Butenandt and Fernholz, in Germany,[22][23] had shown that stigmasterol, isolated from soybean oil, could be converted to progesterone by synthetic organic chemistry.\\r\\nIn 1936 Julian was denied a professorship at DePauw for racial reasons. DuPont had offered a job to fellow chemist Josef Pikl but declined to hire Julian, despite his superlative qualifications as an organic chemist, apologizing that they were \\"unaware he was a Negro\\".[10] Julian next applied for a job at the Institute of Paper Chemistry (IPC) in Appleton, Wisconsin. However, Appleton was a sundown town, forbidding African Americans from staying overnight, stating directly: \\"No Negro should be bed or boarded overnight in Appleton.\\"\\r\\nMeanwhile, Julian had written to the Glidden Company, a supplier of soybean oil products, to request a five-gallon sample of the oil to use as his starting point for the synthesis of human steroidal sex hormones (in part because his wife was suffering from infertility). After receiving the request, W. J. O'Brien, a vice-president at Glidden, made a telephone call to Julian, offering him the position of director of research at Glidden's Soya Products Division in Chicago. He was very likely offered the job by O'Brien because he was fluent in German, and Glidden had just purchased a modern continuous countercurrent solvent extraction plant from Germany for the extraction of vegetable oil from soybeans for paints and other uses.[5]\\r\\nJulian supervised the assembly of the plant at Glidden when he arrived in 1936. He then designed and supervised construction of the world's first plant for the production of industrial-grade, isolated soy protein from oil-free soybean meal. Isolated soy protein could replace the more expensive milk casein in industrial applications such as coating and sizing of paper, glue for making Douglas fir plywood, and in the manufacture of water-based paints.\\r\\nAt the start of World War II, Glidden sent a sample of Julian's isolated soy protein to National Foam System Inc. (today a unit of Kidde Fire Fighting), which used it to develop Aer-O-Foam,[24][25] the U.S. Navy's beloved fire-fighting \\"bean soup.\\" While it was not exactly Julian's brainchild, his meticulous care in the preparation of the soy protein made the fire fighting foam possible. When a hydrolyzate of isolated soy protein was fed into a water stream, the mixture was converted into a foam by means of an aerating nozzle. The soy protein foam was used to smother oil and gasoline fires aboard ships and was particularly useful on aircraft carriers. It saved the lives of thousands of sailors and airmen.[25] Citing this achievement, in 1947 the NAACP awarded Julian the Spingarn Medal, its highest honor.\\r\\nJulian's research at Glidden changed direction in 1940 when he began work on synthesizing progesterone, estrogen, and testosterone from the plant sterols stigmasterol and sitosterol, isolated from soybean oil by a foam technique he invented and patented.[2][26] At that time clinicians were discovering many uses for the newly discovered hormones. However, only minute quantities could be extracted from hundreds of pounds of the spinal cords of animals.\\r\\nIn 1940 Julian was able to produce 100?lb of mixed soy sterols daily, which had a value of $10,000 ($82,000 today)[27] as sex hormones. Julian was soon ozonizing 100 pounds daily of mixed sterol dibromides. The soy stigmasterol was easily converted into commercial quantities of the female hormone progesterone, and the first pound of progesterone he made, valued at $63,500 ($520,000 today),[27] was shipped to the buyer, Upjohn,[28] in an armored car.[4] Production of other sex hormones soon followed.[29]\\r\\nHis work made possible the production of these hormones on a larger industrial scale, with the potential of reducing the cost of treating hormonal deficiencies. Julian and his co-workers obtained patents for Glidden on key processes for the preparation of progesterone and testosterone from soybean plant sterols. Product patents held by a former cartel of European pharmaceutical companies had prevented a significant reduction in wholesale and retail prices for clinical use of these hormones in the 1940s. He saved many lives with this discovery.[30][31][32]\\r\\nOn April 13, 1949, rheumatologist Philip Hench at the Mayo Clinic announced the dramatic effectiveness of cortisone in treating rheumatoid arthritis. The cortisone was produced by Merck at great expense using a complex 36-step synthesis developed by chemist Lewis Sarett, starting with deoxycholic acid from cattle bile acids. On September 30, 1949, Julian announced an improvement in the process of producing cortisone.[33][34][35][36] This eliminated the need to use osmium tetroxide, which was a rare and expensive chemical.[33] By 1950, Glidden could begin producing closely related compounds which might have partial cortisone activity. Julian also announced the synthesis, starting with the cheap and readily available pregnenolone (synthesized from the soybean oil sterol stigmasterol) of the steroid cortexolone (also known as Reichstein's Substance S), a molecule that differed from cortisone by a single missing oxygen atom; and possibly 17ϫ-hydroxyprogesterone and pregnenetriolone, which he hoped might also be effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis,[33][34][35][36][37] but unfortunately they were not.[36]\\r\\nOn April 5, 1952, biochemist Durey Peterson and microbiologist Herbert Murray at Upjohn published the first report of a fermentation process for the microbial 11ϫ-oxygenation of steroids in a single step (by common molds of the order Mucorales). Their fermentation process could produce 11ϫ-hydroxyprogesterone or 11ϫ-hydroxycortisone from progesterone or Compound S, respectively, which could then by further chemical steps be converted to cortisone or 11-hydroxycortisone (cortisol).[38]\\r\\nAfter two years, Glidden abandoned production of cortisone to concentrate on Substance S. Julian developed a multistep process for conversion of pregnenolone, available in abundance from soybean oil sterols, to cortexolone. In 1952, Glidden, which had been producing progesterone and other steroids from soybean oil, shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an arrangement with Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by Russell Marker after leaving Syntex). Glidden's cost of production of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use progesterone, available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce cortisone and hydrocortisone.[36]\\r\\nIn 1953, Glidden decided to leave the steroid business, which had been relatively unprofitable over the years despite Julian's innovative work.[39] On December 1, 1953, Julian left Glidden after 18 years, giving up a salary of nearly $50,000 a year (equivalent to $460,000 in 2017)[27] to found his own company, Julian Laboratories, Inc., taking over the small, concrete-block building of Suburban Chemical Company in Franklin Park, Illinois.[40][41][42]\\r\\nOn December 2, 1953, Pfizer acquired exclusive licenses of Glidden patents for the synthesis of Substance S. Pfizer had developed a fermentation process for microbial 11-oxygenation of steroids in a single step that could convert Substance S directly to 11-hydrocortisone (cortisol), with Syntex undertaking large-scale production of cortexolone at very low cost.[36]\\r\\nCirca 1950, Julian moved his family to the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, becoming the first African-American family to reside there.[43] Although some residents welcomed them into the community, there was also opposition. Before they even moved in, on Thanksgiving Day, 1950, their home was fire-bombed. Later, after they moved in, the house was attacked with dynamite on June 12, 1951. The attacks galvanized the community, and a community group was formed to support the Julians.[44] Julian's son later recounted that during these times, he and his father often kept watch over the family's property by sitting in a tree with a shotgun.[5]\\r\\nIn 1953, Julian founded his own research firm, Julian Laboratories, Inc. He brought many of his best chemists, including African-Americans and women, from Glidden to his own company. Julian won a contract to provide Upjohn with $2 million worth of progesterone (equivalent to $16 million today).[27] To compete against Syntex, he would have to use the same Mexican yam Mexican barbasco trade as his starting material. Julian used his own money and borrowed from friends to build a processing plant in Mexico, but he could not get a permit from the government to harvest the yams. Abraham Zlotnik, a former Jewish University of Vienna classmate whom Julian had helped escape from the Holocaust, led a search to find a new source of the yam in Guatemala for the company.\\r\\nIn July 1956, Julian and executives of two other American companies trying to enter the Mexican steroid intermediates market appeared before a U.S. Senate subcommittee. They testified that Syntex was using undue influence to monopolize access to the Mexican yam.[32][45] The hearings resulted in Syntex signing a consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department. While it did not admit to restraining trade, it promised not to do so in the future.[32] Within five years, large American multinational pharmaceutical companies had acquired all six producers of steroid intermediates in Mexico, four of which had been Mexican-owned.[32]\\r\\nSyntex reduced the cost of steroid intermediates more than 250-fold over twelve years, from $80 per gram in 1943 to $0.31 per gram in 1955.[32][45] Competition from Upjohn and General Mills, which had together made very substantial improvements in the production of progesterone from stigmasterol, forced the price of Mexican progesterone to less than $0.15 per gram in 1957. The price continued to fall, bottoming out at $0.08 per gram in 1968.[32][36]\\r\\nIn 1958, Upjohn purchased 6,900?kg of progesterone from Syntex at $0.135 per gram, 6,201?kg of progesterone from Searle (who had acquired Pesa) at $0.143 per gram, 5,150?kg of progesterone from Julian Laboratories at $0.14 per gram, and 1,925?kg of progesterone from General Mills (who had acquired Protex) at $0.142 per gram.[46]\\r\\nDespite continually falling bulk prices of steroid intermediates, an oligopoly of large American multinational pharmaceutical companies kept the wholesale prices of corticosteroid drugs fixed and unchanged into the 1960s. Cortisone was fixed at $5.48 per gram from 1954, hydrocortisone at $7.99 per gram from 1954, and prednisone at $35.80 per gram from 1956.[32][46] Merck and Roussel Uclaf concentrated on improving the production of corticosteroids from cattle bile acids. In 1960 Roussel produced almost one-third of the world's corticosteroids from bile acids.[36]\\r\\nJulian Laboratories chemists found a way to quadruple the yield on a product on which they were barely breaking even. Julian reduced their price for the product from $4,000 per kg to $400 per kg.[5] He sold the company in 1961 for $2.3 million (equivalent to $19 million today).[27] The U.S. and Mexico facilities were purchased by Smith Kline, and Julian's chemical plant in Guatemala was purchased by Upjohn.\\r\\nIn 1964, Julian founded Julian Associates and Julian Research Institute, which he managed for the rest of his life.[47]\\r\\nHe was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1973 in recognition of his scientific achievements.[5] He became the second African-American to be inducted, after David Blackwell.\\r\\nRuben Santiago-Hudson portrayed Percy Julian in the Public Broadcasting Service Nova documentary about his life, called \\"Forgotten Genius\\". It was presented on the PBS network on February 6, 2007, with initial sponsorship by the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation and further funding by the National Endowment for the Humanities. Approximately sixty of Julian's family members, friends, and work associates were interviewed for the docudrama.[5][59]\\r\\nProduction on the biopic began at DePauw University's Greencastle campus in May 2002 and included video of Julian's bust on display in the atrium of the university's Percy Lavon Julian Science and Mathematics Center. Completion and broadcasting of the documentary program was delayed in order for Nova to commission and publish a matching book on Julian's life.[60]\\r\\nAccording to University of Illinois historian James Anderson in the film, \\"His story is a story of great accomplishment, of heroic efforts and overcoming tremendous odds...a story about who we are and what we stand for and the challenges that have been there and the challenges that are still with us.\\"[59]\\r\\nThe Percy Lavon Julian family papers are archived at DePauw University.[61]","input":"Who was the african american scientist who created synthetic physostigmine?"},{"output":"at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey, United States","context":"Kingda Ka is a steel accelerator roller coaster located at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey, United States. It is the world's tallest roller coaster, the world's second fastest roller coaster, and was the second strata coaster ever built. It was built by Stakotra,[1] a subcontractor to Intamin. Riders have to be 54\\" in order to be able to get on the roller coaster. [2]\\r\\nThe train is launched by a hydraulic launch mechanism to 128 miles per hour (206?km/h) in 3.5 seconds.[2] At the end of the launch track, the train climbs the main top hat tower, reaching a height of 456 feet (139?m) and spanning over a 3,118-foot-long (950?m) track by the end of the ride.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPlans to build Kingda Ka were announced on September 10, 2003, at an event held for roller coaster enthusiasts and the media.[4] The event revealed the park's goal to build \\"the tallest and fastest roller coaster on earth\\", reaching 456 feet (139?m) and accelerating up to 128 miles per hour (206?km/h) in 3.5 seconds.[5] On January 13, 2005, Kingda Ka's tower construction was completed,[6] and on May 21, 2005, the ride opened to the public. Kingda Ka became the \\"tallest\\" and \\"fastest\\" roller coaster in the world, taking both world records from Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point. It lost the title of world's fastest when Formula Rossa at Ferrari World opened in November 2010.[7] Intamin designed both Kingda Ka and Top Thrill Dragster, and the two share a similar design and layout that differs primarily by the theme and the additional hill featured on Kingda Ka.[8] Both rides were built by Stakotra[9] and installed by Martin & Vleminckx.[10]\\r\\nOn August 29, 2013, Six Flags Great Adventure officially announced Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom for the 2014 season. The new attraction was attached to the Kingda Ka coaster.[11] The drop tower features three gondolas integrated into the existing structure which was also built by Intamin. Kingda Ka closed at the start of the 2014 season in order to construct Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom on to Kingda Ka. Kingda Ka reopened on weekends on Memorial Day Weekend and fully reopened when Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom was completed on July 4, 2014.[12]\\r\\nKingda Ka's layout and experience is nearly identical to Top Thrill Dragster.[13] After the train has been locked and checked, it moves slowly out of the station to the launch area. It passes through a switch track, which allows four trains (on two tracks) to load simultaneously. When the signal to launch is given, the train rolls back slightly (to engage the catch car) and the brakes on the launch track retract.[14] There is a voice that says, \\"Arms down, head back, hold on!\\". The launch occurs five seconds after the hissing sound of the brake fins retracting or the warning voice.[15] Kingda Ka's horn previously sounded before each launch,[16] but it was silenced due to noise complaints from nearby residents; the horn now sounds only when Kingda Ka first launches after being idle for a length of time. When the train is in position, the hydraulic launch mechanism accelerates the train from 0 to 128 miles per hour (0 to 206?km/h) in 3.5 seconds.[2] At the end of the launch track, the train climbs the main tower (or top hat) and rolls 90 degrees to the right before reaching a height of 456 feet (139?m).[3] The train then descends 418 feet (127?m) straight down through a 270-degree right-hand spiral. The train climbs the second hill of 129 feet (39?m), producing a moment of weightlessness before being smoothly brought to a stop by the magnetic brakes; it then makes a left-hand U-turn and enters the station. The ride lasts 28 seconds from the start of the launch.[17][18]\\r\\nKingda Ka is themed as a mythical tiger, named for the 500?lb (230?kg) Golden Tabby Bengal tiger who lived in an adjacent exhibit before moving to the park's safari.[19] The ride's sign and station have a Nepalese style. The queue line is surrounded by bamboo, which augments the jungle theme.[20] Jungle music is played during the wait and throughout the Golden Kingdom section of the park, which was built for the ride.[4]\\r\\nThe hydraulic launch motor is capable of producing 20,800 peak horsepower (15.5 MW). Because of the high speed and open nature of the trains, the ride will not operate in light rain.[21]\\r\\nKingda Ka's four trains are color-coded for easy identification (green, dark blue, teal, and orange) and are numbered; the four colors are also used for the seats and restraints. Each train seats 18 people (two per row). The rear car has one row, while the rest have two.[22] The rear row of each car is positioned higher than its front row for better visibility.\\r\\nEach of Kingda Ka's trains has an extra row of seat mounts. The panels could be removed for the installation of additional seats in the future. This modification would increase the capacity of each train from 18 to 20, and the hourly capacity of the coaster from 1400 to 1600 riders per hour. Kingda Ka's station is prepared for this modification, with entrance gates for the currently-nonexistent row of seats.[22]\\r\\nKingda Ka's over-the-shoulder restraint system consists of a thick, rigid lap bar and two thin, flexible over-the-shoulder restraints.[23] Because the over-the-shoulder portions of the restraint are not rigid, the hand grips are mounted to the lap bar. Kingda Ka's restraints are also held down by a belt, in case the main locking system fails. To speed loading, riders are asked to secure their own restraints if possible.\\r\\nKingda Ka's station has two parallel tracks, with switch tracks at the entrance and exit. Each of the station's tracks is designed to accommodate two trains, so each of the four trains can be operated from its own station. While all of the trains are mechanically identical and able to load and unload at each of the four individual station bays the original plan was for all trains to operate at the same time and for each train to load and unload at their own station. During normal operation, trains on one side are loaded while trains on the other side are launched.[23] When both sides of the station are in use an employee directs riders in line to go to a particular side, where they can choose to sit in the front or rear of the train.[14] During recent seasons it has become common that only one train bay (the forward one on the side opposite of the parking lot) be used for the loading, unloading, and dispatching of trains and that the other train or trains in operation on any given day wait either in the station behind a loading/unloading train or outside of the station on the brakes that follow the second hill. Two operators load, check and dispatch each train; another launches the trains. Kingda Ka's music is by Safri Duo; almost their entire Episode II album is played in the queue and station. The other is the remix version of Survivor's \\"Eye of the Tiger\\", played by DJ Quicksilver. Both of these may be heard during the queue and in the station.[24]\\r\\nA train may occasionally experience a rollback following a launch. A rollback occurs when the train fails to make it over the top of the tower and descends back down the side it was launched. Kingda Ka includes retractable magnetic brakes on its launch track to prevent a train from rolling back into the loading station.[16]\\r\\nOn June 8, 2005, a bolt failed inside a trough that the launch cable travels through. This caused the liner to come loose creating friction on the cable and preventing the train from accelerating to the correct speed. The rubbing of the cable against the inside of the metal trough caused sparks and shards of metal to fly out from the bottom of the train. The ride was closed for almost two months following the incident.[25]\\r\\nDamage occurred to the launch cable which was frayed and required replacement, to the engine including minor damage to seals, and to many of the brake fins. The brake fins in the launch section are mounted to keep fast-moving trains from moving backward into the station. However, the fast-moving train being pulled forward caused an unexpected stress on a number of fins bending them forward. Not all required replacement, but there were more damaged brake fins than Six Flags had replacements for. Extra brake fins had to be ordered from the manufacturer, Intamin in Switzerland, and the ride had to undergo thorough testing following the repair.[21] Kingda Ka reopened on August 4.[26]\\r\\nKingda Ka was struck by lightning in May 2009 and suffered serious damage.[27] The ride was closed for three months for repairs and reopened on August 21, 2009.[28]\\r\\nOn August 27, 2011, Kingda Ka suffered unspecified damage shortly before Hurricane Irene; that same day, Six Flags Great Adventure did not open due to the approaching hurricane. While it is unknown whether additional damage occurred due to the storm, the coaster was damaged to the extent that it could not run before Irene.[29] Kingda Ka remained closed until the start of the 2012 operating season on April 5.[30]\\r\\nShortly before 5:00?pm on July 26, 2012, a young boy was sent to the hospital after suffering minor injuries from being struck by a bird during normal operation. The ride resumed normal operation shortly after the incident.[31]","input":"Where is the roller coaster kingda ka located?"},{"output":"in the decade after the Norman conquest of 1066","context":"","input":"When was the royal castle in england built?"},{"output":"Alexander Armstrong","context":"Mr Smith is a fictional extraterrestrial computer voiced by Alexander Armstrong which appears in the British children's science fiction television series, The Sarah Jane Adventures, with further minor appearances in the final two episodes of the fourth series of Doctor Who. He is installed in the attic of Sarah Jane Smith's home, and is used to hack into other systems; Sarah Jane asserts that he can hack \\"into anything\\". He first appeared in \\"Invasion of the Bane\\", the 2007 New Year's Day premire special, and has appeared in all the stories except The Eternity Trap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Smith is a Xylok, a member of a crystalline race which crashed to Earth as a meteorite some 60 million years in Earth's past.[1] It was trapped underneath the surface of the Earth until the eruption of Krakatoa brought a single, small Xylok to the attention of geologists. Sarah Jane received the crystal from a geologist friend as an aid to her studies in volcanic activity. She found that the crystal could communicate with her laptop; it revealed to her that it could help her track alien life and protect the earth. To this end it is the core of the supercomputer known as Mr Smith.\\r\\nMr Smith is hidden behind the chimney breast in Sarah Jane's attic at 13 Bannerman Road, Ealing, London. He reveals himself on the vocal command \\"Mr Smith, I need you\\". When he reveals himself as requested a fanfare plays (apparently diegetic, as Sarah Jane comments on it in the Doctor Who episode \\"The Stolen Earth\\"). The fanfare is omitted if summoned by the phrase \\"Mr Smith, I need you quickly and quietly,\\"[2] or if he determines that the fanfare would be inappropriate.[3] He can request the attention of Sarah Jane and can be heard quite clearly from her living room, three floors below. Mr Smith can also be called through mobile phones. In The Gift (Series Three), Clyde called Mr Smith through K-9.\\r\\nIn the first season, Mr Smith's main screen displays a crystal-like visualisation when idle. While Mr Smith allowed his sinister intentions to manifest at the end of the first series, the crystal shape that rotated, grew, and shrunk on his screen on a black background, turned green in some places and black in others. After his reboot and cleansing of malicious personality traits, in the second season the main screen displays a more abstract, fluid pattern, though retaining the same basic colours as the original display.\\r\\nBehind the screen is a large mass of tangled wires and electronics. Despite Mr Smith's extraterrestrial origins, his construction includes one or more USB ports.[4]\\r\\nIn \\"Invasion of the Bane\\", Sarah Jane is somewhat unwilling to allow either Maria Jackson or the young boy whom they rescued into her attic to see Mr Smith or her other alien technology and mementos. However, after Kelsey Hooper sneaks upstairs, Sarah Jane reveals Mr Smith to them when she uses him to hack into the Bubble Shock! factory computers in order to issue a warning to Mrs. Wormwood and the other Bane.\\r\\nMr Smith is also able to create replicas of official documents for Sarah Jane's use; for example, he created the necessary documents she needed to adopt Luke and falsified news reports to explain global blackouts. According to the official website,[5] Mr Smith has two access levels and Sarah Jane has only basic level clearance, as Mr Smith only allows the species that created him access to level two (although even basic level clearance has a very wide range of capabilities, so Sarah Jane is not hindered by this). He constantly scans all media, police, and other similar sources ÿ even passing space ships ÿ for reports of alien incursions and extraterrestrial information. He also scans for celebrity gossip for his own amusement.\\r\\nMr Smith is capable of conducting self-diagnostics and of extrapolating from orders given to generate information likely to be needed. At the end of Revenge of the Slitheen, he also warns Clyde Langer against trying to investigate his capabilities, and does so in an uncharacteristically authoritarian and somewhat malevolent \\"voice\\" with a slightly menacing chuckle.\\r\\nIn the penultimate episode of the first series, The Lost Boy, Mr Smith \\"readopts\\" his \\"evil\\" persona when he reveals to Clyde that he is a Xylok and that he had manipulated the Slitheen into kidnapping Sarah Jane's adopted son Luke. In doing so, he plans to bring the Moon crashing into the Earth by using Luke ÿ subsequent to his impending \\"arranged\\" escape by Mr Smith ÿ in conjunction with a telekinetic energiser headset, codenamed MITRE (derived from the Greek \\"mitre\\"), which is tuned to a human's natural telekinetic power, thereby enabling the user to move things with their mind. The gravitational pull of the Moon would tear the Earth apart, thereby freeing the Xylok race.\\r\\nSarah Jane eventually returns to her attic and confronts Mr Smith, who proceeds to monologue in the same malevolent voice as Luke pulses in agony. In retaliation, she unleashes K-9 to battle Mr Smith while she covertly enters an Armageddon code virus acquired by Maria's father. Thanks to K-9's attack distracting Mr Smith, she is successful in her attempts to infect him with the computer virus. As Mr Smith's databanks begin to collapse, he loses his memories of his primary objective, which was originally to release other Xyloks from within the Earth, and Sarah Jane \\"reaffirms\\"[citation needed] Mr Smith that his objective is to save the Earth.\\r\\nMr Smith shuts down, and the Moon returns to its regular orbit. In the episode's dnouement, Sarah Jane promises that when Mr Smith reboots, his new purpose will be \\"to safeguard the Earth\\", meaning he will resume his previous role in the series.\\r\\nMr Smith makes an appearance in the two-part Doctor Who episode, \\"The Stolen Earth\\", along with Sarah Jane and Luke, helping the two of them to contact other past companions such as Jack Harkness and Martha Jones. When former Prime Minister Harriet Jones asks them to help her send a signal to the Doctor, Mr Smith hacks into every telephone line on Earth, allowing the entire world to phone the Doctor ÿ currently using Martha's old mobile phone ÿ simultaneously, thus breaking through the barrier that Davros and the Daleks had erected around Earth. Mr Smith further assists the team in the finale episode, \\"Journey's End\\", with the help of K-9 and Torchwood Three, by creating a lasso of temporal energy around the TARDIS to tow Earth back to its proper location in space.\\r\\nSince the reboot, his visualisation has changed into a distorted, liquid like, version of his original one and some of his controls have been slightly altered, although in the Doctor Who episodes the visualisation is still the same as in through most of the first series of The Sarah Jane Adventures. The reprogramming also had an effect on his personality; Previously, not counting the time when he went \\"evil\\" and turned on Sarah, he was much colder and more emotionless, more like the computer he resembles rather than the living organism he is. Since then, he has become kinder, seems to be somewhat sensitive to other's emotions, and even has developed a sense of humor.[6]\\r\\nMr Smith appeared to start to self-destruct in Prisoner of the Judoon when ordered to do so by Sarah Jane while she was under the control of an alien entity, but Luke was able to override the self-destruct by pointing out the conflict with that order and Mr Smith's prime directive to protect humanity, given that the resulting explosion would destroy several city blocks.\\r\\nHe demonstrated displeasure and sarcasm in The Mad Woman in the Attic when told that K-9 Mark IV would return to residing with the Smith family. Mr Smith was initially openly resentful of K-9, a feeling which was mutual. The two of them engaged in a sort of rivalry, frequently bickering and trying to outdo each other in their technical support of Sarah Jane. When Clyde Langer secretly borrowed K-9 in order to cheat on a school exam, he asked Mr Smith not to tell Sarah Jane and Luke; Mr Smith readily agreed and graciously thanked Clyde for taking the dog.[7] However, despite their animosity towards each other, Mr. Smith once seemed to show genuine concern for K-9 when it appeared the latter might've been broken beyond repair. When it was decided K-9 would accompany Luke to Oxford University, Mr. Smith told K-9 \\"good-bye\\" and \\"you could always contact me if you need to\\", to which K-9 replied \\"I knew you would miss me\\".[8]\\r\\nMr Smith also has control of two powerful fans which he can power up on command; in The Gift it severely reduces his power packs. They are located behind the screen of Mr Smith and the screen slides up out of the way. Mr Smith states \\"Every computer has a cooling system.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter Sky Smith joined the team, she and Mr Smith briefly became the only people unaffected when Clyde was 'cursed' in The Curse of Clyde Langer, allowing them to help Sarah Jane and Rani break the curse of hatred at the sound of his name. When investigating the 'SerfBoard' in The Man Who Never Was, a new computer where the designers were hypnotising users to think that it was better than it was, Luke was able to communicate with Mr Smith by using K9's dog whistle to transmit a message in Morse code, Mr Smith subsequently hacking into various computers to delay two journalists from arriving at the SerfBoard's official launch and allowing Clyde and Rani to take their place.\\r\\nIn one timeline, Mr Smith will \\"die\\"  [sic] several years before 2059.[9]","input":"Who is mr smith in sarah jane adventures?"},{"output":"Sarojini Naidu","context":"In India, a governor is the constitutional head of each of the twenty-nine states. The governor is appointed by the President of India for a term of five years, and holds office at the President's pleasure. The governor is de jure head of the state government; all its executive actions are taken in the governor's name. However, the governor must act on the advice of the popularly elected council of ministers, headed by the chief minister, who thus hold de facto executive authority at the state-level. The Constitution of India also empowers the governor to act upon his or her own discretion, such as the ability to appoint or dismiss a ministry, recommend President's rule, or reserve bills for the President's assent. Over the years, the exercise of these discretionary powers have given rise to conflict between the elected chief minister and the central governmentÿappointed governor.[1] The union territories of Andaman and Nicobar, Delhi and Puducherry are headed by lieutenant-governors.\\r\\nSarojini Naidu was the first female to become the governor of an Indian state.[2] She governed Uttar Pradesh from 15 August 1947 to 2 March 1949.

For Major League Baseball and most of the minor leagues, this day typically falls during the first week of April.\\r\\nFor baseball fans, Opening Day serves as a symbol of rebirth; writer Thomas Boswell once penned a book titled, Why Time Begins on Opening Day.[1] Many feel that the occasion represents a newness or a chance to forget last season, in that all 30 of the major league clubs and their millions of fans begin with 0ÿ0 records.[1]\\r\\nOpening Day festivities extend throughout the sport of baseball, from hundreds of Minor League Baseball franchises to college, high school, and youth leagues in North America and beyond. Since Major League Baseball generally starts their season first among professional leagues, their Opening Day is the one most commonly recognized by the general public. Most of the minor leagues start a few days later, but within the same week; the short season Class A and Rookie leagues are exceptions, since they begin play in June. (College, high school and youth baseball seasons vary widely depending on location and weather conditions.) Opening Day ignores the exhibition games played during spring training in the month leading up to Opening Day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor generations, Opening Day has arrived amid pageantry. In Cincinnati, home of the sport's first professional team, the annual Findlay Market Parade marks an official \\"city holiday\\" with young and old alike taking the day off to cheer on the Reds. For decades, the first pitch of every major league season officially took place in Cincinnati, and the Reds remain the only major league team to always open the season with a home game (save for 1966, when they started the season at Philadelphia after rain washed out the opening series in Cincinnati; and 1990, when due to a lockout affecting the schedule they opened the season at Houston).[2] The Chicago Cubs have been the Reds' most common Opening Day opponent, visiting Cincinnati 36 times on Opening Day, most recently in 2007. The Pittsburgh Pirates, whom the current Reds organization played their first Opening Day against in 1882, is a close second with 31, most recently in 2015; no other team has more than 19 (by the St. Louis Cardinals, most recently in 2014), largely due to the Cubs and Pirates rotating as the Opening Day opponents from 1899 to 1916, then the two teams and the Cardinals rotated from 1917 to 1952.[3] Fittingly, the Reds were also the first team to host an Interleague game on Opening Day when the team hosted the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the first year of year-round Interleague play in 2013.[4]\\r\\nSince 1994 ESPN has televised a regular-season game the night before \\"Opening Day\\" and recent years have seen the staging of season-opening series in Mexico, Puerto Rico, Japan, and Australia. While these are technically \\"opening games\\", Major League Baseball still reserves the title \\"Opening Day\\" for the first day in which multiple games are played. (For the first time ever, three televised games were played on Sunday, April 3, 2016, before the traditional \\"Opening Day\\" slate of games on Monday, April 4.)[5][6][7]\\r\\nA home opener is a team's first game of the season on their home field.\\r\\nOpening Day is a state of mind as well, with countless baseball fans known to recognize this unofficial holiday as a good reason to call in sick at work or be truant from school (as most teams typically play their home opener in the afternoon) and go out to the ballpark for the first of 162 regular season games. Teams' home openers serve as the only regular season games during the year in which the entire rosters of both teams as well as coaches and clubhouse staff are introduced to the crowd prior to the games; for the rest of the year, ballparks only introduce the starting lineups (including the designated hitter in American League ballparks) and the team's manager. Some teams, among them the New York Mets, have had their broadcasters as the master of pre-game ceremonies for their home openers, which also typically feature appearances by retired players, local celebrities or media personalities, politicians, and other dignitaries.\\r\\nHall of Fame pitcher Early Wynn, who played for the Washington Senators, Cleveland Indians and Chicago White Sox, once said: \\"An opener is not like any other game. There's that little extra excitement, a faster beating of the heart. You have that anxiety to get off to a good start, for yourself and for the team. You know that when you win the first one, you can't lose 'em all.\\"[1]\\r\\nPrior to Opening Day, the teams' managers have to decide the starting pitchers for the game, an assignment typically given to the ace of each team's staff.[8] For a pitcher to start on Opening Day is considered an honor.[9]\\r\\nIn 2014, Ozzie Smith, with the support of Anheuser-Busch, began a campaign using the We the People site on WhiteHouse.gov to petition the U.S. government to make Opening Day an official national holiday.[10][11]\\r\\nIn 1907, the New York Giants forfeited their game at the Polo Grounds to the Philadelphia Phillies, 9ÿ0, after rowdy fans made and threw snowballs. Without police available to restore order, umpire Bill Klem awarded the game to the Phillies.[12]\\r\\nIn 1940, Cleveland Indians pitcher Bob Feller threw a no-hitter to open the season against the Chicago White Sox. It remains the only no-hitter in Opening Day history.[13]\\r\\nTwelve U.S. Presidents have thrown the first ball of the season. On April 14, 1910, baseball enthusiast William Howard Taft attended the home opener in Washington, D.C., becoming the first U.S. President to throw out the first pitch to start a season.[14] Harry S. Truman threw first pitches with both his right and left arm in 1950.[1] On April 4, 1994, Bill Clinton inaugurated the Cleveland Indians' new ballpark, then known as Jacobs Field and now as Progressive Field, with the first pitch.[15]\\r\\nTed Williams was a .449 hitter in openers, with three home runs and fourteen runs batted in during fourteen such games and at least one hit in each game.[16]\\r\\nOn April 4, 1974, Hank Aaron of the Atlanta Braves hit his 714th career home run on Opening Day at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium, tying Babe Ruth on Major League Baseball's all-time list.[1] Aaron finished his career with 755 home runs.\\r\\nIn 14 season openers for the Washington Senators, Walter Johnson pitched a record nine shutouts. Two of his more famous starts include a 3ÿ0 victory over the Philadelphia Athletics in 1910 and a 1ÿ0 marathon victory while battling the A's Eddie Rommel for 15 innings.\\r\\nOn April 4, 2005, Dmitri Young of the Detroit Tigers hit three home runs in his team's opener against the Kansas City Royals at Detroit's Comerica Park. He became the third major leaguer with three home runs on Opening Day, following the Toronto Blue Jays' George Bell in 1988 and the Chicago Cubs' Tuffy Rhodes in 1994.[17]\\r\\nThe St. Louis Cardinals were the first major league team to open their home season with a night game, beating the Pittsburgh Pirates 4ÿ2 at Sportsman's Park on April 18, 1950.[18]\\r\\nThe longest Opening Day game in major league history was played on April 5, 2012 between the Cleveland Indians and Toronto Blue Jays. The game, played at Cleveland's Progressive Field, ended with the Blue Jays beating the Indians, 7ÿ4, in 16 innings.[19] The previous record for longest Opening Day game was on April 19, 1960, again at Cleveland. That game, lasting 15 innings, also saw the Indians in a losing effort, 4ÿ2, versus the Detroit Tigers. The Philadelphia Athletics and Washington Senators also played a 15-inning season opener on April 13, 1926, with Washington winning, 1ÿ0, at home.\\r\\nOn rare occasions, predominantly in the early 20th century, a team would open its home season with a doubleheader. The first of these came when the Boston Americans hosted the Philadelphia Athletics for two games on April 20, 1903, with Boston winning the first game, 9ÿ4, and Philadelphia taking the second game, 10ÿ7.[20] The most recent Opening Day doubleheader in the major leagues came on April 7, 1971, with the Chicago White Sox defeating the host Oakland Athletics in both games (6ÿ5 and 12ÿ4, respectively).[21]\\r\\nIn 1968, Greg Washburn, a pitcher in the California Angels organization, pitched two Opening Day games in the same yearfirst for the San Jose Bees of the California League, and then for the Quad City Angels of the Midwest League. Washburn won both openers 2ÿ0. This is the only record of a pitcher pitching two openers in the same year in professional baseball.\\r\\nHall of Famer Tom Seaver has been a starting pitcher for the most Opening Day games in Major League history, doing the honors 16 times for the New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds, and Chicago White Sox.[22]\\r\\nMajor League Baseball had most of its teams open the 2011 season on a Thursday (March 31) or Friday (April 1) rather than the traditional Monday, in order to prevent the World Series from extending into November.[23] Similarly, most teams opened the 2012 season on Thursday (April 5) or Friday (April 6). However, subsequent seasons through 2017 returned to Monday openers for most teams. For the 2018 season, all 30 teams were scheduled to open the season on Thursday, March 29 (the earliest domestic start for a regular season in MLB history, and the first time since 1968 that all major league teams were scheduled to start the season on the same day, although two games were subsequently rained out and postponed to Friday, March 30).[24]\\r\\nIn the beginning, there was no baseball. But ever since, there have been few beginnings as good as the start of a new baseball season. It is the most splendid time in sport, in part because baseball is about the only sport leftnow that football players report to training camp before the Fourth of July, and hockey players start skating in Indian summerthat still has a time and is true to it.\\r\\nThere is no sports event like Opening Day of baseball, the sense of beating back the forces of darkness and the National Football League.\\r\\nYou always get a special kick on Opening Day, no matter how many you go through.

It lies within the upper region of the Great Appalachian Valley and drains all the way northward into Lake Champlain and the St. Lawrence River drainage basin. The lake is situated along the historical natural (Amerindian) path between the valleys of the Hudson and St. Lawrence Rivers, and so lies on the direct land route between Albany, New York and Montreal, Canada. The lake extends about 32.2?mi (51.8?km) on a north-south axis, is quite deep, and varies from one to three miles (1.6 to 4.8?km) in width, presenting a significant barrier to east-west travel. Although the year-round population of the Lake George region is relatively small, the summertime population can swell to over 50,000 residents, many in the village of Lake George region at the southern end of the lake.[not verified in body]\\r\\nLake George drains into Lake Champlain to its north through a short stream, the La Chute River, with many falls and rapids, dropping 226 feet (69?m) in its 3.5-mile (5.6?km) coursevirtually all of which is within the lands of Ticonderoga, New York and near the site of the famous Fort Ticonderoga. Ultimately the waters flowing via the 106-mile-long (171?km) Richelieu River drain into the St. Lawrence River downstream and northeast of Montreal, and then into the North Atlantic Ocean above Nova Scotia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLake George is located in the southeastern Adirondack State Park and is part of the St. Lawrence watershed. Notable landforms include Anthony's Nose, Deer's Leap, Diver's Rock (a 15-foot [4.6?m] jump into the lake), and Double-Diver's (a 30-foot [9.1?m] jump), the Indian Kettles, and Roger's Rock.\\r\\nSome of the surrounding mountains include Black Mountain, Elephant Mountain, Pilot Knob, Prospect Mountain, Shelving Rock, Sleeping Beauty Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain, and the Tongue Mountain Range. Some of the lake's more famous bays are Basin Bay, Kattskill Bay, Northwest Bay, Oneida Bay, and Silver Bay.\\r\\nThe lake is distinguished by \\"The Narrows\\", an island-filled narrow section (approximately five miles [8?km] long) that is bordered on the west by the Tongue Mountain Range and the east by Black Mountain. In all, Lake George is home to over 170 islands, 148 of them state-owned. They range from the car-sized Skipper's Jib to the larger Vicar's and Long Islands. Camping permits are attainable for the larger portion of islands.\\r\\nThe lake's deepest point is 196 feet (60?m), between Dome Island and Buck Mountain in the southern quarter of the lake. The northern end of the lake that is located near Ticonderoga is considered the southern end of the Champlain Valley, which includes Lake Champlain, as well as the cities Plattsburgh, New York and Burlington, Vermont.\\r\\nThere are six known invasive species in Lake George, according to the Lake George Association. The Asian clam first found in 2010 is the biggest threat, along with the Eurasian watermilfoil. Other invasive species are the Chinese mystery snail, curly-leaf pondweed, spiny water flea, and zebra mussel.[3]\\r\\nThe lake was originally named the Andia-ta-roc-te by local Native Americans. James Fenimore Cooper in his narrative Last of the Mohicans called it the Horican, after a tribe which may have lived there, because he felt the original name was too hard to pronounce.\\r\\nThe first European visitor to the area, Samuel de Champlain, noted the lake in his journal on July 3, 1609, but did not name it.[citation needed] In 1646, the French Canadian Jesuit missionary Isaac Jogues, the first European to view the lake, named it Lac du Saint-Sacrement (Lake of the Holy Sacrament), and its exit stream, La Chute (\\"The Fall\\").[4]\\r\\nOn August 28, 1755, William Johnson led British colonial forces to occupy the area in the French and Indian War. He renamed the lake as Lake George for King George II.[5] On September 8, 1755 the Battle of Lake George was fought between the forces of Britain and France resulting in a strategic victory for the British and their Iroquois allies. After the battle, Johnson ordered the construction of a military fortification at the southern end of the lake. The fort was named Fort William Henry after the King's grandson Prince William Henry, a younger brother of the later King George III.\\r\\nIn September, the French responded by beginning construction of Fort Carillon, later called Fort Ticonderoga, on a point where La Chute enters Lake Champlain. These fortifications controlled the easy water route between Canada and colonial New York. A French army, and their native allies under general Louis-Joseph de Montcalm laid siege to Fort William Henry in 1757 and burned it down after the British surrender. During the British retreat to Fort Edward they were ambushed and massacred by natives allied to the French, in what would become known as The Massacre at Fort William Henry.\\r\\nOn March 13, 1758, an attempted attack on that fort by irregular forces led by Robert Rogers was one of the most daring raids of that war. The unorthodox (to Europeans) tactics of Rogers' Rangers are seen as the inspiring the later creation of similar forces in later conflictsincluding the United States Army Rangers.\\r\\nLake George's key position on the MontrealÿNew York water route made possession of the forts at either endparticularly Ticonderogastrategically crucial during the American Revolution.\\r\\nLater in the war, British General John Burgoyne's decision to bypass the easy water route to the Hudson River that Lake George offered and, instead, attempt to reach the Hudson though the marshes and forests at the southern end of Lake Champlain, led to the British defeat at Saratoga.\\r\\nOn May 31, 1791, Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter to his daughter, \\"Lake George is without comparison, the most beautiful water I ever saw; formed by a contour of mountains into a basin... finely interspersed with islands, its water limpid as crystal, and the mountain sides covered with rich groves... down to the water-edge: here and there precipices of rock to checker the scene and save it from monotony.\\"\\r\\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Lake George was a common spot sought out by well-known artists, including Martin Johnson Heade, John F. Kensett, E. Charlton Fortune, Frank Vincent DuMond and Georgia O'Keeffe.\\r\\nOn October 2, 2005, at 2:55?p.m., the Ethan Allen, a 40-foot (12?m) glass-enclosed tourist boat carrying 47 passengers and operated by Shoreline Cruises, capsized during calm weather on the lake. According to reports from a local newspaper, 20 people (mostly senior citizens) died.\\r\\nInitial reports indicated that the tour group was from Canada, but these reports were later found to be incorrect. It was later determined that the group was from the Trenton, Michigan, area on a week-long fall trip along the East Coast by bus and rail, organized by Trenton's parks and recreation department and arranged through a Canadian company. Police said they had never seen a disaster of this magnitude on the lake. The captain survived and cooperated with police.[6]\\r\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board investigation of the incident revealed that, although the boat was rated to carry 50 people when it was manufactured in 1966, subsequent alterations to the boat's design had greatly reduced its stability. At the time of the accident, the boat should have been rated to carry no more than 14 passengers. On February 5, 2007, the captain, Richard Paris, and the company that owned the boat, Shoreline Cruises, were indicted for having only one crew member aboard the boat. More serious charges were not filed because neither the captain nor the owners were aware they were violating safety standards.[7]\\r\\nSituated on the rail line halfway between New York City and Montreal, Lake George attracted the era's rich and famous by the late 19th and early 20th century. Members of the Roosevelt, van Rensselaer, Vanderbilt, Rockefeller and Whitney families visited its shores. The Fort William Henry Hotel, in what is now Lake George Village, and The Sagamore in Bolton Landing opened at this time to serve tourists. The wealthiest visitors were more likely to stay with their peers at their private country estates.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Silver Bay YMCA on Lake George was constructed in 1900. It has since evolved into a summer family camp, serving several hundred organizations and tourists every summer.

Such notables as Spencer Trask and Robert Pitcairn built palatial summer homes here.

The current head coach is ܇scar Tabrez. The Uruguayan team is commonly referred to as La Celeste (The Sky Blue).\\r\\nThe Uruguayan team won the 2011 Copa Amrica. They have won the Copa Amrica 15 times, being the team that has won the tournament on most occasions. The team has won the FIFA World Cup twice, including the first World Cup in 1930 as hosts, defeating Argentina 4ÿ2 in the final. They won their second title in 1950, upsetting host Brazil 2ÿ1 in the final match, which received an attendance higher than any football match ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have won the Gold Medals in football at the Summer Olympics twice, in 1924 and 1928 recognized by FIFA as World Championships, before the creation of the World Cup. Uruguay also won the 1980 Mundialito, a tournament among former World Cup champions. In total, Uruguay have won 20 official titles, a world record for the most international titles held by any country.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir success is amplified by the fact that the nation has a very small population of around 3.4 million inhabitants (2011 est.). Uruguay is by far the smallest country in the world to have won a World Cup in terms of population, 1.75 million inhabitants in 1930. The second-smallest country, by population, to have won the World Cup is Argentina with a population of nearly 28 million people in 1978. Uruguay is also the smallest country ever to win any World Cup medals; only six FIFA member nations with a currently smaller population than Uruguay's have ever qualified to any World Cup: Northern Ireland (three times), Slovenia (twice), Wales, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Iceland.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1901, Uruguay played against Argentina in their first ever match, a close contest won by Argentina 3ÿ2. Prior to 1916, Uruguay played more than 30 matches, of which all but one were against Argentina. The inaugural Copa America provided Uruguay with more varied opposition. Victories over Chile and Brazil, along with a tie against Argentina, enabled Uruguay to win the tournament. The following year Uruguay hosted the competition, and retained the title by winning every game. The 1919 Copa Amrica saw Uruguay's first defeat in the tournament, a 1ÿ0 defeat in a playoff with Brazil which went to two periods of extra time, the longest Copa Amrica match in history.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1924, the Uruguay team traveled to Paris to become the first South American team to compete in the Olympic Games. In contrast to the physical style of the European teams of the era, Uruguay played a style based around short passes,[6] and won every game, defeating Switzerland 3ÿ0 in the gold medal match. In the 1928 Summer Olympics, Uruguay went to Amsterdam to defend their title, again winning the gold medal after defeating Argentina 2ÿ1 in the replay of the final (the first match was a draw after extra time). FIFA assumed the responsibility of the organization of the Football Games to be played by FIFA rules and the tournaments would be recognized as World Championships. It only happened twice (1924/1928 Summer Olympic Games) until the creation of its own FIFA World Championship, the FIFA World Cup, in 1930.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the double Olympic triumph, Uruguay was chosen as the host nation for the first World Cup, held in 1930, the centenary of Uruguay's first constitution. During the World Cup, Uruguay won all its matches, and converted a 1ÿ2 half-time deficit to a 4ÿ2 victory against Argentina at the Estadio Centenario. Due to the refusal of some European teams to participate in the first World Cup, the Uruguayan Football Association urged other countries to reciprocate by boycotting the 1934 World Cup played in Italy. For the 1938 World Cup, France was chosen as host, contrary to a previous agreement to alternate the championships between South America and Europe, so Uruguay again refused to participate.\\r\\n\\r\\nUruguay again won the World Cup in 1950, beating hosts Brazil in one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history. The decisive match was at the Maracan? Stadium in Brazil. Uruguay came from behind to beat the host nation in a match which would become known as the Maracanazo. Many Brazilians had to be treated for shock after the event, such was the surprise of Uruguay's victory.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter their fourth-place finish in the 1954 World Cup, the team had mixed performances and after the fourth-place finish in 1970, their dominance, quality and performance dropped. They were no longer a world football power and failed to qualify for the World Cup on five occasions in the last nine competitions. They reached an all-time low and at one time ranked 76th in the FIFA World Rankings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, however, a new generation of footballers, led by Luis Surez, Diego Forln and Edinson Cavani, formed a team considered to be Uruguay's best in the last four decades, catching international attention after finishing fourth in the 2010 World Cup. Uruguay opened the tournament with a goalless draw against France, followed by defeats of South Africa (3ÿ0) in and Mexico (1ÿ0) respectively, finishing at the top of their group with seven points. In the second round, they played South Korea, defeating them 2ÿ1 with star striker Luis Surez scoring a brace and earning Uruguay a spot in the quarter-finals for the first time since 1970. Against Ghana, the match finished 1ÿ1, forcing the game into extra-time. Both sides had their chances at extra time but Surez blocked the ball with his hand in the penalty area, earning Surez a red card and earning Uruguay universal scorn. Ghana striker Asamoah Gyan missed the subsequent penalty, forcing the game to go into penalties where Uruguay would win 4ÿ2, sending them into the last four. They played the Netherlands in the semifinals but were beaten 3ÿ2. For the third-place match, they played Germany, again losing 3ÿ2. This placed Uruguay in fourth place for the tournament, their best result in 40 years. Diego Forlan was awarded the Player of The Tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year later, they won the Copa America for the first time in 16 years and broke the record for the most successful team in South America. Luis Surez ended up as the Player of The Tournament\\r\\nIn the 2014 World Cup Uruguay was placed in Group D alongside Costa Rica, England, and Italy. They were upset by Costa Rica in the opening match, losing 3ÿ1 despite taking the lead in the first half. They rebounded with a 2ÿ1 victory over England, in which Surez scored a brace right after coming back from an injury, and a 1ÿ0 victory over Italy, placing them second in their group and earning a spot in the last 16. During the match against Italy, forward Luis Surez bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini on his left shoulder. Two days after the match, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee banned Surez for nine international matches, the longest such ban in World Cup history, exceeding the eight-match ban handed to Italy's Mauro Tassotti for breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique in 1994.[9][10][11] Surez was also banned from taking part in any football-related activity (including entering any stadium) for four months and fined CHF100,000 (approx. S65,700/?82,000/US$119,000).[9][10][12] In the round of 16, Uruguay played Colombia but were beaten 2ÿ0, eliminating them from the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 2015 and 2016 Copa Amrica, Uruguay, missing banned striker Luis Surez, were eliminated in the quarter-finals and group stages respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1930, Uruguay have played their home games at the Estadio Centenario in the Uruguayan capital Montevideo. The stadium was built as a celebration of the centenary of Uruguay's first constitution, and had a capacity of 90,000 when first fully opened.[13] The stadium hosted several matches in the 1930 World Cup, including the final, which was watched by a crowd of 93,000.[14] Crowds for Uruguay's home matches vary greatly depending on the importance of the match and the quality of the opposition. World Cup qualifying matches often attract crowds of between 50,000 and 73,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nUruguay's stadium Estadio Centenario is one of the biggest stadiums in the world over 100m wide and 100m long.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1901 and 1910, Uruguay wore a variety of different shirts during matches, including solid green and white tops, and even a shirt modeled from the Flag of Artigas. On 10 April 1910, now-defunct River Plate F.C. defeated Argentine team Alumni by 2ÿ1, being the first time an Uruguayan team beat legendary Alumni. That day River Plate wore its alternate jersey, a light blue one due to the home jersey was similar to Alumni's. Ricardo LeBas proposed Uruguay to wear a light blue jersey as a tribute to the victory of River Plate over Alumni. This was approved by president of the Uruguayan Association, Hctor G܇mez.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe red jersey that was used in some previous away strips was first used at the 1935 Copa Amrica, held in Santa Beatriz in Peru, which Uruguay won. It was not worn again (except for a 1962 FIFA World Cup match, against Colombia[16]) until 1991, when it was officially adopted as the away jersey.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour stars appear above the team logo on the jersey.

Stadium, thus winning the competition and earning their second World Cup title.","input":"What was the smallest country to win world cup?"},{"output":"the Blue Ridge Mountains","context":"Shenandoah National Park /???n?n?do??/ (often /???n?n?do??/) is a national park that encompasses part of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the U.S. state of Virginia. The park is long and narrow, with the broad Shenandoah River and Valley on the west side, and the rolling hills of the Virginia Piedmont on the east. Although the scenic Skyline Drive is likely the most prominent feature of the park, almost 40% of the land area 79,579 acres (124.342?sq?mi; 32,204?ha; 322.04?km2) has been designated as wilderness and is protected as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The highest peak is Hawksbill Mountain at 4,051 feet (1,235?m).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park encompasses parts of eight counties. On the west side of Skyline Drive they are, from northeast to southwest, Warren, Page, Rockingham, and Augusta counties. On the east side of Skyline Drive they are Rappahannock, Madison, Greene, and Albemarle counties. The park stretches for 105 miles (169?km) along Skyline Drive from near the town of Front Royal in the northeast to near the city of Waynesboro in the southwest. The park headquarters are located in Luray.\\r\\nShenandoah National Park lies along the Blue Ridge Mountains in north-central Virginia. These mountains form a distinct highland rising to elevations above 4,000 feet (1,200?m). Local topographic relief between the Blue Ridge Mountains and Shenandoah Valley exceeds 3,000 feet (910?m) at some locations. The crest of the range divides the Shenandoah River drainage basin, part of the Potomac River drainage, on the west side, from the James and Rappahannock River drainage basins on the east side.[3]\\r\\nSome of the rocks exposed in the park date to over one billion years in age, making them among the oldest in Virginia. Bedrock in the park includes Grenville-age granitic basement rocks (1.2ÿ1.0?billion years old) and a cover sequence of metamorphosed Neoproterozoic (570ÿ550?million years old) sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Swift Run and Catoctin formations. Columns of Catoctin Formation metamorphosed basalt can be seen at Compton Peak.[4] Clastic rocks of the Chilhowee Group are of early Cambrian age (542ÿ520?million years old). Quaternary surficial deposits are common and cover much of the bedrock throughout the park.[5][6]\\r\\nThe park is located along the western part of the Blue Ridge anticlinorium, a regional-scale Paleozoic structure at the eastern margin of the Appalachian fold and thrust belt. Rocks within the park were folded, faulted, distorted, and metamorphosed during the late Paleozoic Alleghanian orogeny (325 to 260 million years ago).[7] The rugged topography of Blue Ridge Mountains is a result of differential erosion during the Cenozoic, although some post-Paleozoic tectonic activity occurred in the region.[8][9]\\r\\nLegislation to create a national park in the Appalachian mountains was first introduced by new Virginia congressman Henry D. Flood in 1901, but despite the support of President Theodore Roosevelt, failed to pass. The first national park was Yellowstone, in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. It was signed into law in 1872. Yosemite National Park was created in 1890. When Congress created the National Park Service (NPS) in 1916, additional parks had maintained the western pattern (Crater Lake in 1902, Wind Cave in 1903, Mesa Verde in 1906, then Denali in 1917). Grand Canyon, Zion and Acadia were all created in 1919 during the administration of Virginia-born President Woodrow Wilson. Acadia finally broke the western mold, becoming the first eastern national park. It was also based on donations from wealthy private landowners. Stephen Mather, the first NPS director, saw a need for a national park in the southern states, and solicited proposals in his 1923 year-end report. In May 1925, Congress and President Calvin Coolidge authorized the NPS to acquire a minimum of 250,000 acres and maximum of 521,000 acres to form Shenandoah National Park, and also authorized creation of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. However, the legislation also required that no federal funds would be used to acquire the land. Thus, Virginia needed to raise private funds, and could also authorize state funds and use its eminent domain (condemnation) power to acquire the land to create Shenandoah National Park.\\r\\nVirginia's Democratic gubernatorial candidate (and the late Congressman Flood's nephew), Harry F. Byrd supported creation of Shenandoah National Park, as did his friend William E. Carson, a businessman who had become Virginia's first chairman of the Commission on Conservation and Development.[10][11] Development of the western national parks had assisted tourism, which produced jobs, which Byrd and local politicians supported. The land that became Shenandoah park was scenic, mountainous, and had also lost about half of its trees to the Chestnut blight (which was incurable and affected trees as they reached maturity). However, it had been held as private property for over a century, so many farms and orchards existed. After Byrd became governor and convinced the legislature to appropriate $1 million for land acquisition and other work, Carson and his teams (including surveyors and his brother Kit who was Byrd's law partner) tried to figure out who owned the land. They found that it consisted of more than 5,000 parcels, some of them inhabited by tenant farmers or squatters (who were ineligible to receive compensation). Some landowners, including wealthy resort owner George Freeman Pollock and Luray realtor and developer L. Ferdinand Zerkel, had long wanted the park created and had formed the Northern Virginia Park Association to win over the national park selection committee.[12][13] However, many local families who had lived in the area for generations (especially people over 60 years old) did not want to sell their land, and some refused to sell at any price. Carson promised that if they sold to the state, they could still live on their homesteads for the rest of their lives. Carson also lobbied the new President Herbert Hoover, who bought land to establish a vacation fishing camp near the headwaters of the Rapidan River (and would ultimately donate it to the park as he left office; it remains as Rapidan Camp).\\r\\nThe Commonwealth of Virginia slowly acquired the land through eminent domain, and then gave it to the U.S. federal government to establish the national park. Carson's brother suggested that Virginia's legislature authorize condemnation by counties (followed by arbitration for individual parcels) rather than condemn each parcel. Some families accepted the payments because they needed the money and wanted to escape the subsistence lifestyle. Nearly 90% of the inhabitants worked the land for a living: selling timber, charcoal or crops. They had previously been able to earn money to buy supplies by harvesting the now-rare chestnuts, by working during the apple and peach harvest season (but the drought of 1930 devastated those crops and killed many fruit trees), by selling handmade textiles and crafts (displaced by factories) and moonshine (illegal after Prohibition started).\\r\\nHowever, Carson and the politicians did not seek citizen input early in the process, nor convince residents that they could live better in a tourist economy. Instead they started with an advertising campaign to raise the funds, and courthouse property evaluations and surveys. Upon Mather's death in 1929, the new NPS director, Horace M. Albright also decided that the federal agency would only accept vacant land, so even elderly residents would be forced to leave. Thus, many families and entire communities were forced to vacate portions of the Blue Ridge Mountains in eight Virginia counties. Although the Skyline Drive right-of-way was purchased from owners without condemnation, the costs of the acreage purchased trebled over initial estimates and the acreage decreased to what Carson called a \\"fish-bone\\" shape and others a \\"shoestring\\".[14] Although Byrd and Carson convinced Congress to reduce the minimum size of Shenandoah Park to just over 160,000 acres to eliminate some high-priced lands, in 1933 newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt decided to also create the Blue Ridge Parkway to connect to then-under-construction Skyline Drive on the Shenandoah National Park ridgeline, which required additional condemnations.\\r\\nWhen many families continued to refuse to sell their land in 1932 and 1933, proponents changed tactics. Freeman hired social worker Miriam Sizer to teach at a summer school he had set up near one of his workers' communities, and asked her to write a report about the conditions in which they lived. Although later discredited, it depicted the local population as very poor and inbred, and was soon used to support forcible evictions and burning of former cabins so residents would not sneak back. University of Chicago sociologists Fay-Cooper Cole and Mandel Sherman described how the small valley communities or hollows had existed \\"without contact with law or government\\" for centuries, which some analogized to a popular comic strip Lil Abner and his fictional community Dogpatch. In 1933, Sherman and journalist Thomas Henry published Hollow Folk[15] drawing pitying eyes to local conditions and \\"hillbillies.\\"[16][17][18] As in many rural areas of the time, most remote homesteads in the Shenandoah lacked electricity and often running water, as well as access to schools and health facilities during many months. However, Hoover had hired experienced rural teacher Christine Vest to teach near his summer home (and who believed the other reports exaggerated, as did Episcopal missionary teachers in other Blue Ridge areas).[19]\\r\\nCarson had had ambitions to become governor in 1929 and 1933, but Byrd instead selected George C. Peery of the state's southwest corner to succeed easterner Pollard.[20] After winning election, Peery and Carson's successor would establish Virginia's state park system, although plans to relocate reluctant residents kept changing and basically failed. Carson had hoped to head that new state agency, but was not selected because of his growing differences with Byrd, over fees owed his brother and especially over the evictions that began in late 1933 against his advice but pursuant to new federal policies and that garnered much negative publicity.\\r\\nMost of the reluctant families came from the park's central counties (Madison, Page, and Rappahannock), not the northern counties nearest Byrd's and Carson's bases, nor from the southern end where residents could see tourism's benefits at Thomas Jefferson's Monticello since the 1920s, as well as the jobs available in the Shenandoah and new Blue Ridge projects. In 1931 and 1932, residents were allowed to petition the state agency to stay another year to gather crops, etc. However, some refused to cooperate to any extent, others wanted to continue to use resources now protected (including timber or homes and gardens vacated by others), and many found the permit process arbitrary. Businessman Robert H. Via filed suit against the condemnations in 1934 but did not prevail (and ended up moving to Pennsylvania and never cashed his condemnation check).\\r\\nCarson announced his resignation from his unpaid job effective in December 1934. As one of his final acts, Carson wrote the new NPS director, Arno B. Cammerer, urging that 60 people over 60 years old whose plots were far and not visible from the new Skyline Drive not be evicted. When evictions kept creating negative publicity in 1935, photographer Arthur Rothstein coordinated with the Hollow Folk authors and then went to document the conditions they claimed.[16]\\r\\nCreation of the park had immediate benefits to some Virginians. During the Great Depression, many young men received training and jobs through the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The first CCC camp in Virginia was established in the George Washington National Forest near Luray, and Governor Pollard quickly filled his initial quota of 5,000 workers. About 1,000 men and boys worked on Skyline Drive, and about 100,000 worked in Virginia during the agency's existence.[21][22] In Shenandoah Park, CCC crews removed many of the dead chestnut trees whose skeletons marred views in the new park, as well as constructed trails and facilities. Tourism revenues also skyrocketed. On the other hand, CCC crews were also assigned to burn and destroy some cabins in the park, to prevent residents from coming back. Also, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes who had jurisdiction over the NPS and partial jurisdiction over the CCC, tried to use his authority to force Byrd to cooperate on other New Deal projects.\\r\\nShenandoah National Park was finally established on December 26, 1935, and soon construction began on the Blue Ridge Parkway that Byrd wanted.[23] President Franklin Delano Roosevelt formally opened Shenandoah National Park on July 3, 1936. Eventually, about 40 people (on the \\"Ickes list\\") were allowed to live out their lives on land that became the park. One of them was George Freeman Pollock, whose residence Killahevlin was later listed on the National Register, and whose Skyland Resort reopened under a concessionaire in 1937. Carson also donated significant land; a mountain in the park is now named in his honor and signs acknowledge his contributions. The last grandmothered resident was Annie Lee Bradley Shenk. NPS employees had watched and cared for her since 1950; she died in 1979 at age 92. Most others left quietly. 85-year-old Hezekiah Lam explained, \\"I ain't so crazy about leavin' these hills but I never believed in bein' ag'in (against) the Government. I signed everythin' they asked me.\\"[24]\\r\\nIn the early 1930s, the National Park Service began planning the park facilities and envisioned separate provisions for blacks and whites. At that time, in Jim Crow Virginia, racial segregation was the order of the day. In its transfer of the parkland to the federal government, Virginia initially attempted to ban African Americans entirely from the park, but settled for enforcing its segregation laws in the park's facilities.[25]\\r\\nBy the 1930s, there were several concessions operated by private firms within the area that would become the park, some going back to the late 19th century. These early private facilities at Skyland Resort, Panorama Resort, and Swift Run Gap were operated only for whites. By 1937, the Park Service accepted a bid from Virginia Sky-Line Company to take over the existing facilities and add new lodges, cabins, and other amenities, including Big Meadows Lodge. Under their plan, all the sites in the parks, save one, were for \\"whites only\\". Their plan included a separate facility for African Americans at Lewis Mountaina picnic ground, a smaller lodge, cabins and a campground. The site opened in 1939, and it was substantially inferior to the other park facilities. By then, however, the Interior Department was increasingly anxious to eliminate segregation from all parks. Pinnacles picnic ground was selected to be the initial integrated site in the Shenandoah, but Virginia Sky-Line Company continued to balk, and distributed maps showing Lewis Mountain as the only site for African Americans. During World War II, concessions closed and park usage plunged. But once the War ended, in December 1945, the NPS mandated that all concessions in all national parks were to be desegregated. In October 1947 the dining rooms of Lewis Mountain and Panorama were integrated and by early 1950, the mandate was fully accomplished.[25]\\r\\nParticularly after the 1960s, park operations broadened from nature-focused to include social history. The Potomac Appalachian Trail Club had restored some cabins beginning in the 1940s, and made them available to overnight hikers. Some displaced residents (and their descendants) created the Children of the Shenandoah to lobby for more balanced presentations.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, the park hired cultural resource specialists and conducted an archeological inventory of existing structures, the Survey of Rural Mountain Settlement. Eventually, the park's new focus on cultural resources coincided with agitation from a descendant's organization known as the Children of Shenandoah, which resulted in the removal of questionable interpretive displays. Hikes and tours that explained the social history of the displaced mountain people began.[17]\\r\\nThe park is best known for Skyline Drive, a 105-mile (169?km) road that runs the length of the park along the ridge of the mountains. The drive is more commonly visited in the fall when the leaves are changing colors.[citation needed] 101 miles (163?km) of the Appalachian Trail are also in the park. In total, there are over 500 miles (800?km) of trails within the park. Of the trails, one of the most popular is Old Rag Mountain.[citation needed] There is also horseback riding, camping, bicycling, and a number of waterfalls. The Skyline Drive is the first National Park Service road east of the Mississippi River listed as a National Historic Landmark on the National Register of Historic Places. It is also designated as a National Scenic Byway.\\r\\nShenandoah National Park offers 196,000 acres (790?km2) of backcountry and wilderness camping. While in the backcountry, campers must use a \\"Leave No Trace\\" policy that includes burying excrement and not building campfires.[26]\\r\\nBackcountry campers must also be careful of wildlife such as bears and venomous snakes. Campers must suspend their food from trees while not in use in \\"bear bags\\" or park-approved bear canisters to prevent unintentionally feeding the bears, who then become habituated to humans and their food and therefore dangerous. All animals are protected by federal law.\\r\\nMost of the campgrounds are open from April to OctoberÿNovember. There are five major campgrounds:[27]\\r\\nThere are three lodges/cabins:[28]\\r\\nLodges are located at Skyland and Big Meadows. The park's Harry F. Byrd Visitor Center is also located at Big Meadows. Another visitor center is located at Dickey Ridge. Campgrounds are located at Mathews Arm, Big Meadows, Lewis Mountain, and Loft Mountain.\\r\\nRapidan Camp, the restored presidential fishing retreat Herbert Hoover built on the Rapidan River in 1929, is accessed by a 4.1-mile (6.6?km) round-trip hike on Mill Prong Trail, which begins on the Skyline Drive at Milam Gap (Mile 52.8). The NPS also offers guided van trips that leave from the Byrd Center at Big Meadows.\\r\\nShenandoah National Park is one of the most dog-friendly in the national park system. The campgrounds all allow dogs, and dogs are allowed on almost all of the trails including the Appalachian Trail, if kept on leash (6 feet or shorter). Dogs are not allowed on ten trails: Fox Hollow Trail, Stony Man Trail, Limberlost Trail, Post Office Junction to Old Rag Shelter, Old Rag Ridge Trail, Old Rag Saddle Trail, Dark Hollow Falls Trail, Story of the Forest Trail, Bearfence Mountain Trail, Frazier Discovery Trail. These ten trails fall short of a total of 20 miles of the 500 miles of trails of the Shenandoah National Park. [29]\\r\\nStreams and rivers in the park are very popular with fly fisherman for native brook trout.[30]\\r\\nMany waterfalls are located within the park boundaries. Below is a list of significant falls.[31]\\r\\nWhiteoak Canyon.\\r\\nRose River Falls.\\r\\nSouth River Falls.\\r\\nDark Hollow Falls.\\r\\nJones Run Falls.\\r\\nBeginning at mile 50.7 of the Skyline Drive near the Byrd Visitor Center, Dark Hollow Falls Trail leads downhill beside Hogcamp Branch to Dark Hollow Falls, a 70-foot cascade. The distance from the trailhead to the base of the falls is 0.7 mile, although the trail continues beyond that point, crossing the creek and connecting with the Rose River fire road.[32] Various fauna can be viewed along the trail, including occasional sightings of black bear and timber rattlesnake.[33] While the trail is relatively short, parts of it are steep and may prove challenging to some visitors. There is no view from the brink of the falls, and slippery rocks make it inadvisable to leave the trail.[32]\\r\\nDark Hollow Falls\\r\\nWildlife at Dark Hollow\\r\\nHogcamp Branch above the Dark Hollow Falls\\r\\nThe trail leading to the Dark Hollow Falls\\r\\nThe climate of the park, and in turn also its flora and fauna, is largely typical for mountainous regions of the eastern Mid-Atlantic woodland, and indeed a large portion of common species are typical of ecosystems at lower altitudes as well. On southwestern faces of some of the southernmost hillsides pine predominates and there is also the occasional prickly pear cactus, which grows naturally. In contrast, some of the northeastern aspects are most likely to have small but dense stands of moisture loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance. Other commonly found plants include oak, hickory, chestnut, maple, tulip poplar, mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. The once predominant American chestnut tree was effectively brought to extinction by a fungus known as the chestnut blight during the 1930s ÿ though the tree continues to grow in the park, it does not reach maturity and dies back before it can reproduce. Various species of oaks superseded the chestnuts and became the dominant tree species. Gypsy moth infestations beginning in the early 1990s began to erode the dominance of the oak forests as the moths would primarily consume the leaves of oak trees. Though the Gypsy moths seem to have abated some, they continue to affect the forest and have destroyed almost 10 percent of the oak groves.[34]\\r\\nMammals include black bear, coyote,[35] striped skunk, spotted skunk, raccoon, beaver, river otter, opossum, woodchuck, two species of foxes, white-tailed deer, and eastern cottontail rabbit. Though unsubstantiated, there have been some reported sightings of cougar in remote areas of the park.[36] Over 200 species of birds make their home in the park for at least part of the year. About thirty live in the park year round, including the barred owl, Carolina chickadee, red-tailed hawk, and wild turkey. The peregrine falcon was reintroduced into the park in the mid-1990s and by the end of the 20th century there were numerous nesting pairs in the park.[37] Thirty-two species of fish have been documented in the park, including brook trout, longnose and eastern blacknose dace, and the bluehead chub.[38]\\r\\nPark rangers organize several programs from spring to fall. These include ranger-led hikes, as well as discussions of the history, flora, and fauna.[39]\\r\\nIn 2014, under the leadership of Superintendent Jim Northup, Shenandoah National Park established an Artist-in-Residence Program that is administered by the Shenandoah National Park Trust, the park's philanthropic partner.[40] Photographer Sandy Long was selected as the park's first artist-in-residence.[41][42] The results of Long's residency were featured in the photography exhibit \\"Wild Beauty: The Artful Nature of Shenandoah National Park\\"[43] held at the Looking Glass Art Gallery in the historic Hawley Silk Mill, in Hawley, Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\"A Guide to the Shenandoah Valley Oral History Project, 2005ÿ2006\\".?","input":"Where is shenandoah national park located in virginia?"},{"output":"?-ton","context":"Truck Classifications are typically based upon the maximum loaded weight of the truck (typically using the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) and sometimes also the gross trailer weight rating (GTWR)), and can vary among jurisdictions.\\r\\nIn the United States, commercial truck classification is determined based on the vehicle's gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). The classes range from 1ÿ8.[1][2] Trucks are also classified more broadly by the Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), which groups classes 1ÿ3 as light duty, 4ÿ6 as medium duty, and 7ÿ8 as heavy duty.[1][3][4][5] The United States Environmental Protection Agency has a separate system of emissions classifications for trucks.[1][6] The United States Census Bureau also assigned classifications in its now-discontinued Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey (VIUS) (formerly Truck Inventory and Use Survey (TIUS)).[7]\\r\\nClass 2 is subdivided into Class 2a (?-ton) and Class 2b (?-ton), with class 2a being 6,001ÿ8,500 pounds (2,722ÿ3,856?kg), and class 2b being 8,501ÿ10,000 pounds (3,856ÿ4,536?kg). Examples of vehicles in Class 2b include the Ram 2500, Chevrolet Silverado 2500, and the Ford F-250. SUVs in Class 2b include the Ford Excursion and the Chevrolet Suburban 2500. Class 2a is commonly referred to as a light duty truck, with class 2b being the lowest heavy-duty class, also called the light heavy-duty class.[9][18][19]\\r\\nWhen light-duty trucks were first produced in the United States, they were rated by their payload capacity in tons (e.g., ?-, ?- and 1-ton). Over time, payload capacities for most domestic pickup trucks have increased while the ton titles have stayed the same. The now-imprecise ton rating is presently used to compare standard sizes, rather than actual capacities.\\r\\nThis has led to categorizing trucks similarly, even if their payload is different. Therefore, the Toyota Tacoma, Dodge Dakota, Ford Ranger, Honda Ridgeline, Chevrolet S-10, GMC S-15are called quarter-tons (?-ton). The Ford F-150, Chevrolet C10/K10, Chevrolet/GMC 1500, and Dodge 1500 are half-tons (?-ton). The Ford F-250, Chevrolet C20/K20, Chevrolet/GMC 2500, and Dodge 2500 are three-quarter-tons (?-ton). Chevrolet/GMC's ?-ton suspension systems were further divided into light and heavy-duty, differentiated by 5-lug and 6 or 8-lug wheel hubs depending on year, respectively. The Ford F-350, Chevrolet C30/K30, Chevrolet/GMC 3500, and Dodge 3500 are one tons (1-ton).\\r\\nSimilar schemes exist for vans and SUVs (e.g. a 1-ton Dodge Van or a ?-ton GMC Suburban), medium duty trucks (e.g. the Ford 1?-ton F-450) and some military vehicles, like the ubiquitous deuce-and-a-half.\\r\\nVehicles in Class 7 and above require a Class-B commercial driver's license (CDL) to operate in the United States.\\r\\nThe Class 8 truck gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) is a vehicle with a GVWR exceeding 33000 lb (14969 kg).[1][20] These include tractor trailer tractors as well as single-unit dump trucks of a GVWR over 33,000 lb; such trucks typically have 3 or more axles. The typical 5-axle tractor-trailer combination, also called a \\"semi\\" or \\"18-wheeler\\", is a Class 8 vehicle. Standard trailers vary in length from 8' containers to 57' van trailers, with the most common length being the 53' trailer. Specialized trailers for oversized loads can be considerably longer. Commercial operation of a Class 8 vehicle in the United States requires either a Class-B CDL for non-combination vehicles, or a Class-A CDL for combination vehicles (tractor-trailers).\\r\\nThe practical gross vehicle weight limit in the USA for Class 8 trucks is determined by per-axle weight limits set by the Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula on interstate highways. Longer 18-wheelers can weigh up to 80,000 lbs. In most states, exceptions to these limits can be made for an Oversize load but they require special permits and handling on a designated route.\\r\\nUsually classifies a heavy, special duty Class 8 truck.

The city was built on the Euphrates river and divided in equal parts along its left and right banks, with steep embankments to contain the river's seasonal floods. Babylon was originally a small Akkadian town dating from the period of the Akkadian Empire c.?2300 BC.\\r\\nThe town became part of a small independent city-state with the rise of the First Amorite Babylonian Dynasty in the nineteenth century BC. After the Amorite king Hammurabi created a short-lived empire in the 18th century BC, he built Babylon up into a major city and declared himself its king, and southern Mesopotamia became known as Babylonia and Babylon eclipsed Nippur as its holy city. The empire waned under Hammurabi's son Samsu-iluna and Babylon spent long periods under Assyrian, Kassite and Elamite domination. After being destroyed and then rebuilt by the Assyrians, Babylon became the capital of the short lived Neo-Babylonian Empire from 609 to 539?BC. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, although a number of scholars believe these were actually in the Assyrian capital of Nineveh. After the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the city came under the rule of the Achaemenid, Seleucid, Parthian, Roman, and Sassanid empires.\\r\\nIt has been estimated that Babylon was the largest city in the world from c.?1770?ÿ c.?1670?BC, and again between c.?612?ÿ c.?320?BC. It was perhaps the first city to reach a population above 200,000.[2] Estimates for the maximum extent of its area range from 890[3] to 900 hectares (2,200 acres).[4]\\r\\nThe remains of the city are in present-day Hillah, Babil Governorate, Iraq, about 85 kilometres (53?mi) south of Baghdad, comprising a large tell of broken mud-brick buildings and debris.\\r\\nThe main sources of information about Babylonexcavation of the site itself, references in cuneiform texts found elsewhere in Mesopotamia, references in the Bible, descriptions in classical writing (especially by Herodotus), and second-hand descriptions (citing the work of Ctesias and Berossus)present an incomplete and sometimes contradictory picture of the ancient city even at its peak in the sixth century BC.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English Babylon comes from Greek Babyl?n (ϫ?), a transliteration of the Akkadian Bbilim.[6]\\r\\nThe Babylonian name in the early 2nd millennium BC had been Babilli or Babilla, long thought to mean \\"gate of god\\" (Bab-Ili).[7] Archibald Sayce and others considered \\"Babili\\" as the translation of a Sumerian or Persian name \\"Ca-dimirra\\", meaning gate of god,[8][9] based on the characters KAN4 DI?IR.RAKI (corresponding to the Sumerian phrase kan di?irak \\"god's gate\\") or perhaps based on other characters.[10]\\r\\nThe \\"gate of god\\" translation is increasingly viewed as a folk etymology to explain an unknown original non-Semitic placename.[11] Linguist I.J. Gelb suggested in 1955 that the name Babil is in reference to an earlier city name,[12] and Joan Oates claims in her book Babylon that the rendering Gateway of the gods is no longer accepted by modern scholars. The name \\"Babil\\" could derive from \\"Bawer\\" located by Ernst Herzfeld in Ancient Iran. David Rohl holds that the original Babylon is to be identified with Eridu.\\r\\nIn the Bible, the name appears as Babel (Hebrew: ???????, Bavel, Tib.???????, Bvel; Classical Syriac: ????, Bwl), interpreted in the Hebrew Scriptures' Book of Genesis to mean \\"confusion\\",[13] from the verb bilbl (????, \\"to confuse\\").[14] The modern English verb, to \\"babble\\", or to speak meaningless words, is popularly thought to derive from this name, but there is no direct connection.[15]\\r\\nAncient records in some situations use Babylon as a name for other cities, including cities like Borsippa within Babylon's sphere of influence, and Nineveh for a short period after the Assyrian sack of Babylon.[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remains of the city are in present-day Hillah,[9] Babil Governorate, Iraq, about 85 kilometers (53?mi) south of Baghdad, comprising a large tell of broken mud-brick buildings and debris. The site at Babylon consists of a number of mounds covering an area of about 2 by 1 kilometer (1.24?mi G?0.62?mi), oriented north to south,[citation needed] along the Euphrates to the west. Originally, the river roughly bisected the city, but the course of the river has since shifted so that most of the remains of the former western part of the city are now inundated. Some portions of the city wall to the west of the river also remain.\\r\\nOnly a small portion of the ancient city (3% of the area within the inner walls; 1.5% of the area within the outer walls; 0.05% at the depth of Middle and Old Babylon) has been excavated.[18] Known remains include:\\r\\nArchaeologists have recovered few artifacts predating the Neo-Babylonian period. The water table in the region has risen greatly over the centuries and artifacts from the time before the Neo-Babylonian Empire are unavailable to current standard archaeological methods. Additionally, the Neo-Babylonians conducted significant rebuilding projects in the city, which destroyed or obscured much of the earlier record. Babylon was pillaged numerous times after revolting against foreign rule, most notably by the Hittites and Elamites in the 2nd millennium, then by the Neo-Assyrian Empire and the Achaemenid Empire in the 1st millennium. Much of the western half of the city is now beneath the river, and other parts of the site have been mined for commercial building materials.\\r\\nOnly the Koldewey expedition recovered artifacts from the Old Babylonian period. These included 967 clay tablets, stored in private houses, with Sumerian literature and lexical documents.[18]\\r\\nNearby ancient settlements are Kish, Borsippa, Dilbat, and Kutha. Marad and Sippar were 60?km in either direction along the Euphrates.[18]\\r\\nHistorical knowledge of early Babylon must be pieced together from epigraphic remains found elsewhere, such as at Uruk, Nippur, and Haradum.\\r\\nInformation on the Neo-Babylonian city is available from archaeological excavations and from classical sources. Babylon was described, perhaps even visited, by a number of classical historians including Ctesias, Herodotus, Quintus Curtius Rufus, Strabo, and Cleitarchus. These reports are of variable accuracy and some of the content was politically motivated, but these still provide useful information.[19]\\r\\nReferences to the city of Babylon can be found in Akkadian and Sumerian literature from the late third millennium BC. One of the earliest is a tablet describing the Akkadian king ?ar-kali-?arri laying the foundations in Babylon of new temples for Annn??tum and Ilaba. Babylon also appears in the administrative records of the Third Dynasty of Ur, which collected in-kind tax payments and appointed an ensi as local governor.[12][20]\\r\\nThe so-called Weidner Chronicle (also known as ABC 19) states that Sargon of Akkad (c.?23d century BC in the short chronology) had built Babylon \\"in front of Akkad\\" (ABC 19:51). A later chronicle states that Sargon \\"dug up the dirt of the pit of Babylon, and made a counterpart of Babylon next to Akkad\\". (ABC 20:18ÿ19). Van de Mieroop has suggested that those sources may refer to the much later Assyrian king Sargon II of the Neo-Assyrian Empire rather than Sargon of Akkad.[17]\\r\\nThe Book of Genesis, chapter 10, claims that king Nimrod founded Babel, Uruk, and Akkad.\\r\\nCtesias, quoted by Diodorus Siculus and in George Syncellus's Chronographia, claimed to have access to manuscripts from Babylonian archives, which date the founding of Babylon to 2286?BC, under the reign of its first king, Belus.[21] A similar figure is found in the writings of Berossus, who according to Pliny,[22] stated that astronomical observations commenced at Babylon 490?years before the Greek era of Phoroneus, indicating 2243?BC. Stephanus of Byzantium wrote that Babylon was built 1002?years before the date given by Hellanicus of Lesbos for the siege of Troy (1229?BC), which would date Babylon's foundation to 2231?BC.[23] All of these dates place Babylon's foundation in the 23rd century BC; however, cuneiform records have not been found to correspond with these classical (post-cuneiform) accounts.\\r\\nBy around the 19th century BC, much of southern Mesopotamia was occupied by Amorites, nomadic tribes from the northern Levant who were Northwest Semitic speakers, unlike the native Akkadians of southern Mesopotamia and Assyria, who spoke East Semitic. The Amorites at first did not practice agriculture like more advanced Mesopotamians, preferring a semi-nomadic lifestyle, herding sheep. Over time, Amorite grain merchants rose to prominence and established their own independent dynasties in several south Mesopotamian city-states, most notably Isin, Larsa, Eshnunna, Lagash, and later, founding Babylon as a state.\\r\\nAccording to a Babylonian date list, Amorite[a] rule in Babylon began (c.?19th or 18th century BC) with a chieftain named Sumu-abum, who declared independence from the neighboring city-state of Kazallu. Sumu-la-El, whose dates may be concurrent with those of Sumu-abum, is usually given as the progenitor of the First Babylonian Dynasty. Both are credited with building the walls of Babylon. In any case, the records describe Sumu-la-Els military successes establishing a regional sphere of influence for Babylon. [25]\\r\\nBabylon was initially a minor city-state, and controlled little surrounding territory; its first four Amorite rulers did not assume the title of king. The older and more powerful states of Assyria, Elam, Isin and Larsa overshadowed Babylon until it became the capital of Hammurabi's short lived empire about a century later. Hammurabi (r. 1792ÿ1750?BC) is famous for codifying the laws of Babylonia into the Code of Hammurabi. He conquered all of the cities and city states of southern Mesopotamia, including Isin, Larsa, Ur, Uruk, Nippur, Lagash, Eridu, Kish, Adab, Eshnunna, Akshak, Akkad, Shuruppak, Bad-tibira, Sippar and Girsu, coalescing them into one kingdom, ruled from Babylon. Hammurabi also invaded and conquered Elam to the east, and the kingdoms of Mari and Ebla to the north west. After a protracted struggle with the powerful Assyrian king Ishme-Dagan of the Old Assyrian Empire, he forced his successor to pay tribute late in his reign, spreading Babylonian power to Assyria's Hattian and Hurrian colonies in Asia Minor.\\r\\nAfter the reign of Hammurabi, the whole of southern Mesopotamia came to be known as Babylonia, whereas the north had already coalesced centuries before into Assyria. From this time, Babylon supplanted Nippur and Eridu as the major religious centers of southern Mesopotamia. Hammurabi's empire destabilized after his death. Assyrians defeated and drove out the Babylonians and Amorites. The far south of Mesopotamia broke away, forming the native Sealand Dynasty, and the Elamites appropriated territory in eastern Mesopotamia. The Amorite dynasty remained in power in Babylon, which again became a small city state.\\r\\nTexts from Old Babylon often include references to Shamash, the sun-god of Sippar, treated as a supreme deity, and Marduk, considered as his son. Marduk was later elevated to a higher status and Shamash lowered, perhaps reflecting Babylons rising political power[12]\\r\\nIn 1595?BC[b] the city was overthrown by the Hittite Empire from Asia Minor. Thereafter, Kassites from the Zagros Mountains of north western Ancient Iran captured Babylon, ushering in a dynasty that lasted for 435?years, until 1160?BC. The city was renamed Karanduniash during this period. Kassite Babylon eventually became subject to the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365ÿ1053 BC) to the north, and Elam to the east, with both powers vying for control of the city. The Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I took the throne of Babylon in 1235?BC.\\r\\nBy 1155?BC, after continued attacks and annexing of territory by the Assyrians and Elamites, the Kassites were deposed in Babylon. An Akkadian south Mesopotamian dynasty then ruled for the first time. However, Babylon remained weak and subject to domination by Assyria. Its ineffectual native kings were unable to prevent new waves of foreign West Semitic settlers from the deserts of the Levant, including the Arameans and Suteans in the 11th century BC, and finally the Chaldeans in the 9th century BC, entering and appropriating areas of Babylonia for themselves. The Arameans briefly ruled in Babylon during the late 11th century BC.\\r\\nDuring the rule of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911ÿ609?BC), Babylonia was under constant Assyrian domination or direct control. During the reign of Sennacherib of Assyria, Babylonia was in a constant state of revolt, led by a chieftain named Merodach-Baladan, in alliance with the Elamites, and suppressed only by the complete destruction of the city of Babylon. In 689?BC, its walls, temples and palaces were razed, and the rubble was thrown into the Arakhtu, the sea bordering the earlier Babylon on the south. Destruction of the religious center shocked many, and the subsequent murder of Sennacherib by two of his own sons while praying to the god Nisroch was considered an act of atonement. Consequently, his successor Esarhaddon hastened to rebuild the old city and make it his residence during part of the year. After his death, Babylonia was governed by his elder son, the Assyrian prince Shamash-shum-ukin, who eventually started a civil war in 652?BC against his own brother, Ashurbanipal, who ruled in Nineveh. Shamash-shum-ukin enlisted the help of other peoples subject to Assyria, including Elam, Persia, Chaldeans and Suteans of southern Mesopotamia, and the Canaanites and Arabs dwelling in the deserts south of Mesopotamia.\\r\\nOnce again, Babylon was besieged by the Assyrians, starved into surrender and its allies were defeated. Ashurbanipal celebrated a \\"service of reconciliation\\", but did not venture to \\"take the hands\\" of Bel. An Assyrian governor named Kandalanu was appointed as ruler of the city. Ashurbanipal did collect texts from Babylon for inclusion in his extensive library at Ninevah.[18]\\r\\nAfter the death of Ashurbanipal, the Assyrian empire destabilized due to a series of internal civil wars throughout the reigns of Assyrian kings Ashur-etil-ilani, Sin-shumu-lishir and Sinsharishkun. Eventually Babylon, like many other parts of the near east, took advantage of the anarchy within Assyria to free itself from Assyrian rule. In the subsequent overthrow of the Assyrian Empire by an alliance of peoples, the Babylonians saw another example of divine vengeance.[26]\\r\\nUnder Nabopolassar, a previously unknown Chaldean chieftain, Babylon escaped Assyrian rule, and in an alliance with Cyaxares, king of the Medes and Persians together with the Scythians and Cimmerians, finally destroyed the Assyrian Empire between 612 BC and 605 BC. Babylon thus became the capital of the Neo-Babylonian (sometimes and possibly erroneously called the Chaldean) Empire.[28][29][30]\\r\\nWith the recovery of Babylonian independence, a new era of architectural activity ensued, particularly during the reign of his son Nebuchadnezzar II (604ÿ561?BC).[31] Nebuchadnezzar ordered the complete reconstruction of the imperial grounds, including the Etemenanki ziggurat, and the construction of the Ishtar Gatethe most prominent of eight gates around Babylon. A reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate is located in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.\\r\\nNebuchadnezzar is also credited with the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylonone of the seven wonders of the ancient worldsaid to have been built for his homesick wife Amyitis. Whether the gardens actually existed is a matter of dispute. German archaeologist Robert Koldewey speculated that he had discovered its foundations, but many historians disagree about the location. Stephanie Dalley has argued that the hanging gardens were actually located in the Assyrian capital, Nineveh.[32]\\r\\nNebuchandnezzar is also notoriously associated with the Babylonian exile of the Jews, the result of an imperial technique of pacification, used also by the Assyrians, in which ethnic groups in conquered areas were deported en masse to the capital.[33]\\r\\nChaldean rule of Babylon did not last long; it is not clear whether Neriglissar and Labashi-Marduk were Chaldeans or native Babylonians, and the last ruler Nabonidus (556ÿ539 BC) and his co-regent son Belshazzar were Assyrians from Harran.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 539?BC, the Neo-Babylonian Empire fell to Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, with a military engagement known as the Battle of Opis. Babylon's walls were considered impenetrable. The only way into the city was through one of its many gates or through the Euphrates River. Metal grates were installed underwater, allowing the river to flow through the city walls while preventing intrusion. The Persians devised a plan to enter the city via the river. During a Babylonian national feast, Cyrus' troops diverted the Euphrates River upstream, allowing Cyrus' soldiers to enter the city through the lowered water. The Persian army conquered the outlying areas of the city while the majority of Babylonians at the city center were unaware of the breach. The account was elaborated upon by Herodotus[34][19] and is also mentioned in parts of the Hebrew Bible.[35][36]\\r\\n(Herodotus also described a moat, an enormously tall and broad wall cemented with bitumen and with buildings on top, and a hundred gates to the city. He also writes that the Babylonians wear turbans and perfume and bury their dead in honey, that they practice ritual prostitution, and that three tribes among them eat nothing but fish. The hundred gates can be considered a reference to Homer, and following the pronouncement of Archibald Henry Sayce in 1883, Herodotuss account of Babylon has largely been considered to represent Greek folklore rather than an authentic voyage to Babylon. Dalley and others have recently suggested taking Herodotuss account seriously again.)[34][37]\\r\\nAccording to 2 Chronicles 36 of the Hebrew Bible, Cyrus later issued a decree permitting captive people, including the Jews, to return to their own lands. Text found on the Cyrus Cylinder has traditionally been seen by biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of this policy, although the interpretation is disputed because the text only identifies Mesopotamian sanctuaries but makes no mention of Jews, Jerusalem, or Judea.\\r\\nUnder Cyrus and the subsequent Persian king Darius I, Babylon became the capital city of the 9th Satrapy (Babylonia in the south and Athura in the north), as well as a center of learning and scientific advancement. In Achaemenid Persia, the ancient Babylonian arts of astronomy and mathematics were revitalized, and Babylonian scholars completed maps of constellations. The city became the administrative capital of the Persian Empire and remained prominent for over two centuries. Many important archaeological discoveries have been made that can provide a better understanding of that era.[38][39]\\r\\nThe early Persian kings had attempted to maintain the religious ceremonies of Marduk, but by the reign of Darius III, over-taxation and the strain of numerous wars led to a deterioration of Babylon's main shrines and canals, and the destabilization of the surrounding region. There were numerous attempts at rebellion and in 522?BC (Nebuchadnezzar III), 521?BC (Nebuchadnezzar IV) and 482?BC (Bel-shimani and Shamash-eriba) native Babylonian kings briefly regained independence. However these revolts were quickly repressed and Babylon remained under Persian rule for two centuries, until Alexander the Great's entry in 331?BC.\\r\\nIn October of 331?BC, Darius III, the last Achaemenid king of the Persian Empire, was defeated by the forces of the Ancient Macedonian Greek ruler Alexander the Great at the Battle of Gaugamela. A native account of this invasion notes a ruling by Alexander not to enter the homes of its inhabitants.[40]\\r\\nUnder Alexander, Babylon again flourished as a center of learning and commerce. However, following Alexander's death in 323?BC in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar, his empire was divided amongst his generals, the Diadochi, and decades of fighting soon began. The constant turmoil virtually emptied the city of Babylon. A tablet dated 275?BC states that the inhabitants of Babylon were transported to Seleucia, where a palace and a temple (Esagila) were built. With this deportation, Babylon became insignificant as a city, although more than a century later, sacrifices were still performed in its old sanctuary.[41]\\r\\nUnder the Parthian and Sassanid Empires, Babylon (like Assyria) became a province of these Persian Empires for nine centuries, until after AD?650. It maintained its own culture and people, who spoke varieties of Aramaic, and who continued to refer to their homeland as Babylon. Examples of their culture are found in the Babylonian Talmud, the Gnostic Mandaean religion, Eastern Rite Christianity and the religion of the prophet Mani. Christianity was introduced to Mesopotamia in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, and Babylon was the seat of a Bishop of the Church of the East until well after the Arab/Islamic conquest.\\r\\nIn the mid-7th century, Mesopotamia was invaded and settled by the expanding Muslim Empire, and a period of Islamization followed. Babylon was dissolved as a province and Aramaic and Church of the East Christianity eventually became marginalized. Ibn Hauqal mentions a small village called Babel in the tenth century; subsequent travelers describe only ruins.[42]\\r\\nBabylon is mentioned in medieval Arabic writings as a source of bricks,[18] said to have been used in cities from Baghdad to Basra.[43]\\r\\nEuropean travelers in many cases could not discover the city's location, or mistook Fallujah for it. Twelfth-century traveler Benjamin of Tudela mentions Babylon but its not clear if he really went there. Others referred to Baghdad as Babylon or New Babylon and described various structures encountered in the region as the Tower of Babel.[44] Pietro della Valle found the ancient site in the seventeenth century and noted the existence of both baked and dried mudbricks cemented with bitumen.[43]\\r\\nThe eighteenth century saw an increasing flow of travelers to Babylon, including Carsten Niebuhr and Pierre-Joseph de Beauchamp, as well as measurements of its latitude. Beauchamps memoir, published in English translation in 1792, provoked the British East India Company to direct its agents in Baghdad and Basra to acquire Mesopotamian relics for shipment to London.[46]\\r\\nClaudius Rich, working for the East India Company in Baghdad, excavated Babylon in 1811ÿ12 and again in 1817.[47][48] Robert Mignan excavated at the site briefly in 1827.[49] William Loftus visited there in 1849.[50]\\r\\nAusten Henry Layard made some soundings during a brief visit in 1850 before abandoning the site.[51] Fulgence Fresnel and Julius Oppert heavily excavated Babylon from 1852 to 1854. However, many of the fruits of their work was lost when a raft containing over forty crates of artifacts sank into the Tigris river.[52][53]\\r\\nSir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet and George Smith worked there briefly in 1854. The next excavation was conducted by Hormuzd Rassam on behalf of the British Museum. Work began in 1879, continuing until 1882, and was prompted by widespread looting of the site. Using industrial scale digging in search of artifacts, Rassam recovered a large quantity of cuneiform tablets and other finds. The zealous excavation methods, common at the time, caused significant damage to the archaeological context.[54][55] Many tablets had appeared on the market in 1876 before Rassam's excavation began.[18]\\r\\nA team from the German Oriental Society led by Robert Koldewey conducted the first scientific archaeological excavations at Babylon. The work was conducted daily from 1899 until 1917. Primary efforts of the dig involved the temple of Marduk and the processional way leading up to it, as well as the city wall.[56][57][58][59][60][61] Artifacts including pieces of the Ishtar Gate and hundreds of recovered tablets were sent back to Germany, where Koldewey's colleague Walter Andrae reconstructed them into displays at Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin.,[62][63] The German archaeologists fled before oncoming British troops in 1917 and again many objects went missing in the following years.[18]\\r\\nFurther work by the German Archaeological Institute was conducted by Heinrich J. Lenzen in 1956 and Hansj?rg Schmid in 1962. Lenzen's work dealt primarily with the Hellenistic theatre, and Schmid focused on the temple ziggurat Etemenanki.[64]\\r\\nThe site was excavated in 1974 on behalf of the Turin Centre for Archaeological Research and Excavations in the Middle East and Asia and the Iraqi-Italian Institute of Archaeological Sciences.[65][66] The focus was on clearing up issues raised by re-examination of the old German data. Additional work in 1987ÿ1989 concentrated on the area surrounding the Ishara and Ninurta temples in the Shu-Anna city-quarter of Babylon.[67][68]\\r\\nDuring the restoration efforts in Babylon, the Iraqi State Organization for Antiquities and Heritage excavation and clearing, but wider publication of these archaeological activities has been limited.[69][70] Indeed, most of the known tablets from all modern excavation remain unpublished.[18]\\r\\nThe site of Babylon has been a cultural asset to Iraq since the creation of the modern Iraqi government in 1920. Babylonian images periodically appear on Iraqi postcards and stamps. In the 1960s a replica of the Ishtar gate and a reconstruction of Ninmakh temple were built on site.[71]\\r\\nOn 14 February 1978, the Baathist government of Iraq under Saddam Hussein began the \\"Archaeological Restoration of Babylon Project\\": reconstructing features of the ancient city atop its ruins. These features included the Southern Palace of Nebuchandnezzar, with 250 rooms, five courtyards, and a 30-meter entrance arch. The project also reinforced the Processional Way, the Lion of Babylon, and an amphitheater constructed in the city's Hellenistic era. In 1982 the government minted a set of seven coins displaying iconic features of Babylon. A Babylon International Festival was held in September 1987, and annually thereafter until 2002 (excepting 1990 and 1991), to showcase this work. Proposed reconstruction of the Hanging Gardens and the great ziggurat never took place.[72][71][73]\\r\\nHussein installed a portrait of himself and Nebuchadnezzar at the entrance to the ruins and inscribed his name on many of the bricks, in imitation of Nebuchadnezzar. One frequent inscription reads: \\"This was built by Saddam Hussein, son of Nebuchadnezzar, to glorify Iraq\\". These bricks became sought after as collectors' items after Hussein's downfall.[74] Similar projects were conducted at Nineveh, Nimrud, Assur and Hatra, to demonstrate the magnificence of Arab achievement.[75]\\r\\nWhen the 1991 Gulf War ended, Hussein wanted to build a modern palace called Saddam Hill over some of the old ruins, in the pyramidal style of a ziggurat. In 2003, he intended the construction of a cable car line over Babylon, but plans were halted by the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\\r\\nFollowing the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the area around Babylon came under the control of US troops, before being handed over to Polish forces in September 2003.[76] US forces under the command of General James T. Conway of the I Marine Expeditionary Force were criticized for building the military base \\"Camp Alpha\\", with a helipad and other facilities on ancient Babylonian ruins during the Iraq War. US forces have occupied the site for some time and have caused irreparable damage to the archaeological record. In a report of the British Museum's Near East department, Dr. John Curtis described how parts of the archaeological site were levelled to create a landing area for helicopters, and parking lots for heavy vehicles. Curtis wrote of the occupation forces:\\r\\nThey caused substantial damage to the Ishtar Gate, one of the most famous monuments from antiquity [...] US military vehicles crushed 2,600-year-old brick pavements, archaeological fragments were scattered across the site, more than 12 trenches were driven into ancient deposits and military earth-moving projects contaminated the site for future generations of scientists.[77]\\r\\nA US Military spokesman claimed that engineering operations were discussed with the \\"head of the Babylon museum\\".[78] The head of the Iraqi State Board for Heritage and Antiquities, Donny George, said that the \\"mess will take decades to sort out\\" and criticised Polish troops for causing \\"terrible damage\\" to the site.[79][80] Poland resolved in 2004 to place the city under Iraq control, and commissioned a report titled Report Concerning the Condition of the Preservation of the Babylon Archaeological Site, which it presented at a meeting on 11ÿ13 December 2004.[72] In 2005 the site was handed over to the Iraqi Ministry of Culture.[76]\\r\\nIn April 2006, Colonel John Coleman, former Chief of Staff for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, offered to issue an apology for the damage done by military personnel under his command. However, he also claimed that the US presence had deterred far greater damage by other looters.[81] An article published in April 2006 stated that UN officials and Iraqi leaders have plans to restore Babylon, making it into a cultural center.[82][83]\\r\\nTwo museums and a library, containing replicas of artifacts and local maps and reports, were raided and destroyed.[84]\\r\\nIn May 2009, the provincial government of Babil reopened the site to tourists, but not many have come. An oil pipeline runs through an outer wall of the city.[85][86]\\r\\nBefore modern archaeological excavations in Mesopotamia, the appearance of Babylon was largely a mystery, and typically envisioned by Western artists as a hybrid between ancient Egyptian, classical Greek, and contemporary Ottoman culture.[87]\\r\\nDue to Babylon's historical significance as well as references to it in the Bible, the word \\"Babylon\\" in various languages has acquired a generic meaning of a large, bustling diverse city. Examples include:\\r\\nIn Genesis 10:10, Babel (Babylon) is described as founded by Nimrod along with Uruk, Akkad and perhaps Calnehall of them in Shinar (\\"Calneh\\" is now sometimes translated not as a proper name but as the phrase \\"all of them\\"). Another story is given in Genesis 11, which describes a united human race, speaking one language, migrating to Shinar to establish a city and towerthe Tower of Babel. God destroys the tower and the city, dispersing humanity across the earth and requiring them to speak mutually unintelligible languages.\\r\\nBabylon appears throughout the Hebrew Bible, including in descriptions of the destruction of Jerusalem and of the Babylonian captivity, and in several prophecies. Consequently, in Jewish and Christian tradition, Babylon symbolizes an oppressor against which righteous believers must struggle. Prophecies sometimes symbolically link the kings of Babylon with Lucifer. Nebuchadnezzar, sometimes conflated with Nabonidus, appears as the foremost ruler in this narrative.[89]\\r\\nThe Revelation of St. John in the Christian Bible refers to Babylon many centuries after it ceased to be a major political center. The city is personified by the Whore of Babylon, riding on a scarlet beast with seven heads and ten horns, and drunk on the blood of the righteous. Some scholars of apocalyptic literature believe this New Testament Babylon to be a dysphemism for the Roman Empire.[90]","input":"Where was the ancient city of babylon located?"},{"output":"in the 114th Congress, which started in January 2015","context":"Harry Reid\\r\\nDemocratic\\r\\nMitch McConnell\\r\\nRepublican\\r\\nElections to the United States Senate were a part of the elections held in the United States on November 4, 2014 (and in some areas for a period of time ending November 4, 2014). 33 Class 2 seats in the 100-member United States Senate were up for election, in addition to three Class 3 seats due to expire on January 3, 2017. The candidates winning the regular elections will serve six-year terms from January 3, 2015 to January 3, 2021. The elections marked 100 years of direct elections of U.S. Senators. Twenty-one of the open seats were held by the Democratic Party, while fifteen were held by the Republican Party.\\r\\nThe Republicans regained the majority of the Senate in the 114th Congress, which started in January 2015; the Republicans had not controlled the Senate since January 2007. They had needed a net gain of at least six seats to obtain a majority. They successfully held all of their seats, and gained nine Democratic-held seats. Republicans defeated five Democratic incumbents:\\r\\nThe Republicans also picked up another 4 open seats in Iowa, Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia. Polls and other factors had led forecasters to predict that the Republicans would win several seats, with most predicting that the party was likely but not certain to win at least the six seats necessary to take control of the Senate.\\r\\nThis was the second consecutive election held in a president's sixth year where control of the Senate changed hands. This was also the first time that the Democrats lost control of the Senate in a sixth-year midterm since 1918. With a total net gain of 9 seats, the Republicans made the largest Senate gain by any party since 1980, and the largest Senate gain in a midterm election since 1958. This is also the first election since 1980 in which more than two incumbent Democratic Senators were defeated by their Republican challengers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to have a majority, the Republicans were required to attain at least 51 seats in the Senate. The Democrats would have been able to retain a majority with 48 seats (assuming the two Independents continued to caucus with them) because, in event of a tie vote, Vice President Joe Biden would become the tie-breaker. From 1915 to 2013, control of the U.S. Senate flipped in 10 of 50 cycles, or 20% of the time.[1]\\r\\nThe Republican Party had lost ground in the 2012 elections, leading to an internal fight among the Republican leadership over the best strategies and tactics for the 2014 Senate races.[2] By December 2013, eight of the twelve incumbent Republicans running for re-election saw Tea Party challenges.[3] However, Republican incumbents won every primary challenge.[4] Although Democrats saw some opportunities for pickups, the combination of Democratic retirements and numerous Democratic seats up for election in swing states and red states gave Republicans hopes of taking control of the Senate.[5] 7 of the 21 states with Democratic seats up for election in 2014 had voted for Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. Democrats also faced the lower voter turnout that accompanies mid-term elections.[6] Days after the election, the United States Election Project estimated that 36.6% of eligible voters voted, 4% lower than the 2010 elections, and possibly the lowest turnout rate since the 1942 election.[7][8]\\r\\nPoll aggregation website FiveThirtyEight gave the Republican Party a 60% chance of taking control of the Senate as of September 28.[9] Another poll aggregation website, RealClearPolitics, gave the Republican Party a net gain of 7 seats.[10] Due to the closeness of several races, it was initially believed that Senate control might not be decided on election night.[11] Both Louisiana and Georgia were seen as competitive, and both states require a run-off election if no candidate takes a majority of the vote. Additionally, two independent candidates, Greg Orman in Kansas and Larry Pressler[12] in South Dakota, refused to commit to caucusing with either party.[11] In the final months of the race, polls showed the two independent candidates with viable chances of winning seats in the Senate, leading some analysts to speculate on the possibility of an \\"independent caucus\\" that could also include Maine Senator Angus King and possibly Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.[13][14] However, no independent won a Senate race in 2014, and King and Sanders continue to caucus with the Democratic Party following the 2014 election.\\r\\nBy midnight ET, most major networks projected that the Republicans would take control of the Senate. The party held all three competitive Republican-held seats (Kentucky, Kansas, and Georgia), and defeated incumbent Democrats in North Carolina, Colorado, and Arkansas. Combined with the pick-ups of open seats in Iowa, Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia, the Republicans made a net gain of 7 seats before the end of the night. In the process of taking control of the Senate, Republicans defeated three incumbent Democrats, a task the party had not accomplished since the 1980 election.[15] Five of the seven confirmed pickups were in states that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, but two of the seats that Republicans won represent states that voted for Barack Obama in 2012 (Colorado and Iowa). Of the three races that were not called by the end of election night, Alaska and Virginia were still too close to call, while Louisiana held a December 6 run-off election. Virginia declared Democrat Mark Warner the winner of his race by a narrow margin over Republican Ed Gillespie on November 7, and Alaska declared Dan Sullivan the winner against Democratic incumbent Mark Begich a week later, on November 12. Republican Bill Cassidy defeated Democratic incumbent Mary Landrieu in the Louisiana runoff on December 6.\\r\\nGoing into the elections, there were 53 Democratic, 45 Republican and 2 independent senators (both of whom caucus with the Democrats). In all, there were 36 elections: 33 senators were up for election this year as class 2 Senators, and 3 faced special elections (all from Class 3). Of all these seats, 21 were held by Democrats and 15 were held by Republicans.\\r\\nColored shading indicates party with largest share of that row.\\r\\nIn these special elections, the winner was elected during 2014 but seated before January 3, 2015  except that one was seated on January 3, 2015, the effective date of the predecessor's resignation.\\r\\nIn these general elections, the races are for the class 2 seats whose terms begin January 3, 2015.\\r\\nSeveral websites used poll aggregation and psephology to estimate the probability that the Republican Party would gain enough seats to take control of the Senate.\\r\\nOut of these 11 competitive seats, Republicans needed to win at least six in order to gain a majority of 51 seats and Democrats needed to win at least five in order to hold a majority of 50 seats (including the two independents who currently caucus with the Democrats and the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Joe Biden.\\r\\nThree-term incumbent Republican Jeff Sessions had been re-elected with 63% of the vote in 2008. Sessions sought re-election. No Democrat filed to run against him,[150] and Sessions won with 97.3 percent of the vote[151] against assorted write-in candidates.[152]\\r\\nOne-term incumbent Democrat Mark Begich had been first elected with 48% of the vote in 2008, defeating six-term Senator Ted Stevens by 3,953 votes (a margin of 1.25%).[153] Begich was 52 years old in 2014 and was seeking re-election to a second term.[28] Stevens, who would have been almost 91 years old at the time of the election, had already filed for a rematch back in 2009,[28] but was killed in a plane crash the following year.\\r\\nRepublican Lieutenant Governor Mead Treadwell,[154] 2010 nominee Joe Miller,[155] State Natural Resources Commissioner Daniel S. Sullivan,[156] and Air Force veteran John Jaramillo ran for the GOP nomination. In the August 19 primary, Sullivan won the Republican nomination with 40% and defeated Begich in the general election.[157]\\r\\nTwo-term incumbent Democrat Mark Pryor had been re-elected with 80% of the vote without Republican opposition in 2008.[158] Pryor was running for a third term.[32]\\r\\nFreshman Representative Tom Cotton of Arkansas's 4th congressional district was the Republican nominee.[159] In the general election, Cotton defeated Pryor.\\r\\nOne-term incumbent Democrat Mark Udall had been elected with 53% of the vote in 2008. Udall was running for re-election.[160]\\r\\nCongressman Cory Gardner of Colorado's 4th congressional district was the Republican nominee; his late entry into the race caused numerous Republicans to withdraw their candidacies.[161] Gaylon Kent was the Libertarian Party nominee. Unity Party of America founder and National Chairman Bill Hammons was the Unity Party nominee.\\r\\nDemocrat Chris Coons won in the 2010 special election caused by Joe Biden's election as Vice President, winning by a 57% to 41% margin. Coons sought re-election. His Republican opponent was engineer Kevin Wade,[162] whom Coons went on to defeat in the general election.\\r\\nTwo-term incumbent Republican Saxby Chambliss had been re-elected with 57% of the vote in 2008 in a runoff election with former state Representative Jim Martin; Georgia requires run-off elections when no Senate candidate wins over 50% of the vote. Chambliss did not seek a third term.[45]\\r\\nPolitical activist Derrick Grayson,[163] Representatives Jack Kingston of Georgia's 1st congressional district,[164] Paul Broun of Georgia's 10th congressional district,[165] and Phil Gingrey of Georgia's 11th congressional district[166] all declared their candidacy for the Republican nomination, as did former Secretary of State Karen Handel[167] and wealthy businessman David Perdue, cousin of former Governor Sonny Perdue.[168] In the May 20 primary, no candidate received a majority of votes, so the top two candidates faced each other in a runoff; Perdue won against Kingston in the runoff primary election on July 22 with 50.9% of the vote.[169]\\r\\nMichelle Nunn, CEO of Points of Light and the daughter of former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn, won the Democratic nomination.[170][171] Other declared Democratic candidates included former State Senator Steen Miles, psychiatrist Branko Radulovacki, and former US Army Ranger Todd Robinson.

State representative Jason Conger, attorney Tim Crawley, IT consultant Mark Callahan, neurosurgeon Dr. Monica Wehby, and former Linn County Republican Chair Jo Rae Perkins all ran for the Republican nomination,[254] with Wehby ultimately winning the nomination in the May 20 primary.[255]\\r\\nThree-term incumbent Democrat Jack Reed had been re-elected in 2012 with 73% of the vote in 2008.[256] Reed defeated Republican nominee Mark Zaccaria in the 2014 election.\\r\\nTwo-term incumbent Republican Lindsey Graham had been re-elected with 58% of the vote in 2008. Graham won the Republican nomination over a field that included state senator Lee Bright. State Senator Brad Hutto won the Democratic nomination.[257]\\r\\nJim DeMint had been elected to a second term in 2010, but resigned from the Senate in January 2013 to become president of The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank. Governor Nikki Haley appointed Congressman Tim Scott as DeMint's replacement.[258] Scott, an African-American, was the Republican nominee to serve out the remainder of DeMint's term. Scott is the first African-American Republican since shortly after Reconstruction to represent a Southern state. Richland County Councilwoman Joyce Dickerson won the Democratic nomination.[259]\\r\\nThree-term incumbent Democrat Tim Johnson had been re-elected with 63% of the vote in 2008. Johnson announced on March 26, 2013 that he would not run for re-election.[260] Former Congressional aide Rick Weiland is the Democratic nominee.[261]\\r\\nAmong Republicans, former two-term Governor Mike Rounds announced his candidacy for the GOP nomination on November 29, 2012.[262] Rounds won the Republican nomination over state senator Larry Rhoden, state representative Stace Nelson, and physician Annette Bosworth.[263]\\r\\nFormer Republican U.S. Senator Larry Pressler and Republican State Senator Gordon Howie ran as independents.[264][265] Pressler did not commit to caucusing with either party, while Howie said he would caucus with the Senate Republicans.[266][267]\\r\\nTwo-term incumbent Republican Lamar Alexander had been re-elected with 65% of the vote in 2008. Alexander sought re-election to a third term.[116] On August 7, 2014, Alexander won the Republican nomination over six challengers, including State Representative Joe Carr.[268]\\r\\nOn November 4, 2014, Alexander faced Democratic nominee Gordon Ball, Libertarian Party nominee Joshua James,[269] Constitution Party nominee Joe Wilmothm, and independent Danny Page[269] also ran in the general election.\\r\\nTwo-term incumbent Republican John Cornyn, the Senate Minority Whip, had been re-elected with 55% of the vote in 2008. Cornyn sought re-election, and won the 2014 Republican primary with 59% of the vote. David Alameel, a dentist, and Kesha Rogers, a volunteer for The Lyndon LaRouche Policy Institute, faced each other in a run-off election for the Democratic nomination.[270] Alameel won the run-off and was the Democratic nominee.[271]\\r\\nOne-term incumbent Democrat Mark Warner had been elected with 65% of the vote in 2008; he sought re-election. Ed Gillespie, former RNC Chairman and presidential adviser, ran for the Republican nomination. Robert Sarvis, the Libertarian nominee for Governor in 2013, also ran.[272]\\r\\nFive-term incumbent Democrat Jay Rockefeller had been re-elected with 64% of the vote in 2008. He announced on January 11, 2013 that he would not seek re-election to a sixth term. Secretary of State Natalie Tennant won the Democratic nomination.[273]\\r\\nOn November 26, 2012, Republican Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito announced her plans to run for the seat, in hopes of becoming the first Republican Senator elected from West Virginia since 1956.[274] Moore Capito won the Republican nomination and the general election, the first woman to serve as United States Senator from West Virginia.\\r\\nThree-term incumbent Republican Mike Enzi had been re-elected with 76% of the vote in 2008. Enzi sought re-election. Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, briefly entered the race for the Republican nomination, but dropped her bid in January 2014.[275] On August 19, Enzi won the Republican primary election with 82% of the vote, and Democrat Charlie Hardy, a former Catholic priest, won his party's primary election with 48% of the vote.[276]","input":"When did republicans gain control of the senate?"},{"output":"10.70%","context":"Labor unions in the United States are organizations that represent workers in many industries recognized under US labor law. Their activity today centers on collective bargaining over wages, benefits, and working conditions for their membership, and on representing their members in disputes with management over violations of contract provisions. Larger unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and electioneering at the state and federal level.\\r\\nMost unions in the United States are aligned with one of two larger umbrella organizations: the AFL-CIO created in 1955, and the Change to Win Federation which split from the AFL-CIO in 2005. Both advocate policies and legislation on behalf of workers in the United States and Canada, and take an active role in politics. The AFL-CIO is especially concerned with global trade issues.\\r\\nIn 2016, there were 14.6 million members in the U.S., down from 17.7 million in 1983. The percentage of workers belonging to a union in the United States (or total labor union \\"density\\") was 10.7%, compared to 20.1% in 1983.[1][2] Union membership in the private sector has fallen under 7%[3]  levels not seen since 1932. From a global perspective, the density in 2013 was 7.7% in France, 18.1% in Germany, 27.1% in Canada, and 88.9% in Iceland, which is currently highest in the world.[2]\\r\\nIn the 21st century the most prominent unions are among public sector employees such as city employees, government workers, teachers and police. Members of unions are disproportionately older, male, and residents of the Northeast, the Midwest, and California.[4] Union workers average 10-30% higher pay than non-union in the United States after controlling for individual, job, and labor market characteristics.[5]\\r\\nAlthough much smaller compared to their peak membership in the 1950s, American unions remain a political factor, both through mobilization of their own memberships and through coalitions with like-minded activist organizations around issues such as immigrant rights, trade policy, health care, and living wage campaigns. Of special concern are efforts by cities and states to reduce the pension obligations owed to unionized workers who retire in the future.[6] Republicans elected with Tea Party support in 2010, most notably Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin, have launched major efforts against public sector unions due in part to state government pension obligations (even though Wisconsin's state pension is 100% funded[7]) along with the allegation that the unions are too powerful.[8][9] States with higher levels of union membership tend to have higher median incomes[10] and standards of living.[11] It has been asserted by scholars and the International Monetary Fund that rising income inequality in the United States is directly attributable to the decline of the labor movement and union membership.[12][13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnions began forming in the mid-19th century in response to the social and economic impact of the industrial revolution. National labor unions began to form in the post-Civil War Era. The Knights of Labor emerged as a major force in the late 1880s, but it collapsed because of poor organization, lack of effective leadership, disagreement over goals, and strong opposition from employers and government forces.\\r\\nThe American Federation of Labor, founded in 1886 and led by Samuel Gompers until his death in 1924, proved much more durable. It arose as a loose coalition of various local unions. It helped coordinate and support strikes and eventually became a major player in national politics, usually on the side of the Democrats.\\r\\nAmerican labor unions benefited greatly from the New Deal policies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1930s. The Wagner Act, in particular, legally protected the right of unions to organize. Unions from this point developed increasingly closer ties to the Democratic Party, and are considered a backbone element of the New Deal Coalition.\\r\\nPro-business conservatives gained control of Congress in 1946, and in 1947 passed the Taft-Hartley Act, drafted by Senator Robert A. Taft. President Truman vetoed it but the Conservative coalition overrode the veto. The veto override had considerable Democratic support, including 106 out of 177 Democrats in the House, and 20 out of 42 Democrats in the Senate.[15] The law, which is still in effect, banned union contributions to political candidates, restricted the power of unions to call strikes that \\"threatened national security,\\" and forced the expulsion of Communist union leaders (the Supreme Court found the anti-communist provision to be unconstitutional, and it is no longer in force). The unions campaigned vigorously for years to repeal the law but failed. During the late 1950s, the Landrum Griffin Act of 1959 passed in the wake of Congressional investigations of corruption and undemocratic internal politics in the Teamsters and other unions.[16][17]\\r\\nIn 1955, the two largest labor organizations, the AFL and CIO, merged, ending a division of over 20 years. AFL President George Meany became President of the new AFL-CIO, and AFL Secretary-Treasurer William Schnitzler became AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer. The draft constitution was primarily written by AFL Vice President Matthew Woll and CIO General Counsel Arthur Goldberg, while the joint policy statements were written by Woll, CIO Secretary-Treasurer James Carey, CIO vice presidents David McDonald and Joseph Curran, Brotherhood of Railway Clerks President George Harrison, and Illinois AFL-CIO President Reuben Soderstrom.[18]\\r\\nThe percentage of workers belonging to a union (or \\"density\\") in the United States peaked in 1954 at almost 35% and the total number of union members peaked in 1979 at an estimated 21.0 million. Membership has declined since, with private sector union membership beginning a steady decline that continues into the 2010s, but the membership of public sector unions grew steadily.\\r\\nAfter 1960 public sector unions grew rapidly and secured good wages and high pensions for their members. While manufacturing and farming steadily declined, state- and local-government employment quadrupled from 4 million workers in 1950 to 12 million in 1976 and 16.6 million in 2009.[19] Adding in the 3.7 million federal civilian employees, in 2010 8.4 million government workers were represented by unions,[20] including 31% of federal workers, 35% of state workers and 46% of local workers.[21] As Daniel Disalvo notes, \\"In today's public sector, good pay, generous benefits, and job security make possible a stable middle-class existence for nearly everyone from janitors to jailors.\\"[22]\\r\\nBy the 1970s, a rapidly increasing flow of imports (such as automobiles, steel and electronics from Germany and Japan, and clothing and shoes from Asia) undercut American producers.[23] By the 1980s there was a large-scale shift in employment with fewer workers in high-wage sectors and more in the low-wage sectors.[24] Many companies closed or moved factories to Southern states (where unions were weak),[25] countered the threat of a strike by threatening to close or move a plant,[26] or moved their factories offshore to low-wage countries.[27] The number of major strikes and lockouts fell by 97% from 381 in 1970 to 187 in 1980 to only 11 in 2010.[26][28] On the political front, the shrinking unions lost influence in the Democratic Party, and pro-Union liberal Republicans faded away.[29] Union membership among workers in private industry shrank dramatically, though after 1970 there was growth in employees unions of federal, state and local governments.[30][31] The intellectual mood in the 1970s and 1980s favored deregulation and free competition.[32] Numerous industries were deregulated, including airlines, trucking, railroads and telephones, over the objections of the unions involved.[33] The climax came when President Ronald Reagana former union presidentbroke the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) strike in 1981, dealing a major blow to unions.[28][34]\\r\\nRepublicans, using conservative think tanks as idea farms, began to push through legislative blueprints to curb the power of public employee unions as well as eliminate business regulations.[27][35][36]\\r\\n???

Both organizations advocate policies and legislation favorable to workers in the United States and Canada, and take an active role in politics favoring the Democratic party but not exclusively so. The AFL-CIO is especially concerned with global trade and economic issues.\\r\\nPrivate sector unions are regulated by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), passed in 1935 and amended since then. The law is overseen by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), an independent federal agency. Public sector unions are regulated partly by federal and partly by state laws. In general they have shown robust growth rates, because wages and working conditions are set through negotiations with elected local and state officials.\\r\\nTo join a traditional labor union, workers must either be given voluntary recognition from their employer or have a majority of workers in a bargaining unit vote for union representation.[citation needed] In either case, the government must then certify the newly formed union.[citation needed] Other forms of unionism include minority unionism, solidarity unionism, and the practices of organizations such as the Industrial Workers of the World, which do not always follow traditional organizational models.\\r\\nPublic sector worker unions are governed by labor laws and labor boards in each of the 50 states. Northern states typically model their laws and boards after the NLRA and the NLRB. In other states, public workers have no right to establish a union as a legal entity. (About 40% of public employees in the USA do not have the right to organize a legally established union.)[38][39]\\r\\nA review conducted by the federal government on pay scale shows that employees in a labor union earn up to 33% more income than their nonunion counterparts, as well as having more job security, and safer and higher-quality work conditions.[40] The median weekly income for union workers was $973 in 2014, compared with $763 for nonunion workers.[37]\\r\\nOnce the union has won the support of a majority of the bargaining unit and is certified in a workplace, it has the sole authority to negotiate the conditions of employment. However, under the NLRA, if a minority of employees voted for a union, those employees can then form a union which represents the rights of only those members who voted for the union.[citation needed] This minority model was once widely used, but was discarded when unions began to consistently win majority support. Unions are beginning to revisit the \\"members only\\" model of unionism because of new changes to labor law which unions view as curbing workers' ability to organize.\\r\\nThe employer and the union write the terms and conditions of employment in a legally binding contract. When disputes arise over the contract, most contracts call for the parties to resolve their differences through a grievance process to see if the dispute can be mutually resolved. If the union and the employer still cannot settle the matter, either party can choose to send the dispute to arbitration, where the case is argued before a neutral third party.\\r\\nRight-to-work statutes forbid unions from negotiating union shops and agency shops. Thus, while unions do exist in \\"right-to-work\\" states, they are typically weaker.\\r\\nMembers of labor unions enjoy \\"Weingarten Rights.\\" If management questions the union member on a matter that may lead to discipline or other changes in working conditions, union members can request representation by a union representative. Weingarten Rights are named for the first Supreme Court decision to recognize those rights.[41]\\r\\nThe NLRA goes farther in protecting the right of workers to organize unions. It protects the right of workers to engage in any \\"concerted activity\\" for mutual aid or protection. Thus, no union connection is needed. Concerted activity \\"in its inception involves only a speaker and a listener, for such activity is an indispensable preliminary step to employee self-organization.\\"[42]\\r\\nUnions are currently advocating new federal legislation, the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA), that would allow workers to elect union representation by simply signing a support card (card check). The current process established by federal law requires at least 30% of employees to sign cards for the union, then wait 45 to 90 days for a federal official to conduct a secret ballot election in which a simple majority of the employees must vote for the union in order to obligate the employer to bargain.\\r\\nUnions report that, under the present system, many employers use the 45- to 90-day period to conduct anti-union campaigns. Some opponents of this legislation fear that removing secret balloting from the process will lead to the intimidation and coercion of workers on behalf of the unions. During the 2008 elections, the Employee Free Choice Act had widespread support of many legislators in the House and Senate, and of the President. Since then, support for the \\"card check\\" provisions of the EFCA subsided substantially.\\r\\nUnion membership had been declining in the US since 1954, and since 1967, as union membership rates decreased, middle class incomes shrank correspondingly.[43] In 2007, the labor department reported the first increase in union memberships in 25 years and the largest increase since 1979. Most of the recent gains in union membership have been in the service sector while the number of unionized employees in the manufacturing sector has declined. Most of the gains in the service sector have come in West Coast states like California where union membership is now at 16.7% compared with a national average of about 12.1%.[44] Historically, the rapid growth of public employee unions since the 1960s has served to mask an even more dramatic decline in private-sector union membership.\\r\\nAt the apex of union density in the 1940s, only about 9.8% of public employees were represented by unions, while 33.9% of private, non-agricultural workers had such representation. In this decade, those proportions have essentially reversed, with 36% of public workers being represented by unions while private sector union density had plummeted to around 7%. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics most recent survey indicates that union membership in the US has risen to 12.4% of all workers, from 12.1% in 2007. For a short period, private sector union membership rebounded, increasing from 7.5% in 2007 to 7.6% in 2008.[37] However, that trend has since reversed. In 2013 there were 14.5 million members in the U.S., compared with 17.7 million in 1983. In 2013, the percentage of workers belonging to a union was 11.3%, compared to 20.1% in 1983. The rate for the private sector was 6.7%, and for the public sector 35.3%.[1]\\r\\nIn the ten years 2005 through 2014, the National Labor Relations Board recorded 18,577 labor union representation elections; in 11,086 of these elections (60 percent), the majority of workers voted for union representation. Most of the elections (15,517) were triggered by employee petitions for representation, of which unions won 9,933. Less common were elections caused by employee petitions for decertification (2792, of which unions won 1070), and employer-filed petitions for either representation or decertification (268, of which unions won 85).[45][46]\\r\\nIn the US, labor education programs such as the Harvard Trade Union Program[47] created in 1942 by Harvard University professor John Thomas Dunlop sought to educate union members to deal with important contemporary workplace and labor law issues of the day. The Harvard Trade Union Program is currently part of a broader initiative at Harvard Law School called the Labor and Worklife Program[48] that deals with a wide variety of labor and employment issues from union pension investment funds to the effects of nanotechnology on labor markets and the workplace.\\r\\nCornell University is known to be one of the leading centers for labor education in the world, establishing the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations in 1945. The school's mission is to prepare leaders, inform national and international employment and labor policy, and improve working lives through undergraduate and graduate education. The school publishes the Industrial and Labor Relations Review and had Frances Perkins on its faculty. The school has six academic departments: Economics, Human Resource Management, International and Comparative Labor, Labor Relations, Organizational Behavior, and Social Statistics. Classes include \\"Politics of the Global North\\" and \\"Economic Analysis of the University.\\"[49][50]\\r\\nLabor unions use the term jurisdiction to refer to their claims to represent workers who perform a certain type of work and the right of their members to perform such work. For example, the work of unloading containerized cargo at United States ports, which the International Longshoremen's Association, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters have claimed rightfully should be assigned to workers they represent. A jurisdictional strike is a concerted refusal to work undertaken by a union to assert its members' right to such job assignments and to protest the assignment of disputed work to members of another union or to unorganized workers. Jurisdictional strikes occur most frequently in the United States in the construction industry.[51]\\r\\nUnions also use jurisdiction to refer to the geographical boundaries of their operations, as in those cases in which a national or international union allocates the right to represent workers among different local unions based on the place of those workers' employment, either along geographical lines or by adopting the boundaries between political jurisdictions.[51]\\r\\nAlthough not as overwhelmingly supportive as it was from the 1930s through the early 1960s, a clear majority of the American public approves of labor unions. The Gallup organization has tracked public opinion of unions since 1936, when it found that 72 percent approved of unions. The overwhelming approval declined in the late 1960s, but - except for one poll in 2009 in which the unions received a favorable rating by only 48 percent of those interviewed, majorities have always supported labor unions. The latest poll in August 2016 gave labor unions a 56 percent approval rating, versus 36 percent who disapproved of unions.\\r\\nOn the question of whether or not unions should have more influence or less influence, Gallup has found the public consistently split since Gallup first posed the question in 2000, with no majority favoring either more influence or less influence. In August 2016, 36 percent wanted unions to have more influence, 34 percent less influence, with 26 percent wanting the influence of labor unions to remain about the same.[52]\\r\\nAlthough most industrialized countries have seen a drop in unionization rates, the drop in union density (the unionized proportion of the working population) has been more significant in the United States than elsewhere.[12]\\r\\nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics surveyed the histories of union membership rates in industrialized countries from 1970 to 2003, and found that of 20 advanced economies which had union density statistics going back to 1970, 16 of them had experienced drops in union density from 1970 to 2003. Over the same period during which union density in the US declined from 23.5 percent to 12.4 percent, some counties saw even steeper drops. Australian unionization fell from 50.2 percent in 1970 to 22.9 percent in 2003, in New Zealand it dropped from 55.2 percent to 22.1 percent, and in Austria union participation fell from 62.8 percent down to 35.4 percent. All the English-speaking countries studied saw union membership decline to some degree. In the United Kingdom, union participation fell from 44.8 percent in 1970 to 29.3 percent in 2003. In Ireland the decline was from 53.7 percent down to 35.3 percent. Canada had one of the smallest declines over the period, going from 31.6 percent in 1970 to 28.4 percent in 2003. Most of the countries studied started in 1970 with higher participation rates than the US, but France, which in 1970 had a union participation rate of 21.7 percent, by 2003 had fallen to 8.3 percent. The remaining four countries which had gained in union density were Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Belgium.[55]\\r\\nPublic approval of unions climbed during the 1980s much as it did in other industrialized nations,[56] but declined to below 50% for the first time in 2009 during the Great Recession. It is not clear if this is a long term trend or a function of a high unemployment rate which historically correlates with lower public approval of labor unions.[57]\\r\\nOne explanation for loss of public support is simply the lack of union power or critical mass. No longer do a sizable percentage of American workers belong to unions, or have family members who do. Unions no longer carry the \\"threat effect\\": the power of unions to raise wages of non-union shops by virtue of the threat of unions to organize those shops.[57]\\r\\nA New York Times/CBS Poll found that 60% of Americans opposed restricting collective bargaining while 33% were for it. The poll also found that 56% of Americans opposed reducing pay of public employees compared to the 37% who approved. The details of the poll also stated that 26% of those surveyed, thought pay and benefits for public employees were too high, 25% thought too low, and 36% thought about right. Mark Tapscott of the Washington Examiner criticized the poll, accusing it of over-sampling union and public employee households.[58]\\r\\nA Gallup poll released on March 9, 2011, showed that Americans were more likely to support limiting the collective bargaining powers of state employee unions to balance a state's budget (49%) than disapprove of such a measure (45%), while 6% had no opinion. 66% of Republicans approved of such a measure as did 51% of independents. Only 31% of Democrats approved.[59]\\r\\nA Gallup poll released on March 11, 2011, showed that nationwide, Americans were more likely to give unions a negative word or phrase when describing them (38%) than a positive word or phrase (34%). 17% were neutral and 12% didn't know. Republicans were much more likely to say a negative term (58%) than Democrats (19%). Democrats were much more likely to say a positive term (49%) than Republicans (18%).[60]\\r\\nA nationwide Gallup poll (margin of error I4%) released on April 1, 2011,[61] showed the following;\\r\\nA nationwide Gallup poll released on August 31, 2011, revealed the following:[62]\\r\\nA nationwide Gallup poll released on September 1, 2011, revealed the following:[63]\\r\\nA broad range of forces have been identified as potential contributors to the drop in union density across countries. Sano and Williamson outline quantitative studies that assess the relevance of these factors across countries.[64] The first relevant set of factors relate to the receptiveness of unions' institutional environments. For example, the presence of a Ghent system (where unions are responsible for the distribution of unemployment insurance) and of centralized collective bargaining (organized at a national or industry level as opposed to local or firm level) have both been shown to give unions more bargaining power and to correlate positively to higher rates of union density.[64]\\r\\nUnions have enjoyed higher rates of success in locations where they have greater access to the workplace as an organizing space (as determined both by law and by employer acceptance), and where they benefit from a corporatist relationship to the state and are thus allowed to participate more directly in the official governance structure. Moreover, the fluctuations of business cycles, particularly the rise and fall of unemployment rates and inflation, are also closely linked to changes in union density.[64]\\r\\nLabor lawyer Thomas Geoghegan attributes the drop to the long-term effects of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, which slowed and then halted labor's growth and then, over many decades, enabled management to roll back labor's previous gains.[65]\\r\\nFirst, it ended organizing on the grand, 1930s scale. It outlawed mass picketing, secondary strikes of neutral employers, sit downs: in short, everything [Congress of Industrial Organizations founder John L.] Lewis did in the 1930s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second effect of Taft-Hartley was subtler and slower-working. It was to hold up any new organizing at all, even on a quiet, low-key scale. For example, Taft-Hartley ended \\"card checks.\\"  Taft-Hartley required hearings, campaign periods, secret-ballot elections, and sometimes more hearings, before a union could be officially recognized.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also allowed and even encouraged employers to threaten workers who want to organize. Employers could hold \\"captive meetings,\\" bring workers into the office and chew them out for thinking about the Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Taft-Hartley led to the \\"union-busting\\" that started in the late 1960s and continues today. It started when a new \\"profession\\" of labor consultants began to convince employers that they could violate the [pro-labor 1935] Wagner Act, fire workers at will, fire them deliberately for exercising their legal rights, and nothing would happen. The Wagner Act had never had any real sanctions.\\r\\n[]\\r\\nIn general, scholars debate the influence of politics in determining union strength in the US and other countries. One argument is that political parties play an expected role in determining union strength, with left-wing governments generally promoting greater union density, while others contest this finding by pointing out important counterexamples and explaining the reverse causality inherent in this relationship.[66]\\r\\nMore recently, as unions have become increasingly concerned with the impacts of market integration on their well-being, scholars have begun to assess whether popular concerns about a global \\"race to the bottom\\" are reflected in cross-country comparisons of union strength. These scholars use foreign direct investment (FDI) and the size of a country's international trade as a percentage of its GDP to assess a country's relative degree of market integration. These researchers typically find that globalization does affect union density, but is dependent on other factors, such as unions' access to the workplace and the centralization of bargaining.[67]\\r\\nSano and Williamson argue that globalization's impact is conditional upon a country's labor history.[68] In the United States in particular, which has traditionally had relatively low levels of union density, globalization did not appear to significantly affect union density.\\r\\nStudies focusing more narrowly on the U.S. labor movement corroborate the comparative findings about the importance of structural factors, but tend to emphasize the effects of changing labor markets due to globalization to a greater extent. Bronfenbrenner notes that changes in the economy, such as increased global competition, capital flight, and the transitions from a manufacturing to a service economy and to a greater reliance on transitory and contingent workers, accounts for only a third of the decline in union density.[70]\\r\\nBronfenbrenner claims that the federal government in the 1980s was largely responsible for giving employers the perception that they could engage in aggressive strategies to repress the formation of unions. Richard Freeman also points to the role of repressive employer strategies in reducing unionization, and highlights the way in which a state ideology of anti-unionism tacitly accepted these strategies[56]\\r\\nGoldfield writes that the overall effects of globalization on unionization in the particular case of the United States may be understated in econometric studies on the subject.[71] He writes that the threat of production shifts reduces unions' bargaining power even if it does not eliminate them, and also claims that most of the effects of globalization on labor's strength are indirect. They are most present in change towards a neoliberal political context that has promoted the deregulation and privatization of some industries and accepted increased employer flexibility in labor markets.\\r\\nRegardless of the actual impact of market integration on union density or on workers themselves, organized labor has been engaged in a variety of strategies to limit the agenda of globalization and to promote labor regulations in an international context. The most prominent example of this has been the opposition of labor groups to free trade initiatives such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). In both cases, unions expressed strong opposition to the agreements, but to some extent pushed for the incorporation of basic labor standards in the agreement if one were to pass.[73]\\r\\nHowever, Mayer has written that it was precisely unions' opposition to NAFTA overall that jeopardized organized labor's ability to influence the debate on labor standards in a significant way.[74] During Clinton's presidential campaign, labor unions wanted NAFTA to include a side deal to provide for a kind of international social charter, a set of standards that would be enforceable both in domestic courts and through international institutions. Mickey Kantor, then U.S. trade representative, had strong ties to organized labor and believed that he could get unions to come along with the agreement, particularly if they were given a strong voice in the negotiation process.[74]\\r\\nWhen it became clear that Mexico would not stand for this kind of an agreement, some critics from the labor movement would not settle for any viable alternatives. In response, part of the labor movement wanted to declare their open opposition to the agreement, and to push for NAFTA's rejection in Congress.[74] Ultimately, the ambivalence of labor groups led those within the Administration who supported NAFTA to believe that strengthening NAFTA's labor side agreement too much would cost more votes among Republicans than it would garner among Democrats, and would make it harder for the United States to elicit support from Mexico.[75]\\r\\nGraubart writes that, despite unions' open disappointment with the outcome of this labor-side negotiation, labor activists, including the AFL-CIO have used the side agreement's citizen petition process to highlight ongoing political campaigns and struggles in their home countries.[76] He claims that despite the relative weakness of the legal provisions themselves, the side-agreement has served a legitimizing functioning, giving certain social struggles a new kind of standing.\\r\\nUnions have recently been engaged in a developing field of transnational labor regulation embodied in corporate codes of conduct. However, O'Brien cautions that unions have been only peripherally involved in this process, and remain ambivalent about its potential effects.[77] They worry that these codes could have legitimizing effects on companies that do not actually live up to good practices, and that companies could use codes to excuse or distract attention from the repression of unions.\\r\\nBraun and Gearhart note that although unions do participate in the structure of a number of these agreements, their original interest in codes of conduct differed from the interests of human rights and other non-governmental activists. Unions believed that codes of conduct would be important first steps in creating written principles that a company would be compelled to comply with in later organizing contracts, but did not foresee the establishment of monitoring systems such as the Fair Labor Association. These authors point out that are motivated by power, want to gain insider status politically and are accountable to a constituency that requires them to provide them with direct benefits.[78]\\r\\nIn contrast, activists from the non-governmental sector are motivated by ideals, are free of accountability and gain legitimacy from being political outsiders. Therefore, the interests of unions are not likely to align well with the interests of those who draft and monitor corporate codes of conduct.\\r\\nArguing against the idea that high union wages necessarily make manufacturing uncompetitive in a globalized economy is labor lawyer Thomas Geoghegan. Busting\\r\\nunions, in the U.S. manner, as the prime way of competing with China and other countries [does not work]. It's no accident that the social democracies, Sweden, France, and Germany, which kept on paying high wages, now have more industry than the U.S. or the UK.  [T]hat's what the U.S. and the UK did: they smashed the unions, in the belief that they had to compete on cost. The result? They quickly ended up wrecking their industrial base.[79]\\r\\nUnions have made some attempts to organize across borders. Eder observes that transnational organizing is not a new phenomenon but has been facilitated by technological change.[80] Nevertheless, he claims that while unions pay lip service to global solidarity, they still act largely in their national self-interest. He argues that unions in the global North are becoming increasingly depoliticized while those in the South grow politically, and that global differentiation of production processes leads to divergent strategies and interests in different regions of the world. These structural differences tend to hinder effective global solidarity. However, in light of the weakness of international labor, Herod writes that globalization of production need not be met by a globalization of union strategies in order to be contained. Herod also points out that local strategies, such as the United Auto Workers' strike against General Motors in 1998, can sometimes effectively interrupt global production processes in ways that they could not before the advent of widespread market integration. Thus, workers need not be connected organizationally to others around the world to effectively influence the behavior of a transnational corporation.[81]\\r\\nHistory:\\r\\nInternational:\\r\\nGeneral:","input":"What percentage of the united states labor force is currently unionized?"},{"output":"19th century","context":"Social work has its roots in the attempts of society at large to deal with the problem of poverty and inequality. Social work is intricately linked with the idea of charity work; but must be understood in broader terms. The concept of charity goes back to ancient times, and the practice of providing for the poor has roots in all major world religions,[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before the rise of modern European states, the church was providing social services. When Constantine I legalized the Christian Church in the 4th century, the newly legitimised church set up burial societies, poorhouses, homes for the aged, shelter for the homeless, hospitals, and orphanages.[2][3][4] These were often funded, at least in part, from grants from the Empire.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 580 AD the church had a system for circulating consumables to the poor: associated with each parish was a diaconium or office of the deacon. Monasteries also often served as comprehensive social service agencies, acting as hospitals, homes for the aged, orphanages,  travelers' aid stations.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Christian church had vast influence on European society and charity was considered to be a responsibility and a sign of ones piety. This charity was in the form of direct relief (for example, giving money, food, or other material goods to alleviate a particular need), as opposed to trying to change the root causes of poverty. As there was no effective bureaucracy below city government that was capable of large scale charitable activities, the clergy carried out this role until the Early Modern Period.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not until the emergence of industrialization and urbanization that the informal helping systems of the church and family began to be replaced by social welfare services.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe practice and profession of social work has a relatively modern and scientific origin,[6] and is generally considered to have developed out of three strands. The first was individual casework, a strategy pioneered by the Charity Organisation Society in the mid-19th century. The\\r\\nsecond was social administration, which included various forms of poverty relief. Statewide poverty relief could be said to have its roots in the English Poor Laws of the 17th century, but was first systematized through the efforts of the Charity Organisation Society. The third consisted of social action - rather than engaging in the resolution of immediate individual requirements, the emphasis was placed on political action working through the community and the group to improve their social conditions and thereby alleviate poverty. This approach was developed originally by the settlement house movement.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was accompanied by a less easily defined movement; the development of institutions to deal with the entire range of social problems. All had their most rapid growth during the nineteenth century, and laid the foundational basis for modern social work, both in theory and in practice.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessional social work originated in 19th century England, and had its roots in the social and economic upheaval wrought by the Industrial Revolution, in particular the societal struggle to deal with the resultant mass urban-based poverty and its related problems. Because poverty was the main focus of early social work, it was intricately linked with the idea of charity work.[8] (Today, it is common for social workers to find themselves dealing with consequences arising from other social problems such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and discrimination based on age or on physical or mental disability.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the decline of feudalism in 16th century England, the indigent poor came to be seen as a more direct threat to the social order.[10] As they were often not associated to a particular feudal manor, the government moved towards the formation of an organized poverty relief system to care for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origins of the English Poor Law system can be traced as far back as late medieval statutes dealing with beggars and vagrancy but it was only during the Tudor period that the Poor Law system became codified. Monasteries, the primary source of poor relief, were dissolved by the Tudors Reformation causing poor relief to move from a largely voluntary basis to a compulsory tax that was collected at a parish level.[11] Early legislation was concerned with vagrants and making the able-bodied work, especially while labour was in short supply following the Black Death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first complete code of poor relief was made in the Act for the Relief of the Poor 1597 and some provision for the \\"deserving poor\\" was eventually made in the Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601.[12] It created a system administered at parish level,[13] paid for by levying local rates on rate payers.[14] Relief for those too ill or old to work, the so-called 'impotent poor', was in the form of a payment or items of food ('the parish loaf') or clothing also known as outdoor relief. Some aged people might be accommodated in parish alms houses, though these were usually private charitable institutions. Meanwhile, able-bodied beggars who had refused work were often placed in Houses of Correction or even subjected to beatings to mend their attitudes.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs populations grew in Colonial America, almhouses were built to house vulnerable people with no other support, including people with a long term illness or older people without families.  The first recorded Almshouse was built in 1713 near Philadelphia by William Penn, and was only open to Quakers. A second one was built nearby in 1728, this time with public money. In 1736 New York opened the Poor House of the City of New York (later renamed Bellevue Hospital) and in 1737 New Orleans opened the Saint John's Hospital to serve the poor of the city.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Poor Law Amendment Act completely overhauled the existing system in Britain[17]  and established a Poor Law Commission to oversee the national operation of the system.[18]  This included the forming together of small parishes into Poor Law Unions[19] and the building of workhouses in each union for the giving of poor relief. Although the aim of the legislation was to reduce costs to rate payers, one area not reformed was the method of financing of the Poor Law system which continued to be paid for by levying a \\"poor rate\\"[20] on the property owning middle classes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Poor Law Amendment Act did not ban all forms of outdoor relief,[21] it stated that no able-bodied person was to receive money or other help from the Poor Law authorities except in a workhouse. Conditions in workhouses were to be made harsh to discourage people from claiming. Workhouses were to be built in every parish and, if parishes were too small, parishes could group together to form Workhouse Unions. The Poor Law Commissioners were to be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Act.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 19th century saw a great leap forward in technological and scientific achievement. There was also a great migration to urban areas throughout the Western world, which led to many social problems. This galvanised the socially active, prosperous middle and upper classes to search for ways to ameliorate the physical and spiritual conditions of the poor underclasses.[22] This was coupled with a religious revival, and many Protestant mission efforts (urban missions), attempted to resolve the problems inherent in large cities like poverty, prostitution, disease, and other afflictions. A new philosophy of \\"scientific charity\\" emerged, which stated charity should be \\"secular, rational and empirical as opposed to sectarian, sentimental, and dogmatic.[23]\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this time, rescue societies were initiated to find more appropriate means of self-support for women involved in prostitution.[citation needed] State-built Mental asylums were built from the 1840s to assist in taking care of the mentally ill.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost historians identify the Charity Organization Society, founded by Helen Bosanquet and Octavia Hill in London in 1869,[24] as the pioneering organization of the social theory that led to the emergence of social work as a professional occupation.[7] COS had its main focus on individual casework. It supported the concept of self-help and limited government intervention to deal with the effects of poverty. The organisation claimed to use \\"scientific principles to root out scroungers and target relief where it was most needed\\".[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlsager Hay Hill was prominent from its foundation, acting as honorary secretary of the council until July 1870, and as an active member of the council until 1880.[26] Hill also worked as an almoner to the Society for the Relief of Distress in the East of London. He campaigned about the many flaws in the poor laws and urged for a more scientific classification of paupers. His 1867 pamphlet, on Our Unemployed, was one of the earliest attempts to highlight the problem of systemic unemployment;  he suggested a national system of labour registration. In 1871, Hill pioneered a system of labour exchanges in England, establishing 'The Employment Inquiry Office and Labour Registry,'. There, Hill advised applicants for assistance, and founded and edited Labour News to improve communication between masters and men seeking work.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nOctavia Hill is regarded by many as the founder of modern social work. She was a moving force behind the development of social housing, and her early friendship with John Ruskin enabled her to put her theories into practice with the aid of his initial investment. She believed in self-reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal. Under her guidance, the Charity Organisation Society organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis for modern social work.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe also provided housing for the poor; after being improved her properties were let to those on intermittent and low incomes. At the heart of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill conceived this as a job for women only. She and her assistants, including Emma Cons combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and getting to know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers.[28] At first Hill believed, \\"Voluntary workers are a necessity. They are better than paid workers, and can be had in sufficient numbers.\\"[29] Later, she found it expedient to maintain a paid workforce.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nHill's principles were summed up in an article of 1869: \\"Where a man persistently refuses to exert himself, external help is worse than useless.\\" She was an outspoken critic of the principles of \\"outdoor relief\\" or the Speenhamland system of poor relief as operated by various Poor Law Boards. Because these systems did not encourage recipients to work, she regarded them as \\"a profligate use of public funds.\\"[30] Under her methods, personal responsibility was encouraged. She insisted on dealing with arrears promptly; she appointed reliable caretakers; she took up of references on prospective tenants, and visited them in their homes; she paid careful attention to allocations and the placing of tenants, with regard to size of families and the size and location of the accommodation to be offered; and she made no rules that could not be properly enforced.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nA stress on social action that developed in the 1880s, was pioneered by the Settlement house movement.[31] This Movement (creating integrated mixed communities of rich and poor) grew directly out of Octavia Hill's work. Her colleagues Samuel and Henrietta Barnett, founded Toynbee Hall, Oxford House[32] in 1884 in Bethnal Green as the first university-sponsored settlement. Another early organization was Mansfield House Settlement, also in east London.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe settlement was named after Arnold Toynbee, an economic historian who's intellectual work laid the foundations of the movement. Toynbee was actively involved in improving the living conditions of the labourer. He read for workers in large industrial centres and encouraged the creation of trade unions and co-operatives. A focal point of his commitment was the slum of Whitechapel, in east London, where he helped to establish public libraries for the working class population. Toynbee also encouraged his students to offer free courses for working class audiences in their own neighbourhoods.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn America, the settlement movement was established by Jane Addams, a young medical student, and Ellen Gates Starr after Addams visited Toynbee Hall and was impressed by the system. She founded Chicago's Hull House in 1889, which focused on providing education and recreational facilities for European immigrant women and children.[32] By 1913, there were 413 settlements in 32 states.[33] The house was both a community service centre and a social research program.  Precursors to modern social work arose at Hull House as health professionals began to work with social determinants of poor health.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of the Settlement house movement was to bring upper and middle class students into lower-class neighbourhoods, not only to provide education and social aid, but to actually live and work together with their inhabitants. This soon inspired a worldwide movement of university settlements. The idea was to help members of the future elite understand the problems of wider society; this was especially important at a time when class divisions were much stronger, social mobility was minimal, and the living conditions of the poor were completely unknown to many members of the upper class.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe settlement movement focused on the causes of poverty through the \\"three Rs\\" - Research, Reform, and Residence. They provided a variety of services including educational, legal, and health services. These programs also advocated changes in social policy. Workers in the settlement movement immersed themselves in the culture of those they were helping. There were basic commonalities in the movement. These institutions were more concerned with societal causes for poverty, especially the changes that came with industrialization, rather than personal causes which their predecessors believed were the main reason for poverty. The settlement movement believed that social reform was best pursued and pushed for by private charities.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movement gave rise to many social policy initiatives and innovative ways of working to improve the conditions of the most excluded members of society. Participating universities settled students in slums to live and work alongside the poor local people. Settlement houses focused on education, savings, sports, and arts. The Poor Man's Lawyer service came about because a barrister volunteered his time and encouraged his friends to do the same. In general, the settlement movement, and settlement houses in particular, were \\"...a foundation for social work practice in this country\\".[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne important participant in the scheme was the philanthropist Charles Booth who published his study Life and Labour of the People in London in 1889 while working at Toynbee Hall. The study was the first systematic attempt at gathering comprehensive statistics and mapping poverty and influenced both social research and the fight against poverty for decades afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, these different organizations with their diverse intellectual underpinnings were beginning to coalesce into modern social work. Foundations were established to examine the root causes of social problems such as poverty, and social workers became more professional and scientific in their methodology. The Quaker philanthropist and chocolate manufacturer Joseph Rowntree believed that social evils could be tackled by systematic research, and to that end founded the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in 1904.[36] Rowntree wanted to tackle the root causes of social problems, rather than treating their symptoms. His Memorandum of 1904 stated: \\"I feel that much of the current philanthropic effort is directed to remedying the more superficial manifestations of weakness or evil, while little thought or effort is directed to search out their underlying causes ... [seek] to search out the under-lying causes of weakness or evil in the community, rather than ... remedying their more superficial manifestations.\\"[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nRowntree's son, Seebohm Rowntree, carried out a series of seminal surveys into poverty in the city of York that greatly influenced public and governmental attitudes towards poverty and deprivation. His first York study of 1899 (this was followed up in 1935 and 1951) was a comprehensive survey into the living conditions of the poor in York during which investigators visited every working class home. This amounted to the detailed study of 11,560 families or 46,754 individuals.[38] The results of this study were published in 1901 in his book Poverty, A Study of Town Life and claimed that 27.84 percent of the total population of York lived below the poverty line.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nRowntree defined the poverty line in terms of a minimum weekly sum of money \\"necessary to enable families... to secure the necessaries of a healthy life\\", including fuel and light, rent, food, clothing, and household and personal items. This was quantified using scientific methods that hadn't been applied to the study of poverty before. For example, he consulted leading nutritionists of the period to discover the minimum calorific intake and nutritional balance necessary before people got ill or lost weight. He then surveyed the prices of food in York to discover what the cheapest prices in the area for the food needed for this minimum diet were and used this information to set his poverty line.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn analysing the results of the investigation he found that people at certain stages of life, for example in old age and early childhood, were more likely to be in abject poverty, living below the poverty line, than at other stages of life. From this he formulated the idea of the poverty cycle[40] in which some people moved in and out of absolute poverty during their lives. Rowntree's argument that poverty was the result of low wages went against the traditionally held view that the poor were responsible for their own plight.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe differing approaches to social work often led to heated debates. In the early 20th century, Mary Richmond of the Charity Organization Society (COS) and Jane Addams of the Settlement House Movement engaged in a public dispute over the optimal approach; whether the problem should be tackled with COS' traditional, scientific method that focused on efficiency and prevention, or whether the Settlement House Movement's immersion into the problem, blurring the lines of practitioner and client, was superior.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nEven as schools of social work opened and formalized processes for social work began to be developed, the question \\"is social work a profession?\\" lingered. In 1915, at the American National Conference of Charities and Corrections, Dr. Abraham Flexner spoke on the topic \\"Is Social Work a Profession?\\" He contended that it was not because it lacked specialized knowledge and specific application of theoretical and intellectual knowledge to solve human and social problems.[43] This led to the professionalization of social work, concentrating on case work and the scientific method..\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first professional medical social workers in England were called hospital almoners, and were based in medical institutions. The Royal Free Hospital, London hired Mary Stewart as the first almoner in 1895. Her role was to assess people requesting treatment at the hospital to ensure that they were considered \\"deserving enough\\" of the free treatment. The role soon developed to cover the provision of other social programs, and by 1905 other hospitals had created similar roles.  By this time, the Hospital Almoners Council had been formed to oversee the new profession.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first professional medical social workers to be hired in the United States were Garnet Pelton (6 months) and Ida Cannon (40 years), in 1905 at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Richard Clarke Cabot was a key advocate in the creation of the role, as he believed there to be a link between tuberculosis and sanitary conditions. Both Pelton and Cannon had trained as nurses before taking up the role. After graduating from Simmons College in 1907, Cabot was in charge of the outpatient ward of the hospital, and together with the newly created social workers, they redefined the way in which health and wellbeing was managed. The economic, social, family and psychological conditions that underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with were recognised for the first time. Social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors, the former concentrating on physiological health, and the latter on social health. In addition to this, he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis approach soon spread through other American hospitals, and in 1911, there were 44 social work departments in 14 different cities. Two years later, the number of social work departments had grown to 200. After 1905, most social workers were trained as nurses. The American Association of Hospital Social Workers was set up in 1918 to increase the links between formal education and hospital practice.  In 1929 there were ten university courses in medical social work.  Around this time, psychiatry and psychology began to compete with social work as the complementary discourse to medicine in hospitals. Social work practice adapted to this by aligning itself more closely with psychoanalytic ideas, and became less concerned with living conditions and social health. While this detracted from the social concerns, it added a more scientific basis to dealing with patients, and challenging behaviours were more likely to be seen as a mental dysfunction than poor moral character.[16]  The increase of social spending after World War Two saw another rise in the number of social workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the problem of poverty moved up the public agenda, it became increasingly clear that laissez-faire economic policies were not working and that governments had to take proactive measures to reduce poverty, rather than leave the task to privately run organizations. The principles of classical liberalism were being increasingly challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities, and the agitation of organized labour. New liberals began to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state.[44] A liberal convert to greater government intervention was Thomas Hill Green, who believed that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences. The state should intervene only where there is a clear, proven and strong tendency of a liberty to enslave the individual.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis strand began to coalesce into the social liberalism movement at the turn of the twentieth century in Britain.[46] In their view, the poverty, squalor, and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. In the early 1900s, the Liberals under H.H. Asquith introduced various reforms, including health insurance, unemployment insurance, and pensions for elderly workers, thereby laying the groundwork for the future British welfare state.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Beveridge, often called the 'architect of the welfare state', was pivotal in framing the debate about social work in the context of state welfare provision. His 1942 report on Social Insurance and Allied Services,[48] known commonly as the Beveridge Report, identified five \\"Giant Evils\\" in society: squalor, ignorance, want, idleness, and disease, and went on to propose widespread reform to the system of social welfare to mitigate these problems.[49] The report proved very popular with a war-weary public, and went on to form the basis to the post-war expansion of the Welfare State and the creation of the National Health Service, a free at the point of delivery healthcare provider.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, social work is known for its critical and holistic approach to understanding and intervening in social problems. This has led, for example, to the recognition of poverty as having a social and economic basis rooted in social policies rather than representing a personal moral defect. This trend also points to another historical development in the evolution of social work: once a profession engages  in social control, it is directed at social and personal empowerment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not to say that modern social workers do not engage in social control (consider, for example, child protection workers), and many, if not most, social workers likely would agree that there is an ongoing tension between these forces within the profession. For example, see the debate between structural social work and humanistic social work.[50]","input":"When did social work start in the uk?"},{"output":"was elected by the enfranchised voters","context":"Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies of North America shared many attributes.

Courts enforced the common law of England. The Governor's Council or the Governor's Court was a body of senior advisers to the appointed royal Governor in each province.\\r\\nThe legislative body, which went by various names from colony to colony and through time, was elected by the enfranchised voters. By 1755, most free white men could vote.

Others were appointed in order to have a representative cross-section of the diverse interests in the colony. Council members were theoretically subject to approval by the London government, either the Secretary of State for the Southern Department, or after 1768 the Secretary of State for the Colonies.[2] In practice, the distance and delay in communications meant that a veto occurred only in rare cases.\\r\\nThe council as a whole would sit as the supreme court for the colony, as was needed. On the local level, justices of the peace periodically convened a county court session.\\r\\nAs with the House of Lords the council had to approve new laws, which usually originated in the legislature.

Land ownership was widespread, however, which meant that most white men were able to cast a vote.\\r\\nTax issues and budget decisions originated in the assembly.

As the American Revolution drew near, this subject was a point of contention and conflict between the provincial assemblies and their respective governors.[2]\\r\\nThe perennial struggles between the colonial governors and the assemblies are sometimes viewed, in retrospect, as signs of a rising democratic spirit. However, those assemblies generally represented the privileged classes, and they were protecting the colony against unreasonable executive encroachments.\\r\\nLegally, the crown governor's authority was unassailable.

Created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger, the character debuted in More Fun Comics #73 (November 1941).[1] Initially a backup feature in DC's anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes of a solo title. During the late 1950s and 1960s superhero-revival period known as the Silver Age, he was a founding member of the Justice League. In the 1990s Modern Age, Aquaman's character became more serious than in most previous interpretations, with storylines depicting the weight of his role as king of Atlantis.[2]\\r\\nThe character's original 1960s animated appearances left a lasting impression, meaning Aquaman is widely recognized in popular culture. Jokes about his wholesome portrayal in Super Friends and perceived weaker powers and abilities have been staples of comedy programs and stand-up routines,[3] leading DC at several times to attempt to make the character edgier or more powerful in comic books. Modern comic book depictions have attempted to reconcile these various aspects of his public perception, casting Aquaman as serious and brooding, saddled with an ill reputation, and struggling to find a true role and purpose beyond his public side as a deposed king and a fallen hero.[4]\\r\\nAquaman has been adapted for screen many times, first appearing in animated form in the 1967 The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure and then in the related Super Friends program. Since then he has appeared in various animated productions, including prominent roles in the 2000s series Justice League Unlimited and Batman: The Brave and the Bold, as well as several DC Universe Animated Original Movies. Actor Alan Ritchson also portrayed the role in live action in the television show Smallville. Jason Momoa portrayed the character in the 2016 film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and will reprise his role in the DC Extended Universe, including a solo film (Aquaman) in 2018.[5][6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAquaman's first origin story was presented in flashback from his debut in More Fun Comics #73 (November 1941), narrated by the character himself:\\r\\nThe story must start with my father, a famous undersea explorerif I spoke his name, you would recognize it. My mother died when I was a baby, and he turned to his work of solving the ocean's secrets. His greatest discovery was an ancient city, in the depths where no other diver had ever penetrated. My father believed it was the lost kingdom of Atlantis. He made himself a water-tight home in one of the palaces and lived there, studying the records and devices of the race's marvelous wisdom. From the books and records, he learned ways of teaching me to live under the ocean, drawing oxygen from the water and using all the power of the sea to make me wonderfully strong and swift. By training and a hundred scientific secrets, I became what you seea human being who lives and thrives under the water.\\r\\nIn his early Golden Age appearances, Aquaman can breathe underwater and control fish and other underwater life for up to a minute. Initially, he was depicted as speaking to sea creatures \\"in their own language\\" rather than telepathically, and only when they were close enough to hear him (within a 20 yards (18?m) radius). Aquaman's adventures took place all across the world, and his base was \\"a wrecked fishing boat kept underwater,\\" in which he lived.[8]\\r\\nDuring his wartime adventures, most of Aquaman's foes were Nazi U-boat commanders and various Axis villains where he once worked with the All-Star Squadron. The rest of his adventures in the 1940s and 1950s had him dealing with various sea-based criminals, including modern-day pirates such as his longtime archenemy Black Jack, as well as various threats to aquatic life, shipping lanes, and sailors.\\r\\nAquaman's last appearance in More Fun Comics was in issue #107, before being moved along with Superboy and Green Arrow to Adventure Comics, starting with issue #103 in 1946.\\r\\nAquaman's adventures continued to be published in Adventure Comics through the 1940s and 1950s, as one of the few superheroes to last through the 1950s in continuous publication. Starting in the late 1950s, new elements to Aquaman's backstory were introduced, with various new supporting characters added and several adjustments made to the character, his origins, his powers, and persona. The first of these elements was the story \\"Aquaman's Undersea Partner\\" in Adventure Comics #229 (October 1956), where his octopus sidekick, Topo, was first introduced. This and subsequent elements were later, after the establishment of DC's multiverse in the 1960s, attributed to the Aquaman of Earth-One.\\r\\nIn Adventure Comics #260 (May 1959) and subsequent Silver Age comics, it was revealed that Aquaman was Arthur Curry, the son of Tom Curry, a lighthouse keeper, and Atlanna, a water-breathing outcast from the lost, underwater city of Atlantis. Due to his heritage, Aquaman discovers as a youth that he possesses various superhuman abilities, including the powers of surviving underwater, communication with sea life, and tremendous swimming prowess. Eventually, Arthur decided to use his talents to become the defender of the Earth's oceans. It was later revealed that he had, in his youth, adventured as Aquaboy and on one occasion, met Superboy, Earth's only other publicly active superpowered hero at the time.[9] When Arthur grew up, he called himself \\"Aquaman\\".\\r\\nIt was later revealed that after Atlanna's death, Tom Curry met and married an ordinary human woman and had a son named Orm Curry, Aquaman's half-brother. Orm grew up as a troubled youth in the shadow of his brother, who constantly bailed him out of trouble with the law. He grew to hate Aquaman not only for the powers that he could never possess but also because he believed that their father would always favor Aquaman. Orm disappeared after becoming an amnesiac and would resurface years later as Aquaman's nemesis, Ocean Master.[10]\\r\\nAquaman's ability to talk with fish eventually expanded to full-fledged telepathic communication with sea creatures even from great distances. He also retroactively developed a specific weakness akin to Superman's vulnerability to kryptonite or Green Lantern's vulnerability to the color yellow: Aquaman had to come into contact with water at least once per hour, or he would die (prior to this story Aquaman could exist both in and out of water indefinitely.)[11]\\r\\nAquaman was included in the Justice League of America comic book series, appearing with the team in their very first adventure,[12] and was also a founding member of the team.[13] Aquaman took part in most of the 1960s adventures of the superhero team.\\r\\nAquaman's supporting cast and rogues gallery soon began to grow with the addition of Aqualad, an outcast, orphaned youth from an Atlantean colony whom Aquaman takes in and begins to mentor.[14] Aquaman later discovered the submerged fictional city of New Venice,[15] and which also becomes Aquaman's base of operations for a time.[16]\\r\\nAquaman is recognized as the son of Atlanna and is later voted to be the King after the death of the former regent, who has no heirs.[17] By this time Aquaman had met Mera,[18] a queen from a water-based dimension, and marries her shortly after he had become king.[17] They soon have a son, Arthur, Jr. (nicknamed \\"Aquababy\\").[19]\\r\\nThe 1960s series introduced other such archenemies as the Ocean Master (Aquaman's amnesiac half-brother Orm),[20] Black Manta,[21] the Fisherman,[22] the Scavenger,[23] and the terrorist organization known as O.G.R.E..[24] Other recurring members of the Aquaman cast introduced in this series include the well-meaning but annoying Quisp (a water sprite);[25] Dr. Vulko, a trustworthy Atlantean scientist who became Aquaman's royal adviser and whom Aquaman eventually appoints to be king after leaving the throne himself;[26] and Tula (known as \\"Aquagirl\\"), an Atlantean princess who was Aqualad's primary love interest.[27]\\r\\nIn the mid-1980s, after his own feature's demise, Aquaman is briefly made the leader of the Justice League of America. In a storyline in Justice League of America #228ÿ230, an invasion of Earth by a race of Martians occurs at a time when the core members are missing. Aquaman is thus forced to defend Earth with a League much-depleted in power and capability, and he takes it upon himself to disband the Justice League altogether in Justice League of America Annual #2 (1984), thereafter reforming it with new bylaws requiring members to give full participation to the League's cases.\\r\\nWith the help of veteran Justice League members Martian Manhunter, Zatanna, and Elongated Man, Aquaman recruits and trains four new and untried members, Gypsy, Vibe, Vixen, and Steel, also relocating the team's headquarters to a reinforced bunker in Detroit, Michigan after the destruction of the JLA's satellite headquarters during the invasion.[28] Aquaman's participation in this new version of the Justice League ended in #243 (October 1985), when he resigns to work on his marriage with Mera.\\r\\nAfter the 1985 Crisis on Infinite Earths miniseries, several short miniseries was produced in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, beginning with 1986's four-issue Aquaman (FebruaryÿMay 1986), written by Neal Pozner, and featuring Aquaman in a new, largely deep-sea blue, costume. The series was well received and a follow up limited series was in the works, though it was eventually canceled due to creative problems.[29] This series also expanded on several details of the Silver Age Aquaman's origin as well as Aquaman's relationship with his half-brother, Ocean Master, whose origin was retold in more complete detail. The series also added mystical elements to Aquaman's mythology and reinvented Ocean Master as a sorcerer. Aquaman reappeared in his blue costume in the Aquaman Special #1 (1988).\\r\\nIn late 1988, the character appeared in the \\"Invasion!\\" storyline, guest starring with the Doom Patrol, again in the orange and green costume.\\r\\nIn 1989, the Legend of Aquaman Special (officially titled as Aquaman Special #1 in the comic's legal indicia, the second Special in back-to-back years) rewrote Aquaman's mythos and origin, though keeping most of his Silver Age history intact. The special was written by writer Robert Loren Fleming, with plots/breakdown art by Keith Giffen and full pencil art by artist Curt Swan.\\r\\nThe Modern Age Aquaman is born as Orin to Queen Atlanna and the mysterious wizard Atlan in the Atlantean city of Poseidonis. As a baby, he was abandoned on Mercy Reef (which is above sea level at low tide, causing exposure to air which would be fatal to Atlanteans) because of his blond hair, which was seen by the superstitious Atlanteans as a sign of a curse they called \\"the Mark of Kordax.\\" The only individual who spoke up on Orin's behalf was Vulko, a scientist who had no patience for myth or superstition. While his pleas fell on deaf ears, Vulko would later become a close friend and advisor to the young Orin.\\r\\nAs a feral child who raised himself in the wilds of the ocean with only sea creatures to keep him company, Orin was found and taken in by a lighthouse keeper named Arthur Curry who named Orin \\"Arthur Curry\\" after himself. One day, Orin returns home and finds that his adoptive father has disappeared, so he sets off on his own. In his early teens, Orin ventures to the far north, where he meets and falls in love with an Inupiat girl named Kako. He also first earned the hatred of Orm, the future Ocean Master who was later revealed to be Arthur's half-brother by Atlan and an Inupiat woman.[30]\\r\\nAs detailed in the five-issue Aquaman limited series (JuneÿOctober 1989) (by the same creative team of the 1989 special of Robert Loren Fleming, Keith Giffen, and Curt Swan), which continued a few of the themes from the Legend of Aquaman Special, Mera is eventually driven insane by grief over the death of Arthur, Jr., and is committed to an asylum in Poseidonis. Shortly afterwards, an alien force conquers Atlantis. Arthur is forced to save the city but is hampered by an escaped Mera, who personally blames Arthur for the death of their son. In a fit of rage, Mera leaves Aquaman's dimension.\\r\\nThe publication of writer Peter David's The Atlantis Chronicles #1ÿ7 (MarchÿSeptember 1990), which tells the story of Atlantis from antediluvian times to Aquaman's birth, introduced the ancient Atlantean characters Orin (after whom Aquaman was named) and Atlan (who was revealed to be Aquaman's father).\\r\\nAnother Aquaman ongoing series with creative team Shaun McLaughlin and Ken Hooper (#1ÿ13) thereafter ran from December 1991 to December 1992, which portrayed Aquaman reluctantly deciding to remain in Poseidonis as its protector once again. For a time, he serves as Atlantis' representative to the United Nations but always finds himself thrust back into the superhero role. Becoming more and more of a workaholic and solitary figure, Aquaman eventually returns to the oceans. He soon becomes tangled up in another attempt by Black Manta to destroy Atlantis by dragging it into a war with a surface nation.\\r\\nPeter David returned to the character in another limited series, Aquaman: Time and Tide, a 1993ÿ1994 four-issue series which further explained Aquaman's origins, as he finally learns all about the history of his people through the Atlantis Chronicles, which are presented as historical texts passed down and updated through the centuries. Aquaman learns that his birth name was Orin and that he and his enemy Ocean Master share the same father, \\"an ancient Atlantean wizard\\" named Atlan. This revelation sends Orin into a bout of rage and depression, setting the stage for later confrontations between the two, as it is said in the Chronicles that \\"two brothers will also battle for control of Atlantis\\". This is in contrast to the Silver Age Aquaman, who had always known that the Ocean Master was his half-brother Orm, although Orm's amnesia prevented him from remembering that fact for some time. This series is credited by Kevin Melrose of Comic Book Resources with helping the character reach the height of his modern-era popularity.[31]\\r\\nAquaman starred in his own series again with the publication of the fifth volume of Aquaman #1 (August 1994), initially scripted by Peter David, following up on his 1993 Time and Tide miniseries. This series was the longest-running for the character, lasting until its 75th issue. David left the series after issue #46 (July 1998) after working on it for nearly four years.\\r\\nDavid began by giving Aquaman an entirely new look, forsaking his former clean-cut appearance. Following his discoveries reading the Atlantis Chronicles during Time and Tide, Aquaman withdraws from the world for a time. Garth finds him weeks later, with his hair and beard grown long, brooding in his cave. Aquaman loses his left hand when the madman Charybdis steals his ability to communicate with sea life and sticks Arthur's hand into a piranha-infested pool.[32] This causes Aquaman to become somewhat unhinged, and he begins having prophetic dreams, and then, in need of a \\"symbol\\", attaches a harpoon spearhead to his left arm in place of his missing hand. His classic orange shirt is shredded in a battle with Lobo,[33] and rather than replace it, he goes shirtless for a while before donning a gladiatorial manica.[34] After the destruction of the harpoon,[35] Aquaman has it replaced with a cybernetic prosthetic from S.T.A.R. Labs.[36] This new harpoon has a retractable reel that he can fully control.\\r\\nA major storyline, culminating in #25, concerns the Five Lost Cities of Atlantis. Facing an unearthly invading species linked to the origin of the Atlanteans, Aquaman has to search out and unite the lost cities. This storyline establishes him as a Warrior King and a major political power, ruling largely undisputed over all the Atlantean cities. The remainder of Peter David's run focused on Orin coming to terms with his genetic heritage and his role as a king. During this time he discovers the remnants of a sentient alien ship beneath Poseidonis and is able to take control of it, returning Poseidonis to the surface and bringing Atlantis into greater contact with the outside world. The cultural changes this brings about, including increased tourism, as well as his conflicting duties as superhero and king, bring him into increasing tension with the political powers in his city.\\r\\nAfter a brief stint by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, David was replaced as writer by Erik Larsen with issue #50 (December 1998) and again by Dan Jurgens in issue #63 (January 2000). The series ended with #75 (January 2001). During this time his wife Mera returns, now sane again, from the otherworldly dimension where she had been trapped, and Aquaman narrowly averts a coup d'tat orchestrated by his son Koryak and his advisor Vulko. His second harpoon is also destroyed, this time in a battle with Noble, King of the Lurkers; he replaces it with a golden prosthetic hand developed by Atlantean scientists which can change shape at his command, thus retaining the powers of the harpoon but being more all-purpose. After a brief war with an island nation, Aquaman expands Atlantis' surface influence by annexing the country to Atlantis.\\r\\nAquaman had no regular series of his own from 2001ÿ2003, but his plot went through several developments via his cameo appearances in several other titles.\\r\\nAquaman had rejoined the JLA when it reforms[37] and remains an active, if sometimes reluctant member of that team until the \\"Our Worlds at War\\" storyline in 2001 (shortly after the cancellation of Aquaman vol. 5), during which Aquaman and the city of Poseidonis disappear during a battle between Aquaman and an Imperiex probe.\\r\\nThe Justice League eventually find that the city was still there, just magically shielded, but in ruins and apparently uninhabited. The Atlanteans are trapped in the ancient past, where Tempest had sent them as a last measure when it appeared that the city would be destroyed by the probe. There, however, they are enslaved by their own Atlantean ancestors, led by a powerful sorceress named Gamemnae, and Aquaman himself is transformed into living water and imprisoned in an ornamental pool. Over time, this civilization had collapsed until only Gamemnae herself, now immensely powerful, inhabited the ruins.\\r\\nAfter a few months of their time but fully fifteen years for the Atlanteansthe JLA free Aquaman in \\"The Obsidian Age\\" storyline in JLA.[38] Although the original League is killed by Gamemnae, their souls are contained by the magician Manitou Raven to use in a spell to contain Gamemnae in Atlantis until the present day, when he is able to resurrect them. With the aid of Nightwing, Hawkgirl, Firestorm, Zatanna and Manitou Raven. The first four are members of the Reserve JLA that had been put together by a program created by Batman that automatically activates after the League vanishes into the past with the aid of the Manitou Raven of their time. Aquaman is freed from his prison in the pool, and Zatanna enhances his powers so that he can now control the entire ocean as a water wraith. With this power, Aquaman is able to sever Gamemnae's connection to the city by sinking it under the sea again. While he fights Gamemnae, the League members return the modern Atlanteans to the present, where they can begin rebuilding the city, which in the present too is once again at the bottom of the sea.\\r\\nA sixth Aquaman series began shortly afterwards, initially written by Rick Veitch who sought to take Aquaman in a more mystical direction. Subsequent writers who contributed to the series include John Ostrander, Will Pfeifer, Tad Williams, and John Arcudi. This series ran 57 issues starting in December 2002 (cover dated February 2003); starting with #39 (April 2006), following the events of the \\"Infinite Crisis\\" storyline, it was renamed Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis.\\r\\nFollowing the \\"One Year Later\\" storyline (starting with Aquaman vol. 6, #40, May 2006), the series was renamed Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis and taken in an entirely different direction by writer Kurt Busiek. Aquaman is missing and presumed dead. A youth by the name of \\"Arthur Joseph Curry\\" is summoned by the mysterious Dweller in the Depths to take up the mantle of Aquaman, but it gradually emerges that the Dweller himself is Aquaman, having lost much of his memory and been strangely mutated while gaining magical powers. (See the Arthur Joseph Curry section, below.)\\r\\nThese changes were explained later during the \\"missing year\\" depicted in the weekly series 52. Aquaman makes a brief appearance at the memorial for Superboy. Sometime later Ralph Dibny, seemingly accompanied by Dr. Fate's helmet, meets a bearded, long-haired, and amnesic Orin in the ruins of Atlantis. The helmet portends that \\"if he lives... if he lives... it is as a victim of the magicks of legend and the power of the sea.\\"[39]\\r\\nOrin makes a deal with the gods of the sea in a desperate bid to gain the power to save the lives of several Sub Diego inhabitants who had lost the ability to live in water. Using the bones of his severed left hand in a magical ritual, the sea gods give Orin the power to raise Sub Diego onto dry land. However, as a side effect of this, Orin mutates into the \\"Dweller of the Depths\\", and loses his memories.[40] The fate he foresaw for Arthur Joseph Curry was a confused memory of his own past.\\r\\nIn the midst of trying to help his successor, Orin is murdered by Narwhal.[41] Upon the receipt of Orin's body, members of the Justice League of America, including Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, and the Flash, examine the body in Atlantis and wish the best for Mera and the new Aquaman.[42]\\r\\nOrin seemingly reappears in Atlantis during the 2008 \\"Final Crisis\\" storyline to fend off the forces of Darkseid, but this Aquaman is revealed to be from another Earth in the multiverse.[43][44] The appearance of this Aquaman is later perceived by Hal Jordan and Barry Allen as an unsubstantiated rumor, since this person was never seen nor heard from again.[45] Sometime between his death and the beginning of the 2008ÿ09 \\"Blackest Night\\" storyline, Orin's body is moved and buried on land at Mercy Reef alongside Tom Curry in accordance with his final wishes.[46]\\r\\nIn Blackest Night #1, Garth returns to Atlantis and tells Orin's wife Mera that he is angry at the notion of Aquaman's body being buried on land. Mera relays to Tempest that Orin felt safe on land and that it is indeed what he wanted. Sometime later, a black power ring is seen entering Orin's grave, bidding him to rise.[46] Aquaman's corpse rises, along with those of Tula and Dolphin as revenant members of the Black Lantern Corps, and demands that Mera reunite with him in death, offering her a chance to see her son again. Garth is killed and joins the Black Lanterns himself. Mera rejects the corpse before fleeing. In the climax of the miniseries, Aquaman is among those resurrected by The White Lantern Entity, and is reunited with Mera. Because the Black Lantern Ring helps reconstruct Orin's body, when he is resurrected his hand is restored as well.[47]\\r\\nAquaman and Mera spend the night together in the lighthouse of Amnesty Bay, but in the morning Mera finds Arthur on the dock looking at the sea and wondering why he was resurrected.[48] Later, they intercept a pirate vessel but Aquaman finds that he can only call on dead sea life to help him.[49]\\r\\nWhile cleaning up an oil spill, Aquaman and Mera are attacked by soldiers from Mera's homeworld, led by Siren. Mera reveals that she was sent to kill him.[50] She also hints that, despite the long-lasting exile of her people, Xebel's soldiers had been enemies of Black Manta himself from a distant time, even preceding the first public appearance of Aquaman, and states that, despite Mera's original mission being a solo one, Siren is now backed by the entire Death Squad, elite Xebel soldiers, at the orders of the acting princess. She later reveals that Siren is her younger sister.[51]\\r\\nAquaman is told by the White Lantern Entity to find Jackson Hyde before a second, unidentified group does.[52] Mera states that she knows who he is,[53] and after she tells him, Aquaman leaves, and rescues Jackson from a Xebel attack. It is revealed that Aquaman's Silver Age origin has been re-established and he is once again the half-human son of Tom Curry and an Atlantean queen.[54] The Entity subsequently reduces Aquaman to what appears to be white water.[55] Aquaman is revealed to be one of the Elementals, and was transformed by the Entity to become the element of water and protect the Star City forest from the Dark Avatar, which appears to be the Black Lantern version of the Swamp Thing.[56] After the Dark Avatar is defeated, Swamp Thing returns Aquaman to normal. Afterward, Aquaman is reunited with Mera, at which point he discovers that the Xebels' weapons were made of Atlantean technology.[57]\\r\\nAs part of The New 52, DC's 2011 relaunch of their entire superhero line, Geoff Johns, Ivan Reis and Joe Prado served as the initial creative team of the company's new Aquaman series, the first issue of which was released September 28, 2011.[58] The three creators remained on the title for the first 16 issues.[59] That subsequently lead into the first continual, Aquaman-related crossover in years \\"Throne of Atlantis\\".\\r\\nThe relaunched series cements Aquaman's status as the half-human son of Tom Curry and Atlanna, and sees him return to Amnesty Bay with Mera. Greatly distressed by the harsh treatment given to the oceans during his time as ruler of Atlantis, Aquaman decides to abdicate the Atlantean throne and return to full-time heroics. However, he now struggles with his lack of reputation with the greater public, which views him as a lesser metahuman with less impressive powers than those of his peers.[60] He is also once again a founding member of the Justice League and is the main member of the team.[61] It is revealed in Aquaman #7 that early in his career, Aquaman had teamed with a mysterious loose-knit group of characters simply known as The Others, consisting of Aquaman himself, the South American jungle girl Ya'Wara and her panther, the Russian is known as Vostok-X, an ex-army veteran called Prisoner-of-War, The Operative, and the Iranian called Kahina the Seer. All of The Others have in their possession an enchanted relic from Atlantis. From 2014 to 2015, an independent Aquaman and the Others series was launched.\\r\\nThe 2015 \\"Convergence\\" storyline gives Aquaman a new look at issue #41. He has been deposed from his throne by Mera, now Queen of Atlantis, who is now hunting Aquaman as a fugitive. Along the way Arthur acquires some new powers and new equipment giving him access to powerful mystical capabilities. It is later revealed that Atlantis is really run by Mera's sister Siren, who has taken her prisoner.\\r\\nFollowing the company-wide rebranding in DC Rebirth with one focus point to bring back legacy and relationships, Arthur finally proposes to Mera in DC Universe: Rebirth #1. Aquaman was given an eighth volume of his eponymous series, which started with a one-shot comic book entitled Aquaman: Rebirth #1 (August 2016). This issue and the subsequent eighth volume of Aquaman kept writer Dan Abnett who had taken over the title of the three last issues in the New 52, having previously written the character for a short time a decade earlier.\\r\\nThe new series starts of focuses on Aquaman's role as king and diplomat, with Arthur attempting to strengthen Atlantis-surface relationships by opening an Atlantean embassy in Amnesty Bay, with Mera appointed as ambassador. The series largely sticks with the main cast of the New 52 series consisting of Aquaman, Mera, and Black Manta, while also fleshing out forgotten side characters such as Murk, Tula (Aquagirl), Black Jack, and others.\\r\\nArthur Joseph Curry is the second DC Comics superhero to be known as Aquaman. Created by Kurt Busiek and Jackson Guice, he first appeared in Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis #40 (May 2006). As part of DC Comics' One Year Later event, Aquaman's series was renamed Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis with issue #40 (May 2006). The new developments include a new lead character, a new supporting cast, and the inclusion of sword and sorceryÿtype fantasy elements in the series. The character was short-lived, and was not seen much leading up to the revival of Aquaman in the 2010 Blackest Night miniseries, and is not featured in DC continuity at all following its 2011 reboot, The New 52.\\r\\nArthur's story resembles versions of the original Aquaman's. While awaiting transport to Miami, Florida, a young man named Arthur Joseph Curry is washed out to sea when a storm ruptures the tank he is in. This Arthur Curry, much like the Golden Age Aquaman, is the son of oceanobiologist Dr. Phillip Curry. Arthur's mother, Elaine, died in childbirth and Dr. Curry was forced to use a mutagenic serum on his son when he was born three months premature. Arthur has lived his whole life in the main tank of his father's research facility at Avalon Cay, his only window to the outside world being television.\\r\\nShortly after his arrival in the sea, Arthur is mentally contacted by the mysterious \\"Dweller of the Depths\\", a deformed humanoid with tentacles instead of hair and a left hand made of water. The Dweller urges him to help King Shark, who still bears scars from a previous battle with Aquaman during the recent Crisis. The Dweller, confusing Arthur for Aquaman and calling him his \\"charge\\", tells Arthur and King Shark of a prophecy regarding Arthur's future, a prophecy which seems to be a distorted version of the original Aquaman's history. The Dweller reveals that the original Aquaman was \\"transformed into one akin to a great and terrible enemy of your people and became the vessel of power strange, ancient and terrible.\\"\\r\\nArthur's first trip causes him to meet many of Aquaman's supporting characters including Mera, the Sea Devils, Vulko, and eventually Ocean Master. During this adventure, the Dweller progressively realizes that he himself is the original Aquaman, despite having no memory of his former life.\\r\\nLater, Arthur finds a humanoid squid named Topo, a naive youth attracted by superheroics and seeking to become a sidekick, and Tempest, now amnesiac, unable to breathe water, and implanted with a post-hypnotic suggestion warning of an upcoming battle. The battle soon occurs, and the Dweller/Orin is apparently killed. The Justice League is called in to evaluate Orin's situation, but are unable to determine if he is truly dead, or if he can somehow resurrect himself due to his new magical nature.[42]\\r\\nIn Sword of Atlantis #57, the series' final issue, Aquaman is visited by the Lady of the Lake, who explains his origins. The original Aquaman had given a sample of his water hand to Dr. Curry in order to resurrect Curry's dead son, Arthur, whom he had named after Orin. When Orin attempted to resurrect Sub Diego, a part of his soul attached itself to the dead body of Arthur Joseph Curry, while Orin mutated into the Dweller. Blaming himself for Orin's death, Aquaman vows to never be called \\"Arthur\\" again, refraining from using the \\"stolen\\" name, asking only to be called Joseph in the future.[62]\\r\\nJoseph is considered as a candidate for the new Outsiders by Batman. After seeing him in action with Metamorpho, however, Batman decides against his induction.[63]\\r\\nIn their quest to rid the Earth of all forms of kryptonite, Superman and Batman journey deep below the sea and find a large amount of it. The two of them are met with hostility by Aquaman and King Shark. A brief fight ensues, but eventually, Joseph allows them to take the kryptonite. Before doing so, he points out that not everyone may want Superman to find all of Earth's kryptonite, and that he would have to be at least part human to know that.[64]\\r\\nJoseph Curry would continue to be the stand-in king of Atlantis until after the \\"Final Crisis\\" storyline. It was revealed that Joseph had stepped down from his position due to being unable to deal with the pressure of carrying on Orin's legacy. Tempest later finds Joseph's trident and costume draped over Orin's throne, confirming that he had abandoned his duties.[65]\\r\\nAquaman's most widely recognized power is the telepathic ability to communicate with marine life, which he can summon from great distances. Although this power is most often and most easily used on beings that live in the sea, Aquaman has at times demonstrated the ability to affect any being that lives upon the sea (e.g., sea eagles), or even any being evolved from marine life (e.g., humans and some aliens). Before the New 52 Aquaman had access to a morphogenic field phenomenon called The Clear, an existential effigy that connects all oceanic and sea related life together as a whole, allowing him to empathize and share in the experiences of all aquatic based lifeforms. Per the 2011 DC continuity reboot, Aquaman's telepathy has been greatly downplayed: acknowledging that most marine life doesn't possess enough intelligence to carry a meaningful telepathic communication, Aquaman is now stated to simply add compulsions and needs in the mindset of aquatic life, compelling them to do his bidding by a subtle altering of their cerebellum.[60] He has shown to have been blessed by the Sea God Poseidon possibly regaining a stronger but latent connection to The Clear when he was shown to bend the poisonous bile emitting from an old world structure that had intruded from the sea poisoning it with dark magic, developing some liquid manipulatory abilities.[66] This blessing also gave him a protective charm against the foul magics of the Thule dimension it had originated from.\\r\\nThe character has a number of other superhuman powers, most of which derive from the fact that he is adapted to live and thrive in the harshest of underwater environments. He has the ability to breathe underwater and possesses a superhuman physique strong enough for his lungs to work unaffected by the immense pressure and the cold temperature of the ocean depths, also making him tough enough to withstand attacks from superhuman opponents and resist machine gun fire.[67] He also possesses superhuman strength as a result.[68] Aquaman possesses superhuman strength, but his strength is always underrated, considering the company that he keeps. Aquaman frequently displays feats of Super-Atlantean (the average Atlantean can lift/press approximately 2 tons) and Superhuman strength. While not on par with Superman and Wonder Woman, he has proven capable of leaps up to 6 miles.[69] He threw an 8000-ton Soviet sub from the ocean floor (2.5 miles deep) to the surface and completely out of the water.[70] Aquaman and Wonder Woman both pulled a Naval Super Carrier through the ocean and onto land, They weigh at the least 70,000 tons or 140,000,000?lbs.[71] He single-handedly fights and defeats one of DC's most feared and toughest to defeat villains The Shaggy Man whose power and abilities are on par with Doomsday.[72] He has lifted a 200-ton cruise ship completely out of the water.[73] He has broken off a tectonic plate sending it crashing down to the ocean floor.[74] He can swim at very high speeds, capable of reaching speeds of 3,000?meters per second[67] (10,800?km [roughly 6,700 miles] per hour) and can swim up Niagara Falls.[75] He also has swum to the four corners of the world gathering magic crystals needed to save the earth all within a few hours,[71] and outswam a jet going hypersonic speed (6000?mph).[76] He can see in near total darkness and has enhanced hearing, granting limited sonar.[2]\\r\\nAlthough, Aquaman can remain underwater indefinitely without suffering any ill effects, he grows weak if he remains on land for extended periods. However, when Batman invented Aquaman's water suit he was able to walk on land for an indefinite amount of time and was no longer vulnerable to a \\"dehumidifier\\".[2] This weakness was later removed from continuity in 2011, establishing that he grew up on land before learning of his Atlantean heritage,[77] but he still runs the risk of dying by dehydration within incredibly hostile environments.[78] AC had been bestowed an ability he never showcased before gifted unto him by an old Sea Monarch, so far one of the said proclivities granted to him was the ability of unaided flight under his own power.[79]\\r\\nBefore the New 52, the Trident, granted by Poseidon to the rightful ruler and protector of the seas, was indestructible and a very powerful melee weapon, able to destroy the very powerful Imperiex Probes for instance, which Aquaman wielded with unmatched skill. Apart from its power as a melee weapon, the Trident also had the power to manipulate water, fire bolts of powerful energy and act as a focus to amplify the magical power of others, most notably Tempest. In the New 52, the Trident is now part of a collection of seven very powerful Atlantean magical items, forged by the first king of Atlantis who calls himself 'The Dead King'. Thought to be the most powerful weapon of the set, with the possible exception of the recently discovered seventh item, the Trident is completely indestructible and able to hurt even the most powerful of opponents, such as the evil god Darkseid, with Aquaman being the only leaguer to puncture and make him bleed out. He was also able to break the mystical barrier of Dr. Graves which was deemed indestructible at the time. In one instance, the Trident was shown glowing with magical power when Black Manta used the rest of the items to discover the hidden seventh one. For a time, Aquaman withheld the Trident of said aforementioned god of the oceans in his battles against the Thule and Rao's disciples, which gave him the power to summon tsunamis and deluges, call down thunder and lighting, project and control ice, move the earth making it rise and tremble at his command, as well as teleport himself from global to interplanetary distances using water as a medium. It could also transform into a gladius and back at will.[80] Arthur also uses both versions of the trident to boost the range his telepathy.[81]\\r\\nAfter the loss of his left hand, Aquaman initially replaced it with a cybernetic retractable hook, then a cybernetic hand. The mechanical hand was replaced by a magical hand made out of water, given to him by the Lady of the Lake, which grants Aquaman numerous abilities, including, but not limited to, the ability to dehydrate anyone he touches and kill them instantly, the ability to shoot jets of water from his hand, scalding or freezing, healing abilities, the ability to create portals into mystical dimensions acting as spontaneous transport, the ability to control almost any body of water he sets his focuses on[2] and the ability to communicate with the Lady of the Lake through the waterbearer hand.[82] His biological hand was restored when the character was resurrected in Blackest Night #8.\\r\\nOn rare occasions Aquaman has been transformed into a living body of sentient water, sometimes an extension of the seas themselves. This has been done on three occasion but he has shown his ability to cognitize himself quite masterfully in doing so, having once embodied the entire ocean in order to re-sink Atlantis during the Obsidian Age, then having been taken over by the ravenous Thirst entity before becoming The Waterbearer itself, and finally after his resurrection where he was de-materialized by the White Light of Life only to be reborn as a water elemental to aid against the rot imprinted Swamp Thing in Brightest Day #24.\\r\\nDuring the 2013 \\"Trinity War\\" storyline, Aquaman's Crime Syndicate counterpart is revealed to be Sea King. He apparently fails to survive the passage from Earth-3 to Prime Earth but is awakened in \\"Forever Evil: Blight\\"[91] after being possessed by Deadman.[92] The design of Sea King resembles that of 1990s Aquaman.[93]\\r\\nSince her comic book debut in November 1941, Aquaman has appeared in a number of adaptations. These formats include television shows, video games, and films.\\r\\nAquaman has made multiple appearances in television. The character was featured in the animated series Super Friends, Justice League, and Justice League Unlimited. He also appeared in the live-action television series Smallville.\\r\\nThe character has appeared in direct-to-DVD animated films such as Justice League: The New Frontier (2008) and Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox (2011).\\r\\nAquaman is featured within the live-action DCEU films played by Jason Momoa. Aquaman made his feature film debut in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and appears in Justice League (2017). The character will star in the upcoming film Aquaman scheduled for release in 2018, with Jason Momoa reprising his role as Aquaman.\\r\\nAquaman was listed as the 147th greatest comic book character of all time by Wizard magazine.[94] IGN also ranked Aquaman as the 53rd greatest comic book hero of all time, opining that \\"even though he'll forever be the butt of jokes thanks to his fishy powers, comic readers have come to love Aquaman as a noble (and very powerful) figure who is forever torn between the worlds of land and sea.\\"[95] In a 2011 reader poll, Parade magazine ranked Aquaman among the Top 10 Superheroes of All Time.[96]\\r\\nBy 2008, cultural critic Glen Weldon noted that Aquaman had become ridiculed by a popular mindset that cast him as an ineffectual hero. This was due to the perception that his heroic abilities were too narrow. Weldon wrote that critics and pop culture comedians who chose to focus on this had overplayed the joke, making it \\"officially the hoariest, hackiest arrow in the quiver of pop-culture commentary.\\"[97][98]","input":"When did the first aquaman comic come out?"},{"output":"two halves of 45 minutes each","context":"Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport.[3][4][5][6] The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal.\\r\\nPlayers are not allowed to touch the ball with outstretched hands or arms while it is in play, unless they are goalkeepers within their penalty area. Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use any other part of their body except the hands and the arms. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French: Fdration Internationale de Football Association), which organises World Cups for both men and women every four years.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rules of association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863 and the name association football was coined to distinguish the game from the other forms of football played at the time, specifically rugby football. The first written \\"reference to the inflated ball used in the game\\" was in the mid-14th century: \\"Te heued fro te body went, Als it were a foteballe\\".[8] The Online Etymology Dictionary states that the word \\"soccer\\" was \\"split off in 1863\\".[9] According to Partha Mazumdar, the term soccer originated in England, first appearing in the 1880s as an Oxford \\"-er\\" abbreviation of the word \\"association\\".[10]\\r\\nWithin the English-speaking world, association football is now usually called football in the United Kingdom and mainly soccer in Canada and the United States. People in Australia, Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand use either or both terms, although national associations in Australia and New Zealand now primarily use \\"football\\" for the formal name.[11]\\r\\nAccording to FIFA, the Chinese competitive game cuju (, literally \\"kick ball\\") is the earliest form of football for which there is evidence.[13] Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was kicking a ball through an opening into a net. It was remarkably similar to modern football, though similarities to rugby occurred.[14][15] During the Han Dynasty (206 BC ÿ 220 AD), cuju games were standardised and rules were established.[14]\\r\\nPhaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games.[16][17] An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a vase at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens[12] appears on the UEFA European Championship Cup.[18] Athenaeus, writing in 228 AD, referenced the Roman ball game harpastum. Phaininda, episkyros and harpastum were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognizable as modern football.[14][19][20][21][22][23] As with pre-codified \\"mob football\\", the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking.[24][25] Non-competitive games included kemari in Japan,[26] chuk-guk in Korea and woggabaliri in Australia.\\r\\nAssociation football in itself does not have a classical history.[18] Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe.[27] The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England. The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century AD.[28]\\r\\nThe Cambridge Rules, first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857,[29] which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.[30]\\r\\nThese ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street, London.[31] The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse. The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from Blackheath, withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of Ebenezer Cobb Morley, went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game.[31] These rules included handling of the ball by \\"marks\\" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.[32]\\r\\nThe world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by C. W. Alcock and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The first official international football match also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock. England is also home to the world's first football league, which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor.[33] The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England.\\r\\nThe laws of the game are determined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).[34] The board was formed in 1886[35] after a meeting in Manchester of The Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales, and the Irish Football Association. FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association.[36] The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the International Football Association Board in 1913. The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.[37]\\r\\nToday, football is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams,[38] while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet.[39][40] A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football.[41] Football has the highest global television audience in sport.[42]\\r\\nIn many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans, local communities, and even nations. R. Kapuscinski says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games.[43] The C?te d'Ivoire national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006[44] and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouak, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time.[45] By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras.[46] The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.[47]\\r\\nWomen may have been playing \\"football\\" for as long as the game has existed. Evidence shows that an ancient version of the game (Tsu Chu) was played by women during the Han Dynasty (25ÿ220 CE). Two female figures are depicted in Han Dynasty (25ÿ220 CE) frescoes, playing Tsu Chu.[48] There are, however, a number of opinions about the accuracy of dates, the earliest estimates at 5000 BCE.[49]\\r\\nAssociation football, the modern game, also has documented early involvement of women. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too.[50][51] In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play.[52] The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow. In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895.[52][53]\\r\\nThe most well-documented early European team was founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, \\"I founded the association late last year [1894], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most.\\" [54] Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game.[55]\\r\\nWomen's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the First World War, when employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men fifty years earlier. The most successful team of the era was Dick, Kerr's Ladies of Preston, England. The team played in the first women's international matches in 1920, against a team from Paris, France, in April, and also made up most of the England team against a Scottish Ladies XI in 1920, and winning 22-0.[50]\\r\\nDespite being more popular than some men's football events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd),[56] women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, on the grounds that the game (as played by women) was distasteful.[57] Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted.[58] This led to the formation of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.[59]\\r\\nAssociation football has been played by women since at least the time of the first recorded women's games in the late 19th century.[60][61] It has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom.[61] In the late 1960s and early 1970s women's association football was organised in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the most prominent team sport for British women.[61]\\r\\nThe growth in women's football has seen major competitions being launched at both national and international level mirroring the male competitions. Women's football has faced many struggles. It had a \\"golden age\\" in the United Kingdom in the early 1920s when crowds reached 50,000 at some matches;[62] this was stopped on 5 December 1921 when England's Football Association voted to ban the game from grounds used by its member clubs. The FA's ban was rescinded in December 1969 with UEFA voting to officially recognise women's football in 1971.[61] The FIFA Women's World Cup was inaugurated in 1991 and has been held every four years since,[63] while women's football has been an Olympic event since 1996.\\r\\nAssociation football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The game is played using a spherical ball of 68ÿ70?cm (27ÿ28?in) circumference,[64] known as the football (or soccer ball). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent his or her team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.[65]\\r\\nThe primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a throw-in restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around they may use any part of their body (notably, \\"heading\\" with the forehead)[66] other than their hands or arms.[67] Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though the ball cannot be received in an offside position.[68]\\r\\nDuring gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.[69]\\r\\nAt a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the 2005ÿ06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match.[70] The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper,[71] but a number of specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time.[72] The layout of a team's players is known as a formation. Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager.[73]\\r\\nThere are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).[74] In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football.\\r\\nEach team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.[71]\\r\\nThe basic equipment or kit players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards. An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals.[75][76] Headgear is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.[77]\\r\\nA number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three, though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches. Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or timewasting at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match.[78] IFAB recommends \\"that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team.\\" Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations.[79]\\r\\n A game is officiated by a referee, who has \\"full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed\\" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two assistant referees. In many high-level games there is also a fourth official who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.[80]\\r\\nThe ball is spherical with a circumference of between 68 and 70 centimetres (27 and 28?in), a weight in the range of 410 to 450 grams (14 to 16?oz), and a pressure between 0.6 and 1.1 bars (8.5 and 15.6 pounds per square inch) at sea level. In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic.[81][82]\\r\\nAs the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.[83]\\r\\nThe length of the pitch, or field, for international adult matches is in the range of 100ÿ110?m (110ÿ120?yd) and the width is in the range of 64ÿ75?m (70ÿ80?yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90ÿ120?m (100ÿ130?yd) length and 45ÿ90?m (50ÿ100?yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105?m (344?ft) long and 68?m (223?ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches;[84] however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.[85]\\r\\nThe longer boundary lines are touchlines, while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are goal lines. A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line.[86] The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be 24 feet (7.3?m) apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be 8 feet (2.4?m) above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.[87]\\r\\nIn front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5?m (18?yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5?m (18?yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.[88]\\r\\nA standard adult football match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time.[89] The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents,[90][91] but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. Stoppage time does not fully compensate for the time in which the ball is out of play, a 90 minute game typically involves about an hour of \\"effective playing time\\".[92] The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee.[89] Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1ÿ0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90?minutes had elapsed and the game was over.[93] The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.[94]\\r\\nIn league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock, some competitions may invoke replays.[95] A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of penalty shootouts (known officially in the Laws of the Game as \\"kicks from the penalty mark\\") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament. Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament (with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score).[65]\\r\\nIn competitions using two-legged matches, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required.[65]\\r\\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the IFAB experimented with ways of creating a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored (golden goal), or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time (silver goal). Golden goal was used at the World Cup in 1998 and 2002. The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was France's victory over Paraguay in 1998. Germany was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating Czech Republic in the final of Euro 1996. Silver goal was used in Euro 2004. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB.[96]\\r\\nUnder the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ball in play and ball out of play. From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:\\r\\nA foul occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of \\"penal fouls\\", punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick.[67]\\r\\nThe referee may punish a player's or substitute's misconduct by a caution (yellow card) or dismissal (red card). A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, and which results in a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been \\"booked\\", the referee writing the player's name in his official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of \\"unsporting behaviour\\" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute or substituted player. Non-players such as managers and support staff cannot be shown the yellow or red card, but may be expelled from the technical area if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner.[67]\\r\\nRather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as \\"playing an advantage\\".[102] The referee may \\"call back\\" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within \\"a few seconds\\". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.[103]\\r\\nThe referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final.[104] The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were incorrect.\\r\\nAlong with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, doping, age fraud and match fixing. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game.[105] Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card.[b] Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.[105]\\r\\nSanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on to clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, points deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the English and Scottish leagues will often deduct 10 points from a team that enters financial administration. Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.\\r\\nThe recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as futsal and beach soccer) is FIFA. The FIFA headquarters are located in Zrich, Switzerland. Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:[106]\\r\\nNational associations oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states, (for example: the Fdration Camerounaise de Football in Cameroon) but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example the Scottish Football Association in Scotland). 209 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations.[106]\\r\\nWhile FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the International Football Association Board, where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes.[37]\\r\\nThe major international competition in football is the World Cup, organised by FIFA. This competition takes place every four years since 1930 with the exception of 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled due to World War II. Approximately 190ÿ200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period.[c] The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games; the cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 FIFA World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet.[107][108][109][110] The current champion is Germany, which won its fourth title at the 2014 tournament in Brazil. FIFA Women's World Cup has been held every four years since 1991. Under the tournament's current format, national teams vie for 23 slots in a three-year qualification phase. (The host nation's team is automatically entered as the 24th slot.) The current champion is the United States, after winning their third title in the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.\\r\\nThere has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles.[111] Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) were the most prestigious international event. Originally, the tournament was for amateurs only.[36] As professionalism spread around the world, the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened. The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. Between 1948 and 1980, 23 out of 27 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only Sweden (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), Denmark (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and Japan (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. For the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the IOC decided to admit professional players. FIFA still did not want the Olympics to rival the World Cup, so a compromise was struck that allowed teams from Africa, Asia, Oceania and CONCACAF to field their strongest professional sides, while restricting UEFA and CONMEBOL teams to players who had not played in a World Cup. Since 1992 male competitors must be under 23 years old, and since 1996, players under 23 years old, with three over-23 year old players, are allowed per squad. A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.[112]\\r\\nAfter the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa Amrica (CONMEBOL), African Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the CONCACAF Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the OFC Nations Cup (OFC). The FIFA Confederations Cup is contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current FIFA World Cup champions and the country which is hosting the Confederations Cup. This is generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and does not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself. The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the UEFA Champions League in Europe and the Copa Libertadores in South America. The winners of each continental competition contest the FIFA Club World Cup.[113]\\r\\nThe governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season, normally comprising several divisions, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into tables, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament. At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division.[114]\\r\\nThe teams finishing at the top of a country's league may be eligible also to play in international club competitions in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named Apertura and Clausura (Spanish for Opening and Closing), awarding a champion for each.[115] The majority of countries supplement the league system with one or more \\"cup\\" competitions organised on a knock-out basis.\\r\\nSome countries' top divisions feature highly paid star players; in smaller countries and lower divisions, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs. The five top European leagues?ÿ the Bundesliga (Germany), Premier League (England),[116] La Liga (Spain), Serie A (Italy), and Ligue 1 (France)?ÿ attract most of the world's best players and each of the leagues has a total wage cost in excess of S600 million/?763 million/US$1.185 billion.[117]\\r\\nFootball hooliganism is the term used to describe disorderly, violent or destructive behaviour perpetrated by spectators at football events.[118][119]\\r\\nVariants of football have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. five-a-side football) play in non-field environments (i.e. beach soccer, indoor soccer, and futsal) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. paralympic association football).\\r\\nCasual games can be played with only minimal equipment?ÿ a basic game can be played on almost any open area of reasonable size with just a ball and items to mark the positions of two sets of goalposts. Such games can have team sizes that vary from eleven-a-side, can use a limited or modified subset of the official rules, and can be self-officiated by the players.","input":"How many minutes are in a professional soccer game?"},{"output":"between 1934 and 1957","context":"","input":"When was the lincoln tunnel built in new york?"},{"output":"Haight-Ashbury area","context":"The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California.[1][2] Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, psychedelia, experimental music, modal jazz, country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, and space rock,[3][4] for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams,[5][6] and for their devoted fan base, known as \\"Deadheads\\". \\"Their music,\\" writes Lenny Kaye, \\"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\\"[7] These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \\"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\\".[8] The band was ranked 57th by Rolling Stone magazine in its The Greatest Artists of All Time issue.[9] The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994[10] and a recording of their May 8, 1977 performance at Cornell University's Barton Hall was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2012.[11] The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide.\\r\\nThe Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s.[12][13][14] The founding members were Jerry Garcia (lead guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (rhythm guitar, vocals), Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums).[15] Members of the Grateful Dead had played together in various San Francisco bands, including Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead; he replaced Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and nonperforming lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history.[16] The other official members of the band are Tom Constanten (keyboards; 1968ÿ1970), John Perry Barlow (nonperforming lyricist; 1971ÿ1995)[17], Keith Godchaux (keyboards; 1971ÿ1979), Donna Godchaux (vocals; 1972ÿ1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979ÿ1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards, vocals; 1990ÿ1995).[18] Pianist Bruce Hornsby was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as a guest with the band on occasion before and after the tours.\\r\\nAfter the death of Garcia in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as the Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009. In 2015, the four surviving core members marked the band's 50th anniversary in a series of concerts that were billed as their last performances together.[19] There have also been several spin-offs featuring one or more core members, such as Dead & Company, Furthur, the Rhythm Devils, Phil Lesh & Friends, RatDog, and Billy & the Kids.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grateful Dead began their career as the Warlocks, a group formed in early 1965 from the remnants of a Palo Alto, California jug band called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions.[20] The band's first show was at Magoo's Pizza located at 639 Santa Cruz Avenue in suburban Menlo Park, California, on May 5, 1965. They were initially known as the Warlocks; coincidentally, the Velvet Underground (similarly influenced by avant-garde music) was also using that name on the East Coast.[21][22] The show was not recorded but the set list has been preserved. Gigging as a bar band,[23] the group quickly changed its name after finding out that another band of the same name (not the Velvet Underground, who by then had also changed their name) had signed a recording contract. The first show under the new name Grateful Dead was in San Jose, California on December 4, 1965, at one of Ken Kesey's Acid Tests.[24][25][26] Earlier demo tapes have survived, but the first of over 2,000 concerts known to have been recorded by the band's fans was a show at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco on January 8, 1966.[27] Later that month, the Grateful Dead played at the Trips Festival, an early psychedelic rock concert.[28]\\r\\nThe name \\"Grateful Dead\\" was chosen from a dictionary. According to Phil Lesh, in his autobiography (pp.?62), \\"... [Jerry Garcia] picked up an old Britannica World Language Dictionary ... [and] ... In that silvery elf-voice he said to me, 'Hey, man, how about the Grateful Dead?'\\" The definition there was \\"the soul of a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial.\\" According to Alan Trist, director of the Grateful Dead's music publisher company Ice Nine, Garcia found the name in the Funk & Wagnalls Folklore Dictionary, when his finger landed on that phrase while playing a game of Fictionary.[29] In the Garcia biography, Captain Trips, author Sandy Troy states that the band was smoking the psychedelic DMT at the time.[30] The term \\"grateful dead\\" appears in folktales of a variety of cultures. In mid-1969, Phil Lesh told another version of the story to Carol Maw, a young Texan visiting with the band in Marin County who also ended up going on the road with them to the Fillmore East and Woodstock. In this version, Phil said, \\"Jerry found the name spontaneously when he picked up a dictionary and the pages fell open. The words 'grateful' and 'dead' appeared straight opposite each other across the crack between the pages in unrelated text.\\"\\r\\nOther supporting personnel who signed on early included Rock Scully, who heard of the band from Kesey and signed on as manager after meeting them at the Big Beat Acid Test; Stewart Brand, \\"with his side show of taped music and slides of Indian life, a multimedia presentation\\" at the Big Beat and then, expanded, at the Trips Festival; and Owsley Stanley, the \\"Acid King\\" whose LSD supplied the tests and who, in early 1966, became the band's financial backer, renting them a house on the fringes of Watts and buying them sound equipment. \\"We were living solely off of Owsley's good graces at that time. ... [His] trip was he wanted to design equipment for us, and we were going to have to be in sort of a lab situation for him to do it,\\" said Garcia.[30]\\r\\nOne of the group's earliest major performances in 1967 was the Mantra-Rock Dancea musical event held on January 29, 1967, at the Avalon Ballroom by the San Francisco Hare Krishna temple. The Grateful Dead performed at the event along with the Hare Krishna founder Bhaktivedanta Swami, poet Allen Ginsberg, bands Moby Grape and Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, donating proceeds to the Krishna temple.[31][32] The band's first LP, The Grateful Dead, was released on Warner Brothers in 1967.\\r\\nClassically trained trumpeter Phil Lesh performed on bass guitar. Bob Weir, the youngest original member of the group, played rhythm guitar. Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan played keyboards and harmonica until shortly before his death in 1973 at the age of 27. Garcia, Weir, and McKernan shared the lead vocal duties more or less equally; Lesh only sang a few leads but his tenor was a key part of the band's three-part vocal harmonies. Bill Kreutzmann played drums, and in September 1967 was joined by a second drummer, New York native Mickey Hart, who also played a wide variety of other percussion instruments.\\r\\n1970 included tour dates in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the band performed at The Warehouse for two nights. On January 31, 1970, the local police raided their hotel on Bourbon Street, and arrested and charged a total of 19 people with possession of various drugs.[33] The second night's concert was performed as scheduled after bail was posted. Eventually the charges were dismissed, with the exception of those against sound engineer Owsley Stanley, who was already facing charges in California for manufacturing LSD. This event was later memorialized in the lyrics of the song \\"Truckin'\\", a single from American Beauty which reached number 64 on the charts.\\r\\nMickey Hart took time off from the Grateful Dead beginning in February 1971,[34] leaving Kreutzmann once again as the sole percussionist. Hart rejoined the Grateful Dead for good in October 1974. Tom \\"TC\\" Constanten was added as a second keyboardist from 1968 to 1970, while Pigpen also played various percussion instruments and sang.\\r\\nAfter Constanten's departure, Pigpen reclaimed his position as sole keyboardist. Less than two years later, in late 1971, Pigpen was joined by another keyboardist, Keith Godchaux, who played grand piano alongside Pigpen's Hammond B-3 organ. In early 1972, Keith's wife, Donna Jean Godchaux, joined the Grateful Dead as a backing vocalist.\\r\\nFollowing the Grateful Dead's \\"Europe '72\\" tour, Pigpen's health had deteriorated to the point that he could no longer tour with the band. His final concert appearance was June 17, 1972, at the Hollywood Bowl, in Los Angeles;[35] he died in March 1973 of complications from liver damage.[36]\\r\\nThe death of Pigpen did not slow the band down, and they continued with their new members. They soon formed their own record group, Grateful Dead Records.[37] Later that year, they released their next studio album, the jazz-influenced Wake of the Flood. It became their biggest commercial success thus far.[38] Meanwhile, capitalizing on Floods success, the band soon went back to the studio, and the next year, 1974, released another album, From the Mars Hotel. Not long after that albums release however, the Dead decided to take a hiatus from live touring.\\r\\nIn September 1975, the Dead released their eighth studio album, Blues for Allah. Their hiatus was short-lived, though, as they resumed touring in June 1976.[37] That same year, they signed with Arista Records. Their new contract soon produced Terrapin Station in 1977. The band's tour in the spring of that year is held in high regard by their fans, and their May 8 concert at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York is often considered to be one of the best performances of their career.[39][40][41]\\r\\nAlthough things appeared to be going well for the band, problems were arising with their two newest members, Keith and Donna Jean Godchaux. The pair were frequently fighting, and Keith's heroin addiction was affecting his playing. Both of these issues were causing complications with touring, and they agreed to leave the band in February 1979.\\r\\nFollowing the departure of the Godchauxs, Brent Mydland joined as keyboardist and vocalist and was considered \\"the perfect fit\\". The Godchauxs then formed the Heart of Gold Band before Keith died in a car accident in 1980. Mydland was the keyboardist for the Grateful Dead for 11 years until his death by narcotics overdose in July 1990,[42] becoming the third keyboardist to die.\\r\\nDuring the 1980s the band transformed as the talents of Mydland helped power the group. Shortly after Mydland found his place in the early 1980s, Garcia's health began to decline. His drug habits caused him to lose his liveliness on stage. After beginning to gradually curtail his opiate usage in 1985, Garcia slipped into a diabetic coma for several days in July 1986. After he recovered, the band released In the Dark in July 1987, which resulted as their best selling studio album release, and also produced their only top-10 chart single, \\"Touch of Grey\\". Also that year, the group toured with Bob Dylan, as documented on the album Dylan & the Dead.\\r\\nInspired by Garcia's improved health and a successful album, the band's energy and chemistry peaked in the late 1980s and 1990. Performances were vigorous and as a result, every show exceeded its maximum audience capacity. The band's \\"high time\\" came to a sudden halt when Mydland died after the summer tour in 1990. They now had to rebuild; Vince Welnick, former keyboardist for the Tubes, joined as a band member, while Bruce Hornsby, who had a successful career with his own band the Range, joined as a touring member. Both performed on keyboards and vocals - Welnick until the band's end, and Hornsby mainly from 1990 to 1992.\\r\\nJerry Garcia died in August 1995 and the remaining band members decided to disband.[43] Since that time, there have been a number of reunions by the surviving members involving various combinations of musicians. Additionally, the former members have also begun or continued their individual projects.\\r\\nIn 1998, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, and Mickey Hart, along with several other musicians, formed a band called the Other Ones, and performed a number of concerts that year, releasing a live album, The Strange Remain, the following year. In 2000, the Other Ones toured again, this time with Kreutzmann but without Lesh. After taking another year off, the band toured again in 2002 with Lesh. That year, the Other Ones then included all four living former Grateful Dead members who had been in the band for most or all of its history. At different times the shifting lineup of the Other Ones also included guitarists Mark Karan, Steve Kimock, and Jimmy Herring, keyboardists Bruce Hornsby, Jeff Chimenti, and Rob Barraco, saxophonist Dave Ellis, drummer John Molo, bassist Alphonso Johnson, and vocalist Susan Tedeschi.[44]\\r\\nIn 2003, the Other Ones, still including Weir, Lesh, Hart, and Kreutzmann, changed their name to the Dead.[45] The Dead toured the United States in 2003, 2004 and 2009. The band's lineups included Jimmy Herring and Warren Haynes on guitar, Jeff Chimenti and Rob Barraco on keyboards, and Joan Osborne on vocals.[46] In 2008, members of the Dead played two concerts, called \\"Deadheads for Obama\\" and \\"Change Rocks\\".\\r\\nFollowing the 2009 Dead tour, Lesh and Weir formed the band Furthur, which debuted in September 2009.[47] Joining Lesh and Weir in Furthur were John Kadlecik (guitar), Jeff Chimenti (keyboards), Joe Russo (drums), Jay Lane (drums), Sunshine Becker (vocals), and Zoe Ellis (vocals). Lane and Ellis left the band in 2010, and vocalist Jeff Pehrson joined later that year. Furthur disbanded in 2014.[48]\\r\\nIn 2010, Hart and Kreutzmann re-formed the Rhythm Devils, and played a summer concert tour.[49]\\r\\nSince 1995, the former members of the Grateful Dead have also pursued solo music careers. Both Bob Weir & RatDog[50][51] and Phil Lesh and Friends[52][53] have performed many concerts and released several albums. Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann have also each released a few albums. Hart has toured with his world music percussion ensemble Planet Drum[54] as well as the Mickey Hart Band.[55] Kreutzmann has led several different bands, including BK3,[56] 7 Walkers (with Papa Mali),[57] and Billy & the Kids.[58] Donna Godchaux has returned to the music scene, with the Donna Jean Godchaux Band,[59] and Tom Constanten also continues to write and perform music.[60] All of these groups continue to play Grateful Dead music.\\r\\nIn October 2014, it was announced that Martin Scorsese will produce a documentary film about the Grateful Dead, to be directed by Amir Bar-Lev. David Lemieux will supervise the musical selection, and Weir, Hart, Kreutzmann and Lesh have agreed to new interviews for the film.[61] Bar-Lev's four-hour documentary, titled Long Strange Trip, was released in 2017.[62][63]\\r\\nIn 2015, Weir, Lesh, Kreutzmann, and Hart reunited for five concerts called \\"Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead\\".[64] The shows were performed on June 27 and 28 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, and on July 3, 4, and 5 at Soldier Field in Chicago, Illinois.[64][65] The band stated that this would be the final time that Weir, Lesh, Hart, and Kreutzmann would perform together.[66] They were joined by Trey Anastasio of Phish on guitar, Jeff Chimenti on keyboards, and Bruce Hornsby on piano.[67][68] Demand for tickets was very high.[69][70] The concerts were simulcast via various media.[71][72] The Chicago shows have been released as a box set of CDs and DVDs.[73]\\r\\nIn the fall of 2015, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann and Bob Weir joined with guitarist John Mayer, keyboardist Jeff Chimenti, and bassist Oteil Burbridge to tour in a band called Dead & Company. Mayer recounts that in 2011 he was listening to Pandora and happened upon the Grateful Dead song \\"Althea\\", and that soon Grateful Dead music was all he would listen to.[74] The band has played three tours: OctoberÿDecember 2015, JuneÿJuly 2016, and MayÿJuly 2017.[75][76]\\r\\nThe Grateful Dead formed during the era when bands such as the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones were dominating the airwaves. \\"The Beatles were why we turned from a jug band into a rock 'n' roll band,\\" said Bob Weir. \\"What we saw them doing was impossibly attractive. I couldn't think of anything else more worth doing.\\"[77] Former folk-scene star Bob Dylan had recently put out a couple of records featuring electric instrumentation. Grateful Dead members have said that it was after attending a concert by the touring New York City band the Lovin' Spoonful that they decided to \\"go electric\\" and look for a dirtier sound. Gradually, many of the East-Coast American folk musicians, formerly luminaries of the coffee-house scene, were moving in the electric direction.[citation needed] It was natural for Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir, each of whom had been immersed in the American folk music revival of the late 1950s and early 1960s, to be open-minded toward electric guitars.\\r\\nThe Grateful Dead's early music (in the mid-1960s) was part of the process of establishing what \\"psychedelic music\\" was, but theirs was essentially a \\"street party\\" form of it. They developed their \\"psychedelic\\" playing as a result of meeting Ken Kesey in Palo Alto, California, and subsequently becoming the house band for the Acid Tests he staged.[78] The Dead were not inclined to fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or country & western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on all of these genres and, more frequently, melding several of them. It was doubtless with this in mind that Bill Graham said of the Grateful Dead, \\"They're not the best at what they do, they're the only ones that do what they do.\\"[79] Often (both in performance and on recording) the Dead left room for exploratory, spacey soundscapes.\\r\\nTheir live shows, fed by their improvisational approach to music, made the Grateful Dead different from most other touring bands. While most rock and roll bands rehearse a standard show for their tours that is replayed night after night, city after city, the Grateful Dead never did. As Garcia stated in a 1966 interview, \\"We don't make up our sets beforehand. We'd rather work off the tops of our heads than off a piece of paper.\\"[80] They maintained this operating ethic throughout their existence. For each performance, the band drew material from an active list of a hundred or so songs.[80]\\r\\nThe 1969 live album Live/Dead did capture more of their essence, but commercial success did not come until Workingman's Dead and American Beauty, both released in 1970. These records largely featured the band's laid-back acoustic musicianship and more traditional song structures. With their rootsy, eclectic stylings, particularly evident on the latter two albums, the band pioneered the hybrid Americana genre.[81][82][83]\\r\\nAs the band and its sound matured over thirty years of touring, playing, and recording, each member's stylistic contribution became more defined, consistent, and identifiable. Lesh, who was originally a classically trained trumpet player with an extensive background in music theory, did not tend to play traditional blues-based bass forms, but opted for more melodic, symphonic and complex lines, often sounding like a second lead guitar. Weir, too, was not a traditional rhythm guitarist, but tended to play jazz-influenced, unique inversions at the upper end of the Dead's sound. The two drummers, Mickey Hart and Kreutzmann, developed a unique, complex interplay, balancing Kreutzmann's steady beat with Hart's interest in percussion styles outside the rock tradition. Hart incorporated an 11-count measure to his drumming, bringing a new dimension to the band's sound that became an important part of its emerging style.[84] Garcia's lead lines were fluid, supple and spare, owing a great deal of their character to his training in fingerpicking and banjo.\\r\\nThe band's primary lyricists, Robert Hunter and John Perry Barlow, commonly used themes involving love and loss, life and death, gambling and murder, beauty and horror, chaos and order, God and other religious themes, travelling and touring.[citation needed] In a retrospective, The New Yorker described Hunter's verses as \\"elliptical, by turns vivid and gnomic\\", which were often \\"hippie poetry about roses and bells and dew,\\"[85] and critic Robert Christgau described them as \\"American myths\\" that later gave way to \\"the old karma-go-round\\".[86]\\r\\nHal Kant was an entertainment industry attorney who specialized in representing musical groups. He spent 35 years as principal lawyer and general counsel for the Grateful Dead, a position in the group that was so strong that his business cards with the band identified his role as \\"Czar\\".[87]\\r\\nKant brought the band millions of dollars in revenue through his management of the band's intellectual property and merchandising rights. At Kant's recommendation, the group was one of the few rock 'n roll pioneers to retain ownership of their music masters and publishing rights.\\r\\nIn 2006, the Grateful Dead signed a ten-year licensing agreement with Rhino Entertainment to manage the band's business interests including the release of musical recordings, merchandising, and marketing. The band retained creative control and kept ownership of its music catalog.[88][89]\\r\\nA Grateful Dead video game titled Grateful Dead Game?ÿ The Epic Tour[90] was released in April 2012 and was created by Curious Sense.[91]\\r\\nThe Grateful Dead toured constantly throughout their career, playing more than 2,300 concerts.[92] They promoted a sense of community among their fans, who became known as \\"Deadheads\\", many of whom followed their tours for months or years on end. In their early career, the band also dedicated their time and talents to their community, the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco, making available free food, lodging, music, and health care to all. It has been said that the band performed \\"more free concerts than any band in the history of music\\".[93]\\r\\nWith the exception of 1975, when the band was on hiatus and played only four concerts together, the Grateful Dead performed many concerts every year, from their formation in April 1965, until July 9, 1995.[94] Initially all their shows were in California, principally in the San Francisco Bay Area and in or near Los Angeles. They also performed, in 1965 and 1966, with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, as the house band for the Acid Tests. They toured nationally starting in June 1967 (their first foray to New York), with a few detours to Canada, Europe and three nights at the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt in 1978. They appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Festival Express train tour across Canada in 1970. They were scheduled to appear as the final act at the infamous Altamont Free Concert on December 6, 1969 after the Rolling Stones but withdrew after security concerns. \\"That's the way things went at Altamontso badly that the Grateful Dead, prime organizers and movers of the festival, didn't even get to play,\\" staff at Rolling Stone magazine wrote in a detailed narrative on the event\\"[95]\\r\\nTheir first UK performance was at the Hollywood Music Festival in 1970. Their largest concert audience came in 1973 when they played, along with the Allman Brothers Band and the Band, before an estimated 600,000 people at the Summer Jam at Watkins Glen.[96] The 1998 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records recognized them with a listing under the heading, \\"most rock concerts performed\\" (2,318 concerts).[97] They played to an estimated total of 25 million people, more than any other band, with audiences of up to 80,000 attending a single show. Many of these concerts were preserved in the band's tape vault, and several dozen have since been released on CD and as downloads. The Dead were known for the tremendous variation in their setlists from night to nightthe list of songs documented to have been played by the band exceeds 500.[98] The band has released four concert videos under the name View from the Vault.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, the Grateful Dead earned a total of $285 million in revenue from their concert tours, the second-highest during the 1990s, with the Rolling Stones earning the most.[99] This figure is representative of tour revenue through 1995, as touring stopped after the death of Jerry Garcia.[99]\\r\\nTheir numerous studio albums were generally collections of new songs that they had first played in concert. The band was also famous for its extended musical jams, which featured both individual improvisations as well as distinctive \\"group-mind\\" improvisations during which each of the band members improvised individually while simultaneously blending together as a cohesive musical unit. Musically, this may be illustrated in that the band not only improvised within the form of songs, but also with the form. The Grateful Dead have often been described as having never played the same song the same way twice. The cohesive listening abilities of each band member made for a transcendence of what might be called \\"free form\\" and improvisation. Their concert sets often blended songs, one into the next (a segue).\\r\\nThe Wall of Sound was a large sound system designed specifically for the Grateful Dead.[100][101] The band was never satisfied with the house system anywhere they played. After the Monterey Pop Festival, the band's crew 'borrowed' some of the other performers' sound equipment and used it to host some free shows in San Francisco.[102] In their early days, soundman Owsley \\"Bear\\" Stanley designed a public address (PA) and monitor system for them. Bear was the Grateful Dead's soundman for many years; he was also one of the largest suppliers of LSD.[103] Stanley's sound systems were delicate and finicky, and frequently brought shows to a halt with technical breakdowns. After Stanley went to jail for manufacturing LSD in 1970, the group briefly used house PAs, but found them to be even less reliable than those built by their former soundman. On February 2, 1970 the group contacted Bob Heil to use his system.[104] In 1971, the band purchased their first solid-state sound system from Alembic Inc Studios. Because of this, Alembic would play an integral role in the research, development, and production of the Wall of Sound. The band also welcomed Dan Healy into the fold on a permanent basis that year. Healy would mix the Grateful Dead's live sound until 1993.\\r\\nLike several other bands during this time, the Grateful Dead allowed their fans to record their shows. For many years the tapers set up their microphones wherever they could, and the eventual forest of microphones became a problem for the official sound crew. Eventually, this was solved by having a dedicated taping section located behind the sound board, which required a special \\"tapers\\" ticket. The band allowed sharing of tapes of their shows, as long as no profits were made on the sale of their show tapes.[105] Sometimes the sound crew would allow the tapers to connect directly to the sound board, which created exceptional concert recordings.[106]\\r\\nRecently, there have been some disputes over which recordings archive.org could host on their site. Although all the recordings are hosted at present, the sound board recordings can only be streamed and not downloaded.[106]\\r\\nOf the approximately 2,350 shows the Grateful Dead played, almost 2,200 were taped, and most of these are available online.[107] The Band began collecting and cataloging tapes early on and Dick Latvala was their keeper. \\"Dick's Picks\\" is named after Latvala. After his death in 1999, David Lemieux gradually took the post. Concert set lists from a subset of 1,590 Grateful Dead shows were used to perform a comparative analysis between how songs were played in concert and how they are listened online by Last.fm members.[108] In their book Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead: What Every Business Can Learn From the Most Iconic Band in History,[109] David Meerman Scott and Brian Halligan identify the taper section as a crucial contributor to increasing the Grateful Dead's fan base.\\r\\nOver the years, a number of iconic images have come to be associated with the Grateful Dead. Many of these images originated as artwork for concert posters or album covers.\\r\\nFans and enthusiasts of the band are commonly referred to as Deadheads. While the origin of the term may be unclear, Dead Heads were made canon by the notice placed inside the Skull and Roses (1971) album by manager Jon McIntire:\\r\\nMany of the Dead Heads would go on tour with the band. As a group, the Dead Heads were considered very mellow. \\"I'd rather work nine Grateful Dead concerts than one Oregon football game\\", Police Det. Rick Raynor said. \\"They don't get belligerent like they do at the games\\".[119]\\r\\nOn April 24, 2008, members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, along with Nion McEvoy, CEO of Chronicle Books, UC Santa Cruz chancellor George Blumenthal, and UC Santa Cruz librarian Virginia Steel, held a press conference announcing that UCSC's McHenry Library would be the permanent home of the Grateful Dead's complete archival history from 1965 to the present. The archive includes correspondence, photographs, fliers, posters, and several other forms of memorabilia and records of the band. Also included are unreleased videos of interviews and TV appearances that will be installed for visitors to view, as well as stage backdrops and other props from the band's concerts.\\r\\nBlumenthal stated at the event, \\"The Grateful Dead Archive represents one of the most significant popular cultural collections of the 20th century; UC Santa Cruz is honored to receive this invaluable gift. The Grateful Dead and UC Santa Cruz are both highly innovative institutionsborn the same yearthat continue to make a major, positive impact on the world.\\" Guitarist Bob Weir stated, \\"We looked around, and UC Santa Cruz seems the best possible home. If you ever wrote the Grateful Dead a letter, you'll probably find it there!\\"[120]\\r\\nProfessor of music Fredric Lieberman was the key contact between the band and the university, who let the university know about the search for a home for the archive, and who had collaborated with Mickey Hart on three books in the past, Planet Drum (1990), Drumming at the Edge of Magic (1991), and Spirit into Sound (2006).[121][122][123]\\r\\nThe first large-scale exhibition of materials from the Grateful Dead Archive was mounted at the New-York Historical Society in 2010.[124]\\r\\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the Grateful Dead No.?57 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[125]\\r\\nOn February 10, 2007, the Grateful Dead received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. The award was accepted on behalf of the band by Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann.[126]\\r\\nIn 2011, a recording of the Grateful Dead's May 8, 1977, concert at Cornell University's Barton Hall was selected for induction into the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress.[127]\\r\\nTwelve members of the Grateful Dead (the eleven official performing members plus Robert Hunter) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, and Bruce Hornsby was their presenter.[6]\\r\\nLead guitarist Jerry Garcia was often viewed both by the public and the media as the leader or primary spokesperson for the Grateful Dead, but was reluctant to be perceived that way, especially since he and the other group members saw themselves as equal participants and contributors to their collective musical and creative output.[128][129] Garcia, a native of San Francisco, grew up in the Excelsior District. One of his main influences was bluegrass music, and he also performedon banjo, one of his other great instrumental loves, along with the pedal steel guitarin bluegrass bands, notably Old and in the Way with mandolinist David Grisman.\\r\\nBruce Hornsby never officially joined the band full-time, because of his other commitments, but he did play keyboards at most Dead shows between September 1990 and March 1992, and sat in with the band over one hundred times in all between 1988 and 1995. Jerry Garcia referred to him as a \\"floating member\\" who could come and go as he pleased.[130][131][132]\\r\\nRobert Hunter and John Perry Barlow were the band's primary lyricists, starting in 1967 and 1971 respectively and continuing until the band's dissolution.[133][134][134] Hunter collaborated mostly with Garcia and Barlow mostly with Weir, though each wrote with other band members as well. Both are listed as official members at Dead.net, the band's website, alongside the performing members.[18] Barlow was the only member not inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","input":"Where did grateful dead live in san francisco?"},{"output":"in the sixth series episode \\"A Good Man Goes to War.","context":"Madame Vastra, Jenny Flint, and Strax (informally known as the Paternoster Gang, together with the Doctor),[11][12] are a trio of recurring fictional characters in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, created by Steven Moffat, and portrayed, respectively, by Neve McIntosh, Catrin Stewart and Dan Starkey.\\r\\nThe three characters first appear in the sixth series episode \\"A Good Man Goes to War.\\" Madame Vastra (a Silurian) and Jenny Flint (a human) are a married couple.[11][13][14] In later stories we see them living in London during the 19th century. Strax, a Sontaran, is seen in his first appearance to be acting as a nurse, caring for wounded soldiers on another planet. They are all recruited by the Eleventh Doctor to help him rescue Amy Pond. Despite the success of the effort, Strax apparently dies in the battle. He is, however, shown to be awakened by Vastra and Flint a couple of days later, in the webisode \\"The Battle of Demons Run: Two Days Later\\";[15][16] he then became their butler in the 19th century.\\r\\nSince their first appearance, the trio have appeared various times to help the Doctor, even having a central role in the first half of \\"The Crimson Horror\\" (2013). Their last episode was 2014's \\"Deep Breath\\", the first episode starring the Twelfth Doctor.\\r\\nThey also have their own spin-off novella, Devil in the Smoke (2012),[17][18] and spin-off novel, Silhouette (2014),[19] and the trio have appeared in several online \\"minisodes\\",[12][20] with Strax additionally appearing in a series of \\"Field Report\\" videos posted to the Doctor Who website.[21] In 2014, they appeared without the Doctor in the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip in the storyline The Crystal Throne (DWM #475ÿ476).[22] Since 2015, an ongoing series of short stories and a comic strip titled Strax and the Time Shark, featuring the three characters, has been a regular feature in Doctor Who Adventures magazine. The three characters became popular with audiences, with the presence of an inter-species same-sex couple also leading to some attention.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVastra is a female Silurian warrior from prehistoric Earth who was awakened from hibernation in the 19th century when her lair was disturbed during the construction of the London Underground.[11] Initially enraged, she slaughtered five commuters before being pacified by the Doctor. She eventually overcame her race's hatred of humans and joined London society. She became a consulting detective to Scotland Yard, and a possible inspiration for the Sherlock Holmes stories.[11] Amongst her unseen adventures is her capture of Jack the Ripper, whom she eats (she mentions in \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\" that she found him \\"stringy, but tasty all the same\\").[10] She hired a maid, Jenny Flint, who assists her in her investigations and who is also married to her.\\r\\nJenny's backstory in \\"The Battle of Demons Run: Two Days Later\\" (2013) shows she was turned away from her family because of her \\"preferences in companionship\\",[16] and saved from attackers by Vastra, who took her on as an employee. The Doctor was present at their initial meeting, during which Vastra recounts in \\"The Name of the Doctor\\" (2013) that he saved Jenny's life.[24] She shows herself to have acquired extremely formidable skills as a hand-to-hand combatant and a swordswoman. She is shown in all of her appearances to be entirely comfortable with post-19th century technologies, time travel, and the TARDIS; she is repeatedly seen using technology devices, and in the episode \\"Deep Breath\\", she is seen wearing and using the Sonic Gauntlet designed for that episode.[9][25]\\r\\nStrax is a member of the warrior Sontaran alien race. Strax was forced to serve as a nurse, healing the injured as a punishment[10] for being defeated by the Doctor during the Sontaran invasion of Earth.[citation needed] This is contrary to the Sontaran's warrior instincts and mentality and as such, Strax has been known to occasionally slip back to his Sontaran ways and mannerisms. In \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\", he states that he is nearly 12, suggesting that this is quite old for a Sontaran.[26] A running gag is Strax's inability to tell the difference between genders and his obsession with using violent tactics.\\r\\nIn their first appearance in \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\", the three, along with others who owe him favours, are chosen by the Eleventh Doctor to help him save Amy Pond from Madame Kovarian and the Order of the Headless Monks at Demons Run.[11] At the time, Strax is a Sontaran \\"nurse\\" taking care of the wounded soldiers on a battlefield as part of a penance imposed on him. Before he can answer Captain Harcourt who came up with this penance, the Doctor arrives in his TARDIS to take him to Demons Run. They fight together against their enemies and succeed in saving Amy, but Strax is mortally wounded and appears to die after saying his last words to Rory Williams.[10]\\r\\nIn \\"The Battle of Demons Run: Two Days Later\\", a webcast set two days after the events of \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\", Strax is awakened by Vastra and Jenny, after they heal his wounds, and accepts their proposition to join them in London in 1888.[15][16] He subsequently becomes their butler.\\r\\nThey then appear in \\"The Snowmen\\" (2012), trying to convince the Eleventh Doctor to come out of retirement (into which he has retreated after losing Amy and Rory in \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\"). They help the Doctor's future new companion Clara Oswald to find him and support them in their fight against the Great Intelligence. A high fall kills Clara, whose death indirectly lets the Doctor defeat the Great Intelligence.[1]\\r\\nThe trio  and more particularly Jenny  have a central role in the first half of \\"The Crimson Horror\\" (2013), set in 1893, in which they investigate a series of strange deaths. They travel to Yorkshire, where Jenny infiltrates a suspect community called Sweetville, led by Mrs Gillyflower. She finds the Eleventh Doctor, kept prisoner in Sweetville, and the trio reunites to help him defeat Mrs Gillyflower, by sabotaging the rocket she was planning to use to poison the skies. They discover that Clara appears to be alive (the Doctor's companion being another version of the one seen in \\"The Snowmen\\", coming from another era), but the Doctor does not explain why to Jenny, as he himself does not know the answer at this time.[8]\\r\\nThe three characters reappear in the seventh series finale \\"The Name of the Doctor\\", where they organise a meeting in a dream with Clara and River Song. During the \\"conference call\\", the three are captured by the Whisper Men, minions of the Great Intelligence, who uses them as bait to bring the Eleventh Doctor to his tomb on the planet Trenzalore. The Doctor unhesitatingly goes to rescue them, recalling their caring and concern for him in \\"The Snowmen\\" and feeling a duty towards them. After the Doctor arrives on Trenzalore with Clara, the Great Intelligence scatters itself across the Doctor's timeline to destroy him. As history changes, Jenny disappears and Strax forgets his friendship with Vastra and attacks her, forcing her to defend herself. She points a weapon at him and it glows, but Strax disappears suddenly, leaving Vastra bewildered and calling his name. After Clara enters the timestream to save the Doctor and undo the Great Intelligence's changes to history, Jenny and Strax are restored.[24]\\r\\nIn \\"Deep Breath\\", the first episode of the eighth series, Vastra, Jenny and Strax arrive in central London to witness a dinosaur marching through the city and proceeding to cough up the TARDIS. Upon finding the TARDIS, they find emerging from it a recently regenerated Twelfth Doctor, who falls unconscious. The three, along with Clara, take him back to their home to rest, while they attempt to solve the problem of the dinosaur. However, the Doctor soon wakes up and tries to solve it himself, only to witness the dinosaur spontaneously combust, and Vastra informs the Doctor that there have been similar murders recently. The Doctor vanishes thereafter and Clara becomes a temporary member of the Paternoster Gang, working with them in an effort to locate the Doctor and investigate the dinosaur's death. Together, they find a message in a newspaper directed at Clara, leading to her reunion with the Doctor. The Doctor and Clara go searching for the culprit; when they are about to be killed by robots, the Paternoster Gang rescue them, fighting along with Clara until the Doctor defeats their leader, leading all robots to be deactivated and saving his friends. After the Doctor takes off, leaving Clara in Victorian London, Clara asks Vastra if she can stay with them. Vastra states that she is of course welcome, but she should have no doubt of the Doctor's return. The Doctor then indeed comes back to pick her up, and they leave the house to bring Clara back home.[9]\\r\\nMcIntosh previously appeared in the series portraying two other Silurian female characters, sisters Alaya and Restac, in the two-part story \\"The Hungry Earth\\"/\\"Cold Blood\\" (2010).[5][28][29]\\r\\nStarkey previously played Commander Skorr, one of the Sontarans, in the two-part story re-introducing the species, \\"The Sontaran Stratagem\\"/\\"The Poison Sky\\" (2008).[30][31] He also portrayed another Sontaran character in The End of Time (2009ÿ10)[citation needed] and in between appearances as Strax in \\"The Name of the Doctor\\" (2013) and \\"Deep Breath\\" (2014), he played two more Sontarans in \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" (2013).[32][33]\\r\\nIn November 2013, the long-running children's show Blue Peter announced a competition for fans aged 6ÿ15 to design 'sonic devices' for the characters, with the three winning designs appearing in Series 8.

The 30th Disney animated feature film and the third released during the Disney Renaissance period, it is based on the French fairy tale of the same name by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont (who was also credited in the English version as well as in the French version),[6] and ideas from the 1946 French film of the same name directed by Jean Cocteau.[7] Beauty and the Beast focuses on the relationship between the Beast (voice of Robby Benson),[8] a prince who is magically transformed into a monster and his servants into household objects as punishment for his arrogance, and Belle (voice of Paige O'Hara),[8] a young woman whom he imprisons in his castle. To become a prince again, Beast must learn to love Belle and earn her love in return before the last petal from the enchanted rose that the enchantress who cursed the Beast had offered falls, or else the Beast will remain a monster forever. The film also features the voices of Richard White, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers, and Angela Lansbury.[8]\\r\\nWalt Disney first attempted unsuccessfully to adapt Beauty and the Beast into an animated film during the 1930s and 1950s. Following the success of The Little Mermaid (1989), Walt Disney Pictures decided to adapt the fairy tale, which Richard Purdum originally conceived as a non-musical. Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg eventually dismissed Purdum's idea and ordered that the film be a musical similar to The Little Mermaid instead. The film was directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, with a screenplay by Linda Woolverton story first credited to Roger Allers.[8] Lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken wrote the film's songs. Ashman, who additionally served as the film's executive producer, died of AIDS-related complications eight months before the film's release, and the film is thus dedicated to his memory.\\r\\nBeauty and the Beast premiered as an unfinished film at the New York Film Festival on September 29, 1991, followed by its theatrical release as a completed film at the El Capitan Theatre on November 13. The film was a box office success, grossing $425 million worldwide on a $25 million budget. Beauty and the Beast won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture ÿ Musical or Comedy, the first animated film to ever win that category. It also became the first animated film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture at the 64th Academy Awards, where it won the Academy Award for Best Original Score and Best Original Song for its title song and received additional nominations for Best Original Song and Best Sound. In April 1994, Beauty and the Beast became Disney's first animated film to be adapted into a Broadway musical. The success of the film spawned two direct-to-video follow-ups: Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas (1997) and Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Magical World (1998), both of which take place in the timeline of the original. This was followed by a spin-off television series, Sing Me a Story with Belle.\\r\\nAn IMAX version of the film was released in 2002, and included \\"Human Again\\", a new five-minute musical sequence. That same year, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". After the success of the 3D re-release of The Lion King, the film was reissued in 3D in 2012.[9] A live-action remake of the film directed by Bill Condon was released on March 17, 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne winter's night, an enchantress disguised as a beggar offers a cold-hearted prince a rose in exchange for shelter from the bitter cold. When he refuses, she transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects. She bestows the Beast with a magic mirror before hexing the rose and warning him that, unless he learns to love another and earns their love in return by the time the last petal falls, he and his servants will lose their humanity forever.\\r\\nTen years later, a beautiful girl named Belle dreams of adventure and brushes off advances from Gaston, an arrogant hunter. Lost in the forest while traveling to a fair to present his latest invention, Belle's father Maurice seeks refuge in the Beast's castle. After Maurice befriends the castle's servants, however, the Beast discovers and imprisons him. Belle ventures out in search for him and finds him locked in the castle's dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take Maurice's place.\\r\\nBefriending the castle's servants, Belle is treated to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden West Wing where the rose is kept, the Beast flies into a rage, causing Belle to flee the castle and into the woods. She is attacked by wolves, but the Beast rescues Belle and gets injured in the process. He begins to develop feelings for her while she nurses his wounds and he delights her by showing his extensive library.\\r\\nReturning to the village, Maurice tells the townsfolk of Belle's predicament, but Gaston convinces the townsfolk to send Maurice to an insane asylum if Belle refuses to marry Gaston.\\r\\nAfter sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father's predicament using the magic mirror. The Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. Back at the village, Belle proves Maurice's sanity by revealing the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, Gaston has her thrown into the basement with her father and rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to kill the Beast. With Chip's aid, Maurice and Belle escape and rush back to the castle.\\r\\nThe servants battle the invading villagers, driving them out of the castle. Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his will upon seeing Belle return. He spares Gaston's life before reuniting with Belle. Gaston stabs the Beast, but he loses his footing and falls to his death.[a] The Beast dies from Gaston's stab before the last petal falls. When Belle tearfully professes her love to him, the curse is broken, repairing the castle and restoring the Beast's and servants' human forms. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.\\r\\nAfter the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937, Walt Disney sought out other stories to adapt into feature films, with Beauty and the Beast being among the stories he considered.[12][29] Attempts to develop the Beauty and the Beast story into a film were made in the 1930s and 1950s, but were ultimately given up because it \\"proved to be a challenge\\" for the story team.[12] Peter M. Nichols states Disney may later have been discouraged by Jean Cocteau having already done his 1946 version.[30]\\r\\nDecades later, during the production of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1987, the Disney studio resurrected Beauty and the Beast as a project for the satellite animation studio it had set up in London, England to work on Roger Rabbit. Richard Williams, who had directed the animated portions of Roger Rabbit, was approached to direct but declined in favor of continuing work on his long-gestating project The Thief and the Cobbler. In his place, Williams recommended his colleague, English animation director Richard Purdum, and work began under producer Don Hahn on a non-musical version of Beauty and the Beast set in 19th-century France.[31] At the behest of Disney CEO Michael Eisner, Beauty and the Beast became the first Disney animated film to use a screenwriter. This was an unusual production move for an animated film, which is traditionally developed on storyboards rather than in scripted form. Linda Woolverton wrote the original draft of the story before storyboarding began, and worked with the story team to retool and develop the film.[32]\\r\\nUpon seeing the initial storyboard reels in 1989, Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg ordered that the film be scrapped and started over from scratch. A few months after starting anew, Purdum resigned as director. The studio had approached Ron Clements and John Musker to direct the film, but they turned down the offer, saying they were \\"tired\\" after just having finished directing Disney's recent success The Little Mermaid. Disney then hired first-time feature directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale. Wise and Trousdale had previously directed the animated sections of Cranium Command, a short film for a Disney EPCOT theme park attraction. In addition, Katzenberg asked songwriters Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who had written the song score for The Little Mermaid, to turn Beauty and the Beast into a Broadway-style musical film in the same vein as Mermaid. Ashman, who at the time had learned he was dying of complications from AIDS, had been working with Disney on a pet project of his, Aladdin, and only reluctantly agreed to join the struggling production team. To accommodate Ashman's failing health, pre-production of Beauty and the Beast was moved from London to the Residence Inn in Fishkill, New York, close to Ashman's New York City home.[31] Here, Ashman and Menken joined Wise, Trousdale, Hahn, and Woolverton in retooling the film's script.[12][32] Since the original story had only two major characters, the filmmakers enhanced them, added new characters in the form of enchanted household items who \\"add warmth and comedy to a gloomy story\\" and guide the audience through the film, and added a \\"real villain\\" in the form of Gaston.[12]\\r\\nThese ideas were somewhat similar to elements of the 1946 French film version of Beauty and the Beast, which introduced the character of Avenant, an oafish suitor somewhat similar to Gaston,[33] as well as inanimate objects coming to life in the Beast's castle.[34] The animated objects were, however, given distinct personalities in the Disney version. By early 1990, Katzenberg had approved the revised script, and storyboarding began again.[12][32] The production flew story artists back and forth between California and New York for storyboard approvals from Ashman, though the team was not told the reason why.[12]\\r\\nDisney had originally considered casting Jodi Benson from The Little Mermaid as Belle.[35] They eventually decided upon Broadway actress and singer Paige O'Hara in favor of having a heroine who sounded \\"more like a woman than a girl\\".[36] According to co-director Kirk Wise, O'Hara was given the role because she \\"had a unique quality, a tone she would hit that made her special\\",[37] reminiscent to that of American actress and singer Judy Garland.[38] O'Hara, who, after reading about the film in The New York Times,[39] competed for the role against 500 hopefuls,[40] believes the fact that lyricist Howard Ashman admired her cast recording of the musical Show Boat proved integral in her being cast.[41]\\r\\nProduction of Beauty and the Beast was to be completed on a compressed timeline of two years rather than the traditional four-year Disney Feature Animation production schedule; this was due to the loss of production time spent developing the earlier Purdum version of the film.[10] Most of the production was done at the main Feature Animation studio, housed in the Air Way facility in Glendale, California. A smaller team at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park in Lake Buena Vista, Florida assisted the California team on several scenes, particularly the \\"Be Our Guest\\" number.[12]\\r\\nBeauty and the Beast was the second film, after The Rescuers Down Under, produced using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar.[12][31] The software allowed for a wider range of colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.[10]\\r\\nIn addition, CAPS allowed an easier combination of hand-drawn art with computer-generated imagery, which before had to be plotted to animation paper and then xeroxed and painted traditionally.[12][42] This technique was put to significant use during the \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" waltz sequence, in which Belle and Beast dance through a computer-generated ballroom as the camera dollies around them in simulated 3D space.[10][12] The filmmakers had originally decided against the use of computers in favor of traditional animation, but later, when the technology had improved, decided it could be used for the one scene in the ballroom.[30] The success of the ballroom sequence helped convince studio executives to further invest in computer animation.[43]\\r\\nAshman and Menken wrote the Beauty song score during the pre-production process in Fishkill, the opening operetta-styled \\"Belle\\" being their first composition for the film. Other songs included \\"Be Our Guest,\\" sung (in its original version) to Maurice by the objects when he becomes the first visitor to eat at the castle in a decade, \\"Gaston,\\" a solo for the swaggering villain, \\"Human Again,\\" a song describing Belle and Beast's growing love from the objects' perspective, the love ballad \\"Beauty and the Beast (Tale as Old as Time)\\" and the climactic \\"The Mob Song.\\" As story and song development came to a close, full production began in Burbank while voice and song recording began in New York City.[12] The Beauty songs were mostly recorded live with the orchestra and the voice cast performing simultaneously rather than overdubbed separately, in order to give the songs a cast album-like \\"energy\\" the filmmakers and songwriters desired.[10]\\r\\nDuring the course of production, many changes were made to the structure of the film, necessitating the replacement and re-purposing of songs. After screening a mostly animated version of the \\"Be Our Guest\\" sequence, story artist Bruce Woodside suggested that the objects should be singing the song to Belle rather than her father. Wise and Trousdale agreed, and the sequence and song were retooled to replace Maurice with Belle. The film's title song went through a noted bit of uncertainty during production. Originally conceived as a rock-oriented song, it was changed to a slow, romantic ballad. Howard Ashman and Alan Menken asked Angela Lansbury to perform the song, but she did not think her voice was suited for the melody. When she voiced her doubts, Menken and Ashman asked her for at least one take and told her to perform the song as she saw fit. Lansbury reportedly reduced everyone in the studio to tears with her rendition, nailing the song in the one take asked of her. This version went on to win the Oscar for Best Original Song. \\"Human Again\\" was dropped from the film before animation began, as its lyrics caused story problems about the timeline over which the story takes place.[12] This required Ashman and Menken to write a new song in its place. \\"Something There,\\" in which Belle and Beast sing (via voiceover) of their growing fondness for each other, was composed late in production and inserted into the script in place of \\"Human Again.\\"[10]\\r\\nMenken would later revise \\"Human Again\\" for inclusion in the 1994 Broadway stage version of Beauty and the Beast, and another revised version of the song was added to the film itself in a new sequence created for the film's Special Edition re-release in 2002.[10][12] Ashman died of AIDS-related complications at the age of 40 on March 14, 1991, eight months before the film's release. He never saw the finished film, though he did get to see it in its unfinished format. Ashman's work on Aladdin was completed by another lyricist, Tim Rice. Before Ashman's death, members of the film's production team visited him after the film's well-received first screening, with Don Hahn commenting that \\"the film would be a great success. Who'd have thought it?\\", to which Ashman replied with \\"I would.\\" A tribute to the lyricist was included at the end of the credits crawl: \\"To our friend, Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice, and a beast his soul. We will be forever grateful. Howard Ashman: 1950ÿ1991.\\"[31] A pop version of the \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" theme, performed by Cline Dion and Peabo Bryson over the end credits, was released as a commercial single from the film's soundtrack, supported with a music video. The Dion/Bryson version of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" became an international pop hit and performed considerably well on charts around the world. The song became Dion's second single to land within the top-10 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number nine. The song peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary chart. In Canada, \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" peaked at number two.[44][45] Outside of North America, the song peaked within the top ten in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, while peaking within the top twenty in Australia, Netherlands, and Ireland. The song sold over a million copies worldwide.[46] This version of the song was also nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year at the Grammys, and it won the Grammy for Dion and Bryson for Best Pop Duo/Group Vocal Performance.\\r\\nIn a first-time accomplishment for The Walt Disney Company, an unfinished version of Beauty and the Beast was shown at the New York Film Festival on September 29, 1991.[47] The film was deemed a \\"work in progress\\" because roughly only 70% of the animation had been completed; storyboards and pencil tests were used in replacement of the remaining 30%.[48] Additionally, certain segments of the film that had already been finished were reverted to previous stages of completion. At the end of the screening, Beauty and the Beast received a ten-minute-long standing ovation from the film festival audience.[31][49] The completed film was also screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.[50] The finished film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on November 13, 1991, beginning a limited release before expanding wide on November 22.[49]\\r\\nThe film was restored and remastered for its New Year's Day, 2002 re-release in IMAX theatres in a special-edition edit, including a new musical sequence. For this version of the film, much of the animation was cleaned up, a new sequence set to the deleted song \\"Human Again\\" was inserted into the film's second act, and a new digital master from the original CAPS production files was used to make the high-resolution IMAX film negative.[51]\\r\\nA sing along edition of the film, hosted by Jordin Sparks, was released in select theaters on September 29 and October 2, 2010. Prior to the showing of the film, Sparks showed an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the newly restored film and the making of her new Beauty and the Beast music video. There was also commentary from producer Don Hahn, interviews with the cast and an inside look at how the animation was created.[52][53]\\r\\nA Disney Digital 3D version of the film, the second of a traditionally animated film, was originally scheduled to be released in US theatres on February 12, 2010, but the project was postponed.[54] On August 25, 2011, Disney announced that the 3D version of the film would make its American debut at Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre from September 2ÿ15, 2011.[55] Disney spent less than $10 million on the 3D conversion.[56] After the successful 3D re-release of The Lion King, Disney announced a wide 3D re-release of Beauty and the Beast in North America beginning January 13, 2012.[57]\\r\\nThe film was released to VHS on October 30, 1992 as part of the Walt Disney Classics series, and was later put on moratorium on April 30, 1993; it was not included in the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection line.[58] This version contains a minor edit to the film: skulls that appear in Gaston's pupils for two frames during his climactic fall to his death were removed for the original home video release. No such edit was made to later reissues of the film. The \\"work-in-progress\\" version screened at the New York Film Festival was also released on VHS and LaserDisc at this time;[10] however, said version was the only one available on the latter format until the fall of 1993, when the completed theatrical version was released. This measure was to diminish the threat of video pirates making copies derived from the LaserDisc (which are not copy-protected) and selling them in international markets, where the film was yet to be available for home release.[59][60]\\r\\nBeauty and the Beast: Special Edition, as the enhanced version of the film released in IMAX/large-format is called, was released on two-disc \\"Platinum Edition\\" DVD and VHS on October 8, 2002. The DVD set features three versions of the film: the extended IMAX Special Edition with the \\"Human Again\\" sequence added, the original theatrical version, and the New York Film Festival \\"work-in-progress\\" version. This release went to \\"Disney Vault\\" moratorium status in January 2003, along with its direct-to-video follow-ups Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas and Belle's Magical World.[61]\\r\\nThe film was released from the vault on October 5, 2010 as the second of Disney's Diamond Editions, in the form of a three-disc Blu-ray Disc and DVD combination pack[62]the first release of Beauty and the Beast on home video in high-definition format.[63] This edition consists of four versions of the film: the original theatrical version, an extended version, the New York Film Festival storyboard-only version, and a fourth iteration displaying the storyboards via picture-in-picture alongside the original theatrical version.[64] Upon its first week of release, the Blu-ray sold 1.1 million units, topping the Blu-ray sales chart and finishing in third place on the combined Blu-ray and DVD sales chart for the week ending on October 10, 2010.[65][66] It was the second-best-selling Blu-ray of 2010, behind Avatar.[67] A two-disc DVD edition was released on November 23, 2010.[62] A five-disc combo pack, featuring Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray 2D, DVD and a digital copy, was released on October 4, 2011. The 3D combo pack is identical to the original Diamond Edition, except for the added 3D disc and digital copy. The Blu-ray release went into the Disney Vault along with the two sequels on April 30, 2012.[68]\\r\\nA 25th-anniversary Signature Edition was released on Digital HD September 6, 2016 and was followed by Blu-ray/DVD combo pack on September 20, 2016.[69] Upon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film topped the Blu-ray Disc sales chart, and debuted at number 3 in the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows and Captain America: Civil War.[70]\\r\\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 94% based on reviews from 110 critics, with an average rating of 8.5 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Enchanting, sweepingly romantic, and featuring plenty of wonderful musical numbers, Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney's most elegant animated offerings.\\"[71] The film also holds a 95/100 on Metacritic.[72] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \\"A+\\" grade.[73]\\r\\nJanet Maslin of The New York Times praised the film with the following statement, \\"Two years ago, Walt Disney Pictures reinvented the animated feature, not only with an eye toward pleasing children, but also with an older, savvier audience in mind. Disney truly bridged a generation gap with The Little Mermaid  Now, lightning has definitely struck twice with Beauty and the Beast.\\"[74] Awarding the film a perfect score of four stars, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times compared Beauty and the Beast positively to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio, writing, \\"Beauty and the Beast reaches back to an older and healthier Hollywood tradition in which the best writers, musicians and filmmakers are gathered for a project on the assumption that a family audience deserves great entertainment, too.\\"[75] In 2001 Ebert again gave the IMAX re-release a full 4 out of 4 stars.[76] James Berardinelli of ReelViews rated the film similarly while hailing it as \\"the finest animated movie ever made\\", writing, \\"Beauty and the Beast attains a nearly-perfect mix of romance, music, invention, and animation.\\"[77] The use of computer animation, particularly in the ballroom sequence, was singled out in several reviews as one of the film's highlights.[10] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, calling the film \\"A delightfully satisfying modern fable, a near-masterpiece that draws on the sublime traditions of the past while remaining completely in sync with the sensibility of its time.\\"[78] Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, saying \\"It is a surprise, in a time of sequels and retreads, that the new film is so fresh and altogether triumphant in its own right.\\"[79] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars, saying \\"Beauty and the Beast is certainly adequate holiday entertainment for children and their more indulgent parents  But the film has little of the technical facility, vivid characterization and emotional impact of Disney past.\\"[80]\\r\\nJay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film four out of five stars, saying \\"It's not an especially scary movie, but right from the start, you can tell that this Beauty and the Beast has a beauty of a bite.\\"[81] John Hartl of The Seattle Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying \\"It's exceptionally difficult to make an audience care for animated characters unless they're mermaids or anthropomorphized animals or insects, yet the Disney animators, with a big assist from the vocal talents of a superb cast, have pulled it off.\\"[82] Gene Siskel, also of the Chicago Tribune, gave the film four out of four stars, saying \\"Beauty and the Beast is one of the year's most entertaining films for both adults and children.\\"[83] On their Beauty and the Beast edition of Siskel & Ebert, both Siskel and Roger Ebert proclaimed that the film is \\"a legitimate contender for Oscar consideration as Best Picture of the Year.\\" Michael Sragow of The New Yorker gave the film a positive review, saying \\"It's got storytelling vigor and clarity, bright, eclectic animation, and a frisky musical wit.\\"[84] Eric Smoodin writes in his book Animating Culture that the studio was trying to make up for earlier gender stereotypes with this film.[85] Smoodin also states that, in the way it has been viewed as bringing together traditional fairy tales and feminism as well as computer and traditional animation, the film's \\"greatness could be proved in terms of technology narrative or even politics\\".[86] Animation legend Chuck Jones praised the film, in a 1992 guest appearance on Later with Bob Costas he claimed he \\"Loved it. I think it should have won [Best Picture]  I think the animation on the beast is one of the greatest pieces of animation I've seen\\".[87]\\r\\nAnimation historian Michael Barrier wrote that Belle \\"becomes a sort of intellectual less by actually reading books, it seems, than by hanging out with them\\", but says that the film comes closer than other \\"Disney-studio\\" films to \\"accepting challenges of the kind that the finest Walt Disney features met\\".[88] David Whitley writes in The Idea of Nature in Disney Animation that Belle is different from earlier Disney heroines in that she is mostly free from the burdens of domestic housework, although her role is somewhat undefined in the same way that \\"contemporary culture now requires most adolescent girls to contribute little in the way of domestic work before they leave home and have to take on the fraught, multiple responsibilities of the working mother\\". Whitley also notes other themes and modern influences, such as the film's critical view of Gaston's chauvinism and attitude towards nature, the cyborg-like servants, and the father's role as an inventor rather than a merchant.[89]\\r\\nIn 2010, IGN named Beauty and the Beast as the greatest animated film of all time, directly ahead of WALL-E, The Incredibles, Toy Story 2, and The Iron Giant.[90]\\r\\nSeveral critics regard the 1991 animated film as superior to the 2017 live-action remake. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said that the 1991 film \\"worked wonderfully because it was pure Broadway, written for the screen, blending comedy and romance and magic and just enough snark in the margins\\", while the 2017 remake got lost in translation since \\"The movie takes our knowledge and our interest in the material for granted. It zips from one number to another, throwing a ton of frenetically edited eye candy at the screen, charmlessly.\\" Phillips also wrote of the 2017 film that \\"too often we're watching highly qualified performers, plus a few less conspicuously talented ones (Watson, primarily), stuck doing karaoke, or motion-capture work of middling quality\\".[91] Dana Schwartz of the Observer criticized some of the 2017 film changes to the characters like Gaston and the Beast as regressive by watering down their distinguishing personalities from the 1991 film, also arguing that the added backstory to the characters in the 2017 version failed to \\"advance the plot or theme in any meaningful way\\".[92] David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that the 2017 film \\"feels particularly egregious, in part, because its so slavishly devoted to the original; every time it falls short of its predecessor (which is quite often), its hard not to notice\\".[93]\\r\\nDuring its initial release in 1991, the film grossed $145.9 million in revenues in North America and $351.9 million worldwide.[5] It ranked as the third-most successful film of 1991 in North America, surpassed only by the summer blockbusters Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.[94] At the time Beauty and the Beast was the most successful animated Disney film release, and the first animated film to reach $100 million in the United States and Canada in its initial run.[95][96] In its IMAX re-release, it earned $25.5 million in North America and $5.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $31 million.[97] It also earned $9.8 million from its 3D re-release overseas.[5] During the opening weekend of its North American 3D re-release in 2012, Beauty and the Beast grossed $17.8 million, coming in at the No. 2 spot, behind Contraband, and achieved the highest opening weekend for an animated film in January.[98][99] The film was expected to make $17.5 million over the weekend; however, the results topped its forecast and the expectations of box office analysts.[100][101] The re-release ended its run on May 3, 2012, and earned $47.6 million, which brought the film's total gross in North America to $219 million.[102] It made an estimated $206 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $425 million.[5]\\r\\n Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's song \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, while Menken's score won the award for Best Original Score.[103] Two other Menken and Ashman songs from the film, \\"Belle\\" and \\"Be Our Guest\\", were also nominated for Best Original Song.[103] Beauty and the Beast was the first picture to receive three Academy Award nominations for Best Original Song, a feat that would be repeated by The Lion King (1994), Dreamgirls (2006), and Enchanted (2007).[103] Academy rules have since been changed to limit each film to two nominations in this category, due to the consecutive unintentional failures of Dreamgirls and Enchanted to win the award.[103]\\r\\nThe film was also nominated for Best Picture and Best Sound.[103] It was the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture, and remained the only animated film nominated until 2009 when the Best Picture field was widened to ten nominees, and it remains the only animated film nominated for the award when it had five nominees.[103] It became the first musical in twelve years to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture of the Year, following All That Jazz (1979), and the last one to be nominated until Moulin Rouge! (2001), ten years later.[103] It lost the Best Picture award to The Silence of the Lambs.[103] With six nominations, the film currently shares the record for the most nominations for an animated film with WALL-E (2008), although, with three nominations in the Best Original Song category, Beauty and the Beast's nominations span only four categories, while WALL-E's nominations cover six individual categories.[103]\\r\\nWhile The Little Mermaid was the first to be nominated, Beauty and the Beast became the first animated film to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture ÿ Musical or Comedy.[103] This feat was later repeated by The Lion King and Toy Story 2.[103]\\r\\nIn 2002, Beauty and the Beast was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its \\"Ten Top Ten\\" lists of the best ten films in ten \\"classic\\" American film genres, based on polls of over 1,500 people from the creative community. Beauty and the Beast was acknowledged as the seventh-best film in the animation genre.[106][107] In previous lists, it ranked number 22 on the Institutes's list of best musicals and number 34 on its list of the best romantic American films.[108] On the list of the greatest songs from American films, Beauty and the Beast ranked number 62.[109]\\r\\nAmerican Film Institute recognition:\\r\\nAccording to an article in the Houston Chronicle, \\"The catalyst for Disney's braving the stage was an article by The New York Times theater critic Frank Rich that praised Beauty and the Beast as 1991's best musical  Theatre Under The Stars executive director Frank Young had been trying to get Disney interested in a stage version of Beauty about the same time Eisner and Katzenberg were mulling over Rich's column. But Young couldn't seem to get in touch with the right person in the Disney empire. Nothing happened till the Disney execs started to pursue the project from their end  When they asked George Ives, the head of Actors Equity on the West Coast, which Los Angeles theater would be the best venue for launching a new musical, Ives said the best theater for that purpose would be TUTS. Not long after that, Disney's Don Frantz and Bettina Buckley contacted Young, and the partnership was under way.\\"[115] A stage condensation of the film, directed by Robert Jess Roth and choreographed by Matt West, both of whom moved on to the Broadway development, had already been presented at Disneyland at what was then called the Videopolis stage.[115] Beauty and the Beast premiered in a joint production of Theatre Under The Stars and Disney Theatricals at the Music Hall, Houston, Texas, from November 28, 1993, through December 26, 1993.[115]\\r\\nOn Monday, April 18, 1994, Beauty and the Beast premiered on Broadway at the Palace Theatre in New York City to mixed reviews.[116][117] The show transferred to the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on November 11, 1999.[118] The commercial (though not critical) success of the show led to productions in the West End, Toronto, and all over the world.[118] The Broadway version, which ran for over a decade, received a Tony Award, and became the first of a whole line of Disney stage productions.[119] The original Broadway cast included Terrence Mann as the Beast, Susan Egan as Belle, Burke Moses as Gaston, Gary Beach as Lumire, Heath Lamberts as Cogsworth, Tom Bosley as Maurice, Beth Fowler as Mrs. Potts, and Stacey Logan as Babette the feather duster.[118] Many well-known actors and singers also starred in the Broadway production during its thirteen-year run, including Kerry Butler, Debbie Gibson, Toni Braxton, Andrea McArdle, Jamie-Lynn Sigler, Christy Carlson Romano, Ashley Brown, and Anneliese van der Pol as Belle; Chuck Wagner, James Barbour, and Jeff McCarthy as the Beast; Meshach Taylor, Patrick Page, Bryan Batt, Jacob Young, and John Tartaglia as Lumire; and Marc Kudisch, Christopher Sieber, and Donny Osmond as Gaston.[118] The show ended its Broadway run on July 29, 2007 after 46 previews and 5,461 performances.[118] As of 2017, it is Broadway's tenth-longest-running show in history.[118]\\r\\nIn June 2014, Walt Disney Pictures announced that a live-action film adaptation of the original film was in the works, with Bill Condon directing and Evan Spiliotopoulos writing the script.[120][121] Condon originally planned on not only drawing inspiration from the original film, but also to include most, if not all, of the Menken/Rice songs from the Broadway musical, with the intention of making the film as a \\"straight-forward, live-action, large-budget movie musical\\".[122] In September 2014, it was announced that Stephen Chbosky (The Perks of Being a Wallflower) would re-write the script.[123] In January 2015, Emma Watson announced on her Facebook page that she would portray Belle in the new live action remake film.[124] In March 2015, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, Emma Thompson, Josh Gad, Audra McDonald, and Kevin Kline joined the film as the Beast, Gaston, Mrs. Potts, Lefou, Garderobe, and Maurice, respectively.[125][126][127][128] The following month, Ian McKellen, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw joined the cast, as Cogsworth, Lumire, Cadenza, and Plumette, respectively.[129][130][131][132] Composer Alan Menken returned to score the film's music, with new material written by Menken and Tim Rice.[133] In June 2015, Menken said the film would not include the songs that were written for the Broadway musical.[134] Filming began on May 18, 2015 in London, and production officially wrapped in August 2015.[135][136] The film was released on March 17, 2017.[137]\\r\\nBeauty and the Beast merchandise cover a wide variety of products, among them storybook versions of the film's story, a comic book based on the film published by Disney Comics, toys, children's costumes, and other items. In addition, the character of Belle has been integrated into the \\"Disney Princess\\" line of Disney's Consumer Products division, and appears on merchandise related to that franchise.[138] In 1995, a live-action children's series entitled Sing Me a Story with Belle began running in syndication, remaining on the air through 1999.[139] Two direct-to-video followups (which take place during the timeline depicted in the original film) were produced by Walt Disney Television Animation: Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas in 1997 and Belle's Magical World in 1998; in contrast to the universal acclaim of the original, reception to the sequels was extremely negative.[140][141] Disney on Ice produced an ice version of the movie that opened in 1992 in Lakeland, Florida. The show was such a huge commercial and critical success, touring around the world to sell-out crowds, that a television special was made when it toured Spain in 1994.[142] The show ended its run in 2006, after 14 years.[142]\\r\\nThere are several video games that are loosely based on the film:\\r\\nThe first video game based on the film was titled Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Quest and is an action platformer for the Sega Genesis. Developed by Software Creations, the game was released in North America in 1993.[143] It is one of two video games based on the film that Sunsoft published for the Genesis, the other being Beauty & The Beast: Roar of the Beast. Characters from the film like Gaston can help the player past tricky situations. As Belle, the player must reach the Beast's castle and break the spell to live happily ever after. To succeed, she must explore the village, forest, castle, and snowy forest to solve puzzles and mini-games while ducking or jumping over enemies. Belle's health is represented by a stack of blue books, which diminishes when she touches bats, rats, and other hazards in the game. Extra lives, keys and other items are hidden throughout the levels. While there is no continue or game saving ability, players can use a code to start the game at any of the seven levels.[144]\\r\\nThe second video game based on the film was titled 'Beauty and the Beast: Roar of the Beast and is a side-scrolling video game for the Genesis. As the Beast, the player must successfully complete several levels, based on scenes from the film, in order to protect the castle from invading villagers and forest animals and rescue Belle from Gaston.[145]\\r\\nThe third and fourth video games based on the film are action platformers developed by Probe Software[146] and published by Hudson Soft. One, titled Beauty and the Beast, was released in Europe in 1994 for the NES,[147] while the other, Disney's Beauty and the Beast, was released in North America in July 1994 and in Europe on February 23 1995 for the SNES. The entire games are played through the perspective of the Beast. As the Beast, the player must get Belle to fall in love so that the curse cast upon him and his castle will be broken. The final boss of the game is Gaston.[146] The Beast can walk, jump, swipe, stomp, super stomp, and roar, the last of which is used to both damage enemies and reveal hidden objects.[148]\\r\\nThe fifth video game based on the film was titled Disney's Beauty and the Beast: A Boardgame Adventure and is a Disney Boardgame adventure for the Game Boy Color. It was released on October 25, 1999.[149]\\r\\nThe video game series Kingdom Hearts features a world based on the film, named \\"Beast's Castle\\", along with several of the film's characters. In the first game, the world has been destroyed and Belle kidnapped by the Heartless, led by Maleficent, but the Beast travels to Maleficent's stronghold and works with Sora to defeat Maleficent and rescue Belle and the other captured princesses.[150] In Kingdom Hearts II, the world has since been restored following Ansem's defeat, but Beast and Belle are having difficulties due to the enigmatic Xaldin of Organization XIII attempting to bring out the Beast's darker side in order to turn him into a Heartless and a Nobody, but the Beast eventually comes to his senses and works with Sora once again to defeat Xaldin once and for all. In the game's ending credits, the Beast turns back into the Prince. In Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days, the world is featured as a playable level but the story is not essential to the main plot. In Kingdom Hearts , the world is featured again, this time as a hallucination that follows the plot of the movie more closely. The characters featured in the series are Beast, Belle, Lumiere, Gaston, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Maurice, and the Wardrobe. After Gaston is defeated, the Beast transforms back into the Prince. Gaston does not appear in Kingdom Hearts II, the world's primary antagonist being Xaldin, an original character created for the series, but who shares several traits with Forte, the main antagonist of Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas.[151]","input":"When was disney beauty and the beast first released?"},{"output":"Liberia","context":"The Society for the Colonization of Free People of Color of America, commonly known as the American Colonization Society (ACS), was a group established in 1816 by Robert Finley of New Jersey which supported the migration of free African Americans to the continent of Africa. It helped to found a colony on the Pepper Coast of West Africa (which became independent Liberia in 1848) in 1821ÿ22 as a place for free-born or manumitted American blacks. The ACS met with immediate and continuing objections from African Americans like James Forten and David Walker, who wished to remain in the land of their birth, saw colonization as a racist strategy for protecting slavery and purging the U.S. of its black citizens, and preferred to fight for equal rights at home.\\r\\nThe ACS was founded by groups otherwise opposed to each other on the issue of slavery,[5] being a coalition made up mostly of evangelicals and Quakers who supported abolition of slavery and believed blacks would face better chances for freedom in Africa than in the United States, and some slaveholders (in the Maryland branch and elsewhere) who saw repatriation as a way to remove free blacks from slave societies and avoid slave rebellions.[2] The Society attracted numerous prominent supporters from the Virginia Piedmont region. The two opposed groups found common ground in support of so-called \\"repatriation\\".[2]\\r\\nAmong the society's supporters were Charles Fenton Mercer, Henry Clay, John Randolph, Richard Bland Lee and Bushrod Washington.[1][2][3][4][6] The Society was especially prominent among slaveowners in the Virginia Piedmont region in the 1820s and 1830s. American presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and James Madison were among its supporters. James Madison served as the Society's president in the early 1830s.[7]\\r\\nFrom 1821, thousands of free blacks, who faced legislated restrictions in much of the U.S., moved to Liberia.[2] Over twenty years, the colony continued to grow and establish economic stability. In 1847, the legislature of Liberia declared the nation an independent state. The ACS had closely controlled the development of Liberia until its declaration of independence. By 1867, the ACS had assisted in the emigration of more than 13,000 Americans to Liberia.\\r\\nFrom 1825 to 1919, it published the African Repository and Colonial Journal.[8] After 1919, the society essentially ended, but it did not formally dissolve until 1964, when it transferred its papers to the Library of Congress.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the American Revolutionary War, the institution of slavery and those bound within it grew, as slaves were naturally increasing; their total number reached four million slaves by the mid-19th century.[10] At the same time, due in part to manumission efforts sparked by the war and the abolition of slavery in Northern states, there was an expansion of the number of free blacks, who faced legislated limits.[2] In the first two decades after the Revolutionary War, the percentage of free blacks rose in Virginia, for instance, from 1% to nearly 10% of the black population. Beginning in 1786, just after the American Revolution, a British organization, the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor, launched its efforts to establish the Sierra Leone Province of Freedom for London's \\"black poor\\".\\r\\nSome slave owners decided to support emigration following an abortive slave rebellion headed by Gabriel Prosser in 1800, and a rapid increase in the number of free African Americans in the United States in the first two decades after the Revolutionary War, which they perceived as threatening. Although the ratio of whites to blacks was 4:1 between 1790 and 1800, it was the increase in the number of free African Americans that disturbed some proponents of colonization. From 1790 to 1800, the number of free African Americans increased from 59,467 (1.5% of total US population, 7.5% of US black population) to 108,398 (2% of U.S. population), an increase of 48,931?; and from 1800 to 1810, the number increased from 108,398 to 186,446 (2.5% of U.S. pop.), an increase of 78,048 .[11] The perception of change was highest in some major cities, but especially in the Upper South, where the highest number of slaves were freed in the two decades after the Revolution.\\r\\nThis steady increase did not go unnoticed by an anxious white community that was ever more aware of the free blacks in their midst. The arguments propounded against free blacks, especially in free states, may be divided into four main categories:\\r\\nSoutherners had their special reservations about free blacks, fearing that those living in slave areas caused unrest among slaves and encouraged runaways and slave revolts. They also had racial reservations about the ability of free blacks to conform. The proposed solution was to have free blacks deported from the United States to colonize parts of Africa.[13]\\r\\nPaul Cuffee (1759ÿ1817) was a mixed-race, successful Quaker ship owner, and activist descended from Ashanti and Wampanoag parents. He advocated settling freed American slaves in Africa and gained support from the British government, free black leaders in the United States, and members of Congress to take emigrants to the British colony of Sierra Leone. Cuffee was an early advocate of settling freed blacks in Africa and he gained support from black leaders and members of the U.S. Congress for an emigration plan.[14] In 1815 he financed a trip and the following year,[15] in 1816, Cuffee took 38 American blacks to Freetown, Sierra Leone; other voyages were precluded by his death in 1817. By reaching a large audience with his pro-colonization arguments and practical example, Cuffee laid the groundwork for the American Colonization Society.[16]\\r\\nThe colonization effort resulted from a mixture of motives. Free-born blacks, freedmen, and their descendants, encountered widespread discrimination in the US of the early 19th century. Whites generally perceived them as a burden on society and a threat to white workers because they undercut wages. Some abolitionists believed that blacks could not achieve equality in the United States because of discrimination and would be better off in Africa where they could organize their own society. Many slaveholders worried that the presence of free blacks was a threat to the slave societies of the South, especially after some were involved directly in slave rebellions. The Society appeared to support contradictory goals: free blacks should be removed because they could not benefit America; on the other hand, free blacks would prosper and thrive under their own leadership in another land.[17]\\r\\nSome Society members were openly racist and frequently argued that free blacks would be unable to assimilate into the white society of America. John Randolph, a Virginia politician and major slaveholder, said that free blacks were \\"promoters of mischief.\\"[18] At this time, about 2 million African Americans lived in the United States; 200,000 were free persons of color, with most in the North, where they were restricted by law in various states.[2] Henry Clay, a US Representative from Kentucky, considered slavery to have a negative effect on the southern economy. But in this period Kentucky had become a state that was selling slaves to the Deep South, where demand was booming because of the rise of cotton. Clay thought that deportation of free blacks was preferable to trying to integrate them in America, believing that \\"unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country. It was desirable, therefore, as it respected them, and the residue of the population of the country, to drain them off.\\"[19]\\r\\nReverend Finley suggested at the inaugural meeting of the Society that a colony be established in Africa to take free people of color, most of whom had been born free, away from the United States. Finley meant to colonize \\"(with their consent) the free people of color residing in our country, in Africa, or such other place as Congress may deem most expedient.\\" The organization established branches throughout the United States. It was instrumental in establishing the colony of Liberia.[20]\\r\\nThe historiography of the American Colonization Society is defined by a theme of swinging between historians interpreting the Society as either a pro-slavery or anti-slavery organization. The oscillation in what has been the generally accepted interpretation of the ACS' motives and actions can be broken down chronologically with a good deal of precision. A number of monographs were written on the society in the early to mid-nineteenth century portraying the ACS as both pro- and anti-slavery.\\r\\nFor early studies that are critical of the ACS' motives, see: William L. Garrison, Thoughts on African Colonization, New York: Arno Press, 1968 [originally published in 1832]; William Jay, Miscellaneous Writings on Slavery.

Philadelphia: John W. Moore, 1857.\\r\\nThe early twentieth century saw increasing racial tensions in the wake of the dismantling of the South's enforced race-based class system and the sense among many white Americans that the wholesale emancipation of the 1860s had perhaps been a misguided decision. As a result, historiography of this period depicted the ACS as an antislavery organization, seeing merits in the values of racial separation through deportation that the Society espoused.[21] Beginning in the 1950s, racism was an increasingly important issue and by the late 1960s and 1970s it had been forced to the forefront of public consciousness by the Civil Rights movement. The prevalence of racism invited a revaluation of the Society's motives, prompting historians to examine the ACS in terms of racism more than its stance on slavery.[22] By the 1980s and 1990s, historians were going even further in reimagining the ACS. Not only were they focussing on the racist rhetoric of the Society's members and publications, but some also depicted the Society as proslavery organization.[23] Recently, however, the winds have shifted again with scholars retreating from an analysis of the ACS as proslavery, and with some cautiously characterizing it as an antislavery organization again.[24]\\r\\nThe ACS had its origins in 1816, when Charles Fenton Mercer, a Federalist member of the Virginia General Assembly, discovered accounts of earlier legislative debates on black colonization in the wake of Gabriel Prosser's rebellion. Mercer pushed the state to support the idea. One of his political contacts in Washington City, John Caldwell, in turn contacted the Reverend Robert Finley, his brother-in-law and a Presbyterian minister, who endorsed the plan.[25]\\r\\nOn December 21, 1816, the society was officially established at the Davis Hotel in Washington, D.C.. Attendees included James Monroe, Bushrod Washington, Andrew Jackson, Francis Scott Key, and Daniel Webster, with Henry Clay presiding over the meeting. Its co-founders were considered to be Henry Clay, John Randolph of Roanoke, Richard Bland Lee and Bushrod Washington. Mercer was unable to go to Washington for the meeting.\\r\\nAlthough Randolph believed that the removal of free blacks would \\"materially tend to secure\\" slave property, the vast majority of early members were philanthropists, clergy, and abolitionists who wanted to free African slaves and their descendants and provide them with the opportunity to \\"return\\" to Africa.[26] Few members were slave-owners, and the Society never enjoyed much support among planters in the Lower South. This was the area that developed most rapidly in the 19th century with slave labor, and initially it had few free blacks, who lived mostly in the Upper South.\\r\\nDuring the next three years, the society raised money by selling memberships. The Society's members pressured Congress and the President for support. In 1819, they received $100,000 from Congress, and on February 6, 1820, the first ship, the Elizabeth, sailed from New York for West Africa with three white ACS agents and 88 African-American emigrants aboard.[27]\\r\\nThe ACS purchased the freedom of some American slaves and paid their passage to Liberia and emigration?was also offered to already free black people. Colonizing proved expensive and the ACS spent many years trying to persuade the U.S. Congress to allocate funds to support colonists emigration to Liberia. Henry Clay led this campaign, but the campaign failed to produce any money from the U.S. Congress. Despite their failure to receive funding from the U.S government, in the 1850s, the ACS was successful in receiving financial backing from some state legislatures, such as Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, plus more. In 1850, the state of Virginia?set aside $30,000 annually for five years to aid and support emigration.The society, in its Thirty-fourth annual report, acclaimed the news as \\"a great Moral demonstration of the propriety and necessity of state action!\\"[28][29]\\r\\nDuring the 1850s, the society also received several thousand dollars from the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Missouri, and Maryland legislatures. Pennsylvania, Maryland and Mississippi set up their own state societies and colonies on the coast next to Liberia.[28] Mississippi-in-Africa joined Liberia in 1847; the Republic of Maryland, established as a colony in the 1830s, remained independent until 1857 as its state society wanted to maintain a trade monopoly.\\r\\nJehudi Ashmun, an early leader of the ACS, took steps to lease, annex, or buy tribal lands along the coast and along major rivers leading inland in Africa in 1825 and 1826, where he intended to establish an American empire. In 1821, Lt. Robert Stockton, Ashmun's predecessor, had pointed a pistol to the head of King Peter, which allowed Stockton to persuade King Peter to sell Cape Montserrado (or Mesurado) and to establish Monrovia.[30] Stockton's actions inspired Ashmun to use aggressive tactics in his negotiations with King Peter and in May 1825, King Peter and other native kings agreed to a treaty with Ashmun. The treaty negotiated land to Ashmun and in return, the natives received three barrels of rum, five casks of powder, five umbrellas, ten pairs of shoes, ten iron posts, and 500 bars of tobacco, as well as other items.[31]\\r\\nThe ship pulled in first at Freetown, Sierra Leone, from where it sailed south to what is now the northern coast of Liberia. The emigrants started to establish a settlement. All three whites and 22 of the emigrants died within three weeks from yellow fever. The remainder returned to Sierra Leone and waited for another ship. The Nautilus sailed twice in 1821 and established a settlement at Mesurado Bay on an island they named Perseverance. It was difficult for the early settlers, made of mostly free-born blacks who had been denied the full rights of United States citizenship. In Liberia, the native Africans resisted the expansion of the colonists, resulting in many armed conflicts between them. Nevertheless, in the next decade 2,638 African Americans migrated to the area. Also, the colony entered an agreement with the U.S. Government to accept freed slaves who were taken from illegal slave ships.\\r\\nDuring the next 20 years the colony continued to grow and establish economic stability. From the establishment of the colony, the ACS had employed white agents to govern the colony. In 1842, Joseph Jenkins Roberts became the first non-white governor of Liberia. In 1847, the legislature of Liberia declared itself an independent state, with J.J. Roberts elected as its first President.\\r\\nThe society in Liberia developed into three segments: settlers with European-African lineage, freed slaves from slave ships and the West Indies, and indigenous native people. These groups would have a profound effect on the history of Liberia.\\r\\nStarting in March 1825, the ACS began a quarterly,?The African Repository and Colonial Journal. Ralph Randolph Gurley (1797-1872), who headed the Society until 1844, edited the journal. The journal promoted both colonization and Liberia, but the journal was primarily a medium for ACS propaganda. Included in the journal were articles about Africa, lists of donors, letters of praise, information about emigrants, and official dispatches that espoused the prosperity and continued growth of the colony.[32]\\r\\nThe ACS continued to operate during the American Civil War, and colonized 168 blacks while it was being waged. It sent 2,492 blacks to Liberia in the following five years. The federal government provided a small amount support for these operations through the Freedmen's Bureau.[33]\\r\\nSince the 1840s, Lincoln, an admirer of Clay, had been an advocate of the ACS program of colonizing blacks in Liberia. Early in his presidency, Abraham Lincoln tried repeatedly to arrange resettlement of the kind the ACS supported, but each arrangement failed.\\r\\nSome scholars believe that Lincoln abandoned the idea by 1863, following the use of black troops. Biographer Stephen B. Oates has observed that Lincoln thought it immoral to ask black soldiers to fight for the U.S. and then to remove them to Africa after their military service. Others, such as the historian Michael Lind, believe that as late as 1864, Lincoln continued to hold out hope for colonization, noting that he allegedly asked Attorney General Edward Bates if the Reverend James Mitchell could stay on as \\"your assistant or aid in the matter of executing the several acts of Congress relating to the emigration or colonizing of the freed Blacks.\\"[34] Mitchell, a former state director of the ACS in Indiana, had been appointed by Lincoln in 1862 to oversee the government's colonization programs.\\r\\nBy late into his second term as president, Lincoln had publicly abandoned the idea of colonization after speaking with Frederick Douglass about the matter,[35] who objected harshly to it. On April 11, 1865, with the war drawing to a close, Lincoln gave a public speech at the White House supporting suffrage for blacks, a speech that led actor John Wilkes Booth, who was vigorously opposed to emancipation and black suffrage, to assassinate him.[36]\\r\\nSome black abolitionists consistently opposed the ACS from its founding. Beginning in the 1830s, some white abolitionists joined them, criticizing colonization as a slaveholders' scheme and the Society's works as palliative propaganda to soften the continuation of slavery in the United States. The presidents of the ACS tended to be Southerners. The first president of the ACS was Bushrod Washington, the nephew of U.S. President George Washington and an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.[4][37] From 1836 to 1849 the statesman Henry Clay of Kentucky, a planter and slaveholder, was ACS president.\\r\\nThree of the reasons the movement never became very successful were lack of interest by free blacks and opposition by some abolitionists,[38] the scale and costs of moving many people (there were 4 million freedmen in the South after the Civil War), and the difficulty in finding locations willing to accept large numbers of black newcomers (some African groups were averse to accepting newcomers,[citation needed] so the society relied on creating settlements at small colonial ports).\\r\\nIn 1913, and again at its formal dissolution in 1964, the Society donated its records to the U.S. Library of Congress. The donated materials contain a wealth of information about the founding of the society, its role in establishing Liberia, efforts to manage and defend the colony, fundraising, recruitment of settlers, conditions for black citizens of the American South, and the way in which black settlers built and led the new nation.[39]\\r\\nIn Liberia, the Society maintained offices at the junction of Ashmun and Buchanan Streets at the heart of Monrovia's commercial district, next to the True Whig Party headquarters in the Edward J. Roye Building. Its offices at the site closed in 1956 when the government demolished all the buildings at the intersection for the purpose of constructing new public buildings there. Nevertheless, the land officially remained the property of the Society into the 1980s, amassing large amounts of back taxes because the Ministry of Finance could not find an address to which to send property tax bills.[40]","input":"What nation was founded as a result of the acs?"},{"output":"encourage common people in the Colonies to fight for egalitarian government","context":"Common Sense[1] is a pamphlet written by Thomas Paine in 1775ÿ76 advocating independence from Great Britain to people in the Thirteen Colonies. Written in clear and persuasive prose, Paine marshaled moral and political arguments to encourage common people in the Colonies to fight for egalitarian government. It was published anonymously on January 10, 1776, at the beginning of the American Revolution, and became an immediate sensation.\\r\\nIt was sold and distributed widely and read aloud at taverns and meeting places. In proportion to the population of the colonies at that time (2.5 million), it had the largest sale and circulation of any book published in American history.[2] As of 2006, it remains the all-time best selling American title, and is still in print today.[3]\\r\\nCommon Sense made public a persuasive and impassioned case for independence, which before the pamphlet had not yet been given serious intellectual consideration. He connected independence with common dissenting Protestant beliefs as a means to present a distinctly American political identity, structuring Common Sense as if it were a sermon.[4][5] Historian Gordon S. Wood described Common Sense as \\"the most incendiary and popular pamphlet of the entire revolutionary era\\".[6]\\r\\nThe text was translated into French by Antoine Gilbert Griffet de Labaume in 1790.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Paine arrived in the American colonies in November 1774, shortly before the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Though the colonies and Great Britain had commenced hostilities against one another, the thought of independence was not initially entertained. Writing of his early experiences in the colonies in 1778, Paine \\"found the disposition of the people such, that they might have been led by a thread and governed by a reed. Their attachment to Britain was obstinate, and it was, at that time, a kind of treason to speak against it. Their ideas of grievance operated without resentment, and their single object was reconciliation.\\"[7] Paine quickly engrained himself in the Philadelphia newspaper business, and began writing Common Sense in late 1775 under the working title of Plain Truth. Though it began as a series of letters to be published in various Philadelphia papers, it grew too long and unwieldy to publish as letters, leading Paine to select the pamphlet form.[8] Benjamin Rush recommended the publisher Robert Bell, promising Paine that, where other printers might balk at the content of the pamphlet, Bell would not hesitate nor delay its printing. Bell zealously promoted the pamphlet in Philadelphia's papers, and demand grew so high as to require a second printing.[9] Paine, overjoyed with its success, endeavored to collect his share of the profits and donate them to purchase mittens for General Montgomery's troops, then encamped in frigid Quebec.[10] However, when Paine's chosen intermediaries audited Bell's accounts, they found that the pamphlet actually had made zero profits. Incensed, Paine ordered Bell not to proceed on a second edition, as he had planned several appendices to add to Common Sense. Bell ignored this and began advertising a \\"new edition\\". While Bell believed this advertisement would convince Paine to retain his services, it had the opposite effect. Paine secured the assistance of the Bradford brothers, publishers of the Pennsylvania Evening Post, and released his new edition, featuring several appendices and additional writings.[11] Bell began working on a second edition. This set off a month-long public debate between Bell and the still-anonymous Paine, conducted within the pages and advertisements of the Pennsylvania Evening Post, with each party charging the other with duplicity and fraud. Both Paine and Bell published several more editions through the end of their public squabble.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe publicity generated by the initial success and compounded by the publishing disagreements no doubt propelled the pamphlet to incredible sales and circulation. Common Sense sold almost 100,000 copies in 1776,[12] and according to Paine, 120,000 copies were sold in the first three months. One biographer estimates that 500,000 copies sold in the first year (in both America and Europe ÿ predominantly France and Britain), and another writes that Paine's pamphlet went through twenty-five published editions in the first year alone.[6][13]\\r\\nAside from the printed pamphlet itself, there were many handwritten summaries and whole copies circulated. Paine also granted publishing rights to nearly every imprint which requested them, including several international editions.[14] It was immensely popular in France, where it was published without its diatribes against monarchy.[15] At least one newspaper printed the entire pamphlet; the Connecticut Courant did so in its issue of February 19, 1776.[16] Writing in 1956, Richard Gimbel estimated, in terms of circulation and impact, that an \\"equivalent sale today, based on the present population of the United States, would be more than six-and-one-half million copies within the short space of three months\\".[14]\\r\\nFor nearly three months, Paine managed to maintain his anonymity, even during Bell's potent newspaper polemics. His name did not become officially connected with the independence controversy until March 30, 1776.[17] Paine never did recoup the profits he felt due to him from Bell's first edition. Ultimately, he lost money on the Bradford printing as well, and because he decided to repudiate his copyright, never did profit from Common Sense.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first and subsequent editions divided the pamphlet into four sections.\\r\\nIn his first section, Paine related common Enlightenment theories of the state of nature, in order to establish a foundation for republican government. Paine began this section by making a distinction between society and government, arguing that government is a \\"necessary evil\\". He illustrated the power of society to create and maintain happiness in man through the example of a few isolated people that find it easier to live together rather than apart, creating society. As society continues to grow, a government becomes necessary to prevent the natural evil Paine saw in man. In order to promote civil society through laws and account for the impossibility of all people meeting centrally to make laws, representation and therefore elections become necessary. As this model was clearly intended to mirror the situation of the colonists at the time of publication, Paine went on to consider the Constitution of the United Kingdom.\\r\\nPaine found two tyrannies in the English constitution; monarchical and aristocratic tyranny, in the king and peers, who rule by heredity and contribute nothing to the people. Paine criticized the English constitution by examining the relationship between the king, the peers, and the commons.\\r\\nIn the second section Paine considers monarchy first from a biblical perspective, then from a historical perspective. He begins by arguing that all men are equal at creation and, therefore, the distinction between kings and subjects is a false one. Paine then examines some of the problems that kings and monarchies have caused in the past and concludes:\\r\\nIn England a king hath little more to do than to make war and give away places; which in plain terms, is to impoverish the nation and set it together by the ears. A pretty business indeed for a man to be allowed eight hundred thousand sterling a year for, and worshipped into the bargain! Of more worth is one honest man to society and in the sight of God, than all the crowned ruffians that ever lived.\\r\\nIn this section, Paine also attacks one type of \\"mixed state\\"?ÿ the constitutional monarchy promoted by John Locke in which the powers of government are separated between a Parliament or Congress that makes the laws, and a monarch who executes them. The constitutional monarchy, according to Locke, would limit the powers of the king sufficiently to ensure that the realm would remain lawful rather than easily becoming tyrannical. According to Paine, however, such limits are insufficient. In the mixed state, power will tend to concentrate into the hands of the monarch, permitting him eventually to transcend any limitations placed upon him. Paine questions why the supporters of the mixed state, since they concede that the power of the monarch is dangerous, wish to include a monarch in their scheme of government in the first place.\\r\\nIn the third section Paine examines the hostilities between England and the American colonies and argues that the best course of action is independence. Paine proposes a Continental Charter (or Charter of the United Colonies) that would be an American Magna Carta. Paine writes that a Continental Charter \\"should come from some intermediate body between the Congress and the people\\" and outlines a Continental Conference that could draft a Continental Charter.[19] Each colony would hold elections for five representatives. These five would be accompanied by two members of the assembly of colonies, for a total of seven representatives from each colony in the Continental Conference. The Continental Conference would then meet and draft a Continental Charter that would secure \\"freedom and property to all men, and the free exercise of religion\\".[19] The Continental Charter would also outline a new national government, which Paine thought would take the form of a Congress.\\r\\nPaine suggested that a congress may be created in the following way: each colony should be divided in districts; each district would \\"send a proper number of delegates to Congress\\".[19] Paine thought that each colony should send at least 30 delegates to Congress, and that the total number of delegates in Congress should be at least 390. The Congress would meet annually, and elect a president. Each colony would be put into a lottery; the president would be elected, by the whole congress, from the delegation of the colony that was selected in the lottery. After a colony was selected, it would be removed from subsequent lotteries until all of the colonies had been selected, at which point the lottery would start anew. Electing a president or passing a law would require three-fifths of the congress.\\r\\nThe fourth section of the pamphlet includes Paine's optimistic view of America's military potential at the time of the revolution. For example, he spends pages describing how colonial shipyards, by using the large amounts of lumber available in the country, could quickly create a navy that could rival the Royal Navy.\\r\\nDue to heavy advertisement by both Bell and Paine, and the immense publicity created by their publishing quarrel, Common Sense was an immediate sensation not only in Philadelphia but also across the Thirteen Colonies. Early \\"reviewers\\" (mainly letter excerpts published anonymously in colonial newspapers) touted the clear and rational case for independence put forth by Paine. One Marylander wrote to the Pennsylvania Evening Post on February 6, 1776, that \\"if you know the author of COMMON SENSE, tell him he has done wonders and worked miracles. His stile [sic] is plain and nervous; his facts are true; his reasoning, just and conclusive\\". [20] The author went on to claim that the pamphlet was highly persuasive in swaying people towards independence. This mass appeal, one later reviewer noted, was due to Paine's dramatic calls for popular support of revolution, \\"giv[ing] liberty to every individual to contribute materials for that great building, the grand charter of American Liberty\\".[21] Paine's vision of a radical democracy, unlike the checked and balanced nation later favored by conservatives like John Adams, was highly attractive to the popular audience which read and reread Common Sense. In the months leading up to the Declaration of Independence, many more reviewers noted that these two main themesdirect and passionate style and calls for individual empowermentwere decisive in swaying the Colonists from reconciliation to rebellion. The pamphlet was also highly successful because of a brilliant marketing tactic planned by Paine. He and Bell timed the first edition to be published at around the same time as a proclamation on the colonies by King George III, hoping to contrast the strong, monarchical message with the heavily anti-monarchical Common Sense.[9] Luckily, the speech and the first advertisement of the pamphlet appeared on the same day within the pages of the Pennsylvania Evening Post.[22]\\r\\nWhile Paine focused his style and address towards the common people, the arguments he made touched on prescient debates of morals, government, and the mechanisms of democracy.[23] This gave Common Sense a \\"second life\\" in the very public call-and-response nature of newspaper debates made by intellectual men of letters throughout Philadelphia. Paine's formulation of \\"war for an idea\\" led to, as Eric Foner describes it, \\"a torrent of letters, pamphlets, and broadsides on independence and the meaning of republican government ... attacking or defending, or extending and refining Paine's ideas\\".[24][25]\\r\\nJohn Adams, who would succeed George Washington to become the new nation's second president, in his Thoughts on Government wrote that Paine's ideal sketched in Common Sense was \\"so democratical, without any restraint or even an attempt at any equilibrium or counter poise, that it must produce confusion and every evil work\\".[26] Others, such the writer calling himself \\"Cato\\", denounced Paine as dangerous and his ideas as violent.[27] Paine was also an active and willing participant in what would become essentially a six month publicity tour for independence. Writing as \\"The Forester\\", he responded to Cato and other critics in the pages of Philadelphian papers with passion, declaring again in sweeping language that their conflict was not only with Great Britain, but with the tyranny inevitably resulting from monarchical rule.[28]\\r\\nLater scholars have assessed Common Sense's influence in several ways. Some, like A. Owen Aldridge, emphasize that Common Sense could hardly be said to embody a particular ideology, and that \\"even Paine himself may not have been cognizant of the ultimate source of many of his concepts\\", making the point that much of the pamphlet's value came as a result of the context in which it was published.[29] Eric Foner wrote that the pamphlet touched a radical populace at the height of their radicalism, which culminated in Pennsylvania with a new constitution aligned along Paine's principles.[30] Many have noted that Paine's skills were chiefly in persuasion and propaganda, and that no matter the content of his ideas, the fervor of his conviction and the various tools he employed on his readers (e.g. asserting his Christianity when he in fact was a Deist), that Common Sense was bound for success.[31] Still others emphasized the uniqueness of Paine's vision, with Craig Nelson calling him a \\"pragmatic utopian\\", who deemphasized economic arguments in favor of moralistic ones, thus giving credence to the Common Sense-as-propaganda argument.[32]\\r\\nEach of these arguments is in some way true, and together they portray Common Sense as an impressive piece of propaganda advocating a distinct and timely action and set of principles. Coupling this with the immense publicity and readership created by both the publishing dispute and the newspaper debates establishes Common Sense as an important stepping stone towards independence.[citation needed]","input":"What effect did common sense have on the colonists?"},{"output":"John Bryan, an ambitious businessman","context":"John Bryan State Park is a 752-acre (304?ha) Ohio state park in Greene County, Ohio. The park surrounds Clifton Gorge, a deep cut of the Little Miami River between Yellow Springs and Clifton.[2] The park contains a campground, and hiking and biking trails.[3] The park also abuts the Clifton Gorge State Nature Preserve.\\r\\nThe Cincinnati-Pittsburgh stagecoach road served the area and several enterprising settlers began establishing water-powered industries in the gorge. The town of Clifton prospered from the textile mill, grist mills and sawmills located there.\\r\\nBy the late 19th century, most of the industrial activity in the area ceased. Water was no longer an economical source of power and many mills were abandoned. However, one of the grist mills built in 1802 is still in operation. Located in the village of Clifton, the Clifton Mill is open to visitors.\\r\\nIn 1896, John Bryan, an ambitious businessman, purchased 335 acres (136?ha) along the Clifton gorge area and called these acres \\"Riverside Farm.\\" This portion of the Little Miami River was a vital, economical source of power for the early settlers in the 19th century.

They help the activity of other immune cells by releasing T cell cytokines. These cells help suppress or regulate immune responses. They are essential in B cell antibody class switching, in the activation and growth of cytotoxic T cells, and in maximizing bactericidal activity of phagocytes such as macrophages.\\r\\nMature Th cells express the surface protein CD4 and are referred to as CD4+ T cells. Such CD4+ T cells are generally treated as having a pre-defined role as helper T cells within the immune system. For example, when an antigen-presenting cell expresses an antigen on MHC class II, a CD4+ cell will aid those cells through a combination of cell to cell interactions (e.g. CD40 (protein) and CD40L) and through cytokines.\\r\\nCD154, also called CD40 ligand or CD40L, is a cell surface protein that mediates T cell helper function in a contact-dependent process[1] and is a member of the TNF superfamily of molecules. It binds to CD40 on antigen-presenting cells (APC), which leads to many effects depending on the target cell type. CD154 acts as a costimulatory molecule and is particularly important on a subset of T cells called T follicular helper cells (TFH cells).[2] On TFH cells, CD154 promotes B cell maturation and function by engaging CD40 on the B cell surface and therefore facilitating cell-cell communication.[3] A defect in this gene results in an inability to undergo immunoglobulin class switching and is associated with hyper IgM syndrome.[4] Absence of CD154 also stops the formation of germinal centers and therefore prohibiting antibody affinity maturation, an important process in the adaptive immune system.\\r\\nThe importance of helper T cells can be seen from HIV, a virus that primarily infects CD4+ T cells. In the advanced stages of HIV infection, loss of functional CD4+ T cells leads to the symptomatic stage of infection known as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). When the HIV virus is detected early in blood or other bodily fluids, continuous therapy can delay the time at which this fall happens. Therapy can also better manage the course of AIDS if and when it occurs. There are other rare disorders such as lymphocytopenia which result in the absence or dysfunction of CD4+ T cells. These disorders produce similar symptoms, many of which are fatal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing T cell development, matured, na?ve T cells leave the thymus and begin to spread throughout the body, including the lymph nodes. (Na?ve T cells are those T cells that have never been exposed to the antigen that they are programmed to respond to). Like all T cells, they express the T cell receptor-CD3 complex. The T cell receptor (TCR) consists of both constant and variable regions. The variable region determines what antigen the T cell can respond to. CD4+ T cells have TCRs with an affinity for Class II MHC, and CD4 is involved in determining MHC affinity during maturation in the thymus. Class II MHC proteins are generally only found on the surface of specialised antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Specialised antigen presenting cells are primarily dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells, although dendritic cells are the only cell group that expresses MHC Class II constitutively (at all times). Some APCs also bind native (or unprocessed) antigens to their surface, such as follicular dendritic cells, but unprocessed antigens do not interact with T cells and are not involved in their activation. The antigens that bind to MHC proteins are always short peptides, 8-10 amino acids long for MHC Class I, and up to 25 or so for MHC Class II.\\r\\nDuring an immune response, professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) endocytose foreign material (typically bacteria or viruses), which undergoes processing, then travel from the infection site to the lymph nodes. Once at the lymph nodes, the APC begin to present antigen peptides that are bound to Class II MHC, allowing CD4+ T cells that express the specific TCRs against the peptide/MHC complex to activate.\\r\\nWhen a Th cell encounters and recognises the antigen on an APC, the TCR-CD3 complex binds strongly to the peptide-MHC complex present on the surface of professional APCs. CD4, a co-receptor of the TCR complex, also binds to a different section of the MHC molecule. These interactions bring these proteins closer together, allowing the intracellular kinases present on the TCR, CD3 and CD4 proteins to activate each other via phosphorylation. With the assistance of a phosphatase present on the intracellular section of CD45 (common leukocyte antigen), these molecules activate major Th cell intracellular pathways. These active pathways are known as Signal 1 of T cell activation, as it is the first and primary pro-activation signal in a Th cell. Upon subsequent encounters with a given antigen, memory T cells are re-activated using the same TCR pathways.\\r\\nThe binding of the antigen-MHC to the TCR complex and CD4 may also help the APC and the Th cell adhere during Th cell activation, but the integrin protein LFA-1 on the T cell and ICAM on the APC are the primary molecules of adhesion in this cell interaction.\\r\\nIt is unknown what role the relatively bulky extracellular region of CD45 plays during cell interactions, but CD45 has various isoforms that change in size depending on the Th cell's activation and maturation status. For example, CD45 shortens in length following Th activation (CD45RA+ to CD45RO+), but whether this change in length influences activation is unknown. It has been proposed that the larger CD45RA+ may decrease the accessibility of the T cell receptor for the antigen-MHC molecule, thereby necessitating an increase in the affinity (and specificity) of the T cell for activation. Once the activation has occurred however, CD45 shortens, allowing easier interactions and activation as an effector T helper cell.[citation needed]\\r\\nHaving received the first TCR/CD3 signal, the na?ve T cell must activate a second independent biochemical pathway, known as Signal 2. This verification step is a protective measure to ensure that a T cell is responding to a foreign antigen. If this second signal is not present during initial antigen exposure, the T cell presumes that it is auto-reactive. This results in the cell becoming anergic (anergy is generated from the unprotected biochemical changes of Signal 1). Anergic cells will not respond to any antigen in the future, even if both signals are present later on. These cells are generally believed to circulate throughout the body with no value until they undergo apoptosis.\\r\\nThe second signal involves an interaction between CD28 on the CD4+ T cell and the proteins CD80 (B7.1) or CD86 (B7.2) on the professional APCs. Both CD80 and CD86 activate the CD28 receptor. These proteins are also known as co-stimulatory molecules.\\r\\nAlthough the verification stage is necessary for the activation of na?ve helper T cells, the importance of this stage is best demonstrated during the similar activation mechanism of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. As na?ve CD8+ T cells have no true bias towards foreign sources, these T cells must rely on the activation of CD28 for confirmation that they recognise a foreign antigen (as CD80/CD86 is only expressed by active APC's). CD28 plays an important role in decreasing the risk of T cell auto-immunity against host antigens.\\r\\nOnce the na?ve T cell has both pathways activated, the biochemical changes induced by Signal 1 are altered, allowing the cell to activate instead of anergise. The second signal is then obsolete; only the first signal is necessary for future activation. This is also true for memory T cells, which is one example of learned immunity. Faster responses occur upon reinfection because memory T cells have already undergone confirmation and can produce effector cells much sooner.\\r\\nOnce the two-signal activation is complete the T helper cell (Th) then allows itself to proliferate. It achieves this by releasing a potent T cell growth factor called interleukin 2 (IL-2) which acts upon itself in an autocrine fashion. Activated T cells also produce the alpha sub-unit of the IL-2 receptor (CD25 or IL-2R), enabling a fully functional receptor that can bind with IL-2, which in turn activates the T cell's proliferation pathways.\\r\\nThe autocrine or paracrine secretion of IL-2 can bind to that same Th cell or neighboring Th's via the IL-2R thus driving proliferation and clonal expansion. The Th cells receiving both signals of activation and proliferation will then become Th0 cells (T helper 0) cell that secrete IL-2, IL-4 and interferon gamma (IFN-). The Th0 cells will then differentiate into Th1 or Th2 cells depending on cytokine environment. IFN- drives Th1 cell production while IL-10 and IL-4 inhibit Th1 cell production. Conversely, IL-4 drives Th2 cell production and IFN- inhibits Th2 cells. It should be noted that these cytokines are pleiotropic and carry out many other functions of the immune response.\\r\\nIn 1991, three groups reported discovering CD154, which is the molecular basis of T cell helper function. Seth Lederman at Columbia University generated an murine monoclonal antibody, 5c8 that inhibited contact-dependent T cell helper function in human cells which characterized the 32 kDa surface protein transiently expressed on CD4+ T cells.[1] Richard Armitage at Immunex cloned a cDNA encoding CD154 by screening an expression library with CD40-Ig.[5] Randolph Noelle at Dartmouth Medical School generated an antibody that bound a 39 kDa protein on murine T cells and inhibited helper function.[6]\\r\\nHelper T cells are capable of influencing a variety of immune cells, and the T cell response generated (including the extracellular signals such as cytokines) can be essential for a successful outcome from infection. In order to be effective, helper T cells must determine which cytokines will allow the immune system to be most useful or beneficial for the host. Understanding exactly how helper T cells respond to immune challenges is currently of major interest in immunology, because such knowledge may be very useful in the treatment of disease and in increasing the effectiveness of vaccination.\\r\\nProliferating helper T cells that develop into effector T cells differentiate into two major subtypes of cells known as Th1 and Th2 cells (also known as Type 1 and Type 2 helper T cells, respectively).\\r\\nTh1 helper cells are the host immunity effectors against intracellular bacteria and protozoa. They are triggered by IL-12, IL-2 and their effector cytokine is IFN-. The main effector cells of Th1 immunity are macrophages as well as CD8 T cells, IgG B cells, and IFN- CD4 T cells. The key Th1 transcription factors are STAT4 and T-bet. IFN- secreted by CD4 T cells can activate macrophages to phagocytose and digest intracellular bacteria and protozoa. In addition, IFN- can activate iNOS to produce NOx free radicals to directly kill intracellular bacteria and protozoa. Th1 overactivation against autoantigens will cause Type 4 delayed-type hypersensitivity. Tuberculin reaction or Type 1 diabetes belong to this category of autoimmunity.[7]\\r\\nTh2 helper cells are the host immunity effectors against extracellular parasites including helminths. They are triggered by IL-4 and their effector cytokines are IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10 and IL-13. The main effector cells are eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells as well as B cells, and IL-4/IL-5 CD4 T cells. The key Th2 transcription factors are STAT6 and GATA3.[8] IL-4 is the positive feedback cytokine for Th2 cells differentiation. Besides, IL-4 stimulates B-cells to produce IgE antibodies, which in turn stimulate mast cells to release histamine, serotonin, and leukotriene to cause broncho-constriction, intestinal peristalsis, gastric fluid acidification to expel helminths. IL-5 from CD4 T cells will activate eosinophils to attack helminths. IL-10 suppresses Th1 cells differentiation and function of dendritic cells. Th2 overactivation against autoantigen will cause Type1 IgE-mediated allergy and hypersensitivity. Allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma belong to this category of autoimmunity.[7] In addition to expressing different cytokines, Th2 cells also differ from Th1 cells in their cell surface glycans (oligosaccharides), which makes them less susceptible to some inducers of cell death.[9][10]\\r\\nWhile we know about the types of cytokine patterns helper T cells tend to produce, we understand less about how the patterns themselves are decided. Various evidence suggests that the type of APC presenting the antigen to the T cell has a major influence on its profile. Other evidence suggests that the concentration of antigen presented to the T cell during primary activation influences its choice. The presence of some cytokines (such as the ones mentioned above) will also influence the response that will eventually be generated, but our understanding is nowhere near complete.\\r\\nTh17 helper cells are a subset of T helper cells developmentally distinct from Th1 and Th2 lineages producing interleukin 17 (IL-17).\\r\\nTHϫ helper cells provide the host immunity against viruses. Their differentiation is triggered by IFN ϫ/ or IL-10. Their key effector cytokine is IL-10. Their main effector cells are NK cells as well as CD8 T cells, IgG B cells, and IL-10 CD4 T cells. The key THϫ transcription factors are STAT1 and STAT3 as well as IRFs. IL-10 from CD4 T cells activate NK cells' ADCC to apoptose virus-infected cells and to induce host as well as viral DNA fragmentation. IFN alpha/beta can suppress transcription to avoid virus replication and transmission. Overactivation of THϫ against autoantigen will cause type 2 antibody-dependent cytotoxic hypersensitivity. Myasthenia gravis or Graves' disease belong to this category.[13]\\r\\nThe interactions between cytokines from the Th1/Th2 model can be more complicated in some animals. For example, the Th2 cytokine IL-10 inhibits cytokine production of both Th subsets in humans. Human IL-10 (hIL-10) suppresses the proliferation and cytokine production of all T cells and the activity of macrophages, but continues to stimulate plasma cells, ensuring that antibody production still occurs. As such, hIL-10 is not believed to truly promote the Th2 response in humans, but acts to prevent over-stimulation of helper T cells while still maximising the production of antibodies.\\r\\nThere are also other types of T cells that can influence the expression and activation of helper T cells, such as natural regulatory T cells, along with less common cytokine profiles such as the Th3 subset of helper T cells. Terms such as \\"regulatory\\" and \\"suppression\\" have become ambiguous after the discovery that helper CD4+ T cells are also capable of regulating (and suppressing) their own responses outside of dedicated regulatory T cells.\\r\\nOne major difference between regulatory T cells and effector T cells is that regulatory T cells typically serve to modulate and deactivate the immune response, while effector T cell groups usually begin with immune-promoting cytokines and then switch to inhibitory cytokines later in their life cycle. The latter is a feature of Th3 cells, which transform into a regulatory subset after its initial activation and cytokine production.\\r\\nBoth regulatory T cells and Th3 cells produce the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-) and IL-10. Both cytokines are inhibitory to helper T cells; TGF- suppresses the activity of most of the immune system. There is evidence to suggest that TGF- may not suppress activated Th2 cells as effectively as it might suppress naive cells, but it is not typically considered a Th2 cytokine.\\r\\nThe characterisation of another novel T helper subtype, T helper 17 cells (Th17)[14] has cast further doubt on the basic Th1/Th2 model. These IL-17 producing cells were initially described as a pathogenic population implicated in autoimmunity but are now thought to have their own distinct effector and regulatory functions. Of note, recent evidence suggest that functional plasticity is an intrinsic capacity of T helper cells. Indeed, a study in mice demonstrated that Th17 cells transform into Th1 cells in vivo.[15] A subsequent study furthermore showed that extensive T helper cell plasticity is also prominent in man.[16]\\r\\nMany of the cytokines in this article are also expressed by other immune cells (see individual cytokines for details), and it is becoming clear that while the original Th1/Th2 model is enlightening and gives insight into the functions of helper T cells, it is far too simple to define its entire role or actions. Some immunologists question the model completely, as some in vivo studies suggest that individual helper T cells usually do not match the specific cytokine profiles of the Th model, and many cells express cytokines from both profiles.[17] That said, the Th model has still played an important part in developing our understanding of the roles and behaviour of helper T cells and the cytokines they produce during an immune response.\\r\\nRecent scientific studies by Stockinger et al. revealed that another T helper subset may exist. Th9 cells are claimed to be an IL9 (interleukin 9)ÿproducing T cell subset focused on defending helminth infections.[18]\\r\\nHistorically, memory T cells were thought to belong to either the effector or central memory subtypes, each with their own distinguishing set of cell surface markers.[19] Central memory T cells reside in the lymph nodes while effector memory T cells lack the C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) and L-selectin (CD62L) receptors, which prevents them from trafficking to the lymph nodes.\\r\\nAdditional populations of memory T cells are now known to exist. These include tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells and virtual memory T cells [20]. The single unifying theme for all memory T cell subtypes is that they are long-lived and can quickly expand to large numbers of effector T cells upon encountering their cognate antigen. By this mechanism they provide the immune system with \\"memory\\" against previously encountered pathogens.\\r\\nConsidering the diverse and important role helper T cells play in the immune system, it is not surprising that these cells often influence the immune response against disease. They also appear to make occasional mistakes, or generate responses that would be politely considered non-beneficial. In the worst-case scenario, the helper T cell response could lead to a disaster and the fatality of the host. Fortunately this is a very rare occurrence.\\r\\nThe immune system must achieve a balance of sensitivity in order to respond to foreign antigens without responding to the antigens of the host itself. When the immune system responds to very low levels of antigen that it usually shouldn't respond to, a hypersensitivity response occurs. Hypersensitivity is believed to be the cause of allergy and some auto-immune disease.\\r\\nHypersensitivity reactions can be divided into four types:\\r\\nOther cellular hypersensitivities include cytotoxic T cell mediated auto-immune disease, and a similar phenomenon; transplant rejection. Helper T cells are required to fuel the development of these diseases. In order to create sufficient auto-reactive killer T cells, interleukin-2 must be produced, and this is supplied by CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells can also stimulate cells such as natural killer cells and macrophages via cytokines such as interferon-gamma, encouraging these cytotoxic cells to kill host cells in certain circumstances.\\r\\nThe mechanism that killer T cells use during auto-immunity is almost identical to their response against viruses, and some viruses have been accused of causing auto-immune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Cellular auto-immune disease occurs because the host antigen recognition systems fail, and the immune system believes, by mistake, that a host antigen is foreign. As a result, the CD8+ T cells treat the host cell presenting that antigen as infected, and go on to destroy all host cells (or in the case of transplant rejection, transplant organ) that express that antigen.\\r\\nSome of this section is a simplification. Many auto-immune diseases are more complex. A well-known example is rheumatoid arthritis, where both antibodies and immune cells are known to play a role in the pathology. Generally the immunology of most auto-immune diseases is not well understood.\\r\\nPerhaps the best example of the importance of CD4+ T cells is demonstrated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV mainly targets lymphoid CD4+ T cells, but can infect other cells that express CD4 such as macrophages and dendritic cells (both groups express CD4 at low levels).\\r\\nIt has been proposed that during the non-symptomatic phase of HIV infection, the virus has a relatively low affinity towards T cells (and has a higher affinity for macrophages), resulting in a slow kill rate of CD4+ T cells by the immune system[citation needed]. This is initially compensated for via the production of new helper T cells from the thymus (originally from the bone marrow). Once the virus becomes lymphotropic (or T-tropic) however, it begins to infect CD4+ T cells far more efficiently (likely due to a change in the co-receptors it binds to during infection), and the immune system is overwhelmed. Of note, recent studies suggest that only ~5% of the lymphoid-derived CD4 T cells targeted by HIV are permissive and become productively infected with the virus. More than 95% of the CD4 T cells that die are resting and are unable to support productive infection. These cells undergo abortive infection with HIV.[21] Cell death is triggered when the host cell detects HIV foreign DNA intermediates and initiates a suicidal death pathway in an attempt to protect the host, leading to caspase-1 activation in inflammasomes, thus causing pyroptosis (a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death).[22][23]\\r\\nAt this point chronic inflammation ensues, and functional CD4+ T cell levels begin to decrease, eventually to a point where the CD4+ T cell population is too small to recognize the full range of antigens that could potentially be detected. The depletion of CD4 T cells and the development of chronic inflammation are signature processes in HIV pathogenesis that propel progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). CD4 T cell depleted to the cell count of less than 200cell/L in blood during AIDS allows various pathogens to escape T cell recognition, thus allowing opportunistic infections that would normally elicit a helper T cell response to bypass the immune system.[24] While these complete bypass situations only occur when the helper T cell response is absolutely necessary for infection clearance, most infections increase in severity and/or duration because the immune system's helper T cells provide less efficient immune response.\\r\\nTwo components of the immune system are particularly affected in AIDS, due to its CD4+ T cell dependency:\\r\\nIf the patient does not respond to (or does not receive) HIV treatment they will succumb usually to either cancers or infections; the immune system finally reaches a point where it is no longer coordinated or stimulated enough to deal with the disease.\\r\\nInhibition of CD4 T-cell expansion during HIV infection may occur due to microbial translocation in an IL-10-dependent way. Triggering PD-1 expressed on activated monocytes by its ligand PD-L1, induces IL-10 production which inhibits CD4 T-cell function.[25]","input":"What is the function of t helper cells?"},{"output":"planning, control, and execution of voluntary movements","context":"The motor cortex is the region of the cerebral cortex involved in the planning, control, and execution of voluntary movements. Classically the motor cortex is an area of the frontal lobe located in the posterior precentral gyrus immediately anterior to the central sulcus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe motor cortex can be divided into three areas:\\r\\n1. the primary motor cortex is the main contributor to generating neural impulses that pass down to the spinal cord and control the execution of movement. However, some of the other motor areas in the brain also play a role in this function. It is located on the anterior paracentral lobule on the medial surface\\r\\n2. the premotor cortex is responsible for some aspects of motor control, possibly including the preparation for movement, the sensory guidance of movement, the spatial guidance of reaching, or the direct control of some movements with an emphasis on control of proximal and trunk muscles of the body. Located anterior to the primary motor cortex\\r\\n3. the supplementary motor area (or SMA), has many proposed functions including the internally generated planning of movement, the planning of sequences of movement, and the coordination of the two sides of the body such as in bi-manual coordination. Located on the midline surface of the hemisphere anterior to the primary motor cortex\\r\\nOther brain regions outside the cerebral cortex are also of great importance to motor function, most notably the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, pedunculopontine nucleus and the red nucleus, as well as other subcortical motor nuclei.\\r\\nIn the earliest work on the motor cortex, researchers recognized only one cortical field involved in motor control. Alfred Walter Campbell[1] was the first to suggest that there might be two fields, a \\"primary\\" motor cortex and an \\"intermediate precentral\\" motor cortex. His reasons were largely based on cytoarchitectonics, or the study of the appearance of the cortex under a microscope. The primary motor cortex contains cells with giant cell bodies known as \\"Betz cells\\". These cells were mistakenly thought to be the main outputs from the cortex, sending fibers to the spinal cord.[1] It has since been found that Betz cells account for about 2-3% of the projections from the cortex to the spinal cord, or about 10% of the projections from the primary motor cortex to the spinal cord.[2][3] The specific function of the Betz cells that distinguishes them from other output cells of the motor cortex remains unknown, but they continue to be used as a marker for the primary motor cortex.\\r\\nOther researchers, such as Vogt and Vogt[4] and Otfrid Foerster[5] also suggested that motor cortex was divided into a primary motor cortex (area 4, according to Brodmann's[6] naming scheme) and a higher-order motor cortex (area 6 according to Korbinian Brodmann).\\r\\nWilder Penfield[7][8] notably disagreed and suggested that there was no functional distinction between area 4 and area 6. In his view both were part of the same map, though area 6 tended to emphasize the muscles of the back and neck. Woolsey[9] who studied the motor map in monkeys also believed there was no distinction between primary motor and premotor. M1 was the name for the proposed single map that encompassed both the primary motor cortex and the premotor cortex.[9] Although sometimes \\"M1\\" and \\"primary motor cortex\\" are used interchangeably, strictly speaking, they derive from different conceptions of motor cortex organization.[citation needed]\\r\\nDespite the views of Penfield and Woolsey, a consensus emerged that area 4 and area 6 had sufficiently different functions that they could be considered different cortical fields. Fulton[10] helped to solidify this distinction between a primary motor cortex in area 4 and a premotor cortex in area 6. As Fulton pointed out, and as all subsequent research has confirmed, both primary motor and premotor cortex project directly to the spinal cord and are capable of some direct control of movement. Fulton showed that when the primary motor cortex is damaged in an experimental animal, movement soon recovers; when the premotor cortex is damaged, movement soon recovers; when both are damaged, movement is lost and the animal cannot recover.\\r\\nThe premotor cortex is now generally divided into four sections.[11][12][13] First it is divided into an upper (or dorsal) premotor cortex and a lower (or ventral) premotor cortex. Each of these is further divided into a region more toward the front of the brain (rostral premotor cortex) and a region more toward the back (caudal premotor cortex). A set of acronyms are commonly used: PMDr (premotor dorsal, rostral), PMDc, PMVr, PMVc. Some researchers use a different terminology. Field 7 or F7 denotes PMDr; F2 = PMDc; F5=PMVr; F4=PMVc.\\r\\nPMDc is often studied with respect to its role in guiding reaching.[14][15][16]\\r\\nPMDr may participate in learning to associate arbitrary sensory stimuli with specific movements or learning arbitrary response rules.[17][18][19]\\r\\nPMVc or F4 is often studied with respect to its role in the sensory guidance of movement. Neurons here are responsive to tactile stimuli, visual stimuli, and auditory stimuli.[20][21][22][23] These neurons are especially sensitive to objects in the space immediately surrounding the body, in so-called peripersonal space. Electrical stimulation of these neurons causes an apparent defensive movement as if protecting the body surface.[24][25] This premotor region may be part of a larger circuit for maintaining a margin of safety around the body and guiding movement with respect to nearby objects.[26]\\r\\nPMVr or F5 is often studied with respect to its role in shaping the hand during grasping and in interactions between the hand and the mouth.[27][28] Mirror neurons were first discovered in area F5 in the monkey brain by Rizzolatti and colleagues.[29][30] These neurons are active when the monkey grasps an object. Yet the same neurons become active when the monkey watches an experimenter grasp an object in the same way. The neurons are therefore both sensory and motor. Mirror neurons are proposed to be a basis for understanding the actions of others by internally imitating the actions using one's own motor control circuits.[30]\\r\\nPenfield[31] described a cortical motor area, the supplementary motor area (SMA), on the top or dorsal part of the cortex. Each neuron in the SMA may influence many muscles, many body parts, and both sides of the body.[32][33][34] The map of the body in SMA is therefore extensively overlapping. SMA projects directly to the spinal cord and may play some direct role in the control of movement.[35]\\r\\nBased on early work using brain imaging techniques in the human brain, Roland[36] suggested that the SMA was especially active during the internally generated plan to make a sequence of movements. In the monkey brain, neurons in the SMA are active in association with specific learned sequences of movement.[37]\\r\\nOthers have suggested that, because the SMA appears to control movement bilaterally, it may play a role in inter-manual coordination.[38]\\r\\nYet others have suggested that, because of the direct projection of SMA to the spinal cord and because of its activity during simple movements, it may play a direct role in motor control rather than solely a high level role in planning sequences.[35][39]\\r\\nOn the basis of the movements evoked during electrical stimulation, it has been suggested that the SMA may have evolved in primates as a specialist in the part of the motor repertoire involving climbing and other complex locomotion.[11][40]\\r\\nBased on the pattern of projections to the spinal cord, it has been suggested that another set of motor areas may lie next to the supplementary motor area, on the medial (or midline) wall of the hemisphere.[35] These medial areas are termed the cingulate motor areas. Their functions are not yet understood.\\r\\nIn 1870 Eduard Hitzig and Gustav Fritsch demonstrated that electrical stimulation of certain parts of the dog brain resulted in muscular contraction on the opposite side of the body.[41]\\r\\nA little later, in 1874, David Ferrier,[42] working in the laboratory of the West Riding Lunatic Asylum at Wakefield (at the invitation of its director, James Crichton-Browne), mapped the motor cortex in the monkey brain using electrical stimulation. He found that the motor cortex contained a rough map of the body with the feet at the top (or dorsal part) of the brain and the face at the bottom (or ventral part) of the brain. He also found that when electrical stimulation was maintained for a longer time, such as for a second, instead of being discharged over a fraction of a second, then some coordinated, seemingly meaningful movements could be caused, instead of only muscle twitches.\\r\\nAfter Ferrier's discovery, many neuroscientists used electrical stimulation to study the map of the motor cortex in many animals including monkeys, apes, and humans.[1][4][5][43][44]\\r\\nOne of the first detailed maps of the human motor cortex was described in 1905 by Campbell.[1] He did autopsies on the brains of amputees. A person who had lost an arm would over time apparently lose some of the neuronal mass in the part of the motor cortex that normally controls the arm. Likewise, a person who had lost a leg would show degeneration in the leg part of motor cortex. In this way the motor map could be established. In the period between 1919 and 1936 others mapped the motor cortex in detail using electrical stimulation, including the husband and wife team Vogt and Vogt,[4] and the neurosurgeon Foerster.[5]\\r\\nPerhaps the best-known experiments on the human motor map were published by Penfield in 1937.[7][8] Using a procedure that was common in the 1930s, he examined epileptic patients who were undergoing brain surgery. These patients were given a local anesthetic, their skulls were opened, and their brains exposed. Then, electrical stimulation was applied to the surface of the brain to map out the speech areas. In this way, the surgeon would be able to avoid any damage to speech circuitry. The brain focus of the epilepsy could then be surgically removed. During this procedure, Penfield mapped the effect of electrical stimulation in all parts of the cerebral cortex, including motor cortex.\\r\\nPenfield is sometimes mistakenly considered to be the discoverer of the map in motor cortex. It was discovered approximately 70 years before his work. However, Penfield drew a picture of a little man stretched over the cortical surface and used the term \\"homunculus\\" to refer to it. Perhaps for these reasons his work has become iconic in neuroscience.\\r\\nA simple view, that is almost certainly too limited and that dates back to the earliest work on the motor cortex, is that neurons in motor cortex control movement by a feed-forward direct pathway. In that view, a neuron in motor cortex sends an axon or projection to the spinal cord and forms a synapse on a motor neuron. The motor neuron sends an axon to a muscle. When the neuron in cortex becomes active, it causes a muscle contraction. The greater the activity in motor cortex, the stronger the muscle force. Each point in motor cortex controls a muscle or a small group of related muscles. This description is only partly correct.\\r\\nMost neurons in the motor cortex that project to the spinal cord synapse on interneuron circuitry in the spinal cord, not directly onto motor neurons.[45] One suggestion is that the direct, cortico-motoneuronal projections are a specialization that allows for the fine control of the fingers.[45][46]\\r\\nThe view that each point in motor cortex controls a muscle or a limited set of related muscles was debated over the entire history of research on the motor cortex, and was suggested in its strongest and most extreme form by Asanuma[47] on the basis of experiments in cats and monkeys using electrical stimulation. However, almost every other experiment to examine the map, including the classic work of Ferrier[42] and of Penfield[7] showed that each point in motor cortex influences a range of muscles and joints. The map is greatly overlapping. The overlap in the map is generally greater in the premotor cortex and supplementary motor cortex, but even the map in the primary motor cortex controls muscles in an extensively overlapped manner. Many studies have demonstrated the overlapping representation of muscles in the motor cortex.[48][49][50][51][52][53][54]\\r\\nIt is believed that as an animal learns a complex movement repertoire, the motor cortex gradually comes to coordinate among muscles.[55][56]\\r\\nThe clearest example of the coordination of muscles into complex movement in the motor cortex comes from the work of Graziano and colleagues on the monkey brain.[11][24] They used electrical stimulation on a behavioral time scale, such as for half a second instead of the more typical hundredth of a second. They found that this type of stimulation of the monkey motor cortex often evoked complex, meaningful actions. For example, stimulation of one site in cortex would cause the hand to close, move to the mouth, and the mouth to open. Stimulation of another site would cause the hand to open, rotate until the grip faced outward, and the arm to project out as if the animal were reaching. Different complex movements were evoked from different sites and these movements were mapped in the same orderly manner in all monkeys tested. Computational models[57] showed that the normal movement repertoire of a monkey, if arranged on a sheet such that similar movements are placed near each other, will result in a map that matches the actual map found in the monkey motor cortex. This work suggests that the motor cortex does not truly contain a homunculus-type map of the body. Instead, the deeper principle may be a rendering of the movement repertoire onto the cortical surface. To the extent that the movement repertoire breaks down partly into the actions of separate body parts, the map contains a rough and overlapping body arrangement noted by researchers over the past century.\\r\\nA similar organization by typical movement repertoire has been reported in the posterior parietal cortex of monkeys and galagos[58][59] and in the motor cortex of rats[60][61] and mice.[62]\\r\\nMammals evolved from mammal-like reptiles over 200 million years ago.[63] These early mammals developed several novel brain functions most likely due to the novel sensory processes that were necessary for the nocturnal niche that these mammals occupied.[64] These animals most likely had a somatomotor cortex, where somatosensory information and motor information were processed in the same cortical region. This allowed for the acquisition of only simple motor skills, such as quadrupedal locomotion and striking of predators or prey. Placental mammals evolved a discrete motor cortex about 100 mya.[63] According to the principle of proper mass, the mass of neural tissue controlling a particular function is appropriate to the amount of information processing involved in performing the function.[64] This suggests that the development of a discrete motor cortex was advantageous for placental mammals, and the motor skills that these organisms acquired were more complex than their early-mammalian ancestors. Further, this motor cortex was necessary for the arboreal lifestyles of our primate ancestors.\\r\\nEnhancements to the motor cortex (and the presence of opposable thumbs and stereoscopic vision) were evolutionarily selected to prevent primates from making mistakes in the dangerous motor skill of leaping between tree branches (Cartmill, 1974; Silcox, 2007). As a result of this pressure, the motor system of arboreal primates has a disproportionate degree of somatotopic representation of the hands and feet, which is essential for grasping (Nambu, 2011; Pons et al., 1985; Gentilucci et al., 1988).","input":"What is the primary function of the cortex?"},{"output":"snifter","context":"A snifter (also called brandy snifter, brandy bowl, cognac glass, or balloon) is a type of stemware, a short-stemmed glass whose vessel has a wide bottom and a relatively narrow top.

It is the fifth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series and the sequel to On Stranger Tides (2011). The film is directed by Joachim R?nning and Espen Sandberg from a script by Jeff Nathanson, with Jerry Bruckheimer serving again as producer. Johnny Depp, Kevin McNally and Geoffrey Rush reprise their roles as Jack Sparrow, Joshamee Gibbs and Hector Barbossa, respectively, while Javier Bardem, Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario join the cast as Armando Salazar, Henry Turner and Carina Smyth. The film also features the returns of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, following their absence from the previous film.\\r\\nThe filmmakers cited the series' first installment, The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), as inspiration for the script and tone of the film.[11][12] Pre-production for the film started shortly before On Stranger Tides was released in early 2011, with Terry Rossio writing a script for the film. In early 2013, Jeff Nathanson was hired to write a new script, with Depp being involved in Nathanson's writing process. Initially planned for a 2015 release, the film was delayed to 2016 and then to 2017, due to script and budget issues, before being released in May 26, 2017, after 6 years of Development Hell. Principal photography started in Australia in February 2015, after the Australian government offered Disney $20 million in tax incentives, and ended in July 2015.\\r\\nDead Men Tell No Tales was released in conventional, Disney Digital 3-D, RealD 3D and IMAX 3D formats on May 26, 2017, ten years and one day after the release of At World's End (2007). The film received mixed reviews, with praise for the performances, especially that of Bardem, visuals, music and shorter running time, and criticism for the convoluted and complicated plot; some critics considered the film an improvement over the recent sequel.[13][14] The film grossed $794 million worldwide, the second-lowest gross of the series but the ninth highest-grossing film of 2017.[15][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry Turner, the twelve-year-old son of Will Turner, boards his cursed fathers ship, the Flying Dutchman, informing his father that the mythical Trident of Poseidon can break his curse, and of his intent to recruit Captain Jack Sparrow for help. Will, however, believes that the trident can't be found and orders Henry to leave. Will and the Dutchman then disappear back into the sea, but Henry still vows to find Jack Sparrow and the Trident.\\r\\nNine years later, Henry is a sailor in the British Royal Navy, but is locked up for attempting mutiny when his ship sails for the supernatural Devils Triangle. The ship comes across a shipwreck, the Silent Mary, and are attacked by its ghostly crew led by Captain Salazar. Salazar and his crew kill everyone aboard except Henry. Salazar, seeing a wanted poster of Jack, allows Henry to live so he can deliver a message to Jack that he is coming for him.\\r\\nIn Saint Martin, a young astronomer and horologist named Carina Smyth is sentenced to death for alleged witchcraft but escapes custody. She briefly crosses paths with Jack, who with his crew tries to steal a bank vault, but accidentally drags the entire bank with them and loses the fortune before crashing the building at the town's exit and escaping. Jacks crew ends up abandoning him, even Gibbs, who has lost faith in Jack after years of Jack and his crew experiencing nothing but bad luck. Depressed, Jack trades his magical compass for a drink. However, this betrayal of the compass frees Salazar and his crew from the Devils Triangle. Carina learns Henry is looking for the Tridents location and offers to help him using a diary left by her unknown father. Carina and Jack are both captured and face execution, but are saved by Henry and Jacks crew, setting sail on the Dying Gull. Carina deciphers that the stars will lead to an island where the Trident is hidden.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Captain Barbossa hears from his pirate crew that the revived Captain Salazar is killing several pirates at sea, and learns from a sea witch named Shansa of the Trident, which could possibly lead him to a new \\"treasure\\". Barbossa and his crew set off to find the Trident themselves, until Salazar and his crew appear and destroy Barbossas fleet, but Barbossa manages to talk his way out of being killed by offering to help him find Jack, to which Salazar agrees. He tells Barbossa that long ago he worked for the Spanish Navy hunting down pirates. However, a young Jack tricked him into sailing into the Devils Triangle, cursing his crew. Salazar pursues the Dying Gull, forcing Jack, Henry, and Carina to flee to an island while fighting off Salazar's cursed sharks, discovering that Salazars crew cannot go on land. After saving Jack from a forced marriage, Barbossa allies himself with Jack and provides him his compass, obtained from Shansa. He uses the Sword of Triton to restore the miniaturized Black Pearl, trapped in a bottle by Blackbeard, to its original size. They all continue their journey to the Trident's island, with Barbossa taking command of the Pearl once more. During the voyage, Jack and Barbossa realize Carina is the latters long-lost daughter. Barbossa tells Jack that he had left her at an orphanage with his diary so she could live a better life.\\r\\nApproaching the Tridents island, the Pearl evades a British Navy warship, which is destroyed by the Silent Mary before the Pearl runs aground on the island. Jack, Barbossa, and Carina use the island's magic to open a path to the Tridents spot on the ocean floor, parting the ocean. Salazar captures Henry and possesses his body, chasing Jack and the others across the ocean floor and seizes the Trident, freeing Henry. Henry shatters the Trident, breaking all curses upon the sea and restoring Salazars crew to life. However, the divided sea begins to collapse in on itself. The Pearl drops its anchor to lift them to safety, but Salazar pursues them, still hell-bent on killing Jack. Carina realizes that Barbossa is her father when she spots a tattoo on his arm identical to the diarys cover. Barbossa sacrifices himself to kill Salazar, allowing the others to escape alive.\\r\\nSome time later, Henry and Carina reach Port Royal, where Will appears, free from the Dutchman. His wife, Elizabeth, appears moments later and the Turner family reunites. Jack watches from the Pearl in disgust before sailing away into the horizon.\\r\\nIn a post-credits scene, Will and Elizabeth are asleep when their bedroom is entered by the shadow of an apparently resurrected Davy Jones. Will wakes up and assumes it was a nightmare, but a small puddle filled with barnacles under the bed implies otherwise.\\r\\nAdditionally, Keira Knightley briefly appears at the end and reprises her role in the film series as Elizabeth Swann,[34] Will Turner's wife, and Henry's mother. Adam Brown, Danny Kirrane, and Delroy Atkinson appear as members of Jack's crew. In the prison scene, Paul McCartney appears briefly as Jack's paternal uncle, Uncle Jack.[35][32][35][35][36][37] Alexander Scheer plays a young Captain Edward Teague in a flashback sequence, while Keith Richards' likeness (as Jack's father) was also used.[38] A silhouette of Davy Jones, one of the series' former villains, was seen in the post-credits scene, but actor Bill Nighy wasn't credited for this appearance. Pablo and Chiquita reprised their role as Jack the Monkey.\\r\\nShortly before the release of On Stranger Tides in 2011, the cast and crew of the fourth film were told to set aside time in the near future, as Walt Disney Pictures intended to shoot a fifth and sixth film back-to-back (like the first two sequels).[39] However, it was later stated that only a fifth film was in the works. On January 11, 2013, Jeff Nathanson signed on to write the script for the film.[40] Rob Marshall, the director of the last film, was believed for return to direct,[41] but he declined after he chose to direct Into the Woods[42] (2014) and The Thin Man[43] (both projects for Disney and starring Johnny Depp). After Marshall passed on the project, many directors were rumored to direct the film, like Tim Burton, Sam Raimi, Shawn Levy, Chris Weitz, Alfonso Cuar܇n and Gore Verbinski (who directed the first three films).[44] On May 9, 2013, it was reported that Fredrik Bond, Rupert Sanders, and the Norwegian film duo Joachim R?nning and Espen Sandberg were considered to direct the fifth film.[45] Finally, on May 29, 2013, R?nning and Sandberg were selected to direct.[46] This decision was based both on their Academy Award-nominated high sea film Kon-Tiki, as well as their ability to work with a limited budget.[47] Geoffrey Rush argued that the pair brought \\"a kind of Euro sensibility to traditional Hollywood franchise thinking\\".[48] While Orlando Bloom believed that they'd \\"recaptured the simplicity and charm\\", calling the film \\"fantastic, really entertaining\\".[49] On August 22, 2013, R?nning and Sandberg revealed that the title of the fifth film would be Dead Men Tell No Tales.[50] They also confirmed that they were working on the film, speaking highly of Jeff Nathanson's \\"funny and touching\\" script and that they are inspired by the first film, The Curse of the Black Pearl,[11] stating that the original is \\"scary, it's funny, and most of all it's a comedy, but with great heart, and that structure and the dynamics between the characters was something I really wanted to try and reinvent\\". On the pair's decision to direct the film, R?nning believed that \\"it was all there in this script already, and for me, it was just a matter of adding scenes that carry the tradition of Gore Verbinski, bring the emotional core and big action set pieces\\", with Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton also being in the director's mind when crafting the tone of the film.[18] The pair also wanted to include two things new to the series: \\"it needs to have heart; I really believe this to be the most emotional Pirates yet\\", argued R?nning, as well as exploring the roots of Jack Sparrow.[51] Kaya Scodelario felt that the film \\"will have much more of the feel of the first film, the producers want to take it back to the beginning again. They wanted it to have this epic journey, and for it to make sense, and for it to tie things up, and also lead to new storylines.\\"[12]\\r\\nHowever, after Disney's The Lone Ranger lost the studio $190 million in 2013a film also starring Depp in a similarly eccentric roleDisney questioned the bankability of Depp and thus the franchise, so the film was reconsidered and not actually green-lit as of early 2014.[52] Another problem, along with the lack of success Depp experienced outside of the Pirates franchise were script problems, as Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn stated: \\"We haven't seen a screenplay yet that I've been able to sign off on. There are a lot of variables that affect the final outcome once it leaves the studio lot, so we are very careful.\\"[53] Due to these problems, the film's production was delayed, and it moved from a 2015 release aspired by Disney in 2013[40] to a likely release in 2016.[54] Producer Jerry Bruckheimer revealed that script as well as budget issues were behind the delay, and that Jeff Nathanson was at work on a second attempt based on a well-received outline, stating: \\"It's all a factor. We want a script that everyone's signed off on and a budget that everyone's signed off on.\\"[47] After the script was accepted and the film was finally officially green-lit by Disney in July 2014, the release date moved to July 7, 2017.[55]\\r\\nMany of the crew members for the film were new to the franchise, replacing members that had served on the previous four films. Apart from directors R?nning and Sandberg and writer Nathanson, a new director of photography, Paul Cameron replaced Dariusz Wolski, production designer Nigel Phelps, visual effects supervisor Gary Brozenich, special effects supervisor Dan Oliver, supervising stunt coordinator R. A. Rondell, stunt coordinators Thomas Robinson Harper and Kyle Gardiner, makeup and hair designer Peter Swords King, executive producers Joe Caracciolo Jr. and Brigham Taylor replacing Mike Stenson, film editors Joel Cox, Gary D. Roach and Roger Barton and composer Geoff Zanelli taking over from composer of the primary themes for the series, Hans Zimmer. Costume designer Penny Rose returned after providing the costumes for all four previous films, along with executive producer Chad Oman.[1][56][57]\\r\\nSpeaking to IGN while promoting The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, Orlando Bloom indicated that the film might serve as a soft reboot for the franchise, saying: \\"Basically, they want to reboot the whole franchise, I think, and do something with me and the relationship with my son.\\"[33]\\r\\nBy 2011, shortly before the release of On Stranger Tides, Terry Rossio was writing a script for a fifth film without his partner Ted Elliott.[58] Rossio's draft was ultimately rejected. \\"My version of Dead Men Tell No Tales was set aside because it featured a female villain,\\" recalled Rossio, \\"and Johnny Depp was worried that would be redundant to Dark Shadows, which also featured a female villain.\\"[59] In January 2013, Disney hired Jeff Nathanson to work on a script.[40] That September, producer Bruckheimer said, \\"We have an outline everyone loves but the script is not done,\\" explaining that the release would be postponed beyond summer 2015.[47]\\r\\nOn April 13, 2014, Depp said Bruckheimer and Disney had invited him in to collaborate with the writer Jeff Nathanson, noting:\\r\\nEveryone involved wants the script to be right and perfect. So we have gone on to do other things [in the meantime]. We are still going to do the film together. I enjoy them immensely. They are super talented. They have a great sense of humor. I think they have a really fun approach to what we are going to do with the next Pirates. Very happily and proudly, I have welcomed taking part in the story and working directly with the screenwriter [Jeff Nathanson]he and I. It's working out really well that way. So I have high hopes for Pirates 5 because if that's really the last one, which it probably is, I feel that we owe it to the audience who went and saw the films so many times. We'll do it right and end it on a high note.[60]\\r\\nSpeaking at the On Stranger Tides press launch in Cannes, Depp said he would play the role for as long as it is popular with the public.[61] In August 2012 news surfaced that Johnny Depp signed on officially for the fifth film, earning A$90 million to reprise his role.[16] As with the fourth film, Depp was also involved in scripting and planning Dead Men Tell No Tales.[60] Geoffrey Rush had commented on returning as Hector Barbossa in the fifth installment, saying \\"If they keep shapeshifting this character, absolutely\\" as well as implying he may return as the villain.[62] He also said that Barbossa's megalomania \\"could explode in horrific ways\\".[63] In December 2014, Rush confirmed his return for the fifth installment, where Barbossa and Jack were \\"at the heart of it and there's a whole new set of story lines\\".[24] In late 2011, about four years after choosing not to return for the fourth installment, Orlando Bloom stated that he would like to return for the fifth film if he was offered.[64] On May 11, 2011, Naomie Harris expressed her desire to return as Tia Dalma if they called her.[65] Several weeks after Disney officially green-lit the film, Bloom stated that there were \\"discussions\\" about his return to the franchise in September 2014.[66] Bloom further commented in December 2014, that while he was not sure whether he would return, there were talks. He also indicated that Disney could do a soft reboot with the franchise and focus on Will Turner and his son.[33] After months of speculation and after filming wrapped up, Bloom's participation was confirmed at Disney D23 on August 15, 2015.[67]\\r\\nOn December 2, 2013, it was reported that Christoph Waltz was in talks to appear as the film's main antagonist,[68] but he finally declined. Australian actor Brenton Thwaites entered talks for the role of Henry in late November 2014,[69] after Disney chose him over Taron Egerton, George MacKay, Mitchell Hope, Ansel Elgort and Sam Keeley.[70] In mid-January 2015, he stated that he was to travel to Australia for the film in February, disclosing that his role was indeed that of Will Turner's son, struggling to break a curse to meet his father.[27] The shortlist of actresses for the female lead consisted of Gabriella Wilde, Kaya Scodelario, Alexandra Dowling, Jenna Thiam and Lucy Boynton. On January 24, Jerry Bruckheimer announced via Twitter that Scodelario had won the role.[71] In July, her character was revealed to be called Carina.[72] In earlier drafts of the script the name Carina Smyth appeared as Barbossa's daughter and was a love interest of Sparrow's and was an astronomer accused of being a witch.[73] Scodelario confirmed that the character was an astronomer and that \\"she's a totally different character\\" to Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann, and also confirmed that Smyth will be Henry's love interest instead of Jack's.[30][74] By October 2014, Javier Bardem, husband of Penlope Cruz (who portrayed Angelica in the fourth installment), was in early talks to appear as the antagonist of the film.[75] His role was eventually confirmed to be that of Armando Salazar, who in early scripts was referred as Captain John Brand.[1] However, during an interview with Collider in 2012, Penlope Cruz stated that she would most likely not reprise her role as Angelica Teach.[76] Kevin McNally confirmed his return as Joshamee Gibbs via Twitter in late January.[77] Shortly after on location pre-production opened in Australia, Disney issued a casting call to local agents for actors from all age- and experience levels to apply for roles and as extras in the upcoming film, with casting also open in the US.[78] Adam Brown, Delroy Atkinson, Danny Kirrane were revealed as cast members shortly before filming.[35] Martin Klebba confirmed his return as Marty via Twitter days before filming began.[79] On February 17, 2015, Stephen Graham revealed that he will reprise his role as Scrum.[80] On September 24, 2015, a YouTube video was uploaded stating that Giles New and Angus Barnett would reprise their roles as Murtogg and Mullroy.[81] Director Joachim R?nning's two children appear in the film as extras.[82] Also, Keith Richards expressed interest in reprising his role as Captain Teague.[83] Additionally, Greg Ellis expressed interest in reprising his role as Theodore Groves, despite his character's apparent death in the previous film, saying the possibility that Groves survived.[84] Apart from this declaration, reports that a deceased Navy officer will star in the film, had sparked many rumors regarding the possibility of the return of James Norrington (portrayed again by Jack Davenport), who died in the third film.[85]\\r\\nBoth Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook commented on the possibility of returning as Pintel and Ragetti. Arenberg confirmed in several interviews that, despite wanting to return to the fourth film,[86] he hoped to reprise his role as Pintel.[87] In an interview on November 7, 2014, Crook confirmed that he had received a call of availability from Disney for the film, although stated that he was uncertain about whether he wanted to reprise his role.[88] Crook declined to reprise his role ultimately, in order to focus on his television series Detectorists.[89] He said he felt \\"pangs of nostalgia\\" when the cast and crew filmed the film without him.[90] Furthermore, shortly before filming started, Arenberg announced on Twitter that he would not reprise his role as well, despite having been interested in doing so.[91] In early 2017, there were rumors that Keira Knightley was back to the franchise for a cameo scene despite Knightley saying in 2011 that she wasn't coming back to any future films. On April 18, 2017, the international trailer was released, confirming Knightley's participation.[92]\\r\\nOn January 15, 2014, directors Joachim R?nning and Espen Sandberg confirmed that shooting would take place in Puerto Rico and New Orleans[93] and Bruckheimer had previously mentioned that there might be a sequence in Louisiana.[94] However, a spokesman for the Australian Arts Minister George Brandis confirmed that the fifth installment was set to shoot exclusively in Australia after the government agreed to repurpose $20 million of tax incentives originally intended for the remake of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, thus edging out Mexico and South Africa as filming locations.[95] According to Australian film industry sources, on location pre-production started in late September 2014 and its cost is around $250 million.[96] This was officially confirmed by Disney and the Queensland Arts Minister on October 2, 2014, stating that filming will take place exclusively in Queensland, Australia, being the largest production to ever shoot in the country. Village Roadshow Studios and Whitsundays were officially confirmed as filming locations.[97] On January 1, 2015, The Rainbow Gypsy, a 15-year-old replica of an 1897 Scottish bawley, sailed into the Gold Coast to start the extensive refit, which will include a new bowsprit and reconfigured decks and cabins in order to become the Dying Gull, a single-masted ghost ship. Its captain and owner Kit Woodward was a rigger on the film.[98]\\r\\nFilming commenced on February 17, 2015.[1] Ship scenes were filmed in front of a giant outdoor greenscreen in Helensvale,[99] while a film set in the form of a village was built in Maudsland.[100] Given the greenscreens were so tall they blocked sunlight, containers with inflatable bluescreens mounted on top were added to the set to allow for light to creep in.[101] While an initial draft of the script featured six ships, the end product had 11 vessels, meaning that to cut costs, most of them were not full sets, but partial constructs later enhanced by computer graphics, at times built atop an hydraulic rig to mimic the movement of seafaring while still on land. The camera crew also made extensive use of drones to capture immersive views on sea without resorting to aerial footage or cranes.[20][102]\\r\\nFilming moved to Doug Jennings Park on The Spit from March 30 to June 15, 2015 for water bound scenes.[103] However, due to extreme sea sickness among the cast and crew due to \\"big swells\\" at The Spit, filming moved to Raby Bay for calmer waters.[104][105] Scenes were shot at Byron Bay on June 1. Locals made up more than 75 percent of the 850-plus crew then working on the film.[106] After much speculation about whether Orlando Bloom would return, Bloom arrived at the Gold Coast in late May to reprise his role as Will Turner.[107][108] Scenes featuring a skeleton of a sperm whale that had been constructed were shot at Hastings Point from June 21 to 23.[109]\\r\\nA number of issues and controversies set back the film during its production. The biosecurity laws in Australia posed problems regarding the capuchin monkeys that portray Hector Barbossa's pet monkey Jack, as the animals are regarded as a category 1 pest and require strict requirements and a 30-day quarantine.[110] Further controversy surrounding the use of the monkeys erupted from animal rights activist groups, who urged the Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt to reject the application to fly two capuchin monkeys from California to Australia, arguing that the trip would \\"harm the monkeys' health, that movie performances are unnatural for wild creatures and that the appearance of monkeys in films encourages the illegal wildlife trade\\".[111] One of the monkeys caused further disruption when it wandered off set at Movie World and bit a make up artist on another production on the ear.[112] Crew and cast members were forced to cover the camera lenses on all mobile phones with duct tape to prevent the film from being pirated before its release. To prevent fans from interfering with the production, secret filming locations used the production name of \\"Herschel\\" to hide the fact it was the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean film.[113] Following the attempt of an armed man trying to bypass security, the already tight security was increased.[114]\\r\\nOn March 10, 2015, Depp was injured off set and had to be flown back to the United States for surgery.[115] Due to his absence, filming stalled completely and 200 crew members were forced to stand down for two weeks as they had done all they had been able to without Depp.[116] Filming was set to resume \\"on or about April 20\\"[117] and Depp returned to set on April 21.[118] In June, Kaya Scodelario was injured on set along with a stuntman.[119]\\r\\nMost of the cast and crew had finished on the July 8, 2015, and a wrap party was held on July 11.[120] Filming then moved to the Whitsundays for the final shots to be filmed.[72][121] On July 21, 2015, Joachim R?nning announced via Instagram that filming has wrapped after a 95-day shoot.[122] After nearly a year in post production, reshoots and additional photography was conducted in Vancouver, Canada from March 24 to April 13, 2016 under the production title \\"Herschel Additional Photography\\".[123]\\r\\nThe entire film was filmed in IMAX for an expanded 1.9:1 aspect ratio, giving IMAX screenings of the film 26% more picture on the screen.[124]\\r\\nFor the first time in the series since Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (which he co-wrote with Klaus Badelt), Hans Zimmer is not composing the music for the film. Instead, one of his protgs, Geoff Zanelli, who worked on all previous four installments in the franchise, is the main composer for the film.[125] Zanelli said of taking over from Zimmer as composer for the series, \\"What Hans did for the Pirates movies redefined the sound of the entire genre, it has been very fulfilling to work alongside him and [producer] Jerry [Bruckheimer] on the past four films. Dead Men Tell No Tales enlarges the Pirates universe with many new, unique elements, and I'm building a distinctive sound for this film that springboards off of many years of collaborating in the Pirates world.\\"[57] The film's soundtrack was released on May 26, 2017.[126]\\r\\nWork on the film concluded on April 19, 2017.[127] Eight companies handled the film's 2,000 visual effects shots, with 150 of them consisting only of computer graphics. The primary vendor was Moving Picture Company, from which hails the film's overall effects supervisor Gary Brozenich.[101] Among MPC's work was Salazar's pirates, whose on-set footage filmed against a blue screen was mostly replaced by CGI given all have missing parts of their body as well as floating hair and clothing, with Brozenich stating that was kept of the original actors was \\"their run, gait and faces.\\" To provide reference for the floating parts, that was meant to resemble a perpetual drowning state, a stuntman in full costume and wig dove into a swimming pool, and was filmed underwater by both a GoPro and a Canon 5D doing various actions.[20] Atomic Fiction handled the scenes of St. Martin, turning the few blocks of buildings built on set onto more than 600 CG buildings surrounded by a jungle environment environment combining references from both the Caribbean and Thailand, and enhancing through CGI both the guillotine on which Jack Sparrow is nearly executed and the bank from the heist scene, that was meant to look as if it was dragging through the ground instead of driving on top of it.[128] Along with sea footage filmed in both the Australian sets and Key West, Florida, there was extensive usage of water simulations, with the artists basing on the Beaufort scale to ensure the sea and wind was realistic.[101]\\r\\nDead Men Tell No Tales had its world premiere at the Shanghai Disney Resort on May 11, 2017.[2] In several countries, the film was released as Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge, including English-speaking countries.[129] It was released at cinemas in Italy[130] and Norway[131] on May 24. The film was released in the United States, Canada, and China on May 26.[132] It is the first Hollywood feature to be released in the United States for the new panorama-like ScreenX format; it played in two locations in the U.S.CGV Buena Park and CGV Cinemasboth in Los Angeles, California. Additionally, it played in 81 screens at select theaters in Korea, China, Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey and Indonesia. The film also played in 4D on 373 4DX screens worldwide.[133] It is Disney's third wide release of the year following Beauty and the Beast and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.[134]\\r\\nA robust marketing effort helped promote Dead Men Tell No Tales.[135] The film was first showcased at the Disney D23 Expo 2015 where Depp appeared in costume as Jack Sparrow and the film's logo was revealed with Orlando Bloom confirmed to be starring in the film.[136][137] Elizabeth Rudnick has been self-confirmed to novelize the film, as well as describing the film as bringing back \\"sensibility\\" plus bringing back Jack Sparrow in \\"all of his swaggering glory\\".[138] Another book is set to be released by Disney, a tie-in prequel expanding the backstory of the character of Carina Smyth, titled Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales ÿ The Brightest Star in the North.[139] The film was also showcased at the Walt Disney Content Showcase in Africa in 2016 where concept art, story details and on set images were previewed.[140] The first teaser trailer was released on October 2, 2016, during Fear the Walking Dead and showcased Armando Salazar hunting for Jack Sparrow who doesn't appear in the trailer except only his image on a wanted poster.[141] On January 27, 2017, Disney uploaded an eight-second motion poster to their official Instagram account for the release of a TV spot of the film during Super Bowl LI.[142] Disney then released a 30-second television teaser at Super Bowl LI, with an extended version released online set to Johnny Cash's \\"Ain't No Grave\\". The trailer was considered to be the \\"big\\" trailer of the event and was the most viewed trailer of all the films advertised at the halftime show. A new teaser poster was also released with the trailer. Both teasers received a highly positive reaction from audiences.[143][144] The official trailer was released on March 2, 2017. Another trailer was released on March 25, 2017.[145] The first 30-second TV spot was released on March 31, 2017. On April 21, at Disney Parks and on the four Disney cruise ships, Disney previewed a sneak peek of the film.[146] With the release of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 on April 28, 2017 in the UK, Disney premiered a 5-minute extended sequence of the film in front of the Marvel film.[147][148]\\r\\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on September 19, 2017, and on Blu-ray, Ultra HD Blu-ray and DVD on October 3, 2017.[149] In its first week to sale were the top home media release. The Blu-ray version accounted for 78% of the sales. Meanwhile, the home video release of the new \\"Pirates\\" sequel helped bring previous films in the franchise back into the Blu-ray top 25, with 2011's On Stranger Tides at No. 12, 2007's At World's End at No. 19, and 2006's Dead Man's Chest at No. 20. The original film, 2003's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, landed at No. 23.[150]\\r\\nIn May 2017, the film was allegedly stolen by a group of piracy hackers, who demanded a large sum of money from Disney in order for them not to distribute the unreleased film. The company refused to do so and worked with the FBI in order to get the identity of the group.[151] Also, Disney CEO Bob Iger reported that hackers did not steal their movie.[152]\\r\\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales grossed $172.6 million in the United States and Canada and $622.2 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $794.8 million, against a production budget of $230 million.[4]\\r\\nThe film had a worldwide opening of $271.4 million from 55 markets, with $24 million coming from 1,088 IMAX screens.[153] The film's six-day opening gross pushed the franchise gross past the $4 billion mark.[154] Despite being the lowest-grossing film of the series in the US by nearly $70 million, the film became the highest-grossing entry of the Pirates franchise internationally when going by modern foreign-exchange rates, passing On Stranger Tides, which grossed $593.4 million at current rates.[155] Despite weak US totals, Deadline.com noted the film should turn a net profit of around $280 million after factoring together all expenses and revenues.[156]\\r\\nIn April 2017, early projections had the film grossing $115 million over its four-day Memorial Day opening weekend.[157] In early May, projections were adjusted to $90ÿ100 million, which was again lowered down to $80ÿ85 million, with a chance of hitting $100 million, by the week of its release.[158] It was released in 4,276 theaters, of which over 3,100 were 3D, including 400 IMAX locations, over 500 Premium Large Format locations, 170 D-Box locations, 10 4D auditoriums and three venues featuring the ScreenX three-screen format.[159] It opened Friday, May 26, 2017, and earned $23.4 million on its opening day, including $5.5 million it made from Thursday night previews. Its opening day was the lowest of the franchise.[160] In total, it grossed $63 million over three days, and $78.5 million over four (FridayÿMonday), finishing first at the box office ahead of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and fellow newcomer Baywatch.[161][162] On a three-day basis, the film did 31% less than On Stranger Tides did over its first three days in 2011, after adjusting for inflation, and on a four-day basis, it was down 34% from At World's End and overall is the second-smallest debut of the franchise after the first film.[163] Despite the film registering the highest test score in the series' history,[164] the opening came in well below initial expectations, which was attributed to various reasons, such as Johnny Depp's diminishing returns and his depreciating public image amid his personal problems, the wave of negative reviews from critics (mainly on Rotten Tomatoes), franchise fatigue and the problem of Memorial Day weekend failing to attract considerable moviegoers in the past years. However, although the film's opening was below predictions, it wasn't considered a fatal failure and was better than Disney had for its last few Memorial Day releases (Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, Tomorrowland and Alice Through the Looking Glass).[165][166][5] Studio executives said they were pleased with the movie's opening, both in the US and abroad.[154] Its opening further helped Disney push past $1 billion in the US to record the second-fastest time a studio has reached the mark in the US, second only to Disney's own record from 2016 when the studio surpassed $1 billion in early May.[167]\\r\\nAfter dropping by 73% on its second Friday, the worst Friday-to-Friday drop in the series, the film fell by a total of 65% in its second weekend, also the worst of the series, grossing $22.1 million.[168] As a result, it finished in third place, after newcomers Wonder Woman ($103.3 million) and Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie ($23.9 million).[169] It made $10.7 million in its third weekend, $9 million in its fourth and $5.2 million in its fifth, respectively, finishing 4th, 6th and 7th at the box office.[170][171]\\r\\nInternationally, where it is marketed as Salazar's Revenge in many countries, the film was released day-and-date with its North American debut in 54 markets (91% of its total marketplace, except Japan, where it debuted on July 1).[172] Preliminary reports had the film opening to $150ÿ175 million, but possibly overperforming depending on major markets, most notably China.[159][173] While its Chinese run benefited from the Dragon Boat Festivala lucrative moviegoing periodfrom May 28ÿ30 as well as from International Children's Day (June 1),[174][175] the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing had a deteriorating effect on certain European markets, and eased moviegoing admissions across the continent over the film's opening weekend.[176] From Wednesday to Friday, it registered an opening of $208.8 million. Around $14 million of that came from IMAX screenings, the second-biggest international IMAX opening in May only after Captain America: Civil War.[153] Similar to its US plunge, it earned $73.8 million in its second weekend, thus, falling in second place behind Wonder Woman.[177]\\r\\nIt recorded the biggest opening day of the year in several markets including Germany ($3.6 million), Austria, France ($2.3 million), Finland, Sweden, Belgium, Thailand ($400,000), Indonesia, Malaysia and the Netherlands ($900,000, also the second-biggest Disney bow, behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens), while Russia opened with $4 million, the fifth-biggest ever.[176][178] In terms of opening, Russia posted the biggest opening of all time with $18.4 million ($18.6 million including previews) while South Korea ($11.5 million), France ($9.1 million), Germany ($8.3 million), Mexico ($6.9 million), the UK ($6.1 million), Brazil ($5.6 million), Italy ($5.5 million), Australia ($4.4 million), Spain ($4.4 million), Indonesia ($4 million), Taiwan ($3.6 million), India ($3 million) and Argentina ($3 million) recorded the top openings.[153][167][179][180]\\r\\nIn China, where the film had its global premiere, it earned $21.3 million on its opening day, the fourth-biggest Disney opening day in the country. It had an 87% marketshare and had already surpassed the entire earnings of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.[181] Earning a total of $67.9 million, it registered the third-highest three-day for any Disney title, only behind Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Age of Ultron and a much higher opening than the U.S.[153] The film did extremely well in IMAX, earning $9 million from 401 screens from Friday to early Monday bookings. The robust opening has been attributed to the Dragon Boat Festival, as well as Depp's star power, the ubiquity of the franchise, the impact of the Shanghai Disneyland Park, which opened last year and good word of mouthit has a score of 7.5/10 on reviews aggregator Douban, and 8.7/10 on top mobile ticketing platform Weying.[182][183]\\r\\nThe final market for the film to be released in was Japan (July 1), where it opened at Number 1, achieving the highest-grossing opening for a Western film of the year, earning $9.25 million over the July 1ÿ2 weekend.[184] It remained at the number 1 spot at the box office for three weeks.[185]\\r\\nThe biggest earning markets so far are China ($172.3 million), followed by Japan ($59.5 million), Russia and the CIS ($40.7 million), where is the second-highest-grossing film ever, behind only Avatar, Germany ($31 million), France ($28.7 million) and U.K. ($25.1 million).[186] The film is the highest-grossing of the series internationally by modern-foreign exchange rates.[187]\\r\\nDead Men Tell No Tales received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 30% based on 234 reviews, with an average rating of 4.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales proves that neither a change in directors nor an undead Javier Bardem is enough to drain this sinking franchise's murky bilge.\\"[188] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\".[189] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"Aÿ\\" on an A+ to F scale.[190]\\r\\nMike Ryan of Uproxx criticized the convoluted plot and overabundance of characters, writing: \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man Tell No Tales is practically incoherent. Ive been trying to wrap my head around the 'plot,' but it's been futile. I've asked literally eight other people who saw this movie to answer a couple specific questions and no one has been able to do it.\\"[191] Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers called the film \\"bloated, boring, repetitive and draining\\" and gave it one star out of four, saying, \\"Abandon ship, audiences. Paying cash money to see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is the equivalent of walking the plank.\\"[192] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club wrote that the film returns \\"to the basic formula of the first three Pirates films directed by Gore Verbinski, in which Johnny Depps louche and campy Jack Sparrow played second banana to an insipid love storythe two romantic leads [] succeed only in making the shortest movie in the series seem just as long as the rest.\\"[193] A. O. Scott of The New York Times said of the film, \\"Its pleasures are so meager, its delight in its own inventions so forced and false, that it becomes almost the perfect opposite of entertainment.\\"[194] Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post remarked that the film was \\"loud, overstimulating and hard to take in all in one sitting\\", comparing it to a \\"vacation that youll need a vacation from.\\"[195] Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle found the film to be \\"a jumble of half-baked impulses\\", with the film's directors \\"trying to pump air and passion into a stinking corpse of a franchise.\\"[196]\\r\\nRichard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying: \\"Dead Men works well enough as a stand-alone, swashbuckling comedic spectacle, thanks to the terrific performances, some ingenious practical effects, impressive CGI and a steady diet of PG-13 dialogue peppered with not particularly sophisticated but (I have to admit) fairly funny sexual innuendo.\\"[197] Pete Hammond of Deadline.com praised the film, calling it \\"the most entertaining installment,\\" giving credit to Directors R?nning and Sandberg for creating a \\"rollicking good time\\". He praised the visual effects, particularly Salazar and his crew, arguing that it should be in line to receive an Academy Award for Visual Effects. He also gave high praise to Bardem for being able to create such a \\"fully dimensional villain\\" under the layers of make-up and CGI, as well as Depp for keeping the film and franchise going.[198] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'B', praising the fun nature of the film as well as its visuals, calling it \\"gorgeously detailed swashbuckling nonsense,\\" but wished that the script had taken more risks instead of following the formula used in previous films.[199] Ashley Esqueda of CNET gave the film a positive review, arguing it brought the franchise back to what made its first two installments so fun, and praised Depp's performance as \\"delightful as ever.\\"[200] Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying \\"What was once a past-its-prime franchise seems to have found new life.\\"[201] Mark Hughes of Forbes opined \\"Dead Men Tell No Tales isn't as good as the first three films, but it's better than the fourth film\\", adding \\"it has mostly good performances, and a couple of great ones. It has fantastic visual effects, lots of humor that works, a lighthearted feel and sense of fun, and many terrific action set pieces to make your eyeballs pop out.\\"[202]\\r\\nThe film was nominated for six Teen Choice Awards:\\r\\nShortly before the release of On Stranger Tides, it was reported that Disney was planning to shoot the fifth and the sixth films back-to-back,[204] although it was later revealed that only the fifth film was in development. On March 4, 2017, director Joachim R?nning stated that Dead Men was only the beginning of the final adventure, implying that it would not be the last film of the franchise and that a sixth film could be realized.[205] The post-credit scene of Dead Men shows Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, and Davy Jones, implying that Will and Elizabeth will be main characters again and Davy Jones would be the main antagonist in a sixth film.[206] In September 2017, producer Jerry Bruckheimer indicated that another Pirates sequel is still possible if Dead Men Tell No Tales does well in its home release.[207] In October 2017, Kaya Scodelario said that she was contracted to return for a sixth film.[208] Shortly after, it was announced that R?nning is being eyed to direct the film.[209]","input":"What's the new pirates of the caribbean called?"},{"output":"most of the Jews of German-occupied Europe would be deported to occupied Poland and murdered","context":"The Wannsee Conference (German: Wannseekonferenz) was a meeting of senior government officials of Nazi Germany and Schutzstaffel (SS) leaders, held in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee on 20 January 1942. The purpose of the conference, called by the director of the Reich Main Security Office SS-Obergruppenfhrer Reinhard Heydrich, was to ensure the cooperation of administrative leaders of various government departments in the implementation of the so-called Final solution to the Jewish question (German: Endl?sung der Judenfrage), whereby most of the Jews of German-occupied Europe would be deported to occupied Poland and murdered. Conference attendees included representatives from several government ministries, including state secretaries from the Foreign Office, the justice, interior, and state ministries, and representatives from the SS. In the course of the meeting, Heydrich outlined how European Jews would be rounded up and sent to extermination camps in the General Government (the occupied part of Poland), where they would be killed.[1]\\r\\nSoon after the invasion of Poland in September 1939, the persecution of European Jews was raised to unprecedented levels, but systematic killing of men, women and children only began in June 1941 after the onset of Operation Barbarossa against the Soviets. On 31 July 1941 Hermann G?ring gave written authorization to Heydrich to prepare and submit a plan for a \\"total solution of the Jewish question\\" in territories under German control and to coordinate the participation of all involved government organisations. At Wannsee, Heydrich emphasized that once the mass deportation was complete, the SS would take complete charge of the exterminations. A secondary goal was to arrive at a definition of who was formally Jewish and thus determine the scope of the genocide.\\r\\nOne copy of the Protocol with circulated minutes of the meeting survived the war. It was found by Robert Kempner in March 1947 among files that had been seized from the German Foreign Office. It was used as evidence in the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials. The Wannsee House, site of the conference, is now a Holocaust memorial.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLegalized discrimination against Jews in Germany began immediately after the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933. Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazi regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country. The ideology of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene, and eugenics and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more Lebensraum (living space) for the Germanic people.[2] Nazi Germany attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or exterminate the Jews and Slavs living there, who were viewed as being inferior to the Aryan master race.[3]\\r\\nDiscrimination against Jews, longstanding but extralegal throughout much of Europe at the time, was codified in Germany immediately after the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January 1933. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed on 7 April of that year, excluded most Jews from the legal profession and the civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of the right to practise.[4] Violence and economic pressure were used by the regime to force Jews to leave the country.[5] Jewish businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of access to government contracts. Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks and boycotts of their businesses.[6]\\r\\nIn September 1935, the Nuremberg Laws were enacted, prohibiting marriages between Jews and people of Germanic extraction, extramarital relations between Jews and Germans, and the employment of German women under the age of 45 as domestic servants in Jewish households.[7] The Reich Citizenship Law stated that only those of German or related blood were defined as citizens; thus, Jews and other minority groups were stripped of their German citizenship.[8] A supplementary decree issued in November defined as Jewish anyone with three Jewish grandparents, or two grandparents if the Jewish faith was followed.[9] By the start of World War II in 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews emigrated to the United States, Palestine, Great Britain, and other countries.[10][11]\\r\\nAfter the invasion of Poland in September 1939, Hitler ordered that the Polish leadership and intelligentsia should be destroyed.[12] The Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen (Special Prosecution Book Poland)lists of people to be killedhad been drawn up by the SS as early as May 1939.[12] The Einsatzgruppen (special task forces) performed these murders with the support of the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz (Germanic Self-Protection Group), a paramilitary group consisting of ethnic Germans living in Poland.[13] Members of the SS, the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces), and the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police; Orpo) also shot civilians during the Polish campaign.[14] Approximately 65,000 civilians were killed by the end of 1939. In addition to leaders of Polish society, they killed Jews, prostitutes, Romani people, and the mentally ill.[15][16]\\r\\nOn 31 July 1941 Hermann G?ring gave written authorization to SS-Obergruppenfhrer (Senior Group Leader) Reinhard Heydrich, Chief of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), to prepare and submit a plan for a \\"total solution of the Jewish question\\" in territories under German control and to coordinate the participation of all involved government organisations.[17] The resulting Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered.[18] The minutes of the Wannsee Conference estimated the Jewish population of the Soviet Union to be five million, with another three million in Ukraine.[19]\\r\\nIn addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis also planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan devised by Herbert Backe.[20] Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists.[21] The objective of the Hunger Plan was to inflict deliberate mass starvation on the Slavic civilian populations under German occupation by directing all food supplies to the German home population and the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front.[22] According to the historian Timothy Snyder, \\"4.2 million Soviet citizens (largely Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians) were starved\\" by the Nazis (and the Nazi-controlled Wehrmacht) in 1941ÿ1944 as a result of Backe's plan.[23][24]\\r\\nHarvests were poor in Germany in 1940 and 1941 and food supplies were short, as large numbers of forced labourers had been brought into the country to work in the armaments industry.[25] If these workersas well as the German peoplewere to be adequately fed, there must be a sharp reduction in the number of \\"useless mouths\\", of whom the millions of Jews under German rule were, in the light of Nazi ideology, the most obvious example.[26]\\r\\nAt the time of the Wannsee Conference, the killing of Jews in the Soviet Union had already been underway for some months. Right from the start of Operation Barbarossathe invasion of the Soviet UnionEinsatzgruppen were assigned to follow the army into the conquered areas and round up and kill Jews. In a letter dated 2 July 1941 Heydrich communicated to his SS and Police Leaders that the Einsatzgruppen were to execute Comintern officials, ranking members of the Communist Party, extremist and radical Communist Party members, people's commissars, and Jews in party and government posts.[27] Open-ended instructions were given to execute \\"other radical elements (saboteurs, propagandists, snipers, assassins, agitators, etc.).\\"[27] He instructed that any pogroms spontaneously initiated by the occupants of the conquered territories were to be quietly encouraged.[27] On 8 July, he announced that all Jews were to be regarded as partisans, and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot.[28] By August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderlythe entire Jewish population.[29] By the time planning was underway for the Wannsee Conference, hundreds of thousands of Polish, Serbian, and Russian Jews had already been killed.[30] The initial plan was to implement Generalplan Ost after the conquest of the Soviet Union.[18][31] European Jews would be deported to occupied parts of Russia, where they would be worked to death in road-building projects.[30]\\r\\nOn 29 November 1941, Heydrich sent invitations for a ministerial conference to be held on 9 December at the offices of Interpol at 16 Am Kleinen Wannsee.[32] He changed the venue on 4 December to the eventual location of the meeting.[32] He enclosed a copy of a letter from G?ring dated 31 July that authorised him to plan a so-called Final solution to the Jewish question. The ministries to be represented were Interior, Justice, the Four-year plan, Propaganda, and the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories.[33]\\r\\nBetween the date the invitations to the conference went out (29 November) and the date of the cancelled first meeting (9 December), the situation changed. On 5 December, the Soviet Army began a counter-offensive in front of Moscow, ending the prospect of a rapid conquest of the Soviet Union. On 7 December, the Japanese attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor, causing the U.S. to declare war on Japan the next day. The Reich government declared war on the U.S. on 11 December. Some invitees were involved in these preparations, so Heydrich postponed his meeting.[34] Somewhere around this time, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately, rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight.[35][a] At the Reich Chancellery meeting of 12 December 1941 he met with top party officials and made his intentions plain.[36] On 18 December, Hitler discussed the fate of the Jews with Himmler in the Wolfsschanze.[37] Following the meeting, Himmler made a note on his service calendar, which simply stated \\"Jewish question/to be destroyed as partisans\\".[37]\\r\\nThe war was still ongoing, and since transporting masses of people into a combat zone was impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews currently living in the General Government (the German-occupied area of Poland) would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland, as would Jews from the rest of Europe.[1]\\r\\nOn 8 January 1942, Heydrich sent new invitations to a meeting to be held on 20 January.[38] The venue for the rescheduled conference was a villa at Am Gro?en Wannsee 56ÿ58, overlooking the Gro?er Wannsee. The villa had been purchased from Friedrich Minoux in 1940 by the Sicherheitsdienst (Security Force; SD) for use as a conference centre and guest house.[39]\\r\\nHeydrich invited representatives from several government ministries, including state secretaries from the Foreign Office, the justice, interior, and state ministries, and representatives from the SS. The process of disseminating information about the fate of the Jews was already well underway by the time the meeting was held.[40] Of the 15 who attended, 8 held academic doctorates.[41][42]\\r\\nIn preparation for the conference, Eichmann drafted a list of the numbers of Jews in the various European countries. Countries were listed in two groups, \\"A\\" and \\"B\\". \\"A\\" countries were those under direct Reich control or occupation (or partially occupied and quiescent, in the case of Vichy France); \\"B\\" countries were allied or client states, neutral, or at war with Germany.[44][b] The numbers reflect the estimated Jewish population within each country; for example, Estonia is listed as Judenfrei (free of Jews), since the 4,500 Jews who remained in Estonia after the German occupation had been exterminated by the end of 1941.[45] Occupied Poland was not on the list because by 1939 the country was split three ways among Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany in the west, the territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union in the east, and the General Government where many Polish and Jewish expellees had already been resettled.[46]\\r\\nHeydrich opened the conference with an account of the anti-Jewish measures taken in Germany since the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. He said that between 1933 and October 1941, 537,000 German, Austrian, and Czech Jews had emigrated.[47] This information was taken from a briefing paper prepared for him the previous week by Eichmann.[48]\\r\\nHeydrich reported that there were approximately eleven million Jews in the whole of Europe, of whom half were in countries not under German control.[44][b] He explained that since further Jewish emigration had been prohibited by Himmler, a new solution would take its place: \\"evacuating\\" Jews to the east. This would be a temporary solution, a step towards the \\"final solution of the Jewish question\\".[49]\\r\\nUnder proper guidance, in the course of the final solution the Jews are to be allocated for appropriate labor in the East. Able-bodied Jews, separated according to sex, will be taken in large work columns to these areas for work on roads, in the course of which action doubtless a large portion will be eliminated by natural causes. The possible final remnant will, since it will undoubtedly consist of the most resistant portion, have to be treated accordingly, because it is the product of natural selection and would, if released, act as the seed of a new Jewish revival.[50]\\r\\nGerman historian Peter Longerich notes that vague orders couched in terminology that had a specific meaning for members of the regime were common, especially when people were being ordered to carry out criminal activities. Leaders were given briefings about the need to be \\"severe\\" and \\"firm\\"; all Jews were to be viewed as potential enemies that had to be dealt with ruthlessly.[51] The wording of the Wannsee Protocolthe distributed minutes of the meetingmade it clear to participants that evacuation east was a euphemism for death.[52]\\r\\nHeydrich went on to say that in the course of the \\"practical execution of the final solution\\", Europe would be \\"combed through from west to east\\" but that Germany, Austria, and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia would have priority \\"due to the housing problem and additional social and political necessities\\".[50] This was a reference to increasing pressure from the Gauleiters (regional Nazi Party leaders) in Germany for the Jews to be removed from their areas to allow accommodation for Germans made homeless by Allied bombing, as well as to make space for laborers being imported from occupied countries. The \\"evacuated\\" Jews, he said, would first be sent to \\"transit ghettos\\" in the General Government, from which they would be transported eastward.[50] Heydrich said that to avoid legal and political difficulties, it was important to define who was a Jew for the purposes of \\"evacuation\\". He outlined categories of people who would not be killed. Jews over 65 years old, and Jewish World War I veterans who had been severely wounded or who had won the Iron Cross, might be sent to Theresienstadt concentration camp instead of being killed. \\"With this expedient solution,\\" he said, \\"in one fell swoop many interventions will be prevented.\\"[50]\\r\\nThe situation of people who were half or quarter Jews, and of Jews who were married to non-Jews, was more complex. Under the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, their status had been left deliberately ambiguous. Heydrich announced that Mischlings (mixed-race persons) of the first degree (persons with two Jewish grandparents) would be treated as Jews. This would not apply if they were married to a non-Jew and had children by that marriage. It would also not apply if they had been granted written exemption by \\"the highest offices of the Party and State.\\"[53] Such persons would be sterilised or deported if they refused sterilisation.[53] \\"Mischlings of the second degree\\" (persons with one Jewish grandparent) would be treated as Germans unless they were married to Jews or Mischlings of the first degree, had a \\"racially especially undesirable appearance that marks him outwardly as a Jew\\",[54] or had a \\"political record that shows that he feels and behaves like a Jew\\".[55] Persons in these latter categories would be killed even if married to non-Jews.[54] In the case of mixed marriages, Heydrich recommended that each case should be evaluated individually and the impact on any German relatives assessed. If such a marriage had produced children who were being raised as Germans, the Jewish partner would not be killed. If they were being raised as Jews, they might be killed or sent to an old-age ghetto.[55] These exemptions applied only to German and Austrian Jews, and were not always observed even for them. In most of the occupied countries, Jews were rounded up and killed en masse, and anyone who lived in or identified with the Jewish community in any given place was regarded as a Jew.[56][c]\\r\\nHeydrich commented, \\"In occupied and unoccupied France, the registration of Jews for evacuation will in all probability proceed without great difficulty\\",[57] but in the end the great majority of French-born Jews survived.[58] More difficulty was anticipated with Germany's allies Romania and Hungary. \\"In Romania the government has [now] appointed a commissioner for Jewish affairs\\", Heydrich said.[57] In fact the deportation of Romanian Jews was slow and inefficient despite a high degree of popular antisemitism.[59] \\"In order to settle the question in Hungary,\\" Heydrich said, \\"it will soon be necessary to force an adviser for Jewish questions onto the Hungarian government\\".[57] The Hungarian regime of Mikl܇s Horthy continued to resist German interference in its Jewish policy until the spring of 1944, when the Wehrmacht invaded Hungary. Very soon, 600,000 Jews of Hungary (and parts of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia occupied by Hungary) were sent to their deaths by Eichmann, with the collaboration of Hungarian authorities.[60]\\r\\nHeydrich spoke for nearly an hour. Then followed about thirty minutes of questions and comments, followed by some less formal conversation.[61] Otto Hofmann (head of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (RuSHA)) and Wilhelm Stuckart (State Secretary of the Reich Interior Ministry) pointed out the legalistic and administrative difficulties over mixed marriages, and suggested compulsory dissolution of mixed marriages or the wider use of sterilisation as a simpler alternative.[62] Erich Neumann from the Four Year Plan argued for the exemption of Jews who were working in industries vital to the war effort and for whom no replacements were available. Heydrich assured him that this was already the policy; such Jews would not be killed.[63][d] Josef Bhler, State Secretary of the General Government, stated his support for the plan and his hope that the killings would commence as soon as possible.[64] Towards the end of the meeting cognac was served, and after that the conversation became less restrained.[62] \\"The gentlemen were standing together, or sitting together\\", Eichmann said, \\"and were discussing the subject quite bluntly, quite differently from the language which I had to use later in the record. During the conversation they minced no words about it at all?... they spoke about methods of killing, about liquidation, about extermination\\".[61] Eichmann recorded that Heydrich was pleased with the course of the meeting. He had expected a lot of resistance, Eichmann recalled, but instead he had found \\"an atmosphere not only of agreement on the part of the participants, but more than that, one could feel an agreement which had assumed a form which had not been expected\\".[56]\\r\\nAt the conclusion of the meeting Heydrich gave Eichmann firm instructions about what was to appear in the minutes. They were not to be verbatim: Eichmann ensured that nothing too explicit appeared in them. He said at his trial: \\"How shall I put it  certain over-plain talk and jargon expressions had to be rendered into office language by me\\".[64] Eichmann condensed his records into a document outlining the purpose of the meeting and the intentions of the regime moving forward. He stated at his trial that it was personally edited by Heydrich, and thus reflected the message he intended the participants to take away from the meeting.[65] Copies of the minutes (known from the German word for \\"minutes\\" as the \\"Wannsee Protocol\\"[e]) were sent by Eichmann to all the participants after the meeting.[66] Most of these copies were destroyed at the end of the war as participants and other officials sought to cover their tracks. It was not until 1947 that Luther's copy (number 16 out of 30 copies prepared) was found by Robert Kempner, a U.S. prosecutor in the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, in files that had been seized from the German Foreign Office.[67]\\r\\nThe Wannsee Conference lasted only about ninety minutes. The enormous importance which has been attached to the conference by postwar writers was not evident to most of its participants at the time. Heydrich did not call the meeting to make fundamental new decisions on the Jewish question. Massive killings of Jews in the conquered territories in the Soviet Union and Poland were ongoing and a new extermination camp was already under construction at Belzec at the time of the conference; other extermination camps were in the planning stages.[30][68] The decision to exterminate the Jews had already been made, and Heydrich, as Himmler's emissary, held the meeting to ensure the cooperation of the various departments in conducting the deportations.[69] Observations from historian Laurence Rees support Longerich's position that the decision over the fate of the Jews was determined before the conference; Rees notes that the Wannsee Conference was really a meeting of \\"second-level functionaries\\" and stresses that neither Himmler, Goebbels, nor Hitler were present.[70] According to Longerich, a primary goal of the meeting was to emphasise that once the deportations had been completed, the implementation of the \\"final solution\\" became an internal matter of the SS, totally outside the purview of any other agency.[71] A secondary goal was to determine the scope of the deportations and arrive at definitions of who was Jewish, who was Mischling, and who (if anybody) should be spared.[71] \\"The representatives of the ministerial bureaucracy had made it plain that they had no concerns about the principle of deportation per se. This was indeed the crucial result of the meeting and the main reason why Heydrich had detailed minutes prepared and widely circulated\\", said Longerich.[72] Their presence at the meeting also ensured that all those present were accomplices and accessories to the murders that were about to be undertaken.[73]\\r\\nEichmann's biographer David Cesarani agrees with Longerich's interpretation; he notes that Heydrich's main purpose was to impose his own authority on the various ministries and agencies involved in Jewish policy matters, and to avoid any repetition of the disputes that had arisen earlier in the annihilation campaign. \\"The simplest, most decisive way that Heydrich could ensure the smooth flow of deportations\\", he writes, \\"was by asserting his total control over the fate of the Jews in the Reich and the east, and [by] cow[ing] other interested parties into toeing the line of the RSHA\\".[74]\\r\\nIn 1965, historian Joseph Wulf proposed that the Wannsee House should be made into a Holocaust memorial and document centre, but the West German government was not interested at that time. The building was in use as a school, and funding was not available. Despondent at the failure of the project and the West German government's failure to pursue and convict Nazi war criminals, Wulf committed suicide in 1974.[75]\\r\\nOn 20 January 1992, on the fiftieth anniversary of the conference, the site was finally opened as a Holocaust memorial and museum known as the Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz (House of the Wannsee Conference).[76] The museum also hosts permanent exhibits of texts and photographs that document events of the Holocaust and its planning.[77] The Joseph Wulf Bibliothek / Mediothek on the second floor houses a large collection of books on the Nazi era, plus other materials such as microfilms and original Nazi documents.[77]\\r\\nCoordinates: 522559N 0130956E? / ?52.43306N 13.16556E? / 52.43306; 13.16556","input":"What was the final solution of the wannsee conference?"},{"output":"94 occur naturally","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nA chemical element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (that is, the same atomic number, or Z).[1] 118 elements are identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radionuclides, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nChemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe. However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter makes up only about 15% of the matter in the universe: the remainder is dark matter; the composition of this is unknown, but it is not composed of chemical elements.[3]\\r\\nThe two lightest elements, hydrogen and helium, were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe. The next three elements (lithium, beryllium and boron) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation, and are thus rarer than heavier elements. Formation of elements with from 6 to 26 protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis. The high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars. Elements with greater than 26 protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae, which, when they explode, blast these elements as supernova remnants far into space, where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"element\\" is used for atoms with a given number of protons (regardless of whether or not they are ionized or chemically bonded, e.g. hydrogen in water) as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element (e.g. hydrogen gas).[1] For the second meaning, the terms \\"elementary substance\\" and \\"simple substance\\" have been suggested, but they have not gained much acceptance in English chemical literature, whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used (e.g. French corps simple, Russian ŤѾҾ ־Ͷ־). A single element can form multiple substances differing in their structure; they are called allotropes of the element.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen different elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held together by chemical bonds, they form chemical compounds. Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals. Among the more common of such native elements are copper, silver, gold, carbon (as coal, graphite, or diamonds), and sulfur. All but a few of the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron from their ores by smelting, using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more; all of the naturally occurring elements were known by 1950.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe properties of the chemical elements are summarized in the periodic table, which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows (\\"periods\\") in which the columns (\\"groups\\") share recurring (\\"periodic\\") physical and chemical properties. Save for unstable radioactive elements with short half-lives, all of the elements are available industrially, most of them in low degrees of impurities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lightest chemical elements are hydrogen and helium, both created by Big Bang nucleosynthesis during the first 20 minutes of the universe[5] in a ratio of around 3:1 by mass (or 12:1 by number of atoms),[6][7] along with tiny traces of the next two elements, lithium and beryllium. Almost all other elements found in nature were made by various natural methods of nucleosynthesis.[8] On Earth, small amounts of new atoms are naturally produced in nucleogenic reactions, or in cosmogenic processes, such as cosmic ray spallation. New atoms are also naturally produced on Earth as radiogenic daughter isotopes of ongoing radioactive decay processes such as alpha decay, beta decay, spontaneous fission, cluster decay, and other rarer modes of decay.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the 94 naturally occurring elements, those with atomic numbers 1 through 82 each have at least one stable isotope (except for technetium, element 43 and promethium, element 61, which have no stable isotopes). Isotopes considered stable are those for which no radioactive decay has yet been observed. Elements with atomic numbers 83 through 94 are unstable to the point that radioactive decay of all isotopes can be detected. Some of these elements, notably bismuth (atomic number 83), thorium (atomic number 90), and uranium (atomic number 92), have one or more isotopes with half-lives long enough to survive as remnants of the explosive stellar nucleosynthesis that produced the heavy metals before the formation of our Solar System. At over 1.9G1019 years, over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe, bismuth-209 (atomic number 83) has the longest known alpha decay half-life of any naturally occurring element, and is almost always considered on par with the 80 stable elements.[9][10] The very heaviest elements (those beyond plutonium, element 94) undergo radioactive decay with half-lives so short that they are not found in nature and must be synthesized.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2010, there are 118 known elements (in this context, \\"known\\" means observed well enough, even from just a few decay products, to have been differentiated from other elements).[11][12] Of these 118 elements, 94 occur naturally on Earth. Six of these occur in extreme trace quantities: technetium, atomic number 43; promethium, number 61; astatine, number 85; francium, number 87; neptunium, number 93; and plutonium, number 94. These 94 elements have been detected in the universe at large, in the spectra of stars and also supernovae, where short-lived radioactive elements are newly being made. The first 94 elements have been detected directly on Earth as primordial nuclides present from the formation of the solar system, or as naturally occurring fission or transmutation products of uranium and thorium.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remaining 24 heavier elements, not found today either on Earth or in astronomical spectra, have been produced artificially: these are all radioactive, with very short half-lives; if any atoms of these elements were present at the formation of Earth, they are extremely likely, to the point of certainty, to have already decayed, and if present in novae, have been in quantities too small to have been noted. Technetium was the first purportedly non-naturally occurring element synthesized, in 1937, although trace amounts of technetium have since been found in nature (and also the element may have been discovered naturally in 1925).[13] This pattern of artificial production and later natural discovery has been repeated with several other radioactive naturally occurring rare elements.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nList of the elements are available by name, atomic number, density, melting point, boiling point and by symbol, as well as ionization energies of the elements. The nuclides of stable and radioactive elements are also available as a list of nuclides, sorted by length of half-life for those that are unstable. One of the most convenient, and certainly the most traditional presentation of the elements, is in the form of the periodic table, which groups together elements with similar chemical properties (and usually also similar electronic structures).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons in each atom, and defines the element.[15] For example, all carbon atoms contain 6 protons in their atomic nucleus; so the atomic number of carbon is 6.[16] Carbon atoms may have different numbers of neutrons; atoms of the same element having different numbers of neutrons are known as isotopes of the element.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of protons in the atomic nucleus also determines its electric charge, which in turn determines the number of electrons of the atom in its non-ionized state. The electrons are placed into atomic orbitals that determine the atom's various chemical properties. The number of neutrons in a nucleus usually has very little effect on an element's chemical properties (except in the case of hydrogen and deuterium). Thus, all carbon isotopes have nearly identical chemical properties because they all have six protons and six electrons, even though carbon atoms may, for example, have 6 or 8 neutrons. That is why the atomic number, rather than mass number or atomic weight, is considered the identifying characteristic of a chemical element.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe symbol for atomic number is Z.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsotopes are atoms of the same element (that is, with the same number of protons in their atomic nucleus), but having different numbers of neutrons. Thus, for example, there are three main isotopes of carbon. All carbon atoms have 6 protons in the nucleus, but they can have either 6, 7, or 8 neutrons. Since the mass numbers of these are 12, 13 and 14 respectively, the three isotopes of carbon are known as carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14, often abbreviated to 12C, 13C, and 14C. Carbon in everyday life and in chemistry is a mixture of 12C (about 98.9%), 13C (about 1.1%) and about 1 atom per trillion of 14C.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost (66 of 94) naturally occurring elements have more than one stable isotope. Except for the isotopes of hydrogen (which differ greatly from each other in relative massenough to cause chemical effects), the isotopes of a given element are chemically nearly indistinguishable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the elements have some isotopes that are radioactive (radioisotopes), although not all of these radioisotopes occur naturally. The radioisotopes typically decay into other elements upon radiating an alpha or beta particle. If an element has isotopes that are not radioactive, these are termed \\"stable\\" isotopes. All of the known stable isotopes occur naturally (see primordial isotope). The many radioisotopes that are not found in nature have been characterized after being artificially made. Certain elements have no stable isotopes and are composed only of radioactive isotopes: specifically the elements without any stable isotopes are technetium (atomic number 43), promethium (atomic number 61), and all observed elements with atomic numbers greater than 82.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the 80 elements with at least one stable isotope, 26 have only one single stable isotope. The mean number of stable isotopes for the 80 stable elements is 3.1 stable isotopes per element. The largest number of stable isotopes that occur for a single element is 10 (for tin, element 50).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mass number of an element, A, is the number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the atomic nucleus. Different isotopes of a given element are distinguished by their mass numbers, which are conventionally written as a superscript on the left hand side of the atomic symbol (e.g. 238U). The mass number is always a whole number and has units of \\"nucleons\\". For example, magnesium-24 (24 is the mass number) is an atom with 24 nucleons (12 protons and 12 neutrons).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereas the mass number simply counts the total number of neutrons and protons and is thus a natural (or whole) number, the atomic mass of a single atom is a real number giving the mass of a particular isotope (or \\"nuclide\\") of the element, expressed in atomic mass units (symbol: u). In general, the mass number of a given nuclide differs in value slightly from its atomic mass, since the mass of each proton and neutron is not exactly 1?u; since the electrons contribute a lesser share to the atomic mass as neutron number exceeds proton number; and (finally) because of the nuclear binding energy. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine-35 to five significant digits is 34.969?u and that of chlorine-37 is 36.966?u. However, the atomic mass in u of each isotope is quite close to its simple mass number (always within 1%). The only isotope whose atomic mass is exactly a natural number is 12C, which by definition has a mass of exactly 12, because u is defined as 1/12 of the mass of a free neutral carbon-12 atom in the ground state.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe standard atomic weight (commonly called \\"atomic weight\\") of an element is the average of the atomic masses of all the chemical element's isotopes as found in a particular environment, weighted by isotopic abundance, relative to the atomic mass unit. This number may be a fraction that is not close to a whole number. For example, the relative atomic mass of chlorine is 35.453?u, which differs greatly from a whole number as it is an average of about 76% chlorine-35 and 24% chlorine-37. Whenever a relative atomic mass value differs by more than 1% from a whole number, it is due to this averaging effect, as significant amounts of more than one isotope are naturally present in a sample of that element.\\r\\n\\r\\nChemists and nuclear scientists have different definitions of a pure element. In chemistry, a pure element means a substance whose atoms all (or in practice almost all) have the same atomic number, or number of protons. Nuclear scientists, however, define a pure element as one that consists of only one stable isotope.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, a copper wire is 99.99% chemically pure if 99.99% of its atoms are copper, with 29 protons each. However it is not isotopically pure since ordinary copper consists of two stable isotopes, 69% 63Cu and 31% 65Cu, with different numbers of neutrons. However, a pure gold ingot would be both chemically and isotopically pure, since ordinary gold consists only of one isotope, 197Au.\\r\\n\\r\\nAtoms of chemically pure elements may bond to each other chemically in more than one way, allowing the pure element to exist in multiple chemical structures (spatial arrangements of atoms), known as allotropes, which differ in their properties. For example, carbon can be found as diamond, which has a tetrahedral structure around each carbon atom; graphite, which has layers of carbon atoms with a hexagonal structure stacked on top of each other; graphene, which is a single layer of graphite that is very strong; fullerenes, which have nearly spherical shapes; and carbon nanotubes, which are tubes with a hexagonal structure (even these may differ from each other in electrical properties). The ability of an element to exist in one of many structural forms is known as 'allotropy'.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe standard state, also known as reference state, of an element is defined as its thermodynamically most stable state at a pressure of 1 bar and a given temperature (typically at 298.15?K). In thermochemistry, an element is defined to have an enthalpy of formation of zero in its standard state. For example, the reference state for carbon is graphite, because the structure of graphite is more stable than that of the other allotropes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral kinds of descriptive categorizations can be applied broadly to the elements, including consideration of their general physical and chemical properties, their states of matter under familiar conditions, their melting and boiling points, their densities, their crystal structures as solids, and their origins.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral terms are commonly used to characterize the general physical and chemical properties of the chemical elements. A first distinction is between metals, which readily conduct electricity, nonmetals, which do not, and a small group, (the metalloids), having intermediate properties and often behaving as semiconductors.\\r\\n\\r\\nA more refined classification is often shown in colored presentations of the periodic table. This system restricts the terms \\"metal\\" and \\"nonmetal\\" to only certain of the more broadly defined metals and nonmetals, adding additional terms for certain sets of the more broadly viewed metals and nonmetals. The version of this classification used in the periodic tables presented here includes: actinides, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, halogens, lanthanides, transition metals, post-transition metals, metalloids, reactive nonmetals, and noble gases. In this system, the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and transition metals, as well as the lanthanides and the actinides, are special groups of the metals viewed in a broader sense. Similarly, the reactive nonmetals and the noble gases are nonmetals viewed in the broader sense. In some presentations, the halogens are not distinguished, with astatine identified as a metalloid and the others identified as nonmetals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother commonly used basic distinction among the elements is their state of matter (phase), whether solid, liquid, or gas, at a selected standard temperature and pressure (STP). Most of the elements are solids at conventional temperatures and atmospheric pressure, while several are gases. Only bromine and mercury are liquids at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) and normal atmospheric pressure; caesium and gallium are solids at that temperature, but melt at 28.4?C (83.2?F) and 29.8?C (85.6?F), respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelting and boiling points, typically expressed in degrees Celsius at a pressure of one atmosphere, are commonly used in characterizing the various elements. While known for most elements, either or both of these measurements is still undetermined for some of the radioactive elements available in only tiny quantities. Since helium remains a liquid even at absolute zero at atmospheric pressure, it has only a boiling point, and not a melting point, in conventional presentations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe density at a selected standard temperature and pressure (STP) is frequently used in characterizing the elements. Density is often expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3). Since several elements are gases at commonly encountered temperatures, their densities are usually stated for their gaseous forms; when liquefied or solidified, the gaseous elements have densities similar to those of the other elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen an element has allotropes with different densities, one representative allotrope is typically selected in summary presentations, while densities for each allotrope can be stated where more detail is provided. For example, the three familiar allotropes of carbon (amorphous carbon, graphite, and diamond) have densities of 1.8ÿ2.1, 2.267, and 3.515?g/cm3, respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elements studied to date as solid samples have eight kinds of crystal structures: cubic, body-centered cubic, face-centered cubic, hexagonal, monoclinic, orthorhombic, rhombohedral, and tetragonal. For some of the synthetically produced transuranic elements, available samples have been too small to determine crystal structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nChemical elements may also be categorized by their origin on Earth, with the first 94 considered naturally occurring, while those with atomic numbers beyond 94 have only been produced artificially as the synthetic products of man-made nuclear reactions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the 94 naturally occurring elements, 83 are considered primordial and either stable or weakly radioactive. The remaining 11 naturally occurring elements possess half lives too short for them to have been present at the beginning of the Solar System, and are therefore considered transient elements. Of these 11 transient elements, 5 (polonium, radon, radium, actinium, and protactinium) are relatively common decay products of thorium and uranium. The remaining 6 transient elements (technetium, promethium, astatine, francium, neptunium, and plutonium) occur only rarely, as products of rare decay modes or nuclear reaction processes involving uranium or other heavy elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nElements with atomic numbers 1 through 40 are all stable, while those with atomic numbers 41 through 82 (except technetium and promethium) are metastable.[citation needed] The half-lives of these metastable \\"theoretical radionuclides\\" are so long (at least 100 million times longer than the estimated age of the universe) that their radioactive decay has yet to be detected by experiment. Elements with atomic numbers 83 through 94 are unstable to the point that their radioactive decay can be detected. Three of these elements, bismuth (element 83), thorium (element 90), and uranium (element 92) have one or more isotopes with half-lives long enough to survive as remnants of the explosive stellar nucleosynthesis that produced the heavy elements before the formation of our solar system. For example, at over 1.9G1019 years, over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe, bismuth-209 has the longest known alpha decay half-life of any naturally occurring element.[9][10] The very heaviest 24 elements (those beyond plutonium, element 94) undergo radioactive decay with short half-lives and cannot be produced as daughters of longer-lived elements, and thus they do not occur in nature at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n1?(red)=Gas?3?(black)=Solid?80?(green)=Liquid?109?(gray)=Unknown?Color of the atomic number shows state of matter (at 0?C and 1?atm) \\r\\n\\r\\nBackground color shows subcategory in the metalÿmetalloidÿnonmetal trend:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe properties of the chemical elements are often summarized using the periodic table, which powerfully and elegantly organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows (\\"periods\\") in which the columns (\\"groups\\") share recurring (\\"periodic\\") physical and chemical properties. The current standard table contains 118 confirmed elements as of 10 April 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough earlier precursors to this presentation exist, its invention is generally credited to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, who intended the table to illustrate recurring trends in the properties of the elements. The layout of the table has been refined and extended over time as new elements have been discovered and new theoretical models have been developed to explain chemical behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse of the periodic table is now ubiquitous within the academic discipline of chemistry, providing an extremely useful framework to classify, systematize and compare all the many different forms of chemical behavior. The table has also found wide application in physics, geology, biology, materials science, engineering, agriculture, medicine, nutrition, environmental health, and astronomy. Its principles are especially important in chemical engineering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe various chemical elements are formally identified by their unique atomic numbers, by their accepted names, and by their symbols.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe known elements have atomic numbers from 1 through 118, conventionally presented as Arabic numerals. Since the elements can be uniquely sequenced by atomic number, conventionally from lowest to highest (as in a periodic table), sets of elements are sometimes specified by such notation as \\"through\\", \\"beyond\\", or \\"from ... through\\", as in \\"through iron\\", \\"beyond uranium\\", or \\"from lanthanum through lutetium\\". The terms \\"light\\" and \\"heavy\\" are sometimes also used informally to indicate relative atomic numbers (not densities), as in \\"lighter than carbon\\" or \\"heavier than lead\\", although technically the weight or mass of atoms of an element (their atomic weights or atomic masses) do not always increase monotonically with their atomic numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe naming of various substances now known as elements precedes the atomic theory of matter, as names were given locally by various cultures to various minerals, metals, compounds, alloys, mixtures, and other materials, although at the time it was not known which chemicals were elements and which compounds. As they were identified as elements, the existing names for anciently-known elements (e.g., gold, mercury, iron) were kept in most countries. National differences emerged over the names of elements either for convenience, linguistic niceties, or nationalism. For a few illustrative examples: German speakers use \\"Wasserstoff\\" (water substance) for \\"hydrogen\\", \\"Sauerstoff\\" (acid substance) for \\"oxygen\\" and \\"Stickstoff\\" (smothering substance) for \\"nitrogen\\", while English and some romance languages use \\"sodium\\" for \\"natrium\\" and \\"potassium\\" for \\"kalium\\", and the French, Italians, Greeks, Portuguese and Poles prefer \\"azote/azot/azoto\\" (from roots meaning \\"no life\\") for \\"nitrogen\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFor purposes of international communication and trade, the official names of the chemical elements both ancient and more recently recognized are decided by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), which has decided on a sort of international English language, drawing on traditional English names even when an element's chemical symbol is based on a Latin or other traditional word, for example adopting \\"gold\\" rather than \\"aurum\\" as the name for the 79th element (Au). IUPAC prefers the British spellings \\"aluminium\\" and \\"caesium\\" over the U.S. spellings \\"aluminum\\" and \\"cesium\\", and the U.S. \\"sulfur\\" over the British \\"sulphur\\". However, elements that are practical to sell in bulk in many countries often still have locally used national names, and countries whose national language does not use the Latin alphabet are likely to use the IUPAC element names.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to IUPAC, chemical elements are not proper nouns in English; consequently, the full name of an element is not routinely capitalized in English, even if derived from a proper noun, as in californium and einsteinium. Isotope names of chemical elements are also uncapitalized if written out, e.g., carbon-12 or uranium-235. Chemical element symbols (such as Cf for californium and Es for einsteinium), are always capitalized (see below).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, physics laboratories became able to produce nuclei of chemical elements with half-lives too short for an appreciable amount of them to exist at any time. These are also named by IUPAC, which generally adopts the name chosen by the discoverer. This practice can lead to the controversial question of which research group actually discovered an element, a question that delayed the naming of elements with atomic number of 104 and higher for a considerable amount of time. (See element naming controversy).\\r\\n\\r\\nPrecursors of such controversies involved the nationalistic namings of elements in the late 19th century. For example, lutetium was named in reference to Paris, France. The Germans were reluctant to relinquish naming rights to the French, often calling it cassiopeium. Similarly, the British discoverer of niobium originally named it columbium, in reference to the New World. It was used extensively as such by American publications prior to the international standardization (in 1950).\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore chemistry became a science, alchemists had designed arcane symbols for both metals and common compounds. These were however used as abbreviations in diagrams or procedures; there was no concept of atoms combining to form molecules. With his advances in the atomic theory of matter, John Dalton devised his own simpler symbols, based on circles, to depict molecules.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current system of chemical notation was invented by Berzelius. In this typographical system, chemical symbols are not mere abbreviationsthough each consists of letters of the Latin alphabet. They are intended as universal symbols for people of all languages and alphabets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of these symbols were intended to be fully universal. Since Latin was the common language of science at that time, they were abbreviations based on the Latin names of metals. Cu comes from Cuprum, Fe comes from Ferrum, Ag from Argentum. The symbols were not followed by a period (full stop) as with abbreviations. Later chemical elements were also assigned unique chemical symbols, based on the name of the element, but not necessarily in English. For example, sodium has the chemical symbol 'Na' after the Latin natrium. The same applies to \\"W\\" (wolfram) for tungsten, \\"Fe\\" (ferrum) for iron, \\"Hg\\" (hydrargyrum) for mercury, \\"Sn\\" (stannum) for tin, \\"K\\" (kalium) for potassium, \\"Au\\" (aurum) for gold, \\"Ag\\" (argentum) for silver, \\"Pb\\" (plumbum) for lead, \\"Cu\\" (cuprum) for copper, and \\"Sb\\" (stibium) for antimony.\\r\\n\\r\\nChemical symbols are understood internationally when element names might require translation. There have sometimes been differences in the past. For example, Germans in the past have used \\"J\\" (for the alternate name Jod) for iodine, but now use \\"I\\" and \\"Iod\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first letter of a chemical symbol is always capitalized, as in the preceding examples, and the subsequent letters, if any, are always lower case (small letters). Thus, the symbols for californium and einsteinium are Cf and Es.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also symbols in chemical equations for groups of chemical elements, for example in comparative formulas. These are often a single capital letter, and the letters are reserved and not used for names of specific elements. For example, an \\"X\\" indicates a variable group (usually a halogen) in a class of compounds, while \\"R\\" is a radical, meaning a compound structure such as a hydrocarbon chain. The letter \\"Q\\" is reserved for \\"heat\\" in a chemical reaction. \\"Y\\" is also often used as a general chemical symbol, although it is also the symbol of yttrium. \\"Z\\" is also frequently used as a general variable group. \\"E\\" is used in organic chemistry to denote an electron-withdrawing group or an electrophile; similarly \\"Nu\\" denotes a nucleophile. \\"L\\" is used to represent a general ligand in inorganic and organometallic chemistry. \\"M\\" is also often used in place of a general metal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least two additional, two-letter generic chemical symbols are also in informal usage, \\"Ln\\" for any lanthanide element and \\"An\\" for any actinide element. \\"Rg\\" was formerly used for any rare gas element, but the group of rare gases has now been renamed noble gases and the symbol \\"Rg\\" has now been assigned to the element roentgenium.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsotopes are distinguished by the atomic mass number (total protons and neutrons) for a particular isotope of an element, with this number combined with the pertinent element's symbol. IUPAC prefers that isotope symbols be written in superscript notation when practical, for example 12C and 235U. However, other notations, such as carbon-12 and uranium-235, or C-12 and U-235, are also used.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a special case, the three naturally occurring isotopes of the element hydrogen are often specified as H for 1H (protium), D for 2H (deuterium), and T for 3H (tritium). This convention is easier to use in chemical equations, replacing the need to write out the mass number for each atom. For example, the formula for heavy water may be written D2O instead of 2H2O.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly about 4% of the total mass of the universe is made of atoms or ions, and thus represented by chemical elements. This fraction is about 15% of the total matter, with the remainder of the matter (85%) being dark matter. The nature of dark matter is unknown, but it is not composed of atoms of chemical elements because it contains no protons, neutrons, or electrons. (The remaining non-matter part of the mass of the universe is composed of the even more mysterious dark energy).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe universe's 94 naturally occurring chemical elements are thought to have been produced by at least four cosmic processes. Most of the hydrogen, helium and a very small quantity of lithiumin the universe was produced primordially in the first few minutes of the Big Bang. Other three recurrently occurring later processes are thought to have produced the remaining elements. Stellar nucleosynthesis, an ongoing process inside stars, produces all elements from carbon through iron in atomic number, but little lithium, beryllium, or boron. Elements heavier in atomic number than iron, as heavy as uranium and plutonium, are produced by explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovas and other cataclysmic cosmic events. Cosmic ray spallation (fragmentation) of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen is important to the production of lithium, beryllium and boron.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the early phases of the Big Bang, nucleosynthesis of hydrogen nuclei resulted in the production of hydrogen-1 (protium, 1H) and helium-4 (4He), as well as a smaller amount of deuterium (2H) and very minuscule amounts (on the order of 10?10) of lithium and beryllium. Even smaller amounts of boron may have been produced in the Big Bang, since it has been observed in some very old stars, while carbon has not.[21] It is generally agreed that no heavier elements than boron were produced in the Big Bang. As a result, the primordial abundance of atoms (or ions) consisted of roughly 75% 1H, 25% 4He, and 0.01% deuterium, with only tiny traces of lithium, beryllium, and perhaps boron.[22] Subsequent enrichment of galactic halos occurred due to stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis.[23] However, the element abundance in intergalactic space can still closely resemble primordial conditions, unless it has been enriched by some means.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Earth (and elsewhere), trace amounts of various elements continue to be produced from other elements as products of nuclear transmutation processes. These include some produced by cosmic rays or other nuclear reactions (see cosmogenic and nucleogenic nuclides), and others produced as decay products of long-lived primordial nuclides.[24] For example, trace (but detectable) amounts of carbon-14 (14C) are continually produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays impacting nitrogen atoms, and argon-40 (40Ar) is continually produced by the decay of primordially occurring but unstable potassium-40 (40K). Also, three primordially occurring but radioactive actinides, thorium, uranium, and plutonium, decay through a series of recurrently produced but unstable radioactive elements such as radium and radon, which are transiently present in any sample of these metals or their ores or compounds. Three other radioactive elements, technetium, promethium, and neptunium, occur only incidentally in natural materials, produced as individual atoms by nuclear fission of the nuclei of various heavy elements or in other rare nuclear processes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman technology has produced various additional elements beyond these first 94, with those through atomic number 118 now known.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following graph (note log scale) shows the abundance of elements in our Solar System. The table shows the twelve most common elements in our galaxy (estimated spectroscopically), as measured in parts per million, by mass.[25] Nearby galaxies that have evolved along similar lines have a corresponding enrichment of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The more distant galaxies are being viewed as they appeared in the past, so their abundances of elements appear closer to the primordial mixture. As physical laws and processes appear common throughout the visible universe, however, scientist expect that these galaxies evolved elements in similar abundance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe abundance of elements in the Solar System is in keeping with their origin from nucleosynthesis in the Big Bang and a number of progenitor supernova stars. Very abundant hydrogen and helium are products of the Big Bang, but the next three elements are rare since they had little time to form in the Big Bang and are not made in stars (they are, however, produced in small quantities by the breakup of heavier elements in interstellar dust, as a result of impact by cosmic rays). Beginning with carbon, elements are produced in stars by buildup from alpha particles (helium nuclei), resulting in an alternatingly larger abundance of elements with even atomic numbers (these are also more stable). In general, such elements up to iron are made in large stars in the process of becoming supernovas. Iron-56 is particularly common, since it is the most stable element that can easily be made from alpha particles (being a product of decay of radioactive nickel-56, ultimately made from 14 helium nuclei). Elements heavier than iron are made in energy-absorbing processes in large stars, and their abundance in the universe (and on Earth) generally decreases with their atomic number.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe abundance of the chemical elements on Earth varies from air to crust to ocean, and in various types of life. The abundance of elements in Earth's crust differs from that in the Solar system (as seen in the Sun and heavy planets like Jupiter) mainly in selective loss of the very lightest elements (hydrogen and helium) and also volatile neon, carbon (as hydrocarbons), nitrogen and sulfur, as a result of solar heating in the early formation of the solar system. Oxygen, the most abundant Earth element by mass, is retained on Earth by combination with silicon. Aluminum at 8% by mass is more common in the Earth's crust than in the universe and solar system, but the composition of the far more bulky mantle, which has magnesium and iron in place of aluminum (which occurs there only at 2% of mass) more closely mirrors the elemental composition of the solar system, save for the noted loss of volatile elements to space, and loss of iron which has migrated to the Earth's core.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe composition of the human body, by contrast, more closely follows the composition of seawatersave that the human body has additional stores of carbon and nitrogen necessary to form the proteins and nucleic acids, together with phosphorus in the nucleic acids and energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that occurs in the cells of all living organisms. Certain kinds of organisms require particular additional elements, for example the magnesium in chlorophyll in green plants, the calcium in mollusc shells, or the iron in the hemoglobin in vertebrate animals' red blood cells.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of an \\"element\\" as an undivisible substance has developed through three major historical phases: Classical definitions (such as those of the ancient Greeks), chemical definitions, and atomic definitions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAncient philosophy posited a set of classical elements to explain observed patterns in nature. These elements originally referred to earth, water, air and fire rather than the chemical elements of modern science.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term 'elements' (stoicheia) was first used by the Greek philosopher Plato in about 360 BCE in his dialogue Timaeus, which includes a discussion of the composition of inorganic and organic bodies and is a speculative treatise on chemistry. Plato believed the elements introduced a century earlier by Empedocles were composed of small polyhedral forms: tetrahedron (fire), octahedron (air), icosahedron (water), and cube (earth).[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAristotle, c. 350 BCE, also used the term stoicheia and added a fifth element called aether, which formed the heavens. Aristotle defined an element as:\\r\\n\\r\\nElement ÿ one of those bodies into which other bodies can decompose, and that itself is not capable of being divided into other.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1661, Robert Boyle proposed his theory of corpuscularism which favoured the analysis of matter as constituted by irreducible units of matter (atoms) and, choosing to side with neither Aristotle's view of the four elements nor Paracelsus' view of three fundamental elements, left open the question of the number of elements.[29] The first modern list of chemical elements was given in Antoine Lavoisier's 1789 Elements of Chemistry, which contained thirty-three elements, including light and caloric.[30] By 1818, J?ns Jakob Berzelius had determined atomic weights for forty-five of the forty-nine then-accepted elements. Dmitri Mendeleev had sixty-six elements in his periodic table of 1869.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Boyle until the early 20th century, an element was defined as a pure substance that could not be decomposed into any simpler substance.[29] Put another way, a chemical element cannot be transformed into other chemical elements by chemical processes. Elements during this time were generally distinguished by their atomic weights, a property measurable with fair accuracy by available analytical techniques.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1913 discovery by English physicist Henry Moseley that the nuclear charge is the physical basis for an atom's atomic number, further refined when the nature of protons and neutrons became appreciated, eventually led to the current definition of an element based on atomic number (number of protons per atomic nucleus). The use of atomic numbers, rather than atomic weights, to distinguish elements has greater predictive value (since these numbers are integers), and also resolves some ambiguities in the chemistry-based view due to varying properties of isotopes and allotropes within the same element. Currently, IUPAC defines an element to exist if it has isotopes with a lifetime longer than the 10?14 seconds it takes the nucleus to form an electronic cloud.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1914, seventy-two elements were known, all naturally occurring.[32] The remaining naturally occurring elements were discovered or isolated in subsequent decades, and various additional elements have also been produced synthetically, with much of that work pioneered by Glenn T. Seaborg. In 1955, element 101 was discovered and named mendelevium in honor of D.I. Mendeleev, the first to arrange the elements in a periodic manner. Most recently, the synthesis of element 118 was reported in October 2006, and the synthesis of element 117 was reported in April 2010.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nTen materials familiar to various prehistoric cultures are now known to be chemical elements: Carbon, copper, gold, iron, lead, mercury, silver, sulfur, tin, and zinc. Three additional materials now accepted as elements, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth, were recognized as distinct substances prior to 1500 AD. Phosphorus, cobalt, and platinum were isolated before 1750.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the remaining naturally occurring chemical elements were identified and characterized by 1900, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nElements isolated or produced since 1900 include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first transuranium element (element with atomic number greater than 92) discovered was neptunium in 1940. Since 1999 claims for the discovery of new elements have been considered by the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party. As of January 2016, all 118 elements have been confirmed as discovered by IUPAC. The discovery of element 112 was acknowledged in 2009, and the name copernicium and the atomic symbol Cn were suggested for it.[34] The name and symbol were officially endorsed by IUPAC on 19 February 2010.[35] The heaviest element that is believed to have been synthesized to date is element 118, oganesson, on 9 October 2006, by the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna, Russia.[12][36] Tennessine, element 117 was the latest element claimed to be discovered, in 2009.[37] On 28 November 2016, scientists at the IUPAC officially recognized the names for four of the newest chemical elements, with atomic numbers 113, 115, 117, and 118.[38][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following sortable table shows the 118 known chemical elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\n\\r\\nBackground color shows subcategory in the metalÿmetalloidÿnonmetal trend:","input":"How many elements are there in the earth?"},{"output":"more than 2,500 locations","context":"Jimmy John's Franchise, LLC is a franchised sandwich restaurant chain, specializing in delivery.

Paying $200 a month in rent, Liautaud could only afford used equipment consisting of a refrigerator, a chest freezer, an oven, and a meat slicer.[10]\\r\\nThe store was able to realize a profit its first year of business, despite the poor location of the store, due to Jimmy Johns willingness to deliver his sandwiches to the nearby dorms at Eastern Illinois University, as well as his handing out free samples for marketing purposes.[3][8]\\r\\nIn April 1985, Liautaud bought out his father's interest in the business, becoming the sole owner. In 1986, he opened his second store in Macomb, Illinois, and in 1987, he opened a third in Champaign, Illinois.\\r\\nIn 1988, Liautaud met Jamie Coulter, who would later become the CEO of Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon. Coulter mentored Liautaud and taught [him] how to effectively run multiple units.[8]\\r\\nLiautaud continued opening more stores and developed a prototype before beginning franchising in 1994. Franchising continued until 2002 when Liautaud stopped selling franchises for one year to give support for stores that were struggling.[11] The first franchise store opened in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. In 2001, the hundredth Jimmy John's store opened in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. In 2007, the five-hundredth store opened in Seattle, Washington, and in 2010, the thousandth opened in Beaverton, Oregon.[12]\\r\\nAs of March 2017, Jimmy John's has almost 3,000 stores with plans for expansion up to 5,000 and beyond.[13]\\r\\nCNNMoney listed Jimmy Johns as one of ten Great Franchise Bets. The company estimates that annual sales can be as high as $1.2 million while net profits can average at about $280,000. Real estate start-up costs are estimated to be between $305,000 and $485,500.[10]\\r\\nLiautaud realized that in order to grow he would need help acquiring better locations for his stores. Since he had little expertise in real estate, he decided to take on a partner who did. In January 2007, Liautaud sold a 33% stake to Weston Presidio, a San Francisco-based private-equity firm.[14] In the first year after partnering with Weston Presidio, 100 real estate deals were closed.[8]\\r\\nThe company has completed two recapitalizations since Weston Presidio's investment.[15]\\r\\nIn the summer of 2015, pictures of Liautaud posing with big game circulated on social media, leading to increased calls to boycott his restaurants.

Terms of the transaction were not immediately disclosed, though it was later clarified that Liautaud retained 35% ownership of the company as part of the deal.[16] As part of the agreement, the company's founder and largest individual shareholder Jimmy John Liautaud will continue as chairman of the board.[17][18]\\r\\nIn 2010, when the Industrial Workers of the World attempted to unionize ten Minneapolis locations, The New York Times called the effort \\"one of the few efforts to organize fast-food workers in American history.\\"[19]\\r\\nIn October 2014, it was revealed that employees at Jimmy John's, including sandwich makers and delivery drivers, were required to sign non-compete agreements as a condition of employment.[20][21] The agreement restricted the employee from working for a competitor for two years, where a competitor was defined as a business which derives more than ten percent of its revenue from selling sandwiches and is located within three miles of any Jimmy John's. Additionally, the employee could not work for another Jimmy John's franchisee for a year.[22] Jimmy Johns has since settled lawsuits filed by the Attorneys General of New York & Illinois on this matter. In statements, the company clarified that it had taken steps to remove noncompete agreements from their new hire paperwork long before they were contacted by the Attorneys General, and that Enforcement of noncompete agreements against our own hourly store employees is not a part of Jimmy Johns culture or business model.[23]\\r\\nJimmy John's was named #1 on the Entrepreneur 2016 Franchise 500.[24] In 2014, YouGov BrandIndex ranked restaurant chains that have the highest millennial brand loyalty, and Jimmy John's topped the ranking with 83% of the vote based on restaurants they would consider going to again.[25] Jimmy John's was named the #2 Most Popular Restaurant for Business Meals by expense reporting program Certify.[26] In 2015, Entrepreneur.com named Jimmy John's one of the 10 Promising Franchises for Ambitious Entrepreneurs.[27] In March 2017, Jimmy John's won Franchise Times' \\"Deal of the Year\\" for attracting Roark Capital Group as the company's new majority owner.

It was brought to an end with the Treaty of London, negotiated in 1604 between representatives of the new King of Spain, Philip III, and the new King of England, James I. England and Spain agreed to cease their military interventions in the Spanish Netherlands and Ireland, respectively, and the English ended high seas privateering.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1560s, Philip II of Spain was faced with increasing religious disturbances as Protestantism gained adherents in his domains in the Low Countries. As a defender of the Catholic Church, he sought to suppress the rising Protestant heresy in his territories, which eventually exploded into open rebellion in 1566.  Meanwhile, relations with the regime of Elizabeth I of England continued to deteriorate, following her restoration of royal supremacy over the Church of England through the Act of Supremacy in 1559; this had been first instituted by her father Henry VIII and rescinded by her sister Mary I. The Act was considered by Catholics as a usurpation of papal authority.  Calls by leading English Protestants to support the Protestant Dutch rebels against Philip increased tensions further as did the Catholic-Protestant disturbances in France, which saw both sides supporting the opposing French factions.\\r\\n\\r\\nComplicating matters were commercial disputes. The activities of English sailors, begun by Sir John Hawkins in 1562, gained the tacit support of Elizabeth, even though the Spanish government complained that Hawkins's trade with their colonies in the West Indies constituted smuggling. In September 1568, a slaving expedition led by Hawkins and Sir Francis Drake was surprised by the Spanish, and several ships were captured or sunk at the Battle of San Juan de Ul~a near Veracruz in New Spain. This engagement soured Anglo-Spanish relations and in the following year the English detained several treasure ships sent by the Spanish to supply their army in the Netherlands. Drake and Hawkins intensified their privateering as a way to break the Spanish monopoly on Atlantic trade. Francis Drake went on a privateering voyage where he eventually circumnavigated the globe between 1577 and 1580. Spanish colonial ports were plundered and a number of ships were captured including the treasure galleon Nuestra Se?ora de la Concepci܇n. When news of his exploits reached Europe, Elizabeth's relations with Philip continued to deteriorate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580, English support was provided to Prior of Crato who then fought in his struggle with Philip II for the Portuguese throne. Philip in return began to support the Catholic rebellion in Ireland against Elizabeth's religious reforms. Both Philip's and Elizabeth's attempts to support opposing factions were defeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1584, Philip signed the Treaty of Joinville with the Catholic League of France to stop the rise of Protestantism there. In the Spanish Netherlands, England had secretly supported the side of the Dutch Protestant United Provinces, who were fighting for independence from Spain. In 1584, the Prince of Orange had been assassinated, leaving a sense of alarm as well as a political vacuum. The following year was a further blow to the Dutch with the capture of Antwerp by Spanish forces led by Alexander Farnese, the Duke of Parma. The Dutch rebels sought help from England, which Elizabeth agreed to as she feared that a Spanish reconquest there would threaten England.[3] The Treaty of Nonsuch was signed as a result ÿ Elizabeth agreed to provide the Dutch with men, horses, and subsidies but she declined overall sovereignty. In return the Dutch handed over four Cautionary Towns which were garrisoned by English troops. Philip took this to be an open declaration of war against his rule in the Netherlands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Anglo-Spanish War broke out in 1585, following the seizure of English merchant ships in Spanish harbors. In response the English privy council immediately authorised a campaign against the Spanish fishing industry in Newfoundland and off the Grand Banks.[4] The campaign was a huge success, and subsequently led to England's first sustained activity in the Americas.[5] In August, England joined the Eighty Years' War on the side of the Dutch Protestant United Provinces, who had declared their independence from Spain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen through Francis Walsingham ordered Sir Francis Drake to lead an expedition to attack the Spanish New World in a kind of preemptive strike. Drake sailed in October to the West Indies, and in January 1586 captured and sacked Santo Domingo. The following month they did the same at Cartagena de Indias and in May sailed North to raid St. Augustine in Florida. When Drake arrived in England in July he became a national hero. In Spain however, the news was a disaster and this now further buoyed a Spanish invasion of England by King Philip.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Dudley, The Earl of Leicester was sent to the United Provinces in 1585 with a dignitary party and took the offer of Governor of the United Provinces. This however was met with fury from Elizabeth who had expressed no desire for any sovereignty over the Dutch. An English mercenary army had been present since the beginning of the war and was then under the command of veteran Sir John Norreys. They combined forces but were undermanned and under financed, and faced one of the most powerful armies in Europe led by the famed Alexander Farnese, the Duke of Parma.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the siege of Grave the following year Dudley attempted its relief but the Dutch garrison commander Hadewij van Hemert surrendered the town to the Spanish. Dudley was furious on hearing of Grave's sudden loss and had van Hemert executed, which shocked the Dutch.[8] The English force then had some successes - taking Axel in July and Doesburg the following month. Dudleys poor diplomacy with the Dutch however made matters worse. His political base weakened and so too did the military situation.[9] Outside Zutphen an English force was defeated in which notable poet Philip Sidney was mortally wounded, which was a huge blow to English morale. Zutphen itself and Deventer were betrayed by catholic turncoats William Stanley and Rowland York which further damaged Leicester's reputation. Finally Sluis with a largely English garrison was besieged and taken by the Duke of Parma in June 1587 after the Dutch refused to help in the relief. This resulted in mutual recriminations between Leicester and the States.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeicester soon realised how dire his situation was and then asked to be recalled. He resigned his post as Governor - his tenure was a military and political failure, and as a result he was financially ruined.[11] After Leicester's departure, the Dutch elected the Prince of Orange's son Count Maurice of Nassau as the Stadtholder and Governor. At the same time Peregrine Bertie took over English forces in the Netherlands.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 February 1587, the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots outraged Catholics in Europe, and her claim on the English throne passed (by her own deed of will) to Philip. In retaliation for the execution of Mary, Philip vowed to invade England to place a Catholic monarch on its throne. In April 1587 Philip's preparations suffered a setback when Francis Drake burned 37 Spanish ships in the harbour of Cdiz, and as a result the invasion of England had to be postponed for over a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 29 July, Philip obtained Papal authority to overthrow Elizabeth, who had been excommunicated by Pope Pius V, and place whomever he chose on the throne of England. He assembled a fleet of about 130 ships, containing 8,000 soldiers and 18,000 sailors. To finance this endeavour, Pope Sixtus V had permitted Philip to collect crusade taxes. Sixtus had promised a further subsidy to the Spanish should they reach English soil.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 28 May 1588, the Armada under the command of Duke of Medina Sidonia set sail for the Netherlands, where it was to pick up additional troops for the invasion of England. As the armada sailed through the English channel, the English navy led by Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham and Francis Drake fought a battle of attrition with the Spanish from Plymouth to Portland and then to the Solent, preventing them from securing any English harbours.[13] The Spanish were forced to withdraw to Calais. While the Spanish were at anchor there in a crescent-shaped defensive formation, the English used fireships to break the formation and scatter the Spanish ships. In the subsequent Battle of Gravelines the English navy inflicted a defeat on the Armada and forced it to sail northward in more dangerous stormy waters on the long way home. As they sailed around Scotland, the Armada suffered severe damage and loss of life from stormy weather. As they approached the West coast of Ireland more damaging stormy conditions forced ships ashore while others were wrecked. Disease took a heavy toll as the fleet finally limped back to port.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilip's invasion plans had miscarried partly because of unfortunate weather and his own mismanagement, and partly because of the opportunistic defensive naval efforts of the English and their Dutch allies prevailed. The defeat of the Armada provided valuable seafaring experience for English oceanic mariners. While the English were able to persist in their privateering against the Spanish and continue sending troops to assist Philip II's enemies in the Netherlands and France, these efforts brought few tangible rewards.[15] One of the most important effects of the event was that the Armada's failure was seen as a sign that God supported the Protestant Reformation in England. One of the medals struck to celebrate the English victory bore the Latin/Hebrew inscription Flavit ???? et Dissipati Sunt (literally: \\"Yahweh blew and they were scattered\\"; traditionally translated more freely as: \\"He blew with His winds, and they were scattered\\".)\\r\\n\\r\\nAn English counter armada under the command of Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Norreys was prepared in 1589 to torch the Spanish Atlantic navy, which was refitting in Santander, Corunna and San Sebastin in northern Spain. It was also intended to capture the incoming Spanish treasure fleet and expel the Spanish from Portugal (ruled by Philip since 1580) in favour of the Prior of Crato. The English fleet departed from?Plymouth?on?April 13 but was then delayed for nearly two weeks by bad weather. Drake as a result had to bypass Santander where the majority of the Spanish fleet were being refitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 4, the English force eventually arrived at Corunna where the lower town was captured and plundered, and a number of merchant ships were seized. Norreys then won a modest victory over a Spanish relief militia force at Puente del Burgo. When the English pressed the attack on the citadel, however, they were repulsed. In addition a number of English ships were captured by Spanish naval forces. With the failure to capture Corunna the English departed and headed towards Lisbon, but owing to poor organisation and lack of co-ordination (they had very few siege guns) the invading force also failed to take Lisbon. The expected uprising by the Portuguese loyal to Crato never materialised. With Portuguese and Spanish reinforcements arriving the English retreated and headed North where Drake sacked and burned Vigo. Sickness then struck the expedition, and finally a portion of the fleet led by Drake headed towards the Azores, which was then scattered in a storm. Drake then took the best part of the fleet and plundered Porto Santo in Madeira before they limped back to Plymouth.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English Armada was arguably misconceived and ended in failure overall. In the end, Elizabeth sustained a severe loss to her treasury.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after the defeat of the Armada, the Duke of Parma's force stood down from the invasion. In the autumn Parma moved his force North towards Bergen op Zoom and then attempted to besiege the English-held town with a substantial force. The English in a ruse however managed to repel the Spanish and forced Parma's retreat with heavy losses which boosted both Dutch and English morale.[17] The following year Bertie under orders from the Queen left for France with a force to help the Protestants in their fight against the Catholic League. Sir Francis Vere assumed command of English forces thereafter - a position he retained during fifteen campaigns, with almost unbroken success.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1590 an Anglo-Dutch force under Maurice and Vere respectively launched a campaign with the aim of taking Breda. In a remarkable feat a small assault force hid in a peat barge before a successful surprise assault that captured the city. With Spanish forces in France supporting the Catholic League as well as in the Low Countries, Maurice was able to take advantage, and thus started the gradual recapture of the Netherlands. This was known by the Dutch as the 'Ten glory years'. Soon after Breda the Anglo-Dutch  retook Zutphen and Deventer which restored English prestige after their earlier betrayals. After defeating the Spanish under the Duke of Parma at Knodsenberg in 1591 a new confidence in the army took shape. English troops by this time composed nearly half of the Dutch army. The reconquest continued with Hulst, Nijmegen, Geertruidenberg, Steenwijk and Coevorden all being taken within the next two years.[18] In 1593 a Spanish attempt led by Francisco Verdugo to recapture Coevorden ended in failure when the Anglo-Dutch under Maurice and Vere relieved the place during the Spring of 1594. Finally the capture of Groningen in the summer of 1594 resulted in the Spanish army being forced out of the Northern provinces which led to the complete restoration of the seven provinces.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter these successes Elizabeth could view the high confidence in the army and renewed the treaty with the States in 1595. English troops having been given high praise by the Dutch were kept at around 4,000 men. They were to be paid for by the States and the Queen would also be repaid on the Crowns expenses in instalments until a conclusion of peace was made.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1595, Maurice's campaign was resumed to retake the cities of the Twente region from the Spanish. This was delayed after Huy was besieged in March but Maurice was unable to prevent its fall. When Maurice did go on the offensive an attempt to take Grol in July ended in failure when a Spanish force under a 90 year old veteran Crist܇bal de Mondrag܇n relieved the city. Maurice then tried to make an attempt on the city of Rheinberg in September but Mondragon defeated this move at the Battle of the Lippe. Maurice was then forced to cancel further planned offensives as the bulk of his English and Scots troops were withdrawn to take part in the attack on Cadiz. The Spanish under the new commander Archduke of Austria took advantage of this lull and recaptured Hulst the following year which led to a prolonged stalemate in the campaign and delayed the reconquest.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this period of respite, the Spanish were able to refit and retool their navy, partly along English lines. The pride of the fleet were named The Twelve Apostles ÿ twelve massive new galleons ÿ and the navy proved itself to be far more effective than it had been before 1588. A sophisticated convoy system and improved intelligence networks frustrated English naval attempts on the Spanish treasure fleet during the 1590s. This was best demonstrated by the repulse of the squadron that was led by Effingham in 1591 near the Azores, who had intended to ambush the treasure fleet. It was in this battle that the Spanish captured the English flagship, the Revenge, after a stubborn resistance by its captain, Sir Richard Grenville. Throughout the 1590s, enormous convoy escorts enabled the Spanish to ship three times as much silver as in the previous decade.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish merchant privateers or corsairs known as Elizabeth's Sea dogs however enjoyed more qualified success.[20] In the three years after the Spanish armada more than 300 prizes were taken from the Spanish with a declared total value of well over S400,000.[21] English courtiers provided money for their own expeditions as well as others, and even Elizabeth herself would make investments. The Earl of Cumberland made a number of expeditions and a few did yield profit - his first being the Azores Voyage in 1589. Others failed however due to bad weather and his 1591 voyage ended in defeat with Spanish galleys off Berlengas. Cumberland with Sir Walter Raleigh and Martin Frobisher combined financial strength and force that led to the most successful English naval expedition of the war. Off Flores island in 1592 in a naval battle the English fleet captured a large rich Portuguese carrack, the Madre de Deus as well as having outwitted a Spanish fleet led by Alonso de Bazn. The expedition's reward equalled nearly half the size of the Kingdom of England's royal annual revenue and yielded Elizabeth a 20-fold return on her investment.[22] These riches gave the English an excited enthusiasm to engage in this opulent commerce.[23] Raleigh himself in 1595 went on an expedition to explore the Orinoco river in an attempt to find the mythical city of El Dorado in the process the English plundered the Spanish settlement of Trinidad. Raleigh however exaggerated the wealth there on his return to England. Supporting Raleigh with his expedition was another led by Amyas Preston and George Somers known as the Preston Somers expedition to South America notable for a daring overland assault that saw the capture of Caracas.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the expeditions were financed by famed London merchants, the most notable of these being John Watts. An expedition Watts financed to Portuguese Brazil led by James Lancaster saw the capture and plunder of Recife and Olinda - which was highly profitable for both.[24] In response to English privateering against their merchantmen, the Spanish monarchy struck back with the Dunkirkers devastating English shipping and fishing in the largely undefended seas around England.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy far the most successful English privateer was Christopher Newport who was backed financially by Watts.[25] Newport set out in 1590 to raid the Spanish West Indies and in the ensuing fight saw the defeat of an armed Spanish convoy but Newport lost his right arm in the process. Despite this Newport continued the ventures - the blockade of Western Cuba in 1591 was the most successful English privateering venture made during the war.[26] Both Drake and Hawkins died of disease on the later 1595ÿ96 expedition against Puerto Rico, Panama, and other targets in the Spanish Main, a severe setback in which the English suffered heavy losses in soldiers and ships despite a number of minor military victories.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1595, a Spanish force on patrol from Brittany, led by Carlos de Amsquita, landed at and raided Cornwall, burning Penzance and several nearby villages.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the summer of 1596, an Anglo-Dutch expedition under Elizabeth's young favourite, the Earl of Essex, sacked Cdiz, causing significant loss to the Spanish fleet, leaving the city in ruins and delaying a projected descent on England. The allies were unable to capture the treasure, as the Spanish commander had time to torch the treasure ships in port, sending the treasure to the bottom of the harbour, from where it was later recovered. Despite its failure to capture the treasure fleet, the sack of Cdiz was celebrated as a national triumph comparable to the victory over the Spanish Armada, and for a time Essex's prestige rivalled Elizabeth's own.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Crown instead of controlling and taxing its subjects, competed with them for private profit, a race it failed to win, as the great naval expeditions were on the whole unprofitable.[28] The last of the great English naval expeditions took place in 1597, led by the Earl of Essex known as the Islands Voyage. The objective was to destroy the Spanish fleet and intercept a treasure fleet in the Azores. Neither was achieved and the expedition ended in failure, and Essex on his return was scolded by the Queen for not protecting the English coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the final years of the war, English privateering continued despite the strengthening of Spanish navy convoys ÿ Cumberland's last expedition in 1598 to the Caribbean led to the capture of San Juan, and had succeeded where Drake had failed. Newport struck at Tobasco in 1599 while William Parker successfully raided Portobello in 1601.[29] Finally in 1603 Christopher Cleeve struck at Santiago de Cuba and in the last raid of the war Newport plundered Puerto Caballos.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the war English privateering had devastated the Spanish private merchant marine.[31] The most famous pirates lauded by English literature and propaganda tended to attack fishing vessels or boats with small value for the Spanish crown.[32] Spanish prizes though were taken at an attritional rate; nearly 1,000 were captured by the wars end, and there was on average a declared value of approximately S100,000-S200,000 for every year of the war.[33] In addition for every Spanish prize brought back, another was either burned or scuttled, and the presence of so many English corsairs even deterred Spanish merchantman from putting to sea.[34] This all later resulted in Spanish and Portuguese commerce being carried on Dutch and English ships which in itself created competition.[21] Nevertheless throughout the war Spains important treasure fleets had been kept safe by their convoy system.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1597, Spanish bankruptcy and the war in France gave the Anglo-Dutch an advantage. At the Battle of Turnout a Spanish force was surprised and routed - Vere and Sir Robert Sydney distinguished themselves particularly. With the Spanish distracted by the siege of Amiens in France Maurice launched an offensive in the summer. This time both Rhienberg and Greonlo were finally taken. This was followed by the capture of Bredevoort, Enschede, Ootsmarsum, Oldenzaal and finally Lingen by the end of the year. The offensive success meant that most of the Republic had been recaptured and a significant barrier had been created along the Rhine river.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1598, the Spanish under Francisco Mendoza retook Rheinberg and Meurs in a campaign known as the Spanish winter of 1598-99. Mendoza then attempted to take Bommelerwaard island but the Dutch and English under Maurice thwarted the attempt and defeated him at Zaltbommel. Mendoza retreated from the area and the defeat resulted in chaos in the Spanish army - mutinies took place and many deserted. The following year the Dutch senate led by Johan van Oldenbarneveldt saw the chaos in the Spanish army and decided the time was ripe for a focal point of the war to be concentrated in Catholic Flanders. Despite a bitter dispute between Maurice and van Oldenbarneveldt, the Dutch and a sizeable contingent of the English Army under Francis Vere reluctantly agreed. They used Ostend (still in Dutch hands) as a base to invade Flanders. Their aim was to conquer the privateer stronghold city of Dunkirk. In 1600 they advanced toward Dunkirk and in a pitched battle the Anglo-Dutch inflicted a rare defeat on the Tercio led Spanish army at the Battle of Nieuwpoort in which the English played a major part.[36] Dunkirk was never attempted however as disputes in the Dutch command meant that taking Spanish occupied cities in the rest of the Republic took priority. Maurice's force thus withdrew leaving Vere to command Ostend in the face of an imminent Spanish siege.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the siege of Ostend under way, Maurice then went on the offensive on the Rhine frontier in the summer of 1600.  Rheinberg and Meurs were thus retaken from the Spanish yet again, although an attempt on s'Hertogenbosch failed during the winter months. At Ostend in January 1602 after being reinforced, Vere faced a huge Spanish assault organised by the Archduke and in bitter fighting this was repelled with heavy losses. Vere left the city soon after and joined Maurice in the field, while Albert was replaced Ambrogio Spinola. The siege there dragged on for another two years as the Spanish attempted to take Ostend's strongpoints in a costly war of attrition. Around the same time Maurice continued ÿ his campaign Grave was retaken but Vere was severely wounded during the siege. An attempt by the Dutch and English to relieve Ostend took place in mid 1604 but the inland of port of Sluis was besieged and captured instead. Soon after the Ostend garrison finally surrendered, after  a siege of nearly four years and costing thousands of lives ÿ for the Spanish it was a pyrrhic victory.[38][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nNormandy added a new front in the war and the threat of another invasion attempt across the channel. In 1590, the Spanish landed a considerable force in Brittany to assist the French Catholic League, expelling the English and Huguenot forces from much of the area. Henry IV's conversion to Catholicism in 1593 won him widespread French support for his claim to the throne, particularly in Paris (where he was crowned the following year), a city that he had unsuccessfully besieged in 1590. However, in 1594 Anglo-French forces were able to end Spanish hopes of using the large port of Brest as a launching point for an invasion of England by capturing Fort Crozon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French civil war turned increasingly against the hardliners of the French Catholic League. With the signing of the Triple Alliance in 1596 between France, England and the Dutch, Elizabeth sent a further 2,000 troops to France after the Spanish took Calais. In September 1597 Anglo-French forces under Henry retook Amiens, just six months after the Spanish took the city, bringing to a halt a string of Spanish victories. The first tentative talks on peace had already begun before the battle. The League hardliners started to lose  ground and popular support throughout France to a resurgent Henry. In addition Spanish finances were at breaking point because of fighting wars in France, the Netherlands and against England. Therefore, a deeply ill Philip decided to end his support for the League and to finally recognize the legitimacy of Henry's accession to the French throne. Without Spanish support the last League hardliners were quickly defeated. In May 1598, the two kings signed the Peace of Vervins ending the last of the religious civil wars and the Spanish intervention with it.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1594, the Nine Years' War in Ireland had begun, when Ulster lords Hugh O'Neill and Red Hugh O'Donnell rose up against English rule with fitful Spanish support, mirroring the English support of the Dutch rebellion. While English forces were containing the rebels in Ireland at great cost in men, general suffering and finance, the Spanish attempted two further armadas, in 1596 and 1597: the first was shattered in a storm off northern Spain, and the second was frustrated by adverse weather as it approached the English coast. King Philip II died in 1598, and his successor Philip III continued the war but was less determined.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of 1601, a final armada was sent north, this time a limited expedition intended to land troops in southern Ireland to assist the rebels. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the Battle of Kinsale. Rather than attempt to hold Kinsale as a base to harry English shipping, the Spanish accepted terms of surrender and returned home, while the Irish rebels hung on, surrendering in 1603, just after Elizabeth died.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new king of England, James I, was the Protestant son and successor to the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, whose execution had been a proximate cause of the war. James regarded himself as the peacemaker of Europe, and the ultimate aim of his idealistic foreign policy was the reunion of Christendom.[41] Therefore, when James came to the English throne, his first order of business was to negotiate a peace with Philip III of Spain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the end of the war in France the new King of Spain Philip III sought peace with England. By 1598 the war had become long and costly for Spain. England and Dutch republic too were war weary and both sides felt the need for peace.[42] At the peace of Boulogne in 1600 however Spanish demands were adamantly rejected by the English and Dutch. Nevertheless, diplomatic routes were open between the Archduke of Austria and his wife  Infanta Isabella (Philip's sister) who differed in their policies to Philip's. Philip wanted to preserve the hegemony of the Spanish empire, whilst the Archduke and Isabella sought peace and friendly relations.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after victory in Ireland the following year the English navy under Richard Leveson conducted a blockade of Spain; the first of its kind. Off Portugal they sailed into Sesimbra bay where a fleet of eight Spanish galleys under Federico Spinola (brother of Ambrogio) and lvaro de Bazn were present.[44] Spinola had already established his base at Sluis in Flanders, and was gathering more with an intent on a potential strike against England. In June 1602 Leveson defeated the Spanish which resulted in two galleys sunk and the capture of a rich Portuguese carrack. Months later in the English channel Spinola's galley fleet gathered more galleys and sailed through the English channel once more but was defeated again by an Anglo-Dutch naval squadron off the Dover straits. The result of this action forced the Spanish to cease further naval operations against England for the remainder of the war.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe treaty restored the status quo ante bellum, and the terms of the treaty were favourable both to Spain and England.[1][46] For Spain the treaty secured her position as a leading power in the world.[47][48] Spain's upgrading of the convoy system had allowed it to defend its treasure fleets and retain its New World colonies. English support for the Dutch rebellion against the Spanish king, the original cause of the war, had ended. The Spanish would then concentrate their efforts on the Dutch in order to bring them to their knees with a knockout blow.[46][49] A complete abandonment of the Dutch cause however was not promised in the treaty.[49] The English held cautionary towns in Holland on the other hand were not surrendered despite Spanish demands.[50] The sieges of Ostend and Sluis were allowed to continue until the end of those respective campaigns.[51] The Dutch by 1607 had in fact prevailed - the Spanish did not deliver their knock out blow they had hoped for; the Twelve Year Truce formally recognized the independence of the Republic.[52][53]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor England the treaty made sure the Protestant reformation there had been protected, and James and his ministers refused the Spanish demand for Catholic toleration in England.[49] After the defeat at Kinsale in 1602, the Treaty of Mellifont was concluded the following year between James I and the Irish rebels. In the subsequent London treaty Spain pledged not to support the rebels.[50] English public opinion however showed that the peace treaty was highly unpopular and many considered it a \\"humiliating peace\\".[54][55][56] Many felt that the King had abandoned the Netherlands, their old ally, in order to appease the Spanish Crown and relations with James's subjects were strained in the following years.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe agreement was well received in Spain.[58][59] Big public celebrations were held at Valladolid, the Spanish capital,[60][61] where the treaty was ratified in June 1605, in the presence of a large English ambassadorial delegation led by Lord Admiral Charles Howard.[58] Some members of the Catholic clergy however questioned Philip III's arrangements with a \\"heretical power\\".[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe provisions of the treaty authorised merchants and warships of both nations to operate from each other's respective ports. English trade with the Spanish Netherlands (notably the city of Antwerp) and the Iberian peninsula was resumed.[49] Spanish warships and privateers were able to use English ports as naval bases to attack Dutch shipping[63] or to ferry troops to Flanders.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe war had also diverted Tudor colonial efforts,[65] but the English who had invested in privateering expeditions during the war garnered enormous windfall profits leaving them well placed to finance new ventures.[33] As a result the London Company were able to establish a settlement in Virginia in 1607.[66] The establishment of the East India Company in 1600, was significant for the growth of England (and later Great Britain) as a colonial power.[67] A factory was established at Banten, Java, in 1603 while the Company had successfully and profitably breached the Spanish and Portuguese monopoly.[68][69] While the incipient illegal trade with the Spanish colonies was brought to an end, there was deadlock over English demands for the right to trade in the East and West Indies, which Spain adamantly opposed. Eventually the complications resulted in the treaty avoiding any mention of the matter.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Spain there was hope that England would eventually secure tolerance for Catholics but the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 however destroyed any possibility of this.[70] As a result it put to rest Protestant fears that a peace with Spain would ultimately mean an invasion by Jesuits and Catholic sympathisers as the Elizabethan Recusancy laws were rigidly enforced by parliament.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nEngland and Spain remained at peace until 1625.","input":"When did england go to war with spain?"},{"output":"July 1994","context":"The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, also known as Tower of Terror, is an accelerated drop tower dark ride located at Disney's Hollywood Studios, Tokyo DisneySea, Walt Disney Studios Park, and formerly located at Disney California Adventure Park.

The Tokyo version, which features an original story line not related to The Twilight Zone, takes place in the fictional Hotel Hightower. All three versions place riders in a seemingly ordinary hotel elevator, and present the riders with a fictional backstory in which people have mysteriously disappeared from the elevator under the influence of some supernatural element many years previously.\\r\\nThe original version of the attraction opened at Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World in July 1994, and was the basis of the 1997 television film of the same name, several scenes of which were shot at the attraction. A decade later, Disney began plans to add similar versions of the attraction to their newest parks at the Disneyland Resort in California, Tokyo Disney Resort in Japan, and Disneyland Paris. In California and Paris, Disney sought to use the popular attraction to boost attendance at the respective resorts' struggling new theme parks. The California and Tokyo versions of Tower of Terror opened in 2004[8] and 2006,[9] respectively, while financial problems delayed the opening of the Paris version until 2008.[10] The California version closed in January 2017.[3]\\r\\nThe Tower of Terror buildings are among the tallest structures found at their respective Disney resorts. At 199 feet (60.7?m), the Florida version is the second tallest attraction at the Walt Disney World Resort, with only Expedition Everest 199.5 feet (60.8?m) being taller. At the Disneyland Resort, the 183-foot (55.8?m) structure (which now houses Guardians of the Galaxy ÿ Mission: Breakout!) is the tallest building at the resort, as well as one of the tallest buildings in Anaheim.[11] At Disneyland Paris, it is the second tallest attraction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the American and European versions of the attraction, guests make their way to the Hollywood Tower Hotel through the front gate. Guests then walk along a cracked, curved pathway that leads to the hotel. The pathway goes past overgrown gardens, signs pointing to the stables, a bowling green, tennis courts, swimming pools, and a vine-covered pavilion. In most parks, 1930s jazz music plays in the queue area.\\r\\nEntering through the hotel's front doors, guests encounter an interior designed to give the impression that the Hollywood Tower Hotel has been left untouched since the night of its closure. The lobby is covered in dust and draped with cobwebs, and throughout there are other signs of the hotel's abrupt closure. Past the front desk, the main elevators are in a dilapidated state, and a sign reads \\"Out of Order\\". Guests are informed by bellhops that their rooms are not ready yet, and they are then ushered into the hotel library, which houses the hotel's collection of books, antiques, an old television set, and various pieces of Twilight Zone memorabilia scattered about the room. Through the library window, guests can observe a severe thunderstorm raging outside.\\r\\nWith a crash of thunder and lightning, the power suddenly goes out, except for the television set which crackles into life and plays the opening sequence from the fourth and fifth seasons of The Twilight Zone, hosted by Rod Serling. The episode goes on to depict the events of a stormy night in 1939 when a lightning bolt struck the tower and caused five peoplea celebrity couple, a rising child star, her nanny, and a hotel bellhopto vanish from the elevator. The television then turns off and the guests are directed through to the boiler room, where they await the maintenance service elevator's arrival.\\r\\nIn the late 1980s, a second phase of development was being designed for Disneyland Paris (then Euro Disney). Included was a free-fall type ride in Frontierland that was to be named Geyser Mountain. It would have been part roller coaster, part free-fall ride that shot guests up a vertical shaft. The plan was scrapped, but was picked up by Disney's Hollywood Studios (then Disney-MGM Studios) as part of a massive expansion to their U.S. park. Several attractions had already been proposed, including \\"Dick Tracy's Crimestoppers\\", which would be later made into Indiana Jones Adventure at Disneyland. Still needing a major \\"E-ticket\\" attraction, the idea of a drop-shaft ride came up and was chosen.[12] There had been several proposed ideas for haunted attractions, including a ride based on Stephen King's novels, a Vincent Price ghost tour, a Mel Brooks-narrated ride, a real hotel, and a whodunit murder mystery, but none progressed into development.[13]\\r\\nWalt Disney Imagineering eventually took inspiration from Rod Serling's anthology stories featured in The Twilight Zone, as a foundation for their original story. Imagineers mused that the attraction would be able to take guests into the Fifth Dimension that Serling always described as unlocking in every episode of the series. With the project in firm development, Disney licensed the rights to use The Twilight Zone intellectual property from CBS Inc.[14] The Imagineering team settled on a 1930s-era Hollywood hotel with a Twilight Zone theme, but a new ride system had to be built, which would allow both more capacity inside the ride and make the drop fast. Otis Elevator Company created the vertical ride system, and Eaton-Kenway a ride vehicle that could drive itself horizontally.[12] Joe Dante directed the ride's short preshow film.[15] The archival footage of Rod Serling used in the preshow was taken from the episode, \\"It's a Good Life\\".[16] Mark Silverman provided the voice for Serling in the attraction; Serling's wife, Carol Serling, approved the casting of Silverman after several auditions.[7]\\r\\nSite-clearing and prep began early 1992. A sinkhole led to the site's being moved slightly. The tower's interior and exterior design took inspiration from existing Southern California landmarks, including the Biltmore Hotel and Mission Inn.[7] The distinctive Spanish Colonial Revival architectural features on and around the attraction's roof were designed so that the rear facade, which is visible from Epcot, would blend seamlessly with the skyline of the Morocco Pavilion in Epcot's World Showcase Lagoon.[17] After construction ended, the ride was set to open on July 4, 1994; but the Tower of Terror opened on July 22, 1994, along with the Sunset Boulevard thoroughfare.[12]\\r\\nThe ride system of The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror at Disney's Hollywood Studios employs specialized technology developed by Walt Disney Imagineering, particularly the ability to move the vehicle in and out of the vertical motion shaft. The elevator cabs are self-propelled automated ride vehicles, also known as automated guided vehicles, which lock into separate vertical motion cabs. The cabs can move into and out of elevators horizontally, move through the \\"Fifth Dimension\\" scene, and on to the drop shaft.\\r\\nIn order to achieve the weightless effect the Imagineers desired, cables attached to the bottom of the elevator car pull it down at a speed slightly faster than what a free fall would provide. Two enormous motors are located at the top of the tower, measuring 12 feet (3.7?m) tall, 35 feet (11?m) long, and weighing 132,000 pounds (60,000?kg). They are able to accelerate 10 short tons (9.1?t) at 15 times the speed of normal elevators. They generate 275 times the torque of a Corvette engine, reaching top speed in 1.5 second. The ride's slogan, \\"Never the Same Fear Twice!\\", refers to the drop pattern being randomly selected by a computer before the ride begins. The drop reaches a top speed of 39 miles per hour (63?km/h).[18]\\r\\nAfter the elevator cab has completed the ride, it propels itself to the unload dock and then back to the show shaft. The Florida ride runs on a unique loop system different from the versions used in California, Paris and Tokyo.\\r\\nIn this version of the attraction, Rod Serling's voice greets passengers the moment the elevator doors close, saying:\\r\\nThe elevator rises for a few seconds before coming to its first stop. The doors open to reveal a long, dimly lit hotel corridor, with overgrown plants and doors to guest rooms, with morning newspapers and room-service trays outside, along its length. There is a single window at the opposite end of the corridor. A violent thunderstorm is raging and lightning flashes outside the window. The five missing passengers from 1939 appear for several moments, turning to face the elevator and beckoning the guests to join them. Then they disappear in a burst of electricity. The corridor fades away, but the window remains until it appears to be floating in a dark field of stars. The window morphs into the window from the Season 5 opening sequence, and breaks.\\r\\nThe elevator doors close and the car continues its ascent. Serling's narration goes on, saying:\\r\\nThe elevator stops once more. The doors open to what at first looks like a maintenance room, but slowly transforms into a field of stars. The elevator car emerges horizontally from the lift shaft and enters a section of the ride called \\"The Fifth Dimension\\", which is a collection of sights and sounds and star fields, again in the style of the television show's opening sequence. A rendition of The Twilight Zone theme plays throughout. The scene ends as the elevator reaches another star field which splits and opens much like elevator doors. The elevator enters another vertical shaft, this one pitch black. Serling's voice is heard again, saying:\\r\\nOn the last word of Serling's narration, the elevator starts its drop sequence. Rather than a simple gravity-powered drop, however, the elevator is pulled downwards, causing most riders to rise off their seats, held down by a seat belt. At least once during the drop sequence, wide elevator doors in front of the riders open to reveal a view of the park from a height of 157?ft (48?m), however the drop is only 130?ft (40?m), the height of a 13-story building. The elevator drops at a top speed of 39 miles per hour (63?km/h). In the Hollywood Studios version, the back of the \\"Hollywood Tower Hotel\\" sign partially obstructs the view (the on-ride camera is located here, recording the ride for video or a photograph to be purchased later).\\r\\nRandomized patterns of drops and lifts have been added, where the ride vehicle will drop or rise various distances at different intervals. Other added effects include projected images of the breaking window, wind effects, lightning flashes, and ominous blue-lit figures of the five ghostly original riders. These changes were made so that each trip on The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror is a slightly different experience. The ride system was reprogrammed,[when?] in its fourth conversion,[vague] so that the ride allows for any numberTemplate:Exaggeration of randomized drops and lifts. When guests enter the drop shaft, a computer randomly chooses one of four drop profiles, one of which is a modified version of the ride's third incarnation.[vague][19] Regardless of the number of randomized drops and lifts, each drop sequence always features one \\"faux drop\\" meant to startle the riders, and one complete drop through the entire tower at the top speed of 39 miles per hour (63?km/h).\\r\\nAfter a series of these drops have been made, the elevator returns to the basement of the decrepit Hollywood Tower Hotel, past a curious array of abandoned items. A short clip plays, showing elements from the Season 5 opening sequence, along with the 1939 elevator passengers and Rod Serling falling into the \\"vortex\\" seen in the Season 3 opening sequence. Serling's voice says:\\r\\nGuests then exit the elevator, leaving the hotel through the gift shop.\\r\\nOn leaving the elevator, guests are led through a hotel corridor towards what would appear to be the old \\"Lost & Found\\" desk of the hotel; however, it is now where photos taken on the ride may be purchased. Beyond this desk, guests pass a cracked fountain to the left and on the right can be seen the Hollywood Tower Hotel's dining room, previously called The Sunset Room. The menu, placed outside the closed double-doors, is dated October 31, 1939. Guests then enter the shop which is called Tower Merchandise. The shop, in keeping with the theme of the hotel, has cracked walls and is dimly lit. There, guests may purchase Twilight Zone merchandise and Hollywood Tower Hotel-themed souvenirs, including hotel bathrobes and slippers.\\r\\nOn August 13, 2014, the ride's on-ride camera began recording video, so that riders could purchase a photograph or video of their ride.[20] This was the first ride at Walt Disney World to offer on-ride videos. On September 18, 2014, the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train ride at the Magic Kingdom began offering on-ride videos and pictures as well, making these the only two rides at Walt Disney World to offer videos and pictures.[21][22]\\r\\nIn February 2010, Disney announced that the Tower of Terror would receive \\"new lighting effects and a new addition\\" as part of a summer entertainment package called \\"Summer Nightastic!\\".[23] The Fifth Dimension scene is changed, mostly covered by black tarps with fiber-optic stars, and Serling's voice is removed from just before the drop profile. Replacing it is music played in the drop shaft, along with a projected picture of the riders just before they enter the drop shaft. Similar to the Disney California Adventure and Walt Disney Studios Park versions of the ride, the riders disappear, leaving an empty elevator. A new drop profile was created for \\"Summer Nightastic!\\", and replaces the other drop profiles on all rides. The profile mainly consisted of utilizing the entire tower for the drop sequences, as compared to the numerous faux and shortened drops in the randomized version. The changes were implemented on June 5, 2010, but were officially introduced the day after. All changes were temporary, and lasted until August 14, 2010.[24]\\r\\nWhile similar in concept and theme to the original attraction in Florida, the attraction at Disney California Adventure, which opened in 2004[8] and closed in 2017, featured some significant differences. The exterior of Disney California Adventure's tower had architectural features reminiscent of Pueblo Deco styles found throughout Southern California during the Golden Age of Hollywood.\\r\\nThe California version also had a slightly different queue area. The boiler room scene in the queue area had two floors, instead of the one floor in the original Florida version. The two floors allowed for one elevator in one shaft to have guests on ride, while the other elevator of the same shaft was loading guests. There were three elevator shafts in the Disney California Adventure version, with two elevators per shaft, for a total of six elevators operating[vague]\\r\\nImagineers redesigned the ride system for the attraction at Disney California Adventure and made some changes to the show scenes. The attraction featured three elevator shafts. Each shaft was its own separate ride with its own separate operating system. This made it easier to repair individual areas of the attraction without causing the entire attraction to go down. Each shaft had the capacity to accommodate two vehicles operating from two load levels, each vehicle loading and unloading at the same point. The ride was designed so that one vehicle could be in its ride profile while the other was at its loading level, giving each ride shaft the ability to accommodate more riders. Disney used this ride system again for Walt Disney Studios Park's version of the ride, and for Tokyo DisneySea's Hotel Hightower.\\r\\nInstead of the autonomous vehicle found in the original incarnation, the Disney California Adventure attraction limited a car to a single shaft. As the elevator doors closed, the lights of the service elevator flickered out. The redesigned, multiple-cars-per-shaft, multilevel-boarding ride system for the California version of the tower required that one elevator load while another be in the drop shaft progressing through the ride cycle. As such, the first movement guests experienced is horizontal, as the elevator itself was pulled back from the doors as Rod Serling's voice was heard:\\r\\nWith a flash of lightning, the walls of the basement disappeared altogether, leaving only a starfield around the service doors with a rotating purple spiral.\\r\\nThe elevator rose quickly to the fifth floor. Because the dark-ride portion of California's tower took place in the drop shaft, the physical vertical vehicle conveyance system moved more quickly and nimbly than Florida's (in which the first tower functions only as a dark ride and is not built for the quick movements that the drop portion requires). As such, visitors felt a moment of weightlessness as the elevator quickly ascended and then stopped on the fifth floor, where when the doors opened, an ornate, wood-framed mirror stood in a brightly lit hallway of the hotel and riders saw their reflection in its glass. Serling then said:\\r\\nSuddenly, lightning struck the hotel and the lights of both the hallway and elevator flickered out. A ghostly wind blows through a window and the reflection of riders in the elevator became distorted. With another blast, the elevator rumbled and shook and with a final blast of lightning the electrified reflection disappeared, leaving only the image of the empty elevator in the mirror as the doors closed.\\r\\nThe elevator descended and opened to reveal the \\"hallway\\" scene with an image of another elevator at the other end of the hallway, unlike Florida's version which shows a window. Serling delivered his next narration:\\r\\nThe five missing guests appeared in the hallway, crackling with electricity and beckoning riders to follow them. They disappeared, and the walls of the hotel became a starfield, leaving just the other elevator, as Serling said:\\r\\nThe other elevator doors opened to reveal the lost passengers inside as both elevators appeared to float through space.\\r\\nThe distant guests fell, then the distant elevator, followed immediately by the ride elevator. California's version did not have a randomized drop sequence. The ride experience was identical in every drop shaft, regardless of which floor passengers boarded on. Two small drops occurred in pitch-black darkness, followed by a rise to the top of the tower as in-cabin lights flickered. The doors then opened out to reveal the view from the top floor before the ride drops briefly, pauses, and drops along the remainder of the shaft. The elevator then raised and immediately dropped without stopping, in complete darkness. The elevator then was raised to the top of the tower, shuddered, and fell to the bottom of the shaft, to the area in between the two loading floors (to assure each ride is identical), with the elevator being finally returned to its load level and horizontally pushed back into place at the boiler room service doors. The height of the ride is 130 feet (40?m) and the elevator drop 124 feet (38?m) in total.\\r\\nAs the elevator was pushed back into place, Serling delivered his final narration:\\r\\nAfter which, the service doors opened and guests exited the hotel through the basement and the gift shop.\\r\\nOn July 23, 2016, at San Diego Comic-Con, Disney announced that the California version would be replaced by an attraction based on Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy film series, titled Guardians of the Galaxy ÿ Mission: Breakout!, which opened in May 2017 and utilizes the same structure and ride system.[2][25] This is the first American Disney attraction to be based on the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Marvel Entertainment having been wholly acquired by Disney in 2009).[26]\\r\\nThe Tower of Terror's final day of operation was January 2, 2017; the ride then closed January 3.[3][4] In preparation for the closure, Disney began a \\"farewell\\" promotion of the ride on September 9, 2016, which featured a \\"Late Check Out\\" option to experience the drop portion of the ride in total darkness. On the night of September 19 and early morning of September 20, the \\"Hollywood Tower Hotel\\" sign was removed to prepare for the new attraction.[27][28]\\r\\nThe other three Disney parks with versions of the Tower of Terror are unaffected, and Disney has stated that there are no plans to change the ride in its other locations.[29][27]\\r\\nThe attraction at Tokyo DisneySea omits any connection or tie-in whatsoever with The Twilight Zone, as the television series is not well known in Japan.[13] Instead, the attraction is themed as the fictional Hotel Hightower. The ride tower, its facade an example of Moorish Revival architecture, is located in the American Waterfront area of the park, close to the S.S. Columbia cruise liner. The ride system for this version is similar to that of the Disney California Adventure and Walt Disney Studios Park versions.\\r\\nThe story line of the attraction is more complex than that of its American and European counterparts. The scenario involves the adventures of the hotel's famous builder and owner, Harrison Hightower III (modeled after Walt Disney Imagineering executive Joe Rohde), who went on many expeditions throughout the world and collected thousands of priceless artifacts. Most of these artifacts were stolen for personal gain and stored in his hotel. After one such expedition to Africa, he brought home an idol with the name of Shiriki Utundu.\\r\\nHightower claimed that the natives were angry to have their beloved god taken, and that they threatened that the idol would curse him. On New Year's Eve, 1899, Hightower held a press conference about his expedition to Africa, followed by a huge party. Hightower boasted about how he acquired the idol and denied claims of it being cursed. Just as he left the party, he mocked the idol, using its head to put out his cigar. Around midnight, he entered the elevator to retire to his private apartments in the hotel penthouse. As the elevator neared the top, the idol came to life.\\r\\nThe idol's immense rage and power caused the elevator to plummet and crash on the ground floor. When the doors were pried open, only Hightower's hat and the idol were recovered. The hotel was abruptly closed and condemned for more than a decade, rumored by locals to be haunted. In 1912, following pressure to demolish the hotel, a New York restoration company reopened it because of its historical significance. The company now offers paid tours of the building. It is on these \\"tours\\" that guests embark when they enter the hotel.\\r\\nThe queue area winds through gardens filled with statues from many different countries up to the Hotel Hightower, where guests can see that the windows are almost completely shattered. Signs are posted all over the hotel front advertising the tour. Guests then enter the lobby, an elaborate and well-decorated room filled with plush furniture and beautiful art. On each ceiling arch is painted a mural of Hightower on one of his adventures, showing him escaping native people with a valuable artifact or item in his possession. At the end of the lobby is the elevator in its destroyed state, its doors left open with only a single plank of wood holding them together, a broken cable visible inside. Guests are then ushered into a room filled with many pictures of Hightower, his expeditions, and his hotel.\\r\\nGuests enter one of two rooms that are Hightower's office. In each room a large stained glass window depicts a confident Hightower with Shiriki Utundu sitting on a pedestal nearby. A tour guide talks about Hightower, then winds up an old gramophone that plays a recording of Hightower's last interview. At this point, the lights dim. Suddenly, the stained glass window changes to show a frightened Hightower holding the idol and then entering the elevator on that fateful night. It then shows the outside of the hotel as the elevator ascends. Suddenly, all the lights in the hotel go out, and there is a flash of green lightning, shattering the bottom of the window. At this point, Shiriki Utundu comes to life, looks around, laughs mischievously at the guests, and then vanishes into a star-field. A gray fog covers the window, which remains the same when the fog lifts. Guests are then ushered into an enormous storage room where Hightower kept his treasures. There are multiple loading rooms on the second floor, each themed to a different type of item. One has swords, another has tapestries, the third has stone tablets and other valuable artifacts.\\r\\nThe mechanics of the DisneySea tower are identical to those of the Californian and Parisian towers, with dual loading floors, horizontal push-back from the doors and into the drop tower, a \\"hallway\\" scene, and a mirror scene, but with thematic changes. The order of the mirror and \\"hallway\\" scenes is reversed compared to the American and European counterparts.\\r\\nAs the ride begins, a flash of electricity appears on the top of the elevator doors. The lights flicker, then go out. Hightower explains what happened to him, then the elevator is pulled backwards. The glowing green eyes of the idol appear in the darkness as the elevator enters the drop shaft. The elevator begins its ascent, stopping at the first scene.\\r\\nThe elevator doors open to reveal the private apartments of Harrison Hightower, the idol sitting on a table in the center. Hightower's ghost, glowing blue, appears beside it and reaches out to touch it. The idol zaps him with a bolt of green electricity, blasting him backwards past open elevator doors at the opposite end of the apartments, where Hightower falls down the shaft, which then fades away, replaced by a star field. The idol turns toward the guests' elevator and laughs before the doors close.\\r\\nThe elevator ascends to another level. The doors open, revealing a large, ornate mirror. Hightower tells the guests to wave and say \\"good bye to themselves\\". As they do, the lighting of the hotel is replaced with an eerie green glow, which makes the reflections of the guests ghostlike, an effect similar to the California and Paris rides, but absent the lightning strike. The ghostly reflection of the riders disappears and leaves the idol alone in the empty elevator. The idol laughs menacingly at the riders, and suddenly shoots forward at them. The elevator vibrates, then begins the drop sequence. The sequence is identical to the US version except the first two drops are missing (the ascent comes first) and the final drop takes place from the bottom set of doors rather than the top of the shaft.\\r\\nAt the end of the drop sequence, the elevator returns to its loading level, where the idol's green eyes glare a new time in the dark, which then disappear, replaced by the service doors through which guests entered.\\r\\nLa Tour de la Terreur ÿ Un Saut dans la Quatrime Dimension (English: The Tower of Terror ÿ A Jump into the Fourth Dimension), at Walt Disney Studios Park in Disneyland Paris, is similar to the version at Disney California Adventure, which used the designs for the Paris park to construct its ride first, when it was needed as an additional crowd-puller.[30] When financial troubles hit Disney's Parisian resort, the attraction had to be put on hold.\\r\\nThe attraction was finally green-lit in 2005 and was under construction in the center of the park, behind the La Terrasse seating area, by early 2006. Upon completion, it was joined by a new Hollywood Boulevard lined by faux movie sets.[31] Unlike its American cousins, the Paris Tower was constructed using concrete rather than steel due to French construction guidelines and standards, at a total cost exceeding ?180 million.[32] The Paris version opened in 2007.[10]\\r\\nThe Paris and California versions were originally intended to be almost identical upon completion, but there are differences, notably the height of the building and the location of some rooms backstage, as well as other differences due to different construction and work regulations in France.[33]\\r\\nThe default language for the pre-show library video and the ride is French, but can be changed to English by the Cast Member upon request. The library video is the same as the American version, but is dubbed in French and subtitled in English.\\r\\nIn an effort to be true to the spirit of The Twilight Zone, Disney Imagineers reportedly watched every episode of the original television show at least twice.[34] The attraction buildings are littered with references to Twilight Zone episodes, including:\\r\\nThe ride appeared on the Disney Channel's 1994 Halloween edition of Walt Disney World Inside Out with guest star Gilbert Gottfried. Scott Herriott was the host.\\r\\nFollowing the ride's success, Disney produced the TV film, Tower of Terror, based on the attraction in 1997, starring Steven Guttenberg and Kirsten Dunst. Many shots were filmed at the Orlando theme park, while others were filmed on Burbank movie sets. As of October 2015[update], a theatrical film based on the ride, with a script by John August, is in the works.[35]\\r\\nIn the queue for the Tower of Terror at Disney's Hollywood Studios, music from the 1930s is played.\\r\\nThe ride's score was composed by Richard Bellis,[36] and incorporates the main Twilight Zone theme composed by Marius Constant. The attraction's theme and can be found on several theme park albums:\\r\\nThe Tokyo DisneySea version of the attraction is scored by Joel McNeely, who has released the overture on his site.","input":"When was tower of terror built in disneyland?"},{"output":"coup d'tat","context":" Chilean Armed Forces\\r\\nThe 1973 Chilean coup d'tat was a watershed moment in both the history of Chile and the Cold War. Following an extended period of social unrest and political tension between the opposition-controlled Congress of Chile and the socialist President Salvador Allende, as well as economic warfare ordered by U.S. President Richard Nixon,[4] Allende was overthrown by the armed forces and national police.[5][6]\\r\\nThe military deposed Allende's Popular Unity government and later established a junta that suspended all political activity in Chile and repressed left-wing movements, especially the communist and socialist parties and the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). Allende's appointed army chief, Augusto Pinochet, rose to supreme power within a year of the coup, formally assuming power in late 1974.[7] The United States government, which had worked to create the conditions for the coup,[8] promptly recognized the junta government and supported it in consolidating power.[9]\\r\\nDuring the air raids and ground attacks that preceded the coup, Allende gave his last speech, in which he vowed to stay in the presidential palace, refusing offers of safe passage should he choose exile over confrontation.[10] Direct witness accounts of Allende's death agree that he killed himself in the palace.[11][12]\\r\\nBefore the coup, Chile had for decades been hailed as a beacon of democracy and political stability while the rest of South America had been plagued by military juntas and Caudillismo. The collapse of Chilean democracy ended a streak of democratic governments in Chile, which had held democratic elections since 1932.[13] Historian Peter Winn characterized the 1973 coup as one of the most violent events in Chile's history.[14] A weak insurgent movement against the Pinochet regime was maintained inside Chile by elements sympathetic to the former Allende government. An internationally supported plebiscite in 1988 held under the auspices of the military government was followed by a peaceful transition to an elected civilian government.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAllende contested the 1970 Chilean presidential election with Jorge Alessandri Rodriguez of the National Party and Radomiro Tomic of the Christian Democratic Party. Allende received 36.6% of the vote. Alessandri was a very close second with 35.3%, and Tomic third with 28.1%.[15] Although Allende received the highest number of votes, according to the Chilean constitution and since none of the candidates won by an absolute majority, the National Congress had to decide among the candidates.[16]\\r\\nThe Chilean constitution did not allow a person to sit as president for two consecutive terms so the incumbent president, Eduardo Frei Montalva, was thus ineligible as a candidate. The CIA's \\"Track I\\" operation was a plan to influence the Congress to choose Alessandri, who would resign after a short time in office, forcing a second election. Frei would then be eligible to run.[17] Alessandri announced on 9 September that if Congress chose him, he would resign. Congress then decided on Allende. Soon after hearing news of his win, Allende signed a Statute of Constitutional Guarantees, which stated that he would follow the constitution during his presidency.[18]\\r\\nThe U.S. feared the example of a \\"well-functioning socialist experiment\\" on the region and exerted diplomatic, economic, and covert pressure upon Chile's elected socialist government.[19][20][21] At the end of 1971, the Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro made a four-week state visit to Chile, alarming Western observers worried about the \\"Chilean Way to Socialism\\".[22]\\r\\nIn 1972, economics minister Pedro Vuskovic adopted monetary policies that increased the amount of circulating currency and devalued the escudo, which increased inflation to 140 percent in 1972 and engendered a black market economy.[23]\\r\\nIn October 1972, Chile suffered the first of many strikes. Among the participants were small-scale businessmen, some professional unions, and student groups. Its leaders ÿ Vilarn, Jaime Guzmn, Rafael Cumsille, Guillermo Elton, Eduardo Arriagada ÿ expected to depose the elected government. Other than damaging the national economy, the principal effect of the 24-day strike was drawing Army head, Gen. Carlos Prats, into the government as Interior Minister, an appeasement to the right wing.[23] (Gen. Prats had succeeded Army head Gen. Ren Schneider after his assassination on 24 October 1970 by a group led by Gen. Roberto Viaux, whom the Central Intelligence Agency had not attempted to discourage.) Gen. Prats supported the legalist Schneider Doctrine and refused military involvement in a coup d'tat against President Allende.[24]\\r\\nDespite the declining economy, President Allende's Popular Unity coalition increased its vote to 43.2% in the March 1973 parliamentary elections; but, by then, the informal alliance between Popular Unity and the Christian Democrats ended.[25] The Christian Democrats allied with the right-wing National Party, who were opposed to Allende's government; the two right-wing parties formed the Confederation of Democracy (CODE). The internecine parliamentary conflict, between the legislature and the executive branch, paralyzed the activities of government.[26] The CIA paid some U.S. $6.8ÿ$8 million to right-wing opposition groups to \\"create pressures, exploit weaknesses, magnify obstacles\\" and hasten Allende's ouster.[27][28][29]\\r\\nAllende began to fear his opponents, convinced they were plotting his assassination. Using his daughter as a messenger, he explained the situation to Fidel Castro. Castro gave four pieces of advice: convince technicians to stay in Chile, only sell copper for US dollars, avoid extreme revolutionary acts which would give opponents an excuse to wreck or control the economy, and maintain a proper relationship with the Chilean military until local militias could be established and consolidated. Allende attempted to follow Castro's advice, but the latter two recommendations proved difficult.[30]\\r\\nPrior to the coup, the Chilean military had undergone a process of de-politicization since the 1920s, when military personnel participated in government positions. Subsequently, most military officers remained under-funded having only subsistence salaries. Because of the low salaries the military spent much time in military leisure-time facilities (e.g. country clubs) where they met other officers and their families. The military remained apart from society, being to some degree an endogamous group as officers frequently married the sisters of their comrades or the daughters of high-ranked older officers. Many officers had also relatives in the military.[31] In 1969 elements of the military made their first act of rebellion in 40 years when they participated in the Tacnazo. The Tacnazo was not a proper coup but a protest against under-funding.[32] In retrospect General Carlos Prats considered that Christian Democrats who were in power in 1969 committed the error of not taking the militaries grievances seriously.[33]\\r\\nGovernments of Argentina (1966), Bolivia (1969), Brazil (1964) and Peru (1968) were all overthrown in coups and replaced by military governments.[34] In June 1973 Uruguay joined the coup d'tat wave that swept through the region.[35] The poor conditions of the Chilean military contrasted with the change of fortune the military of neighboring countries experienced as they came to power in coups.[34]\\r\\nDuring the decades previous to the coup, the military became influenced by the United States' anti-communist ideology in the context of various cooperation programs including the US Army School of the Americas.[31]\\r\\nOn 29 June 1973, Colonel Roberto Souper surrounded the La Moneda presidential palace with his tank regiment and failed to depose the Allende Government.[36] That failed coup dtat ÿ known as the Tanquetazo tank putsch ÿ organized by the nationalist \\"Fatherland and Liberty\\" paramilitary group.\\r\\nIn August 1973, a constitutional crisis occurred; the Supreme Court publicly complained about the government's inability to enforce the law of the land. On 22 August, the Chamber of Deputies (with the Christian Democrats united with the National Party) accused the government of unconstitutional acts and called upon the military to enforce constitutional order.[26]\\r\\nFor months, the government had feared calling upon the Carabineros national police, suspecting them of disloyalty. On 9 August, Allende appointed General Carlos Prats as Minister of Defence. He was forced to resign both as defence minister and as the Army commander-in-chief on 24 August 1973, embarrassed by the Alejandrina Cox incident and a public protest of the wives of his generals at his house. General Augusto Pinochet replaced him as Army commander-in-chief the same day.[26] In late August 1973, 100,000[disputed ÿ discuss] Chilean women congregated at Plaza de la Constituci܇n to protest against the government for the rising cost and increasing shortages of food and fuels, but they were dispersed with tear gas.[37]\\r\\nOn 22 August 1973, with the support of the Christian Democrats and National Party members, the Chamber of Deputies passed 81ÿ47 a resolution that asked \\"the President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces\\"[38] to \\"put an immediate end\\" to \\"breach[es of] the Constitution . . . with the goal of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law and ensuring the Constitutional order of our Nation, and the essential underpinnings of democratic co-existence among Chileans.\\"\\r\\nThe resolution declared that the Allende Government sought \\". . . to conquer absolute power with the obvious purpose of subjecting all citizens to the strictest political and economic control by the State . . . [with] the goal of establishing a totalitarian system\\", claiming it had made \\"violations of the Constitution . . . a permanent system of conduct.\\" Essentially, most of the accusations were about the government disregarding the separation of powers, and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government. Finally, the resolution condemned the creation and development of government-protected armed groups, which . . . are headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces. President Allende's efforts to re-organize the military and the police forces were characterised as notorious attempts to use the armed and police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and politically infiltrate their ranks.\\r\\nIt can be argued that the resolution called upon the armed forces to overthrow the government if it did not comply, as follows \\"...To present the President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces with the grave breakdown of the legal and constitutional order ... it is their duty to put an immediate end to all situations herein referred to that breach the Constitution and the laws of the land with the aim of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law.\\"[39]\\r\\nTwo days later, on 24 August 1973, President Allende responded, characterising the Congress' declaration as \\"destined to damage the countrys prestige abroad and create internal confusion\\", predicting \\"It will facilitate the seditious intention of certain sectors\\". He noted that the declaration had not obtained the two-thirds Senate majority \\"constitutionally required\\" to convict the president of abuse of power: essentially, the Congress was \\"invoking the intervention of the armed forces and of Order against a democratically elected government\\" and \\"subordinat[ing] political representation of national sovereignty to the armed institutions, which neither can nor ought to assume either political functions or the representation of the popular will\\".[40]\\r\\nAllende argued he had obeyed constitutional means for including military men to the cabinet \\"at the service of civic peace and national security, defending republican institutions against insurrection and terrorism\\". In contrast, he said that Congress was promoting a coup dtat or a civil war with a declaration \\"full of affirmations that had already been refuted before-hand\\" and which, in substance and process (directly handing it to the ministers rather than directly handing it to the President) violated a dozen articles of the Constitution. He further argued that the legislature was usurping the government's executive function.\\r\\nPresident Allende wrote: \\"Chilean democracy is a conquest by all of the people. It is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations, have imposed it . . . With a tranquil conscience . . . I sustain that never before has Chile had a more democratic government than that over which I have the honor to preside . . . I solemnly reiterate my decision to develop democracy and a state of law to their ultimate consequences . . . Parliament has made itself a bastion against the transformations . . . and has done everything it can to perturb the functioning of the finances and of the institutions, sterilizing all creative initiatives\\".\\r\\nAdding that economic and political means would be needed to relieve the country's current crisis, and that the Congress was obstructing said meanshaving already \\"paralyzed\\" the Statethey sought to \\"destroy\\" it. He concluded by calling upon \\"the workers, all democrats and patriots\\" to join him in defending the Chilean Constitution and the \\"revolutionary process\\".[40]\\r\\nMany people in different parts of the world immediately suspected U.S. of foul play. In early newspaper reports, the U.S. denied any involvement or previous knowledge of the coup.[43][44] Prompted by an incriminating New York Times article, the U.S. Senate opened an investigation into possible U.S. interference in Chile.[44] A report prepared by the United States Intelligence Community in 2000, at the direction of the National Intelligence Council, that echoed the Church committee, states that\\r\\nAlthough CIA did not instigate the coup that ended Allende's government on 11 September 1973, it was aware of coup-plotting by the military, had ongoing intelligence collection relationships with some plotters, andbecause CIA did not discourage the takeover and had sought to instigate a coup in 1970probably appeared to condone it.\\r\\nThe report stated that the CIA \\"actively supported the military Junta after the overthrow of Allende but did not assist Pinochet to assume the Presidency.\\"[45] After a review of recordings of telephone conversations between Nixon and Henry Kissinger, Robert Dallek concluded that both of them used the CIA to actively destabilize the Allende government. In one particular conversation about the news of Allende's overthrow, Kissinger complains about the lack of recognition of the American role in the overthrow of a \\"communist\\" government, upon which Nixon remarked, \\"Well, we didn't ÿ as you know ÿ our hand doesn't show on this one.\\".[46] A later CIA report contended that US agents maintained close ties with the Chilean military to collect intelligence but no effort was made to assist them and \\"under no circumstances attempted to influence them.\\"[29]\\r\\nHistorian Peter Winn found \\"extensive evidence\\" of United States complicity in the coup. He states that its covert support was crucial to engineering the coup, as well as for the consolidation of power by the Pinochet regime following the takeover. Winn documents an extensive CIA operation to fabricate reports of a coup against Allende, as justification for the imposition of military rule.[8] Peter Kornbluh asserts that the CIA destabilized Chile and helped create the conditions for the coup, citing documents declassified by the Clinton administration.[47] Other authors point to the involvement of the Defense Intelligence Agency, agents of which allegedly secured the missiles used to bombard the La Moneda Palace.[48]\\r\\nThe U.S. Government's hostility to the election of Allende in Chile was substantiated in documents declassified during the Clinton administration, which show that CIA covert operatives were inserted in Chile in order to prevent a Marxist government from arising and for the purpose of spreading anti-Allende propaganda.[49] As described in the Church Committee report, the CIA was involved in multiple plots designed to remove Allende and then let the Chileans vote in a new election where he would not be a candidate. The first, non-military, approach involved attempting a constitutional coup. This was known as the Track I approach, in which the CIA, with the approval of the 40 Committee, attempted to bribe the Chilean legislature, tried to influence public opinion against Allende, and provided funding to strikes designed to coerce him into resigning. It also attempted to get congress to confirm Jorge Alessandri as the winner of the presidential election. Alessandri, who was an accessory to the conspiracy, was ready to then resign and call for fresh elections.\\r\\nThe other approach of the CIA, also known as the Track II approach, was an attempt to encourage a military coup by creating a climate of crisis across the country. False flag operatives contacted senior Chilean military officers and informed them that the U.S. would actively support a coup, but would revoke all military aid if such a coup did not happen.[47] In addition, the CIA gave extensive support for black propaganda against Allende, channeled mostly through El Mercurio. Financial assistance was also given to Allende's political opponents, and for organizing strikes and unrest to destabilize the government. By 1970, the U.S. manufacturing company ITT Corporation owned 70% of Chitelco (the Chilean Telephone Company), and also funded El Mercurio. The CIA used ITT as a means of disguising the source of the illegitimate funding Allende's opponents received.[50][51][52] On 28 September 1973, ITT's headquarters in New York City was bombed, allegedly for its involvement in Allende's overthrow.[53]\\r\\nAn Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) station was established in Chile out of the Australian embassy in July 1971 at the request of the CIA and authorised by then Liberal Party Foreign Minister William McMahon. Newly-elected Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was informed of the operation in February 1973 and signed a document ordering the closure of the operation several weeks later. It appears, however, the last ASIS agent did not leave Chile until October 1973, one month after the CIA-backed coup d'tat had brought down the Allende Government. There were also two officers of Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), Australia's internal security service, who were based in Santiago working as migration officers during this period.[54][55] The failure of timely closure of Australia's covert operations was one of the reasons for the sacking of the Director of ASIS on 21 October 1975. This took effect on 7 November, just four days before Prime Minister's Whitlam's own dismissal in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis with allegations of CIA political interference.[56]\\r\\nBy 7:00?am on 11 September 1973, the Navy captured Valparaso, strategically stationing ships and marine infantry in the central coast and closed radio and television networks. The Province Prefect informed President Allende of the Navy's actions; immediately, the president went to the presidential palace with his bodyguards, the \\"Group of Personal Friends\\" (GAP). By 8:00?am, the Army had closed most radio and television stations in Santiago city; the Air Force bombed the remaining active stations; the President received incomplete information, and was convinced that only a sector of the Navy conspired against him and his government.\\r\\nPresident Allende and Defence minister Orlando Letelier were unable to communicate with military leaders. Admiral Montero, the Navy's commander and an Allende loyalist, was rendered incommunicado; his telephone service was cut and his cars were sabotaged before the coup dtat, to ensure he could not thwart the opposition. Leadership of the Navy was transferred to Jos Toribio Merino, planner of the coup dtat and executive officer to Adm. Montero. Augusto Pinochet, General of the Army, and Gustavo Leigh, General of the Air Force, did not answer Allende's telephone calls to them. The General Director of the Carabineros (uniformed police), Jos Mara Sep~lveda, and the head of the Investigations Police (plain clothes detectives), Alfredo Joignant answered Allende's calls and immediately went to the La Moneda presidential palace. When Defence minister Letelier arrived at the Ministry of Defense, controlled by Adm. Patricio Carvajal, he was arrested as the first prisoner of the coup dtat.\\r\\nDespite evidence that all branches of the Chilean armed forces were involved in the coup, Allende hoped that some units remained loyal to the government. Allende was convinced of Pinochet's loyalty, telling a reporter that the coup dtat leaders must have imprisoned the general. Only at 8:30?am, when the armed forces declared their control of Chile and that Allende was deposed, did the president grasp the magnitude of the military's rebellion. Despite the lack of any military support, Allende refused to resign his office.\\r\\nAt approx. 9:00 the carabineros of the La Moneda left the building.[57] By 9:00?am, the armed forces controlled Chile, except for the city centre of the capital, Santiago. Allende refused to surrender, despite the military's declaring they would bomb the La Moneda presidential palace if he resisted being deposed. The Socialist Party along with his Cuban advisors proposed to Allende that he escape to the San Joaqun industrial zone in southern Santiago, to later re-group and lead a counter-coup dtat; the president rejected the proposition. According to Tanya Harmer, Allende's refusal to lead an insurgency against the coup is evidence of his unrelenting desire to bring about change through non-violent methods.[58] The military attempted negotiations with Allende, but the President refused to resign, citing his constitutional duty to remain in office. Finally, Allende gave a farewell speech, telling the nation of the coup dtat and his refusal to resign his elected office under threat.\\r\\nLeigh ordered the presidential palace bombed, but was told the Air Force's Hawker Hunter jet aircraft would take forty minutes to arrive. Pinochet ordered an armoured and infantry force under General Sergio Arellano to advance upon the La Moneda presidential palace. When the troops moved forward, they were forced to retreat after coming under fire from GAP snipers perched on rooftops. General Arellano called for helicopter gunship support from the commander of the Chilean Army Puma helicopter squadron and the troops were able to advance again.[59] Chilean Air Force aircraft soon arrived to provide close air support for the assault (by bombing the Palace), but the defenders did not surrender until nearly 2:30?pm.[60] First reports said the 65-year-old president had died fighting troops, but later police sources reported he had committed suicide.\\r\\nIn the first months after the coup dtat, the military killed thousands of Chilean leftists, both real and suspected, or forced their \\"disappearance\\". The military imprisoned 40,000 political enemies in the National Stadium of Chile; among the tortured and killed desaparecidos (disappeared) were the U.S. citizens Charles Horman, and Frank Teruggi.[61] In October 1973, the Chilean songwriter Vctor Jara, and 70 other political killings were perpetrated by the death squad, Caravan of Death (Caravana de la Muerte).\\r\\nThe government arrested some 130,000 people in a three-year period;[62][63] the dead and disappeared numbered thousands in the first months of the military government. Those include the British physician Sheila Cassidy, who survived to publicize to the UK the human rights violations in Chile.[64] Among those detained was Alberto Bachelet (father of future Chilean President Michelle Bachelet), an Air Force official; he was tortured and died on 12 March 1974,[65][66][67] the right-wing newspaper, El Mercurio (The Mercury),[68] reported that Mr Bachelet died after a basketball game, citing his poor cardiac health. Michelle Bachelet and her mother were imprisoned and tortured in the Villa Grimaldi detention and torture centre on 10 January 1975.[69][70][71][72]\\r\\nAfter Gen. Pinochet lost the election in the 1988 plebiscite, the Rettig Commission, a multi-partisan truth commission, in 1991 reported the location of torture and detention centers, among others, Colonia Dignidad, the tall ship Esmeralda and Vctor Jara Stadium. Later, in November 2004, the Valech Report confirmed the number as less than 3,000 killed, and reduced the number of cases of forced disappearance; but some 28,000 people were arrested, imprisoned, and tortured. Sixty individuals died as a direct result of fighting on 11 September, although the MIR and GAP continued to fight the following day. In all, 46 of Allende's guard (the GAP, Grupo de Amigos Personales) were killed, some of them in combat with the soldiers that took the Moneda.[73] Allende's Cuban-trained guard would have had about 300 elite commando-trained GAP fighters at the time of the coup,[74] but the use of brute military force, especially the use of Hawker Hunters, may have handicapped many GAP fighters from further action.[75]\\r\\nAccording to official reports prepared after the return of democracy, at La Moneda only two people died: President Allende and the journalist Augusto Olivares (both by suicide). Two more were injured, Antonio Aguirre and Osvaldo Ramos, both members of President Allende's entourage; they would later be allegedly kidnapped from the hospital and disappeared. In November 2006, the Associated Press noted that more than 15 bodyguards and aides were taken from the palace during the coup and are still unaccounted for; in 2006 Augusto Pinochet was indicted for two of their deaths.[76]\\r\\nOn the military side, there were 34 deaths: two army sergeants, three army corporals, four army privates, 2 navy lieutenants, 1 navy corporal, 4 naval cadets, 3 navy conscripts and 15 carabineros.[77] In mid-September, the Chilean military junta claimed its troops suffered another 16 dead and 100 injured by gunfire in mopping-up operations against Allende supporters, and Pinochet said: \\"sadly there are still some armed groups who insist on attacking, which means that the military rules of wartime apply to them.\\"[78] A press photographer also died in the crossfire while attempting to cover the event. On 23 October 1973, 23-year-old army corporal Benjamn Alfredo Jaramillo Ruz, who was serving with the Cazadores, became the first fatal casualty of the counterinsurgency operations in the mountainous area of Alquihue in Valdivia after being shot by a sniper.[79] The Chilean Army suffered 12 killed in various clashes with MIR guerrillas and GAP fighters in October 1973.[80]\\r\\nWhile fatalities in the battle during the coup might have been relatively small, the Chilean security forces sustained 162 dead in the three following months as a result of continued resistance,[81] and tens of thousands of people were arrested during the coup and held in the National Stadium.[82] This was because the plans for the coup called for the arrest of every man, woman and child on the streets the morning of 11 September. Of these approximately 40,000 to 50,000 perfunctory arrests, several hundred individuals would later be detained, questioned, tortured, and in some cases murdered.[citation needed] While these deaths did not occur before the surrender of Allende's forces, they occurred as a direct result of arrests and round-ups during the coup's military action.\\r\\nPresident Allende died in La Moneda during the coup. The junta officially declared that he committed suicide with a rifle given to him by Fidel Castro, two doctors from the infirmary of La Moneda stated that they witnessed the suicide,[83] and an autopsy labelled Allende's death a suicide. Vice Admiral Patricio Carvajal, one of the primary instigators of the coup, claimed that \\"Allende committed suicide and is dead now.\\"[this quote needs a citation]\\r\\nAt the time, few of Allende's supporters believed the explanation that Allende had killed himself.[84] Allende's body was exhumed in May 2011. A scientific autopsy was performed and the autopsy team delivered a unanimous finding on 19 July 2011 that Allende committed suicide using an AK-47 rifle.[85]\\r\\nHowever, on 31 May 2011, Chile's state television station reported that a top-secret military account of Allende's death had been discovered in the home of a former military justice official. The 300-page document was only found when the house was destroyed in the 2010 Chilean earthquake. After reviewing the report, two forensic experts told TVN \\"that they are inclined to conclude that Allende was assassinated.\\"[21]\\r\\nAllende's widow and family escaped the military government and were accepted for exile in Mexico, where they remained for 17 years.[86][87]\\r\\nOn 13 September, the Junta dissolved Congress.[88] At the same time, it outlawed the parties that had been part of the Popular Unity coalition, and all political activity was declared \\"in recess\\".[89]\\r\\nThe military government took control of all media including the radio broadcasting that Allende attempted to use to give his final speech to the nation. It is not known how many Chileans actually heard the last words of Allende as he spoke them, but a transcript and audio of the speech survived the military government.[90][91] Chilean scholar Lidia M. Baltra details how the military took control of the media platforms and turned them into their own \\"propaganda machine.\\"[91] The only two newspapers that were allowed to continue publishing after the military takeover were El Mercurio and La Tercera de la Hora, both of which were anti-Allende under his leadership.[91] The dictatorship's silencing of the leftist point of view extended past the media and into \\"every discourse that expressed any resistance to the regime.\\"[92] An example of this is the torturing and death of folk singer Victor Jara. The military government detained Jara in the days following the coup. He, along with many other leftists, was held in Estadio Nacional, or the National Stadium of Chile in the capital of Santiago. Initially, the Junta tried to silence him by crushing his hands but ultimately he was murdered.[93] Immediately after the coup the military sought after television host Don Francisco to have him report on the events. Don Francisco declined the offer encouraging the captain that had approached him to take the role of reporter himself.[94]\\r\\nInitially, there were four leaders of the junta: In addition to General Augusto Pinochet, from the Army, there were General Gustavo Leigh Guzmn, of the Air Force; Admiral Jos Toribio Merino Castro, of the Navy (who replaced Constitutionalist Admiral Ra~l Montero); and General Director Csar Mendoza Durn, of the National Police (Carabineros de Chile) (who replaced Constitutionalist General Director Jos Mara Sep~lveda). Coup leaders soon decided against a rotating presidency and named General Pinochet permanent head of the junta.[95]\\r\\nIn the months that followed the coup, the junta, with authoring work by historian Gonzalo Vial and admiral Patricio Carvajal, published a book titled El Libro Blanco del cambio de gobierno en Chile (commonly known as El Libro Blanco, \\"The White Book of the Change of Government in Chile\\"), where they attempted to justify the coup by claiming that they were in fact anticipating a self-coup (the alleged Plan Zeta, or Plan Z) that Allende's government or its associates were purportedly preparing. Historian Peter Winn states that the Central Intelligence Agency had an extensive part to play in fabricating the conspiracy and in selling it to the press, both in Chile and internationally.[8] Although later discredited and officially recognized as the product of political propaganda,[96] some Chilean historians pointed to the similarities between the alleged Plan Z and other existing paramilitary plans of the Popular Unity parties in support of its legitimacy.[97]\\r\\nThe newspaper La Tercera published on its front page a photograph showing prisoners at the Quiriquina Island Camp who had been captured during the fighting in Concepci܇n. The photograph's caption stated that some of the detained were local leaders of the \\"Unidad Popular\\" while others were \\"extremists who had attacked the armed forces with firearms\\". The photo is reproduced in Docuscanner.[98] This is consistent with reports in newspapers and broadcasts in Concepci܇n about the activities of the Armed Forces, which mentioned clashes with \\"extremists\\" on several occasions from 11 to 14 September. Nocturnal skirmishes took place around the Hotel Alonso De Ercilla in Colo Colo and San Martino Street, one block away from the Army and military police administrative headquarters. A recently published testimony about the clashes in Concepcion offers several plausible explanations for the reticence of witnesses to these actions.[99]\\r\\nBesides political leaders and participants, the coup also affected many everyday Chilean citizens. Thousands were killed, went missing, and were injured. Because of the political instability in their country, many relocated elsewhere. Canada, among other countries, became a main point of refuge for many Chilean citizens. Through an operation known as Special Movement Chile, more than 7,000 Chileans were relocated to Canada in the months following September 11, 1973.[100] These refugees are now known as Chilean Canadian people and have a population of over 38,000.[101]\\r\\nThe U.S. view of the coup continues to spark controversy. Beginning in late 2014 in response to a request by then Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Carl Levin, United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS), located at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C., has been under investigation by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General. Insider national security whistleblower complaints included that the Center knowingly protected a CHDS professor from Chile who was a former top advisor to Pinochet after belonging to the Direcci܇n de Inteligencia Nacional / DINA state terrorist organization (whose attack against a former Chilean foreign minister in 1976 in Washington, D.C. resulted in two deaths, including that of an American). Reports that NDU hired foreign military officers with histories of involvement in human rights abuses, including torture and extra-judicial killings of civilians, are stunning, and they are repulsive, said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the author of the Leahy Law prohibiting U.S. assistance to military units and members of foreign security forces that violate human rights.[102][103][104][105]\\r\\nRoberto Theime, the military leader of Fatherland and Liberty, who was imprisoned on September 11 was shocked to hear about the degree of violence the coup was carried out with. Despite being an arduous opponent of Unidad Popular he had expected a cleaner coup.[106]\\r\\nPresident of Argentina Juan Domingo Per܇n condemned the coup calling it a \\"fatality for the continent\\". Before the coup Per܇n had warned the more radical of his followers to stay calm and \\"not do as Allende\\".[107] Argentine students protested the coup at the Chilean embassy in Buenos Aires, where part of them chanted that they were \\"available to cross the Andes\\" (dispuestos a cruzar la cordillera).[108]\\r\\nThe commemoration of the coup is associated to competing narratives on its cause and effects.[109] The coup has been commemorated by detractors and supporters in various ways.\\r\\nOn September 11 of 1975 Pinochet lit the Llama de la Libertad (lit. Flame of Liberty) to commemorate the coup. This flame was extinguished in 2004.[110][111] Avenida Nueva Providencia in Providencia, Santiago, was renamed Avenida 11 de Septiembre in 1980.[112] In the 30th anniversary of the coup President Ricardo Lagos inaugurated the Morand 80 entrance to La Moneda. This entrance to the presidential palace had been errased during the repairs the dictatorship did to the building after the bombing.[113]\\r\\nThe 40th anniversary of the coup in 2013 was particularly intense.[109] That year the name of Avenida 11 de Septiembre was reversed to the original Avenida Nueva Providencia.[112] The Association of Chilean Magistrates issued a public statement in early September 2013 recognizing the past unwillingness of judges to protect those persecuted by dictatorship.[109] On September 11, 2013 hundreds of Chileans posed as dead in the streets of Santiago in remembrance of the ones \\"disappeared\\" by the dictatorship.[114]\\r\\nThe centre-left opposition refused to attend the commemoration event organized by Sebastin Pi?era's right-wing government organizing instead a separate event.[114] Osvaldo Andrade of the Socialist Party explained that attendance was not viable as Pi?era's government was \\"packed with passive accomplices\\" of the dictatorship.[115] Some right-wing politicians also declined the invitation.[116] President candidate Michelle Bachelet planned to spend the day visiting Museum of Memory and Human Rights and commented that \\"it is not fair to talk about the coup as something unavoidable\\".[116] President Pi?era held an unusual speech in which he denounced \\"passive accomplices\\" like news reporters who deliberately changed or omitted the truth and judges who rejected recursos de amparos that could have saved lives. People who knew things or could have known things but decided to stay quiet were also criticized as passive accomplices in Pi?era's speech.[109]\\r\\nA number of new films, theatre plays and photography expositions were held to cast light on the abuses and censorship of the dictatorship.[114] The number of new books published on the subject in 2013 was such that it constituted an editorial boom.[109][114] Conferences and seminaries on the subject of coup were also held. Various series and interviews with politicians on the subject of the coup and the dictatorship were aired on Chilean TV in 2013.[109]","input":"What happened in chile on september 11 1973?"},{"output":"ring-tailed lemur","context":"","input":"What type of monkey is the popular king julien character from madagascar?"},{"output":"February 22, 2018","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficial website \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gateway Arch National Park, formerly known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial until 2018, is an American national park located in St. Louis, Missouri, near the starting point of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The Gateway Arch and its immediate surroundings were initially designated as a national memorial by executive order 7523 on December 21, 1935, and redesignated as a national park in 2018. The park is maintained by the National Park Service (NPS).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park was established to commemorate:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe memorial consists of a 91-acre (36.8?ha) park along the Mississippi River on the site of the earliest buildings of St. Louis; the Old Courthouse, a former state and federal courthouse that saw the origins of the Dred Scott case; the 140,000?sq?ft (13,000?m2) museum at the Gateway Arch; and most notably the Gateway Arch, a steel catenary arch that has become the definitive icon of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gateway Arch, known as the \\"Gateway to the West\\", is the tallest structure in Missouri. It was designed by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen and structural engineer Hannskarl Bandel in 1947 and built between 1963 and October 1965.   It stands 630 feet (192?m) tall and 630 feet (192?m) wide at its base.  The legs are 54 feet (16.5?m) wide at the base, narrowing to 17 feet (5.2?m) at the arch.  There is a unique tram system to carry passengers to the observation room at the top of the arch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Old Courthouse is built on land originally deeded by St. Louis founder Auguste Chouteau. It marks the location over which the arch reaches. Its dome was built during the American Civil War and is similar to the dome on the United States Capitol which was also built during the Civil War.  It was the site of the local trials in the Dred Scott case.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe courthouse is the only portion of the memorial west of Interstate 44. To the west of the Old Courthouse is a Greenway between Market and Chestnut Streets which is only interrupted by the Civil Courts Building which features a pyramid model of the Mausoleum of Mausolus (which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World) on its roof. When the Civil Courts building was built in the 1920s, the Chouteau family sued to regain the property belonging to the Old Courthouse because it had been deeded in perpetuity to be a courthouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderneath the Arch is a visitor center, entered from a circular entryway facing the Old Courthouse. Within the center, a project to rebuild the Museum at the Gateway Arch  was completed in July 2018. The new museum features exhibits on a variety of topics including westward expansion and the construction of the arch, all told through a St. Louis lens. Tucker Theater, finished in 1968 and renovated 30 years later, has about 285 seats and shows a documentary (Monument to the Dream) on the Arch's construction. A second theater was added in 1993 but removed in 2018 as part of the CityArchRiver renovation project. Also located in the visitor center are a gift shop and cafe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe memorial was developed largely through the efforts of St. Louis civic booster Luther Ely Smith who first pitched the idea in 1933, was the long-term chairman of the committee that selected the area and persuaded Franklin Roosevelt in 1935 to make it a national park service unit after St. Louis passed a bond issue to begin building it, and who partially financed the 1947 architectural contest that selected the Arch.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1930s the United States began looking for a suitable memorial for Thomas Jefferson (the Washington Monument and the newly built Lincoln Memorial were the only large Presidential memorials at the time).\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after Thanksgiving in 1933 Smith who had been on the commission to build the George Rogers Clark National Historical Park in Indiana, was returning via train when he noticed the poor condition of the original platted location of St. Louis along the Mississippi. He thought that the memorial to Jefferson should be on the actual location that was symbolic of one of Jefferson's greatest triumphsthe Louisiana Purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe originally platted area of St. Louis was the site of:\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost all of the historic buildings associated with this period had been replaced by newer buildings.  His idea was to raze all of the buildings in the original St. Louis platted area and replace it with a park with \\"a central feature, a shaft, a building, an arch, or something which would symbolize American culture and civilization.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith pitched the idea to Bernard Dickmann who quickly assembled a meeting of St. Louis civic leaders on December 15, 1933 at the Jefferson Hotel and they endorsed the plan and Smith became chairman of what would become the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Association (a position he would hold until 1949 with a one-year exception).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commission then defined the area, got cost estimates of $30 million to buy the land, clear the buildings and erect a park and monument.  With promises from the federal government (via the United States Territorial Expansion Memorial Commission) to join if the City of St. Louis could raise money.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area to be included in the park was bounded by the Eads Bridge/Washington Avenue on the north and Poplar Street on the south, the Mississippi River on the east and Third Street (now Interstate 44) on the west.  The Old Courthouse, just west of Third Street, was added in 1940.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only building in this area not included was the Old Cathedral, which is on the site of St. Louis first church and was opposite the home of St. Louis founder Auguste Chouteau.  The founders of the city were buried in its graveyard (but were moved in 1849 to Bellefontaine Cemetery during a cholera outbreak).\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking away 40 blocks in the center of St. Louis was bitterly fought by some sourcesparticularly the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.[5] On September 10, 1935, the voters of St. Louis approved a $7.5 million bond issue to buy the property. Local architect Louis Le Beaume provided a preliminary design proposal for the site that included multiple museums, fountains, and obelisks.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe buildings were bought for $7 million by the federal government via Eminent domain and was subject to considerable litigation but were ultimately bought at 131.99 percent of assessed valuation.[7] Roosevelt inspected the memorial area on October 14, 1936 during the dedication of the St. Louis Soldiers Memorial. Included in the party was then Senator Harry S. Truman.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe land was to be cleared by 1942.  Among the buildings razed was the \\"Old Rock House\\" 1818 home of fur trader Manuel Lisa (now occupied by the stairs on the north side of the Arch) and the 1819 home of original St. Louis pioneer Jean Pierre Chouteau at First and Washington.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe architectural competition for a monument was delayed by World War II.  Interest in the monument was fed after the war as it was to be the first big monument in the post-World War II era.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe estimated cost of the competition was $225,000 and Smith personally donated $40,000.  Civic leaders held the nationwide competition in 1947 to select a design for the main portion of the Memorial space.\\r\\n\\r\\nArchitect Eero Saarinen won this competition with plans for a 590-foot (180?m) catenary arch to be placed on the banks of the Mississippi River. However, these plans were modified over the next 15 years, placing the arch on higher ground and adding 40 feet (12?m) in height and width.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe central architectural feature at the base of the arch is the Old Courthouse, which was once the tallest building in Missouri and has a dome similar to the United States Capitol and was placed on the building during the American Civil War at the same time as that on the U.S. Capitol.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaarinen developed the shape with the help of architectural engineer Hannskarl Bandel. It is not a pure inverted catenary. Saarinen preferred a shape that was slightly elongated and thinner towards the top, a shape that produces a subtle soaring effect, and transfers more of the structure's weight downward rather than outward at the base.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Saarinen won the competition, the official notification was sent to \\"E. Saarinen\\", thinking it to be the architect's father Eliel Saarinen, who had also submitted an entry. The family celebrated with a bottle of champagne, and two hours later an embarrassed official called to say the winner was, in fact, the younger Saarinen. The elder Saarinen then broke out a second bottle of champagne to celebrate his son's success.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the five finalists was local St. Louis architect Harris Armstrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand for the memorial was formally dedicated on June 10, 1950 by Harry S. Truman.  However the Korean War began and the project was put on hold.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 23, 1959, work begins on covering railroad tracks that cut across the memorial grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 11, 1961, excavation began, and that September 1, Saarinen died. On February 12, 1963, the first stainless steel triangle that formed the first section of the arch was set in place on the south leg.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 28, 1965, it was completed, costing approximately $15 million to build. The adjacent park was designed by landscape architect Dan Kiley. Along with all other historical areas of the National Park Service, the memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall dedicated the Arch on May 25, 1968.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1984, Congress authorized the enlargement of the Memorial to include up to 100 acres (40?ha) on the east bank of the Mississippi River in East St. Louis, Illinois. Funds were authorized to begin land acquisition, but Congress placed a moratorium upon NPS land acquisitions in fiscal year 1998. The moratorium continued into the 21st century, with expansion becoming less likely because of the construction of a riverboat gambling facility and related amenities.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, Mississippi flood waters reached halfway up the Grand Staircase on the east.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999, the Arch tram queue areas were renovated at a cost of about $2.2 million. As well, the Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site in St. Louis County, Missouri, was put under the jurisdiction of the Superintendent of the Memorial.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arch was featured on the Missouri state quarter in 2003.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007 St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay and former Missouri Senator John Danforth asked the National Park Service to create a more \\"active\\" use of the grounds of the memorial and model it on Millennium Park in Chicago including the possibility of restaurants, fountains, ice skating, swimming, and other activities.[10] The National Park Service was not in favor of the plan noting that the only other overt development pressure on national park property has been at the Jackson Hole Airport in Grand Teton National Park[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor most of its life, the Memorial was largely separated from the rest of Downtown St. Louis by a sunken section of I-70 (now I-44 with the rerouting of I-70 over a new bridge), but in 2014, a lid was installed over the highway, creating the foundation for a park connecting downtown with the Memorial grounds. In November 2015, Saarinen's original master plan was brought to fruition. Building of the Gateway Arch Connector linking the Old Courthouse with the grounds of the Arch was completed.[12]  This design, and other design components were imagined by Michael Van Valkenburg Associates. In September 2010 Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates won a design contest to \\"re-envision the visitor experience\\" of the grounds.[13] The project, originally planned for completion in 2015 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Arch,[14] is now due to be completed in 2018.[15] It includes:[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire project is now scheduled for a 2018 completion, an update to Kiener Plaza due in 2017, completion of the new museum in 2018 and improvements to the Old Courthouse ending the work.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, many ash trees on the grounds were removed to preemept damage from emerald ash borers.[18] Prior to the work of CityArchRiver, there were 1,800 trees on the grounds. There are now a total of 4,200. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe $380 million project was funded both privately and publicly. The public funding, provided largely by Proposition P, totaled $159 million. The remaining $221 were secured via fundraising efforts of Gateway Arch Park foundation.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Congress approved the Gateway Arch National Park Designation Act in early 2018 to re-designate the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial as the Gateway Arch National Park. U.S. President Donald Trump signed the act into law on February 22, 2018.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nLower south tram queue area\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Arch from the west, looking east over Luther Ely Smith Square\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sign at the top of the observation deck.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe St. Louis Arch as seen from the lawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs seen from Laclede's Landing\\r\\n\\r\\nArch at dawn\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Old Cathedral as viewed from top of Arch\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth entrance to the arch\\r\\n\\r\\nAt night as seen from Illinois\\r\\n\\r\\nGateway Arch from below\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking west from the observatory\\r\\n\\r\\nA closeup view of South Pond, one of the two ponds inside Gateway Arch National Park\\r\\n\\r\\nAn aerial view of North Pond, one of the two ponds inside Gateway Arch National Park, as seen from the observation deck atop the Arch","input":"When did gateway arch become a national park?"},{"output":"16 years","context":"In the United States of America, driver's licenses are issued by each individual state, territories, and the federal district rather than by the federal government because of the concept of federalism. Drivers are normally required to obtain a license from their state of residence and all states recognize each other's licenses for temporary visitors subject to normal age requirements. A state may also suspend an individual's driving privilege within its borders for traffic violations. Many states share a common system of license classes, with some exceptions, e.g. commercial license classes are standardized by federal regulation at 49 C.F.R. 383.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1899 Chicago and New York City were the first locales to require testing before being allowed to drive a motor vehicle. Massachusetts and Missouri were the first U.S. states to require a license for driving a motor vehicle in 1903; however, Missouri did not require testing before a license was granted.[2]\\r\\nPennsylvania's 1909 licensing laws were the first to give an age restriction (\\"18 years of age\\") and the first state to allow 16-year-olds to drive (accompanied by a licensed driver) was Connecticut in 1921.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome states also have additional classifications. Hawaii, for example, has a separate license category for drivers who only operate mopeds, while some more northerly states have separate categories for snowmobiles and ATVs. South Carolina and Georgia have non-commercial versions of every commercial class license for agricultural purposes.\\r\\nClass C licenses are issued in all states, except Massachusetts, in both commercial and non-commercial status. A non-commercial Class C license may not be used for hire. Most recreational vehicles that do not fall into the class D/E category, such as converted buses, tractor, lawn mowers, or full size (greater than 40 feet (12?m)) campers require a non-commercial Class C license and the corresponding permit from the state with which you reside.\\r\\nProfessional drivers are usually required to add endorsements to their CDL in order to drive certain types of vehicles that require additional training, such as those equipped with air brakes. CDL endorsements requirements are mostly similar, but some vary slightly from state to state. The training and testing requirements are regulated by the US Department of Transportation. Endorsements are as follows:[8]\\r\\nLicenses can be restricted through any of the following ways:[8]\\r\\nIn a rare exception to states and territories issuing driver's licenses, the State Department's Office of Foreign Missions (OFM) issues driver's licenses to foreign officials and diplomats, bypassing the states and territories in which they live. OFM-issued driver licenses are equivalent to a regular state-issued license.[10]\\r\\nThe minimum age to obtain a restricted driver's license in the United States varies from 14 years, three months in South Dakota to as high as 17 in New Jersey. In most states, with the exception of South Dakota, a graduated licensing law applies to newly licensed teenage drivers, going by names such as Provisional Driver, Junior Operator, Probationary Driver, or Intermediate License. These licenses restrict certain driving privileges, such as whether the new driver may carry passengers and if so how many, as well as setting a curfew for young drivers to be off the roads. For example, Utah drivers who are under 18 may not drive other people outside the family in their first six months with a license. Unlike in some states of Australia and some provinces of Canada, however, graduated licensing laws do not require lowered speed limits, displaying of L and P plates, restrictions on towing a trailer or boat, or prohibitions on highway driving or operating high performance cars.\\r\\nDrivers under 18 are usually required to attend a comprehensive driver's education program either at their high school or a professional driving school and take a certain number of behind the wheel lessons with a certified driving instructor before applying for a license. Some states like New York also require new adult drivers to attend some form of driver's education before applying for a license.[11]\\r\\nHowever, in some states all newly licensed adult drivers may be on probation for a set amount of time (usually between six months and two years), during which traffic violations carry harsher penalties or mandatory suspensions that would not normally apply to experienced drivers.\\r\\nAccording to federal law, the minimum age to operate a commercial vehicle in interstate transit is 21; as a result the minimum age to apply for an unrestricted commercial driver's license is 21.[12]\\r\\nDriving a school bus also requires a CDL, however the minimum age to drive a school bus is typically higher, usually 25. Some states issue restricted intrastate commercial driver's licenses, valid for operating commercial vehicles in that state only, to drivers aged 18 and older. Professional drivers who are aged 18ÿ20 typically cannot be licensed to drive tractor trailers, hazardous materials, or school buses.\\r\\nBelow is a list of Graduated Driver's Licenses (GDL) and hardship licenses for minors laws for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The list includes the state agency responsible for issuing driver's licenses and the length of time that a full (unrestricted) driver's license is valid for.[4][13][14][15][16]\\r\\nNote: In California, to obtain a hardship license for a minor, the minor must be at least 14 but under the age of 18. The pertinent form is DL120 and is entitled \\"Junior Permit Statement of Facts\\".[24]\\r\\nNote: In Georgia, to obtain a hardship license for a minor, the minor must have a suspended license due to school conduct or attendance problems and needs an exemption in order to get to and from school or for family medical reasons. The minor must be old enough to already have a license. The pertinent form is DDS 7012.[32]\\r\\nDriver must have not been convicted of a moving violation in the six months prior to turning 18 to receive full license privileges. If a driver is convicted of a moving violation in the first full year of licensing, this will result in extension of the passenger restriction for an additional six months. If a driver is convicted of a moving violation before turning 18, the Secretary of State will mail a warning letter to the driver and parents. If an under 18 driver is convicted of two moving violations in 24 months, this will result in a minimum 1-month license suspension.\\r\\nThe driver may not use any telecommunication device while operating the vehicle. For the first 180 days of holding their license, the driver may not have any passengers, unless the passengers are over the age of 25 and hold a valid driver's license. Holders of a probationary driver's license must comply with state and local curfew laws.[37]\\r\\nNote: In Iowa, to obtain a hardship license for a minor, called a Minor School License (MSL), the minor must be at minimum 14 and a half years old, the minor must have completed an Iowa-approved drivers education class unless exempted due to hardship, the minor must have a valid instruction permit for the previous six months, the minor's driving history must be free of convictions for moving traffic violations, contributive accidents and license withdrawals during the six-month period immediately preceding application, and the minor must live at least one mile or more from the school he or she is enrolled in. The pertinent form is Form 430021, entitled \\"Affidavit for School License\\", but the form must be completed by the school and signed by the minor's parent(s) or legal guardian(s).[40]\\r\\nPermit must be held for six months. After logging 20 daytime and five nighttime hours of driving, if the learner is between age 15 and 16 the learner has the option of getting a restricted license. The learner must then log an additional 20 daytime and five nighttime practice hours and reach age 16 before getting a less restricted license. Applicant must provide affidavit showing at least 50 hours of adult supervised driving, with ten of those hours being at night, by a licensed driver at least 21 years old. At age 17, a full-privileges license may be obtained with the same requirements as the semi-restricted license.[42] Nonresident: At least 16 years of age and has in immediate possession a valid license issued by home state or country.[43]\\r\\nIntermediate License (Age 16): Must have completed the Learners's Permit requirements, pass the on-road drivers test, and have the Learner's Permit for at least 90 days. May not drive between the hours of 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. Full License (Age 17): Must successfully complete Learner's Permit and Intermediate License stages or be a minimum of 17 years of age prior to application for the first time.\\r\\nNote: In Michigan, to obtain a hardship license for a minor, the minor, who is at least 14 years old, must be living on a family-owned farm, the minor's family income must meet specific levels depending on the number of family members, there must be a significant change in the farming operation, i.e. the loss of a previous driver, to warrant requesting a minor restricted license, and the minor has no alternative transportation available. The pertinent form is entitled \\"Application for Minor Restricted License Special Farming Need Only\\".[53] Due to the expense of the graduated licensing system (including driver education, it can reach upwards of $500 for the entire process), most poorer Michigan residents wait until they are 18, spend $11 to get the Temporary Instruction Permit, and then take a road test, which is no higher than $50.\\r\\nNote: In Minnesota, to obtain a hardship license for a minor, called a Restricted Farm Work License, the minor must be at least 15 years old and need the license to help a parent or legal guardian on a farm. The pertinent form is the Farm Work License Affidavit.[55]\\r\\nNote: The validity periods to the left are for Class D licenses.\\r\\nNote: In Nebraska, to obtain a hardship license for a minor, both a School Learners Permit and a School Permit will be issued. A minor, who is at a minimum 14 years old, must have a School Learners Permit for at least 2 months before getting a School Permit. A School Permit will be issued for a minor, who is at a minimum age of 14 years, 2 months, who lives at least a mile and a half or more from school, who resides outside of a city with 5,000 people or more, or who attends a school outside a city of 5,000 people or more. The School Permit is to be used for the purpose of transporting the minor or any family member who resides with the minor to attend school, extracurricular, or school-related activities at the school, and the minor may drive under the personal supervision of a licensed driver who is at least 21 years old. If a minor has not completed a DMV-approved Driver Safety Course, then the minor is required to compile 50 hours of driving time with a parent, guardian or licensed driver 21 years or older. Information about the School Learners Permit and School Permit can be found here at [62] and the certification of 50 hours of driving time is located at.[63]\\r\\nNote: In Nevada, to obtain a hardship license for a minor, a minor restricted license cannot be approved for commercial driving purposes, to seek employment, or for public school students in Carson City, Clark, Douglas, or Washoe counties; workdays and hours are limited to a maximum of six (6) days per week, ten (10) hours per day; a physicians statement is required if a minor is driving for medical purposes; a \\"Verification of Need\\" affidavit must be completed by an unbiased individual (a member of the clergy or a social worker, etc.) and signed in front of a DMV authorized representative or notary public official if a minor is driving for medical appointments or to go to a grocery store; school authorities and parents/guardians must complete certain sections if a minor is driving to school. The form is entitled \\"Restricted License Information\\".[65]\\r\\nLearner Permits: NYC has the toughest regulations of the regions, requiring an instructor's brake to be installed, and the accompanying driver must be a parent or professional instructor (driving school/driver's ed teacher), and prohibits driving between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. On Long Island, one must be accompanied by a guardian or professional instructor, and may not drive between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. In the rest of the state, one may drive while accompanied by a licensed driver over 21 from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m.; other hours require parent or professional accompaniment.\\r\\nJunior operator licenses (Class DJ or MJ) allows unaccompanied driving from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m., driving outside these hours is permitted only to or from school, employment, or documented medical appointments, unless the driver is accompanied by their parent, legal guardian, or a certified driving instructor. Once someone acquires a junior license he/she is able to drive to and from school with the same restrictions on passengers as driving anywhere else with a junior license.\\r\\nAdolescent drivers must have their permit accident and ticket free for six full months before taking their road test, along with the completion at least 50 hours of supervised driving, 15 of which must be in moderate to heavy traffic.\\r\\nA full driver's education course is not required in New York, although license applicants who do not have a driver's ed certificate must complete a five-hour pre-licensing course. For 17-year-olds, a junior license will be converted to a full standard license if the driver submits a Driver's Ed Certificate and a certified completion of 50 hours of driving plus 15 in moderate to heavy traffic. Otherwise, it will be converted on the driver's 18th birthday. A 12 a.m. curfew exists for drivers who have not completed the driver's ed program.[citation needed]\\r\\nUnder 17 either with a learner's permit or a driver license cannot drive between midnight and 6 a.m., under 18 either with a learner's permit or a driver license cannot drive between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., unless accompanied by a parent or guardian. Drivers under 17 may only have one non-family member under the age of 21 in the vehicle; no restrictions on family members or those over 21. 18 and over have full license privileges and have no time or passenger restrictions. Special restricted license can drive after hours for purposes of employment, education, travel between home and school, vocational training, employment opportunities, and attending church services.\\r\\nNote: In Ohio, to obtain a hardship license for a minor, the minor, aged 14 or 15 years old, must be the only licensed driver in the household; any other licensed driver will be required to surrender his or her driver license; a hardship license may not be used for the child to drive themselves or siblings to and from school, work or social and school events; the license is valid only within a 10-mile radius of the home for obtaining groceries and other household necessities, to drive the disabled parent or guardian to medical appointments and medical emergencies; the parent or guardian must accompany the child at all times while driving; the family must live in an area where there is no public transportation or community services available to assist them; the parent or guardian must show proof that they can maintain financial responsibility insurance on the driver; the child must complete a driver education course and the graduated licensing requirements.

No two driver's license numbers issued by a state are alike. Social Security numbers are now prohibited by federal law from appearing on new driver's licenses, due to identity theft concerns. In most states, to be compliant with AAMVA standards, the orientation of a driver's license for persons under the age of 21 is vertical while a driver's license for those over the age of 21 is horizontal. Since the driver's license is often used as proof of a person's age, the difference in orientation makes it easy to determine that a person is legally allowed to purchase or consume alcohol (the drinking age in all U.S. states is 21). Some states, however, do not require that a driver's license is changed to horizontal, such as Arizona, where it is optional to change to a horizontal license. Furthermore, the vertical license does not expire until age 65 in the state of Arizona. Most states require that when a driver establishes residence in a state, he or she must obtain a license issued by that state within a certain time frame.[citation needed]\\r\\nBecause there is no national identity card in the United States, the driver's license is often used as the de facto equivalent for completion of many common business and governmental transactions. As a result, driver's licenses are the focus of many kinds of identity theft. Driver's licenses were not always identification cards. In many states, driver's licenses did not even have a photograph well into the 1980s. Activism by the Mothers Against Drunk Driving organization for the use of photo ID age verification in conjunction with increasing the drinking age to 21 in order to reduce underage drinking led to photographs being added to all state licenses. New York and Tennessee were the last states to add photos in 1986. However, New Jersey later allowed drivers to get non-photo licenses; this was later revoked.[110] Vermont license holders have the option of receiving a non-photo license.[citation needed] All Tennessee drivers aged 60 years of age or older had the option of a non-photo driver's license prior to January 2013, when photo licenses were required for voting identification. All people with valid non-photo licenses will be allowed to get a photo license when their current license expires.[111] Thirteen states allow the option of a non-photo driver's license for reasons of religious belief: Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Washington, and Wisconsin.[112]\\r\\nLater additions varied from state to state, and have included fingerprints, bar codes, magnetic strips, social security numbers, and tamper-proof features, most of which were added to prevent identity theft and to curb the use of fake IDs. States have now slowly been converting to digitized driver's licenses, which incorporate holograms and bar codes to prevent forgery.\\r\\nMany states, usually through the same agency that issues driver's licenses, provide identification cards for people who do not drive.[113]\\r\\nThe Department of Homeland Security has the power through the Real ID Act of 2005 to set standards relating to identification of applicants and license design for state-issued driver licenses and identification cards. States are not required to comply with RealID, but if a state does not comply, any driver licenses or ID cards issued by that state will not be valid for any official purpose with the federal government, meaning they will not be accepted for entering federal buildings or boarding airplanes.\\r\\nFor a state to meet RealID compliance, licenses and ID cards issued from that state must be approved by DHS in meeting RealID requirements.\\r\\nStates can choose to issue both regular licenses and ID cards as well as RealIDs, but any non-RealID must be marked that it is not a RealID.\\r\\nRealIDs are allowed to be issued only to legal immigrants and citizens of the United States.\\r\\nWhen a person applies for a RealID, either as a new driver license or ID card applicant or renewing a current license or ID card, they must present a citizenship document (US passport, certified birth certificate or citizenship certificate) or proof of legal immigrant status (valid visa) and proof of residency in that state. The state then must verify the documents and store them either electronically or on paper. No one may have more than one RealID at one time.\\r\\nFor those born on or after December 1, 1964, a RealID must be obtained by December 1, 2014, to be allowed to conduct business with the federal government. Those born before December 1, 1964, have until December 1, 2017, to obtain their RealIDs.\\r\\nFlorida, Nevada and Wisconsin have been approved by DHS and started to issue RealIDs. A RealID can be identified as materially compliant by a gold star located on the top third of the ID. A fully compliant RealID is identified as having a circle with an inset gold star in the top third of the ID.[114] As of October 2011, Connecticut also issues them.[115] Starting in January 2013, Ohio is issuing RealIDs under the name \\"Safe ID\\".[116] Starting on January 22, 2018, California will be issuing RealIDs.[117]\\r\\nAdditionally, some states, mostly those with an international border, issue enhanced driver licenses and enhanced ID cards. Enhanced licenses combine a regular driver's license with the specifications of the new federal passport card. Thus, in addition to providing driving privileges, the enhanced license also is proof of U.S. citizenship, and can therefore be used to cross the Canadian and Mexican borders by road, rail, or sea, although air travel still requires a traditional passport book.[118] The enhanced licenses are also fully Real ID compliant.\\r\\nAs of May 2009[update], Vermont, New York, Michigan, and Washington were issuing enhanced driver's licenses and ID cards.[119] In January 2014, Minnesota became the fifth state to issue enhanced driver's licenses, while Ohio is set to become the sixth state once it has been approved by its legislature.[120]\\r\\nOn March 27, 2008, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced that Washington's enhanced driver's license[121] was the first such license approved under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative; according to a Homeland Security press release, the department is also working with Arizonan authorities to develop enhanced driver's licenses. On September 16, 2008, New York began issuing enhanced driver's licenses that meet WHTI requirements. Texas was expected to also implement an enhanced driver's license program, but the program has been blocked by Texas Governor Rick Perry, despite a state law authorizing the Texas Department of Public Safety to issue EDLs and a ruling by the state attorney general, Greg Abbott, that Texas' production of EDLs would comply with federal requirements.[122]\\r\\nCalifornia,[123] Iowa, and Delaware have proposed digital drivers licenses as a means of identification. The license would be available as an app by MorphoTrust USA and installed on a user's personal cellphone.[124] Several questions have been raised about user privacy, since a police officer may ask for one's license and gain access to one's cellphone.

Before this, the highest absolute price paid for a painting was S8.1 million (S18.0 million in 2016 dollars) paid by the J. Paul Getty Museum for Mantegna's Adoration of the Magi at Christie's in London on April 18, 1985.[4] In constant dollars, the highest price paid before 1987 was by the National Gallery of Art when in February 1967 they acquired Leonardo da Vinci's Ginevra de' Benci for around $5 million ($36?million in 2016 dollars) from the Princely Family of Liechtenstein. The sale of Van Gogh's Sunflowers was also significant in that for the first time a \\"modern\\" (in this case 1888) painting became the record holder, as opposed to the old master paintings which previously had dominated the market.

His name was also in honor of the commander of Holloman Aeromedical Laboratory, Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton \\"Ham\\" Blackshear.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHam was born in 1957 in French Cameroons (present day Cameroon),[5][6] captured by animal trappers and sent to Rare Bird Farm in Miami, Florida. He was purchased by the United States Air Force and brought to Holloman Air Force Base in 1959.[5]\\r\\nThere were originally 40 chimpanzee flight candidates at Holloman. After evaluation, the number of candidates was reduced to 18, then to 6, including Ham.[7]:245ÿ246 Officially, Ham was known as No. 65 before his flight,[8] and only renamed \\"Ham\\" upon his successful return to Earth. This was reportedly because officials did not want the bad press that would come from the death of a \\"named\\" chimpanzee if the mission were a failure.[9] Among his handlers, No. 65 had been known as \\"Chop Chop Chang\\".[10][9]:page 138\\r\\nBeginning in July 1959, the two-year-old chimpanzee was trained under the direction of neuroscientist Joseph V. Brady at Holloman Air Force Base Aero Medical Field Laboratory to do simple, timed tasks in response to electric lights and sounds.[11] During his pre-flight training, Ham was taught to push a lever within five seconds of seeing a flashing blue light; failure to do so resulted in an application of a mild electric shock to the soles of his feet, while a correct response earned him a banana pellet.[12]:243\\r\\nWhat differentiates Ham's mission from all the other primate flights to this point is that he was not merely a passenger, and the results from his test flight led directly to the mission Alan Shepard made on May 5, 1961 aboard Freedom 7.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn January 31, 1961, Ham was secured in a Project Mercury mission labeled MR-2 and launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a suborbital flight.[1][12]:314ÿ315 Ham had his vital signs and tasks monitored using computers on Earth.[13] The capsule suffered a partial loss of pressure during the flight, but Ham's space suit prevented him from suffering any harm.[12]:315 Ham's lever-pushing performance in space was only a fraction of a second slower than on Earth, demonstrating that tasks could be performed in space.[12]:316 Ham's capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean and was recovered by a rescue ship later that day.[12]:316 His only physical injury was a bruised nose.[13] His flight was 16?minutes and 39?seconds long.[14]\\r\\nAfter the flight, Ham lived for 17 years in the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.,[7]:255ÿ257 before joining a small group of captive chimps at North Carolina Zoo.[15]\\r\\nAfter his death in 1983, Ham's body was turned over to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology for necropsy. Following the necropsy, the plan was to have him stuffed and placed on display at the Smithsonian, following Soviet precedent with pioneering space dogs Belka and Strelka. However, this plan was abandoned after a negative public reaction. Ham's remains, minus the skeleton, were buried at the International Space Hall of Fame in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Colonel John Stapp gave the eulogy at the memorial service.[16] The skeleton is held in the collection of the National Museum of Health and Medicine.[6]\\r\\nHam's backup, Minnie, was the only female chimpanzee trained for the Mercury program.

It stars Ryan Gosling as a jazz pianist and Emma Stone as an aspiring actress, who meet and fall in love in Los Angeles while pursuing their dreams. The film's title refers simultaneously to the city of Los Angeles and to the idiom for being out of touch with reality.\\r\\nChazelle wrote the screenplay in 2010 but did not find a studio willing to finance the production without changes to his design. Following the success of his 2014 film Whiplash, the project was picked up by Summit Entertainment. Filming took place from August to September 2015 in Los Angeles. La La Land premiered at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2016, and was released in the United States on December 9, 2016. It grossed $446 million worldwide against a production budget of $30 million.\\r\\nLa La Land received acclaim from critics, being praised for Chazelle's screenplay and direction, Gosling and Stone's performances, Justin Hurwitz's musical score, and the film's musical numbers. It won in every category for which it was nominated at the 74th Golden Globe Awards, with a record-breaking seven wins, and received 11 nominations at the 70th British Academy Film Awards, winning five.

After a bad day at work, her subsequent audition goes poorly when the casting director takes a call in the middle of an emotional scene. That night, Mia's roommates take her to a lavish party in the Hollywood Hills, where Mia hopes for a breakthrough (\\"Someone in the Crowd\\"). She walks home after her car is towed.\\r\\nDuring a gig at a restaurant, Sebastian slips into a passionate jazz improvisation despite warnings from the owner to stick to the setlist of traditional Christmas songs. Mia overhears the music as she passes by (\\"Mia and Sebastian's Theme\\"). Moved, she enters the restaurant, but Sebastian is fired for his disobedience. As he storms out, Mia attempts to compliment him, but he brushes her off.\\r\\nMonths later, Mia runs into Sebastian at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band; she teases him by requesting \\"I Ran (So Far Away)\\", a song he considers an insult for \\"a serious musician\\". After the gig, the two walk to their cars, lamenting each other's company despite the chemistry between them (\\"A Lovely Night\\").\\r\\nThe next day, Sebastian arrives at Mia's work, and she shows Sebastian around the movie lot, where she works as a barista, while explaining her passion for acting. Sebastian takes Mia to a jazz club, describing his passion for jazz and desire to open his own club. They warm to each other (\\"City of Stars\\"). Sebastian invites Mia to a screening of Rebel Without a Cause; Mia accepts, forgetting a commitment with her current boyfriend. Bored with the double date with her boyfriend, she runs to the theater and finds Sebastian as the film begins. When the projector breaks, the two conclude their evening with a romantic dance at the Griffith Observatory (\\"Planetarium\\").\\r\\nAfter more failed auditions, Mia decides, at Sebastian's suggestion, to write a one-woman play. Sebastian begins to perform regularly at a jazz club (\\"Summer Montage\\"), and the two move in together.

Although he is dismayed by the band's pop style, Sebastian signs after overhearing Mia trying to convince her mother that Sebastian is working on his career. The band finds success, but when Mia attends one of their concerts (\\"Start a Fire\\") she is disturbed, knowing Sebastian does not enjoy their music.\\r\\nDuring the band's first tour, Mia and Sebastian get into an argument; she accuses him of abandoning his dreams, while Sebastian claims she liked him more when he was unsuccessful. Mia leaves, insulted and frustrated. Sebastian misses Mia's play due to a band photo shoot that he had previously forgotten. The play is a disaster; few people attend, and Mia overhears dismissive comments. Sebastian attempts to apologize to Mia for missing the play, but she is unwilling to forgive him and ends their relationship. Despondent and unable to pay the theater back, Mia moves back home to Boulder City, Nevada.\\r\\nSebastian receives a call from a casting director who attended Mia's play, inviting her to a film audition. Sebastian drives to Boulder City and persuades Mia to attend. The casting directors ask Mia to tell a story; she sings an ode to her aunt who inspired her to pursue acting (\\"Audition (The Fools Who Dream)\\"). Sebastian, confident the audition was a success, encourages Mia to devote herself to the opportunity.

Before Mia leaves with her husband, she shares a poignant smile with Sebastian.\\r\\nAs a drummer, Damien Chazelle has a predilection for musical films.[7] He wrote the screenplay for La La Land in 2010, when the film industry seemed out of reach for him.[8] His idea was \\"to take the old musical but ground it in real life where things don't always exactly work out,\\"[7] and to salute creative people who move to Los Angeles to chase their dreams.[9] He conceived the film when he was a student at Harvard University with his classmate, Justin Hurwitz. The two explored the concept in their senior thesis through a low-budget musical about a Boston jazz musician, Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench.[10][11] Chazelle was moved by the tradition of 1920s city symphony films, such as Manhattan (1921) and Man With a Movie Camera (1929), that paid tribute to cities.[12] After graduating, both moved to Los Angeles in 2010 and continued writing the script, but made a few modifications, such as altering the location to Los Angeles instead of Boston.[10]\\r\\nL.A., even more so than any other American city, obscures, sometimes neglects, its own history. But that can also be its own magical thing, because it's a city that reveals itself bit by bit, like an onion, if you take the time to explore it.[12]\\r\\nRather than trying to match L.A. to the charms of Paris or San Francisco, he focused on the qualities that make the city distinctive: the traffic, the sprawl, and the skylines.[12] The style and tone of the film were inspired by Jacques Demy's The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and The Young Girls of Rochefort, especially the latter, which was more dance and jazz-oriented.[13] The film also makes visual allusions to Hollywood classics such as Broadway Melody of 1940, Singin' in the Rain, The Band Wagon and An American in Paris.[14] About An American in Paris, Chazelle commented: Thats a movie that we just pillaged. Its an awesome example of how daring some of those old musicals really were.\\" [15] It shares some character development and themes with Chazelle's previous musical work, Whiplash; Chazelle said:\\r\\nHe said that both films reflect his own experiences as a filmmaker working his way up the Hollywood ladder.[9] La La Land in particular is inspired by his experience of moving from the East Coast with preconceived notions of what L.A. would be like, \\"that it was all just strip malls and freeways.\\"[12]\\r\\nChazelle was unable to produce the film for years as no studio was willing to finance an original contemporary musical, with no familiar songs. It was also a jazz musical, which The Hollywood Reporter called an \\"extinct genre\\". He believed that since he and Hurwitz were unknown at that time, it might have made financiers dubious about the project's potential.[17][10] Chazelle found producers through friends who introduced him to Fred Berger and Jordan Horowitz. With the two producers on board, the script went to Focus Features at a budget of around $1 million. The studio demanded alterations: the male lead was asked to be changed from a jazz pianist to a rock musician, the complicated opening number had to be altered, and the story's bittersweet ending needed to be dropped. Chazelle scrapped the project and moved on.[10]\\r\\nChazelle later wrote Whiplash, which was an easier concept to sell and a less risky investment.[18] After Whiplash was well received by critics upon its premiere at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival in January, Chazelle continued his efforts to bring La La Land to the big screen.[10] A year later, when Whiplash earned five Oscar nominations at the 87th Academy Awards including Best Picture, and grossed nearly $50 million worldwide off a $3.3 million production budget, Chazelle and his project began to attract attention from studios.[17]\\r\\nFive years after Chazelle wrote the script,[19] Summit Entertainment and Black Label Media, along with producer Marc Platt, agreed to invest in La La Land and distribute it. They had been impressed by the critical and commercial success of Whiplash.[9] Lionsgate's Patrick Wachsberger, who had previously worked on the Step Up franchise, pushed Chazelle to increase the film's budget since he felt high-quality musicals could not be made cheaply.[20]\\r\\nInitially, Miles Teller and Emma Watson were both set to star in the leads. Watson dropped out over a commitment to the 2017 musical adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, while Teller departed via long contract negotiations.[8] Conversely, Gosling himself turned down a role as the Beast in Beauty and the Beast in favor of La La Land.[21] Chazelle decided to make his characters somewhat older, with experience in struggling to make their dreams, rather than younger newcomers just arriving in Los Angeles.[10]\\r\\nEmma Stone plays Mia, a struggling actress in Los Angeles.[17] Stone has loved musicals since she saw Les Misrables when she was 8 years old, saying that \\"bursting into song has always been a real dream of mine\\", and that her favorite film is the 1931 Charlie Chaplin romantic comedy City Lights.[17][7] She studied pom dancing as a child, with a year of ballet.[17] She moved to Hollywood with her mother at the age of 15 to pursue a career, and struggled constantly to get an audition during her first year. When she did, she was often turned away after singing or saying just one line.[22] Stone drew from her own experiences for her character of Mia, and some were added into the film.[16]\\r\\nShe met Chazelle in 2014 while she was making her Broadway debut in Cabaret. Chazelle and Hurwitz saw her perform on a night when the actress had a cold.[17][23] She met with Chazelle at Brooklyn Diner in New York City, where the director outlined his vision for the planned film.[24] Stone gained confidence from performing in Cabaret to handle the demands of the film.[24] In preparation for her role, Stone watched some of the musical movies that inspired Chazelle, including The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers collaborations.[19] Stone accepted the offer because Chazelle was so passionate about the project.[24]\\r\\nRyan Gosling plays Sebastian, a jazz pianist.[17] Like Stone, Gosling drew from his own experiences as an aspiring artist. One incident was used for Mia. Gosling was performing a crying scene in an audition and the casting director took a phone call during it, talking about her lunch plans while he was emoting.[17][22][25] Chazelle met with Gosling at a bar near the latter's home in Hollywood Hills, when Gosling was about to begin filming for The Big Short.[10]\\r\\nChazelle cast the two immediately after Summit bought the film.[9] He said the two \\"feel like the closest thing that we have right now to an old Hollywood couple\\" as akin to Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, and Myrna Loy and William Powell.[16] The film marked the third collaboration between Gosling and Stone, following Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) and Gangster Squad (2013).[26] Chazelle asked the two about their audition disasters when they were both trying to make it.[22] Both learned how to sing and dance for the film's six original tunes.[10]\\r\\nThe rest of the cast?ÿ J. K. Simmons, Sonoya Mizuno, Jessica Rothe, Callie Hernandez, Finn Wittrock, Rosemarie DeWitt, John Legend, Jason Fuchs, Meagen Fay?ÿ were announced between July and August 2015.[27][28][29][30][31][32] Legend plays Keith, a long-time friend of Sebastian.[17]\\r\\nThe film was choreographed by Mandy Moore. Rehearsals took place at a production office in Atwater Village, Los Angeles over the span of three to four months, beginning in May 2015. Gosling practiced piano in one room, Stone worked with Moore in another, and costume designer Mary Zophres had her own corner of the complex.[17][10] Gosling, with no previous experience, had to learn how to play the piano, as no hand models were used.[33] Moore emphasised working on emotion rather than technique, which Stone said was key when they filmed the Prius car scene.[17] To help his cast and crew get their creative mode flowing, Chazelle held screenings on the soundstages every Friday night of classical films that had inspired him for the film, including The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, Singin' in the Rain, Top Hat, and Boogie Nights.[10]\\r\\nFrom the beginning, Chazelle wanted the film's musical numbers to be filmed \\"head to toe\\" and performed in a single take, like those of the 1930s works of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.[24] He also wanted the film to emulate the widescreen, CinemaScope look of 1950s musicals such as It's Always Fair Weather. Consequently, the movie was shot on celluloid film (not digitally) with Panavision equipment in a widescreen format, but not true CinemaScope as that technology is no longer available.[34][35][36][37]\\r\\nChazelle wanted Los Angeles to be the primary setting for his film, commenting that \\"there is something very poetic about the city I think, about a city that is built by people with these unrealistic dreams and people who kind of just put it all on the line for that.\\"[7] Principal photography on the film officially began in the city on August 10, 2015,[38] and filming took place in more than 60 locations both in and near Los Angeles, including the Angels Flight trolley in downtown, houses in the Hollywood Hills, the Colorado Street Bridge, the Rialto Theatre in South Pasadena, the Warner Bros. studio lot, the Grand Central Market, Hermosa Beach's Lighthouse Cafe, Chateau Marmont Hotel, and the Watts Towers, with many scenes shot in one take. It took 40 days to complete shooting, finishing in mid-September 2015.[10][39][40]\\r\\nThe opening pre-credits sequence was the first to be shot,[10] and was filmed on a closed-off portion of two carpool direct connector ramps of the Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange, connecting the I-105 Carpool Lane to the I-110 Express Lanes, leading to Downtown Los Angeles. It was filmed in a span of two days, and required over 100 dancers.[9][41] For this particular scene, Chazelle wanted to give a sense of how vast the city is.[12] The scene was originally planned for a stretch of ground-level highway, until Chazelle decided to shoot it in the 105ÿ110 interchange, which arcs 100 feet (30?m) in the air. Production designer David Wasco said, \\"I thought somebody was going to fall off and get killed.\\" Not every portion of the highway was blocked.[10] Chazelle compared the scene to the yellow brick road leading to the Emerald City in The Wizard of Oz (1939).[10]\\r\\nChazelle scouted for \\"old L.A.\\" locations that were in ruins, or were perhaps razed. One such example was the use of the Angels Flight trolley, built in 1901. The funicular had been closed in 2013 after a derailment. Attempts were made to repair and re-open the railway, but to no avail. However, the production team was able to secure permission to use it for a day. Chazelle and his crew then arranged to have it run for shooting (it was re-opened to the public in 2017).[12] Mia works at a coffee shop on the Warner Bros. studio lot; Chazelle considered studio lots to be \\"monuments\\" of Hollywood. Production designer Wasco created numerous fake old film posters. Chazelle occasionally created names for them, deciding to use the title of his first feature, Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench (2009) for one poster, which reimagines it as a 1930s musical.[12]\\r\\nThe six-minute-long Prius car scene had to be completed during the brief \\"magic hour\\" moment at sunset. It took eight takes and two days to shoot it.[17] When Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone finally nailed it, \\"everybody just exploded,\\" Stone said.[24] Since Gosling and Stone were not primarily dancers, the two made a number of mistakes, especially during long uninterrupted single-take musical numbers. However, Chazelle was very sympathetic towards them, understanding their lack of experience and not minding their errors.[19] While shooting Sebastian and Mia's first dance together, Stone stumbled over the back of a bench, but picked right up and kept on going with the scene.[19]\\r\\nThe fight scene during the romantic dinner that Gosling's character Sebastian prepared for Mia (Emma Stone) was one of the scenes that was re-written more than any other. Gosling and Stone also helped create the dialogue of the scene to get it to be one of the more realistic scenes in a film filled with fantasy and fantastical elements.[42]\\r\\nChazelle spent nearly a year editing the film with editor Tom Cross, as the two were primarily concerned with getting the tone just right.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe songs and score for La La Land were composed and orchestrated by Justin Hurwitz, Chazelle's Harvard University classmate, who also worked on his two prior films.[17] The lyrics were written by Pasek and Paul,[24] except for \\"Start a Fire\\", which was written by John Legend, Hurwitz, Marius De Vries and Angelique Cinelu.[43]\\r\\nA soundtrack album was released on December 9, 2016, by Interscope Records, featuring selections from Hurwitz's score and songs performed by the cast.[43]\\r\\nLa La Land had its world premiere as the Venice Film Festival's opening night film on August 31, 2016.[44][45] The film also screened at the Telluride Film Festival,[46] the Toronto International Film Festival, beginning September 12, 2016,[47] the BFI London Film Festival,[48] the Middleburg Film Festival in late October 2016, the Virginia Film Festival, held at the University of Virginia on November 6, 2016, and the AFI Fest on November 15, 2016.[49]\\r\\nThe film was originally set for a July 15, 2016, release;[50] however, in March 2016, it was announced the film would be given a limited release starting December 2, 2016, before expanding on December 16, 2016.[51] Chazelle stated that the change was because he felt that the release date was not right for the context of the film, and because he wanted to have a slow rollout beginning with the early fall film festivals.[16] The film was later pushed back a week to December 9, 2016 with the wide release still being planned for December 16, 2016.[52] Lionsgate opened the film in five locations on December 9, 2016 and expanded it to about 200 theaters on December 16, 2016 before going nationwide on December 25, 2016. The film went fully wide on January 6, 2017,[40] with a release into select IMAX theaters a week later.[53]\\r\\nLa La Land was released in the United Kingdom on January 12, 2017.[54] The film was released in the Netherlands on December 22, 2016, and in Australia on December 26, with the rest of the territories planned for a release from mid-January 2017.[55]\\r\\nLionsgate released La La Land on Digital HD on April 11, 2017, and Blu-ray, Ultra HD Blu-Ray and DVD on April 25, 2017.[56]\\r\\nLa La Land grossed $151.1 million in the United States and Canada and $294.9 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $446 million, against a production budget of $30 million.[6] Deadline.com calculated the net profit of the film to be $68.25 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it one of the top 20 most profitable releases of 2016.[57]\\r\\nLa La Land began its theatrical release with a limited release in five theaters in Los Angeles and New York City on December 9. It made $881,107 in its opening weekend, giving the film a per-theater average of $176,221, the best average of the year.[58][59][60] In its second week of limited release, the film expanded to 200 theaters and grossed $4.1 million, finishing 7th at the box office. It was an increase of 366% from the previous week and good for a per-theater of $20,510.[61] The following week, the film had its wide expansion to 734 theaters, grossing $5.8 million for the weekend (including $4 million on Christmas Day and $9.2 million over the four days), and finishing 8th at the box office.[62] On January 6, 2017, the weekend of the Golden Globes, the film expanded to 1,515 theaters and grossed $10 million over the weekend, finishing 5th at the box office.[63] In its 6th week of release, the film grossed $14.5 million (a total of $16.9 million over the four-day MLK weekend), finishing 2nd at the box office behind Hidden Figures.[64] After receiving its 14 Oscar nominations, the film expanded to 3,136 theaters on January 27, 2017 (an increase of 1,271 from the week before) and grossed $12.1 million (up 43% from its previous week's $8.4 million).[65] During the weekend of February 24ÿ26 (the weekend of the Academy Awards) the film grossed $4.6 million, exactly the same amount it grossed the previous weekend.[66] The next week, following its six Oscar wins, the film grossed $3 million.[67]\\r\\nLa La Land was met with critical acclaim upon its release, with critics praising its screenplay, direction, performances, chemistry of Gosling and Stone, musical score and musical numbers.[68][69][70][71] The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 92% based on 373 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"La La Land breathes new life into a bygone genre with thrillingly assured direction, powerful performances, and an irresistible excess of heart.\\"[72] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating based on reviews, the film has a score of 93 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".[73] It was the third- and sixth-highest scoring film released in 2016 on each respective site.[74][75] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"Aÿ\\" on an A+ to F scale.[76]\\r\\nPeter Travers of Rolling Stone gave La La Land four stars out of four, describing it as \\"a hot miracle\\" and complimenting its musical numbers, particularly the opening scene. He went on to name it his favorite movie of the year.[77] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune similarly lauded the opening sequence, in addition to highlighting Stone's performance, stating \\"she's reason enough to see La La Land.\\" Despite being less enthusiastic about Gosling's dancing and the film's middle section, Phillips nevertheless gave the film four out of four stars, declaring it \\"the year's most seriously pleasurable entertainment\\".[78]\\r\\nA. O. Scott of The New York Times praised the film, stating that it \\"succeeds both as a fizzy fantasy and a hard-headed fable, a romantic comedy and a showbiz melodrama, a work of sublime artifice and touching authenticity\\".[79] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded the film five out of five stars, describing it as \\"a sun-drenched musical masterpiece.\\"[80] Tom Charity of Sight & Sound stated, \\"Chazelle has crafted that rare thing, a genuinely romantic comedy, and as well, a rhapsody in blue, red, yellow and green.\\"[81] Diana Dabrowska of Cinema Scope wrote, \\"La La Land may look like the world that we dream about, but it also understands the cruelty that can come out of (or undermine) those dreams; it's shot in CinemaScope, and yet it's still an intimate masterpiece.\\"[82]\\r\\nWriting for The Boston Globe in December 2016, Ty Burr summarized the effectiveness of the film to relate to audiences stating: \\"...the movie traffics in the bittersweet happiness of treasuring things that are vanishing, like the unrealized future imagined in the climatic dance number, or those inky, star-filled dance floors that go on forever in old movies, or Hollywood musicals themselves. Or jazz: Sebastian has an early moment at a nightclub where he passionately sticks up for the music he loves. It's dying on the vine, he says. And the world says Let it die. It had its time. Well, not on my watch. In that scene, he speaks for the director. By the end of La La Land, hes speaking for all of us.\\"[83]\\r\\nThe film has been criticized for its treatment of race and jazz. Kelly Lawler of USA Today noted that Gosling's character has been referred to as a \\"white savior\\" by some critics, due to \\"his quest (and eventual success) to save the traditionally black musical genre from extinction, seemingly the only person who can accomplish such a goal.\\"[84] The sentiment was also expressed by Ruby Lott-Lavigna of Wired,[85] Anna Silman of New York[86] and Ira Madison III of MTV News.[87] Rex Reed of the New York Observer also takes aim at the film's intention to emulate the MGM musical classics, noting that \\"the old-fashioned screenplay, by the ambitious writer-director Damien Chazelle, reeks of mothballs\\", and that \\"the movie sags badly in the middle, like a worn-out mattress that needs new springs\\".[88] The South China Morning Post said that the film is a little dull, that the two leads' singing and dancing aren't exceptional, and that Sebastian is a jazz snob and Mia's character lacks depth.[89]\\r\\nAt the 89th Academy Awards, La La Land received a leading six awards, including Best Director, Best Actress (for Stone), Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, Best Original Song (\\"City of Stars\\") and Best Production Design.[90] The film received a total of 14 nominations, tying records for most nominations by a single film with All About Eve (1950) and Titanic (1997). Its other nominations included Best Picture, Best Actor (for Gosling), Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, a second nomination for Best Original Song (\\"Audition\\"), Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing.[91] During the ceremony, Faye Dunaway announced that La La Land had won Best Picture, reading it from the incorrect card Warren Beatty held, which was actually for the Best Actress award that Stone had just won. It took the show's crew more than two minutes and nearly three whole speeches to rectify the mistake; the actual winner was Moonlight.[92][93]\\r\\nAt the 74th Golden Globe Awards, La La Land received a leading seven nominations.[94] The film won in all seven categories for which it was nominated, setting a historic record for the most Golden Globes won by a single film, namely Best Motion Picture ÿ Musical or Comedy, Best Director, Best Actor ÿ Comedy or Musical for Gosling, Best Actress ÿ Comedy or Musical for Stone, Best Screenplay, Best Original Score and Best Original Song (\\"City of Stars\\").[95]\\r\\nLa La Land received eleven nominations at the 70th British Academy Film Awards, more than any other film of 2016.[96] The film won in the categories of Best Film, Best Director, Best Actress in a Leading Role for Stone, Best Cinematography and Best Film Music.[97]","input":"Who composed the music for la la land?"},{"output":"Alabama","context":"Fried Green Tomatoes is a 1991 comedy-drama film based on the novel Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe by Fannie Flagg. Directed by Jon Avnet and written by Flagg and Carol Sobieski, it stars Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Mary-Louise Parker. It tells the story of a Depression-era friendship between two women, Ruth and Idgie, and a 1980s friendship between Evelyn, a middle-aged housewife, and Ninny, an elderly woman. The centerpiece and parallel story concerns the murder of Ruth's abusive husband, Frank, and the accusations that follow. It received a generally positive reception from film critics and was nominated for two Academy Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEvelyn Couch, a timid, unhappy housewife in her forties, meets elderly Ninny Threadgoode in an Anderson, Alabama, nursing home. Over several encounters with Evelyn, Ninny tells her the story of the now abandoned town of Whistle Stop, and the people who lived there. The film's subplot concerns Evelyn's dissatisfaction with her marriage, her life, her growing confidence, and her developing friendship with Ninny. The narrative switches several times between Ninny's story, which is set between World War I and World War II, and Evelyn's life in 1980s Birmingham.\\r\\nNinny's story begins with tomboy Idgie Threadgoode, the youngest of the Threadgoode children, whom Ninny describes as her sister-in-law. Idgie's close relationship with her charming older brother, Buddy, is cut short when he is hit by a train and killed. Devastated, she recedes from formal society for much of her childhood and adolescence until Buddy's former girlfriend, the straitlaced Ruth Jamison, intervenes at the request of the concerned Threadgoode family.\\r\\nIdgie initially resists Ruth's attempts at friendship, but gradually a deep attachment develops between them. Ruth leaves Whistle Stop to marry Frank Bennett and moves to Valdosta, Georgia. Idgie tries to forget her but later visits her house to find her pregnant and subject to physical abuse from Frank. Against his wishes and violent attempts to stop her, she returns to Whistle Stop with Idgie, where her baby, a boy whom she names Buddy, Jr., is born. Papa Threadgoode gives Idgie money to start a business so she can care for Ruth and Buddy, Jr. She and Ruth open the Whistle Stop Cafe, employing the family cook, Sipsey, and her son, Big George, who excels with a barbecue that becomes popular with their patrons.\\r\\nFrank eventually returns to Whistle Stop to kidnap Buddy, Jr., but his attempt is thwarted by an unseen assailant, and he is later reported missing. Once his truck appears at the bottom of a nearby drying lake without its owner, Idgie is immediately a suspect, as she had publicly threatened violence against him for beating Ruth. She is detained along with Big George for his murder by Grady Kilgore, the local sheriff, who offers to release her and pin the crime solely on Big George; she refuses to sacrifice him. During the subsequent trial, the local minister, Reverend Scroggins, has no problem lying, providing Idgie and Big George with sound alibi for the time of Frank's disappearance. Taking into account his reputation for getting drunk, the judge rules his death an accident and dismisses the case. Idgie and Big George are cleared of all charges.\\r\\nAfter the trial, Ruth is diagnosed with cancer, becomes very ill, and eventually dies. Following her death, the caf closes. Over time, many Whistle Stop residents eventually move away, bringing Ninny to the end of her story, but not before the revelation of what really happened to Frank. Sipsey killed him with a blow to the head with a heavy cast iron frying pan while trying to prevent him from kidnapping Buddy, Jr. Idgie got Big George to barbecue Frank's body, which was later served to an investigator from Georgia searching for him. The investigator ate with gusto, proclaiming his meal the best pork barbecue he'd ever tasted.\\r\\nEvelyn discovers that during Ninny's temporary stay at the nursing home, her house was condemned and torn down. Evelyn, having become friends with her, offers her a room in her house which she accepts. As they walk away from the empty lot where her house used to be, they pass Ruth's grave, freshly adorned with a jar of honey, a honeycomb, and a card which reads, \\"I'll always love you, the Bee Charmer\\". The Bee Charmer is Ruth's old nickname for Idgie, and the note reveals that she is still alive.\\r\\nUnlike the novel, the film does not make the lesbian romance between the two central characters explicit, instead leaving the relationship between Idgie and Ruth ambiguous.[2] The DVD contains an audio commentary in which the director acknowledges the relationship and points out that a scene between Idgie and Ruth engaging in a food fight was intended to be seen as symbolic love-making. At the time of the film's debut, it was criticized by reviewers and activists for what was seen as \\"glossing over\\" the lesbian relationship.[2][3] However, it won an award from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation for best feature film with lesbian content.[4] It shows examples of discrimination against African Americans, women, and the disabled, but the novel's examination of sexuality-based prejudice through a robust lesbian plot, is made more ambiguous.[5]\\r\\nThough in the book, Idgie and Ninny are two separate characters, at the end of the film it's largely hinted that they are one and the same[citation needed], although this runs counter to Ninny's earlier comment that \\"I was practically adopted by the Threadgoodes; I married her [Idgie's] brother, Cleo\\".\\r\\nAvnet first read the novel in 1987.[6] He was introduced to it by producer Lisa Lindstrom, with whom he worked on television films Heat Wave and Breaking Point. Although he wanted her to give him a synopsis of the story, she insisted he read the book and like her, he loved it. He decided to turn the story into a film and pitched the idea to Norman Lear's company, Act III Communications, who were interested and gave him a small budget for a screenwriter.[7] He hired Carol Sobieski who had written the screenplay for 1982's Annie. She wrote a draft for it as a musical, which he was unhappy with.[7] Sobieski left the project and he hired Flagg, who had been surprised that anyone would want to turn the novel into a film, to develop the script. Although she had some screenwriting experience, she found the process of turning her own novel into a script a strange one. The job was made somewhat easier by the work done by Sobieski and Avnet in choosing which characters from the book were going to be featured, but she found it difficult and also left the project, after writing 70 pages of the screenplay. With no money left to hire another writer, Avnet took the script over himself and spent the next 2ÿ3 years developing it. Flagg gave her blessing to the final draft.[7]\\r\\nAvnet wrote the film with Jessica Tandy in mind; she expressed excitement about making the film.[7] He had worked with Kathy Bates and Chris O'Donnell on the 1990 film Men Don't Leave before offering them the roles of Evelyn Couch and Buddy Threadgoode respectively.[6] When Bates read the script she loved the characters and was particularly keen to work with Tandy.[6] Mary-Louise Parker was casting director David Rubin's first choice for the role of Ruth Jamison. She read for the part several times, initially unhappy with her own tests. When she read along with Mary Stuart Masterson, they?ÿ and the producers?ÿ agreed that they had good chemistry.\\r\\nAvnet hired Barbara Ling as production designer. Scouting for a location, she found Juliette, Georgia, a town that was, according to Avnet, nearly deserted.[7][8] The building chosen to be the Whistle Stop Caf was formerly an antique and hardware store. It was redesigned as a cafe, with a horseshoe shaped counter to allow for optimal camera angles.[7]\\r\\nAfter the release of the film, Juliette saw an influx of tourists and, with Jon Avnet's encouragement, locals opened the Whistle Stop Caf, recreated to mirror the film set.[9] Although \\"Whistle Stop Caf\\" is now a registered trademark, other establishments have appeared using that name.[10] While writing the novel, Flagg based Whistle Stop on Irondale, Alabama, and the caf on a real-life restaurant, the Irondale Caf.[8] She was a frequent visitor there which was formerly owned by her great-aunt.[11]\\r\\nThe scene where Idgie goes to collect honey from a beehive for Ruth was originally intended to be performed by a stunt double. However, after the latter backed out at the last minute, Masterson volunteered to do it herself. The footage of her covered in a swarm of live bees is seen in the final version of the film.[6]\\r\\nThe steam locomotive used in the film is A&WP 290, then in use pulling steam excursions for the New Georgia Railroad.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe film was given a limited release in the US on December 27, 1991, opening in five theaters.[12] It got a wide release four weeks later on January 24, 1992, in 673 theaters. It ran for 19 weeks in total, with its widest release having been 1,331 theaters.[12]\\r\\nThe film grossed a total of $82,418,501 in the United States alone, and took in $37,000,000 outside the US, bringing the total to $119,418,501 worldwide.[12] In its opening weekend it earned $105,317, and at its wide release opening weekend it earned $5,235,940, which was 6.4?percent of its total gross.[12] According to Box Office Mojo, it ranked at no.?11 for all films released in the US in 1991, and no.?5 for PG?13 rated films released that year.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe film was generally well received by critics. Film review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes gave it a \\"fresh\\" score of 73% based on 41 reviews.[13]\\r\\nCritics enjoyed the narrative, but found it conventional and predictable.[3][14] The adaptation of the separate narrative of book to the screen was criticised by Time Out as \\"clumsy\\", Roger Ebert praised the performances, Janet Maslin praised the costume and production design and Emanuel Levy praised the cinematography and score.[3][15] The cast drew praise for their performances, particularly Masterson and Tandy.[3][15]\\r\\nThe film was nominated at the 64th Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Jessica Tandy) and for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium (Fannie Flagg and Carol Sobieski).[16]\\r\\nAt the 46th British Academy Film Awards in 1992, Tandy was nominated for the Best Actress award, and Bates was nominated as Best Actress in a Supporting Role.

It borders Queensland to the north, Victoria to the south, and South Australia to the west. Its coast borders the Tasman Sea to the east.  The Australian Capital Territory is an enclave within the state. New South Wales' state capital is Sydney, which is also Australia's most populous city. In March 2017[update], the population of New South Wales was over 7.8 million,[9] making it Australia's most populous state. Just under two-thirds of the state's population, five million, live in the Greater Sydney area.[10] Inhabitants of New South Wales are referred to as New South Welshmen.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colony of New South Wales was founded as a penal colony in 1788. It originally comprised more than half of the Australian mainland with its western boundary set at 129th meridian east in 1825. The colony also included the island territories of New Zealand, Van Diemen's Land, Lord Howe Island, and Norfolk Island. During the 19th century, most of the colony's area was detached to form separate British colonies that eventually became New Zealand and the various states and territories of Australia. However, the Swan River Colony has never been administered as part of New South Wales.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Howe Island remains part of New South Wales, while Norfolk Island has become a federal territory, as have the areas now known as the Australian Capital Territory and the Jervis Bay Territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prior inhabitants of New South Wales were the Aboriginal tribes who arrived in Australia about 40,000 to 60,000 years ago. Before European settlement there were an estimated 250,000 Aboriginal people in the region.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wodi Wodi people are the original custodians of the Illawarra region of South Sydney.[12] Speaking a variant of the Dharawal language, the Wodi Wodi people lived across a large stretch of land which was roughly surrounded by what is now known as Campbelltown, Shoalhaven River and Moss Vale.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bundjalung people are the original custodians of parts of the northern coastal areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European discovery of New South Wales was made by Captain James Cook during his 1770 survey along the unmapped eastern coast of the Dutch-named continent of New Holland, now Australia. In his original journal(s) covering the survey, in triplicate to satisfy Admiralty Orders, Cook first named the land \\"New Wales\\", named after Wales. However, in the copy held by the Admiralty, he \\"revised the wording\\" to \\"New South Wales\\".[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first British settlement was made by what is known in Australian history as the First Fleet; this was led by Captain Arthur Phillip, who assumed the role of governor of the settlement on arrival in 1788 until 1792.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter years of chaos and anarchy after the overthrow of Governor William Bligh, a new governor, Lieutenant-Colonel (later Major-General) Lachlan Macquarie, was sent from Britain to reform the settlement in 1809.[16] During his time as governor, Macquarie commissioned the construction of roads, wharves, churches and public buildings, sent explorers out from Sydney and employed a planner to design the street layout of Sydney. Macquarie's legacy is still evident today.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 19th century, large areas were successively separated to form the British colonies of Tasmania (proclaimed as a separate colony named Van Diemen's Land in 1825), South Australia (1836), Victoria (1851) and Queensland (1859). Responsible government was granted to the New South Wales colony in 1855. Following the Treaty of Waitangi, William Hobson declared British sovereignty over New Zealand in 1840. In 1841 it was separated from the Colony of New South Wales to form the new Colony of New Zealand.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Darwin visited Australia in January 1836 and in The Voyage of the Beagle (chapter?19 of the 11th edition) records his hesitations about and fascination with New South Wales, including his speculations about the geological origin and formation of the great valleys, the aboriginal population, the situation of the convicts, and the future prospects of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the 19th century, the movement toward federation between the Australian colonies gathered momentum. Conventions and forums involving colony leaders were held on a regular basis. Proponents of New South Wales as a free trade state were in dispute with the other leading colony Victoria, which had a protectionist economy. At this time customs posts were common on borders, even on the Murray River.\\r\\n\\r\\nTravelling from New South Wales to Victoria in those days was very difficult. Supporters of federation included the New South Wales premier Sir Henry Parkes whose 1889 Tenterfield Speech (given in Tenterfield) was pivotal in gathering support for New South Wales involvement. Edmund Barton, later to become Australia's first Prime Minister, was another strong advocate for federation and a meeting held in Corowa in 1893 drafted an initial constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1898 popular referenda on the proposed federation were held in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. All votes resulted in a majority in favour, but the New South Wales government under Premier George Reid (popularly known as \\"yesÿno Reid\\" because of his constant changes of opinion on the issue) had set a requirement for a higher \\"yes\\" vote than just a simple majority which was not met.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1899 further referenda were held in the same states as well as Queensland (but not Western Australia). All resulted in yes votes with majorities increased from the previous year. New South Wales met the conditions its government had set for a yes vote. As a compromise to the question on where the capital was to be located, an agreement was made that the site was to be within New South Wales but not closer than 100 miles (161?km) from Sydney, while the provisional capital would be Melbourne. Eventually the area that now forms the Australian Capital Territory was ceded by New South Wales when Canberra was selected.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the years after World War I, the high prices enjoyed during the war fell with the resumption of international trade. Farmers became increasingly discontented with the fixed prices paid by the compulsory marketing authorities set up as a wartime measure by the Hughes government. In 1919 the farmers formed the Country Party, led at national level by Earle Page, a doctor from Grafton, and at state level by Michael Bruxner, a small farmer from Tenterfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Depression, which began in 1929, ushered in a period of political and class conflict in New South Wales. The mass unemployment and collapse of commodity prices brought ruin to both city workers and to farmers. The beneficiary of the resultant discontent was not the Communist Party, which remained small and weak, but Jack Lang's Labor populism. Lang's second government was elected in November 1930 on a policy of repudiating New South Wales' debt to British bondholders and using the money instead to help the unemployed through public works. This was denounced as illegal by conservatives, and also by James Scullin's federal Labor government. The result was that Lang's supporters in the federal Caucus brought down Scullin's government, causing a second bitter split in the Labor Party. In May 1932 the Governor, Sir Philip Game dismissed his government. The subsequent election was won by the conservative opposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the differences between New South Wales and the other states that had emerged in the 19th century had faded as a result of federation and economic development behind a wall of protective tariffs.[citation needed] New South Wales continued to outstrip Victoria as the centre of industry, and increasingly of finance and trade as well.[citation needed] Labor returned to office under the moderate leadership of William McKell in 1941 and remained in power for 24 years. World War II saw another surge in industrial development to meet the needs of a war economy, and also the elimination of unemployment.\\r\\n\\r\\nLabor stayed in power until 1965. Towards the end of its term in power it announced a plan for the construction of an opera/arts facility on Bennelong Point. The design competition was won by J?rn Utzon. Controversy over the cost of what would eventually become the Sydney Opera House became a political issue and was a factor in the eventual defeat of Labor in 1965 by the conservative Liberal Party led by Sir Robert Askin. Sir Robert remains a controversial figure with supporters claiming him to be reformist especially in terms of reshaping the NSW economy. Others though, regard the Askin era as synonymous with corruption with Askin the head of a network involving NSW police and SP bookmaking (Goot).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1960s a secessionist movement in the New England region of the state led to a referendum on the issue. The new state would have consisted of much of northern NSW including Newcastle. The referendum was narrowly defeated and, as of  2010[update], there are no active or organised campaigns for new states in NSW.\\r\\n\\r\\nAskin's resignation in 1975 was followed by a number of short lived premierships by Liberal Party leaders. When a general election came in 1976 the ALP under Neville Wran were returned to power. Wran was able to transform this narrow one seat victory into landslide wins (known as Wranslide) in 1978 and 1981.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter winning a comfortable though reduced majority in 1984, Wran resigned as premier and left parliament. His replacement Barrie Unsworth struggled to emerge from Wran's shadow and lost a 1988 election against a resurgent Liberal Party led by Nick Greiner. Unsworth was replaced as ALP leader by Bob Carr. Initially Greiner was a popular leader instigating reform such as the creation of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). Greiner called a snap election in 1991 which the Liberals were expected to win. However the ALP polled extremely well and the Liberals lost their majority and needed the support of independents to retain power.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreiner was accused (by ICAC) of corrupt actions involving an allegation that a government position was offered to tempt an independent (who had defected from the Liberals) to resign his seat so that the Liberal party could regain it and shore up its numbers. Greiner resigned but was later cleared of corruption. His replacement as Liberal leader and Premier was John Fahey whose government secured Sydney the right to host the 2000 Summer Olympics. In the 1995 election, Fahey's government lost narrowly and the ALP under Bob Carr returned to power.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Wran before him Carr was able to turn a narrow majority into landslide wins at the next two elections (1999 and 2003). During this era, NSW hosted the 2000 Sydney Olympics which were internationally regarded as very successful, and helped boost Carr's popularity. Carr surprised most people by resigning from office in 2005. He was replaced by Morris Iemma, who remained Premier after being re-elected in the March 2007 state election, until he was replaced by Nathan Rees in September 2008.[17] Rees was subsequently replaced by Kristina Keneally in December 2009.[18] Keneally's government was defeated at the 2011 state election and Barry O'Farrell became Premier on 28 March. On 17 April 2014 O'Farrell stood down as Premier after misleading an ICAC investigation concerning a gift of a bottle of wine. The Liberal Party then elected Treasurer Mike Baird as party leader and Premier. Baird resigned as Premier on 23 January 2017, and was replaced by Gladys Berejiklian.\\r\\n\\r\\nExecutive authority is vested in the Governor of New South Wales, who represents and is appointed by Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. The current Governor is David Hurley. The Governor commissions as Premier the leader of the parliamentary political party that can command a simple majority of votes in the Legislative Assembly. The Premier then recommends the appointment of other Members of the two Houses to the Ministry, under the principle of responsible or Westminster government. As in other Westminster systems, there is no constitutional requirement in NSW for the Government to be formed from the Parliamentmerely convention. The Premier is Gladys Berejiklian of the Liberal Party.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe form of the Government of New South Wales is prescribed in its Constitution, dating from 1856 and currently the Constitution Act 1902 (NSW).[19]  Since 1901 New South Wales has been a state of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Australian Constitution regulates its relationship with the Commonwealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, the Constitution Amendment Pledge of Loyalty Act 2006 No 6,[20] was enacted to amend the NSW Constitution Act 1902 to require Members of the New South Wales Parliament and its Ministers to take a pledge of loyalty to Australia and to the people of New South Wales instead of swearing allegiance to Elizabeth II her heirs and successors, and to revise the oaths taken by Executive Councillors. The Pledge of Loyalty Act was officially assented to by the Queen on 3 April 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Australian Constitution, New South Wales ceded certain legislative and judicial powers to the Commonwealth, but retained independence in all other areas. The New South Wales Constitution says: \\"The Legislature shall, subject to the provisions of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, have power to make laws for the peace, welfare, and good government of New South Wales in all cases whatsoever\\".[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first \\"responsible\\" self-government of New South Wales was formed on 6 June 1856 with Sir Stuart Alexander Donaldson appointed by Governor Sir William Denison as its first Colonial Secretary which in those days accounted also as the Premier.[22] The State Parliament is composed of the Sovereign and two houses: the Legislative Assembly (lower house), and the Legislative Council (upper house). Elections are held every four years on the fourth Saturday of March, the most recent being on 28 March 2015. At each election one member is elected to the Legislative Assembly from each of 93 electoral districts and half of the 42 members of the Legislative Council are elected by a statewide electorate.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew South Wales is divided into 128 local government areas. There is also the Unincorporated Far West Region which is not part of any local government area, in the sparsely inhabited Far West, and Lord Howe Island, which is also unincorporated but self-governed by the Lord Howe Island Board.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew South Wales is policed by the New South Wales Police Force, a statutory authority. Established in 1862, the NSW Police Force investigates Summary and Indictable offences throughout the State of New South Wales. The state has two fire services: the volunteer based New South Wales Rural Fire Service, which is responsible for the majority of the state, and the Fire and Rescue NSW, a government agency responsible for protecting urban areas. There is some overlap due to suburbanisation. Ambulance services are provided through the Ambulance Service of New South Wales. Rescue services (i.e. vertical, road crash, confinement) are a joint effort by all emergency services, with Ambulance Rescue, Police Rescue Squad and Fire Rescue Units contributing. Volunteer rescue organisations include the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard, State Emergency Service (SES), Surf Life Saving New South Wales and Volunteer Rescue Association (VRA).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe estimated population of New South Wales at the end of September 2017 was 7,895,800 people.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of the 2016 census, the principal ancestries of New South Wales's residents  are:[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nSydney was home to almost two-thirds (65.5%) of the NSW population as at the 2016 Census.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nPassage through New South Wales is vital for cross-continent transport. Rail and road traffic from Brisbane (Queensland) to Perth (Western Australia), or to Melbourne (Victoria) must pass through New South Wales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of railways in New South Wales are currently operated by the state government. Some lines began as branch-lines of railways starting in other states. For instance, Balranald near the Victorian border was connected by a rail line coming up from Victoria and into New South Wales. Another line beginning in Adelaide crossed over the border and stopped at Broken Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nRailways management are conducted by Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink[27] which maintain rolling stock. Sydney Trains operates trains within Sydney while NSW TrainLink operates outside Sydney, intercity, country and interstate services.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink have their main terminus at Sydney's Central station. NSW TrainLink regional and long-distance services consist of XPT services to Grafton, Casino, Brisbane, Melbourne and Dubbo, as well as Xplorer services to Canberra, Griffith, Broken Hill, Armidale and Moree. NSW TrainLink intercity trains operate on the Blue Mountains Line, Central Cost & Newcastle Line, South Coast Line, Southern Highlands Line and Hunter Line.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor roads are the concern of both federal and state governments. The latter maintains these through the Department of Roads and Maritime Services, formerly the Roads and Traffic Authority, and before that, the Department of Main Roads (DMR).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main roads in New South Wales are\\r\\n\\r\\nOther roads are usually the concern of the RMS and/or the local government authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nKingsford Smith Airport (commonly Sydney Airport, and locally referred to as Mascot Airport or just 'Mascot'), located in the southern Sydney suburb of Mascot is the major airport for not just the state but the whole nation. It is a hub for Australia's national airline Qantas.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther airlines serving regional New South Wales include:[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state government through Sydney Ferries operates ferries within Sydney Harbour and the Parramatta River. It also has a ferry service within Newcastle.[32] All other ferry services are privately operated.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpirit of Tasmania ran a commercial ferry service between Sydney and Devonport, Tasmania. This service was terminated in 2006.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate boat services operated between South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales along the Murray and Darling Rivers but these only exist now as the occasional tourist paddle-wheeler service.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NSW school system comprises a kindergarten to year 12 system with primary schooling up to year 6 and secondary schooling between years 7 and 12. Schooling is compulsory from before 6 years old until the age of 17 (unless Year 10 is completed earlier).[36]. Between 1990 and 2010, schooling was only compulsory in NSW until age 15.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrimary and secondary schools include government and non-government schools. Government schools are further classified as comprehensive and selective schools. Non-government schools include Catholic schools, other denominational schools, and non-denominational independent schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypically, a primary school provides education from kindergarten level to year 6. A secondary school, usually called a \\"high school\\", provides education from years 7 to 12. Secondary colleges are secondary schools which only cater for years 11 and 12.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NSW Education Standards Authority classifies the 13 years of primary and secondary schooling into six stages, beginning with Early Stage 1 (Kindergarten) and ending with Stage 6 (years 11 and 12).[38][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Record of School Achievement (RoSA) is awarded by the NSW Education Standards Authority to students who have completed at least Year 10 but leave school without completing the Higher School Certificate.[40] The RoSA was introduced in 2012 to replace the former School Certificate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Higher School Certificate (HSC) is the usual Year 12 leaving certificate in NSW. Most students complete the HSC prior to entering the workforce or going on to study at university or TAFE (although the HSC itself can be completed at TAFE). The HSC must be completed for a student to get an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (formerly Universities Admission Index), which determines the student's rank against fellow students who completed the Higher School Certificate.\\r\\n\\r\\nEleven universities primarily operate in New South Wales. Sydney is home to Australia's first university, the University of Sydney founded in 1850. Other universities include the University of New South Wales, Macquarie University, the University of Technology, Sydney and Western Sydney University. The Australian Catholic University has two of its six campuses in Sydney, and the private University of Notre Dame Australia also operates a secondary campus in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside Sydney, the leading universities are the University of Newcastle and the University of Wollongong. Armidale is home to the University of New England, and Charles Sturt University and Southern Cross University have campuses spread across cities in the state's south-west and north coast respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe public universities are state government agencies, however they are largely regulated by the federal government, which also administers their public funding. Admission to NSW universities is arranged together with universities in the Australian Capital Territory by another government agency, the Universities Admission Centre.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrimarily vocational training is provided up the level of advanced diplomas is provided by the state government's ten Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institutes. These institutes run courses in more than130 campuses throughout the state.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew South Wales is bordered on the north by Queensland, on the west by South Australia, on the south by Victoria and on the east by the Tasman Sea. The Australian Capital Territory and the Jervis Bay Territory form a separately administered entity that is bordered entirely by New South Wales. The state can be divided geographically into four areas. New South Wales' three largest cities, Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong, lie near the centre of a narrow coastal strip extending from cool temperate areas on the far south coast to subtropical areas near the Queensland border.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Illawarra region is centred on the city of Wollongong, with the Shoalhaven, Eurobodalla and the Sapphire Coast to the south. The Central Coast lies between Sydney and Newcastle, with the Mid North Coast and Northern Rivers regions reaching northwards to the Queensland border. Tourism is important to the economies of coastal towns such as Coffs Harbour, Lismore, Nowra and Port Macquarie, but the region also produces seafood, beef, dairy, fruit, sugar cane and timber.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Dividing Range extends from Victoria in the south through New South Wales to Queensland, parallel to the narrow coastal plain. This area includes the Snowy Mountains, the Northern, Central and Southern Tablelands, the Southern Highlands and the South West Slopes. Whilst not particularly steep, many peaks of the range rise above 1,000 metres (3,281?ft), with the highest Mount Kosciuszko at 2,229?m (7,313?ft). Skiing in Australia began in this region at Kiandra around 1861. The relatively short ski season underwrites the tourist industry in the Snowy Mountains. Agriculture, particularly the wool industry, is important throughout the highlands. Major centres include Armidale, Bathurst, Bowral, Goulburn, Inverell, Orange, Queanbeyan and Tamworth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are numerous forests in New South Wales, with such tree species as Red Gum Eucalyptus and Crow Ash (Flindersia australis), being represented.[41] Forest floors have a diverse set of understory shrubs and fungi. One of the widespread fungi is Witch's Butter (Tremella mesenterica).[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe western slopes and plains fill a significant portion of the state's area and have a much sparser population than areas nearer the coast. Agriculture is central to the economy of the western slopes, particularly the Riverina region and Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area in the state's south-west. Regional cities such as Albury, Dubbo, Griffith and Wagga Wagga and towns such as Deniliquin, Leeton and Parkes exist primarily to service these agricultural regions. The western slopes descend slowly to the western plains that comprise almost two-thirds of the state and are largely arid or semi-arid. The mining town of Broken Hill is the largest centre in this area.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne possible definition of the centre for New South Wales is located 33 kilometres (21?mi) west-north-west of Tottenham.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major part of New South Wales, west of the Great Dividing Range, has an arid to semi arid climate. Rainfall averages from 150 millimetres (5.9?in) to 500 millimetres (20?in) a year throughout most of this region. Summer temperatures can be very hot, while winter nights can be quite cold in this region. Rainfall varies throughout the state. The far north-west receives the least, less than 180?mm (7?in) annually, while the east receives between 700 to 1,400?mm (28 to 55?in) of rain.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe climate along the flat, coastal plain east of the range varies from oceanic in the south to humid subtropical in the northern half of the state, right above Wollongong. Rainfall is highest in this area; however, it still varies from around 800 millimetres (31?in) to as high as 3,000 millimetres (120?in) in the wettest areas, for example Dorrigo. Along the southern coast, rainfall is heaviest in winter due to cold fronts which move across southern Australia. While in the far north, around Lismore, rain is heaviest in summer from tropical systems and occasionally even cyclones.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe climate in the southern half of the state is generally warm to hot in summer and cool in the winter. The seasons are more defined in the southern half of the state, especially as one moves inland towards South West Slopes, Central West and the Riverina region. The climate in the northeast region of the state, or the North Coast, bordering Queensland, is hot and humid in the summer and mild in winter. The Northern Tablelands, which are also on the north coast, have relatively mild summers and cold winters, due to their high elevation on the Great Dividing Range.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeaks along the Great Dividing Range vary from 500 metres (1,640?ft) to over 2,000 metres (6,562?ft) above sea level. Temperatures can be cool to cold in winter with frequent frosts and snowfall, and are rarely hot in summer due to the elevation. Lithgow has a climate typical of the range, as do the regional cities of Orange, Cooma, Oberon and Armidale. Such places fall within the subtropical highland (Cwb) variety. Rainfall is moderate in this area, ranging from 600 to 800?mm (24 to 31?in).\\r\\n\\r\\nSnowfall is common in the higher parts of the range, sometimes occurring as far north as the Queensland border. On the highest peaks of the Snowy Mountains, the climate can be subpolar oceanic and even alpine on the higher peaks with very cold temperatures and heavy snow. The Blue Mountains, Southern Tablelands and Central Tablelands, which are situated on the Great Dividing Range, have mild to warm summers and cold winters, although not as severe as those in the Snowy Mountains.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest maximum temperature recorded was 49.7?C (121?F) at Menindee in the west of the state on 10 January 1939. The lowest minimum temperature was ?23?C (?9?F) at Charlotte Pass in the Snowy Mountains on 29 June 1994. This is also the lowest temperature recorded in the whole of Australia excluding the Antarctic Territory.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1970s, New South Wales has undergone an increasingly rapid economic and social transformation.[citation needed] Old industries such as steel and shipbuilding have largely disappeared; although agriculture remains important, its share of the state's income is smaller than ever before.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew industries such as information technology and financial services are largely centred in Sydney and have risen to take their place, with many companies having their Australian headquarters in Sydney CBD.[citation needed] In addition, the Macquarie Park area of Sydney has attracted the Australian headquarters of many information technology firms.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoal and related products are the state's biggest export. Its value to the state's economy is over A$5?billion, accounting for about 19% of all exports from NSW.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nTourism has also become important, with Sydney as its centre, also stimulating growth on the North Coast, around Coffs Harbour and Byron Bay.[citation needed] Tourism is worth over $25.1 billion to the New South Wales economy and employs 7.1% of the workforce.[49]\\r\\nIn 2007, then-Premier of New South Wales Morris Iemma established Events New South Wales to \\"market Sydney and NSW as a leading global events destination\\". In July 2011 Events NSW merged with three key state authorities including Tourism NSW to establish Destination NSW (DNSW).[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew South Wales had a Gross State Product in 2010ÿ11 (equivalent to Gross Domestic Product) of $419.9?billion which equalled $57,828 per capita.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 9 October 2007 NSW announced plans to build a 1,000 MW bank of wind powered turbines. The output of these is anticipated to be able to power up to 400,000 homes. The cost of this project will be $1.8?billion for 500 turbines.[52] On 28 August 2008 the New South Wales cabinet voted to privatise electricity retail, causing 1,500 electrical workers to strike after a large anti-privatisation campaign.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NSW business community is represented by the NSW Business Chamber which has 30,000 members.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgriculture is spread throughout the eastern two-thirds of New South Wales. Cattle, sheep and pigs are the predominant types of livestock produced in NSW and they have been present since their importation during the earliest days of European settlement. Economically the state is the most important state in Australia, with about one-third of the country's sheep, one-fifth of its cattle, and one-third of its small number of pigs.\\r\\nNew South Wales produces a large share of Australia's hay, fruit, legumes, lucerne, maize, nuts, wool, wheat, oats, oilseeds (about 51%), poultry, rice (about 99%),[54] vegetables, fishing including oyster farming, and forestry including wood chips.[55] Bananas and sugar are grown chiefly in the Clarence, Richmond and Tweed River areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nWools are produced on the Northern Tablelands as well as prime lambs and beef cattle. The cotton industry is centred in the Namoi Valley in northwestern New South Wales. On the central slopes there are many orchards, with the principal fruits grown being apples, cherries and pears.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 40,200 hectares of vineyards lie across the eastern region of the state, with excellent wines produced in the Hunter Valley, with the Riverina being the largest wine producer in New South Wales.[56] Australias largest and most valuable Thoroughbred horse breeding area is centred on Scone in the Hunter Valley.[57] The Hunter Valley is the home of the world-famous Coolmore,[58] Darley and Kia-Ora Thoroughbred horse studs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout half of Australia's timber production is in New South Wales. Large areas of the state are now being replanted with eucalyptus forests.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Water Management Act 2000, updated riparian water rights were given to those within NSW with livestock. This change was named \\"The Domestic Stock Right\\" which gives \\"an owner or occupier of a landholding is entitled to take water from a river, estuary or lake which fronts their land or from an aquifer which is underlying their land for domestic consumption and stock watering without the need for an access licence.\\"[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew South Wales has more than 780 national parks and reserves covering more than 8% of the state.[60] These parks range from rainforests, waterfalls, rugged bush to marine wonderlands and outback deserts, including World Heritage sites.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royal National Park on the southern outskirts of Sydney became Australia's first National Park when proclaimed on 26 April 1879. Originally named The National Park until 1955, this park was the second National Park to be established in the world after Yellowstone National Park in the U.S. Kosciuszko National Park is the largest park in state encompassing New South Wales' alpine region.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Parks Association was formed in 1957 to create a system of national parks all over New South Wales which led to the formation of the National Parks and Wildlife Service in 1967.[63] This government agency is responsible for developing and maintaining the parks and reserve system, and conserving natural and cultural heritage, in the state of New South Wales. These parks preserve special habitats, plants and wildlife, such as the Wollemi National Park where the Wollemi Pine grows and areas sacred to Australian Aboriginals such as Mutawintji National Park in western New South Wales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout Australian history, New South Wales sporting teams have been very successful in both winning domestic competitions and providing players to the Australian national teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest sporting competition in the state is the National Rugby League, which is based in Sydney and expanded from the New South Wales Rugby League. The state is represented by the New South Wales Blues in the State of Origin series. Sydney is the spiritual home of Australian rugby league and hosts nine of the 16 NRL teams: Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Cronulla Sharks, Manly Sea Eagles, Parramatta Eels, Penrith Panthers, South Sydney Rabbitohs, Sydney Roosters and Wests Tigers, as well as being the northern home of the St George Illawarra Dragons, which is based in Wollongong. A tenth team, the Newcastle Knights is located in Newcastle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state is represented by four teams in soccer's A-League: Sydney FC (2005-06, 2009-10, 2016-17 champions), Western Sydney Wanderers (2014 Asian champions), Central Coast Mariners (2012-13 champions) and Newcastle United Jets (2007ÿ08 A League Champions).\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralian rules football has historically not been strong in New South Wales outside the Riverina region. However, the Sydney Swans relocated from South Melbourne in 1982 and their presence and success since the late 1990s has raised the profile of Australian rules football, especially after their AFL premiership in 2005. A second NSW AFL club, the Greater Western Sydney Giants, entered the competition in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main summer sport is cricket and the Sydney Cricket Ground hosts the 'New Year' cricket Test match in January each year. The NSW Blues play in the One-Day Cup and Sheffield Shield competitions. Sydney Sixers and Sydney Thunder both play in the Big Bash League.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther teams in major national competitions include the Sydney Kings and Illawarra Hawks in the National Basketball League, Sydney Uni Flames in the Women's National Basketball League, NSW Waratahs in Super Rugby and New South Wales Swifts in Suncorp Super Netball.\\r\\n\\r\\nSydney was the host of the 2000 Summer Olympics and the 1938 British Empire Games. The Olympic Stadium, now known as ANZ Stadium hosts major events including the NRL Grand Final, State of Origin, rugby union and football internationals. It hosted the final of the 2003 Rugby World Cup and the 2015 AFC Asian Cup, as well as the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifier between Australia and Uruguay, qualifying Australia for their first World Cup since 1974.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe annual Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race begins in Sydney Harbour on Boxing Day. Bathurst hosts the annual Bathurst 1000 as part of the Supercars Championship at Mount Panorama Circuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe popular equine sports of campdrafting and polocrosse were developed in New South Wales and competitions are now held across Australia. Polocrosse is now played in many overseas countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor professional teams include:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Australia's most populous state, New South Wales is home to a number of cultural institutions of importance to the nation. In music, New South Wales is home to the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Australia's busiest and largest orchestra. Australia's largest opera company, Opera Australia, is headquartered in Sydney. Both of these organisations perform a subscription series at the Sydney Opera House. Other major musical bodies include the Australian Chamber Orchestra. Sydney is host to the Australian Ballet for its Sydney season (the ballet is headquartered in Melbourne). Apart from the Sydney Opera House, major musical performance venues include the City Recital Hall and the Sydney Town Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNew South Wales is home to several major museums and art galleries, including the Australian Museum, the Powerhouse Museum, the Museum of Sydney, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Museum of Contemporary Art.\\r\\n Sydney is home to five Arts teaching organisations, which have all produced world-famous students: The National Art School, The College of Fine Arts, the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), the Australian Film, Television & Radio School and the Conservatorium of Music (now part of the University of Sydney).\\r\\n\\r\\nNew South Wales is the setting and shooting location of many Australian films, including Mad Max 2, which was shot near the mining town of Broken Hill. The state has also attracted international productions, both as a setting, such as in Mission: Impossible 2, and as a stand-in for other locations, as seen in The Matrix franchise, The Great Gatsby and Unbroken.[64][65] 20th Century Fox operates Fox Studios Australia in Sydney.

As of 2000, it had a worldwide membership of over 8,000,000, with almost 60,000 churches in 144 countries. The headquarters are in Los Angeles, California, United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1922, Aimee Semple McPherson (1890ÿ1944), an evangelist known as \\"Sister Aimee\\", explained for the first time her definition of the term Foursquare Gospel (theological concept \\"Full Gospel\\"). [1] According to chapter 1 of Book of Ezekiel, Ezekiel had a vision of God as revealed to be four different aspects: a man, a lion, an ox and an eagle. It also represents the four aspects of the Department of Christ; Savior, Baptizer with the Holy Spirit, Healer and Soon-coming King. This will be the vision and the name that she will give at Foursquare Church, founded in 1923 to Los Angeles.[2] Los Angeles was her center of operations, and Angelus Temple, seating 5,300 people, was opened in Echo Park in 1923.[3]  The attendance has become a megachurch with 10 000 people. [4] McPherson was a flamboyant celebrity in her day, participating in publicity events, such as weekly Sunday parades through the streets of Los Angeles, along with the mayor and movie stars, directly to Angelus Temple. She built the temple, as well as what is now known as Life Pacific College adjacent to it, on the northwest corner of land that she owned in the middle of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcPherson's celebrity status continued after her death, with biopics such as the 1976 Hallmark Hall of Fame drama The Disappearance of Aimee depicting her life, as well as the 2006 independent film Aimee Semple McPherson, which particularly focused on her month-long disappearance in MayÿJune 1926 and the legal controversy that followed.[5][6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Aimee Semple McPherson's death in 1944, her son Rolf K. McPherson became president and leader of the church, a position he held for 44 years.[8] [9]   The Foursquare Church formed the \\"Pentecostal Fellowship of North America\\" in 1948 in Des Moines, Iowa, in an alliance with the Assemblies of God, the Church of God, the Open Bible Standard Churches, the Pentecostal Holiness Church, and others. In 1994, 46 years after the founding of the Pentecostal Fellowship, it was reorganized as the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America after combining with African-American organizations, most significantly the Church of God in Christ.\\r\\nOn May 31, 1988, John R. Holland became the Church's third President, a position he held until July 1997.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nHarold Helms served as interim president from July 1997 until July 1998; he was followed by Paul C. Risser, who became the president on April 16, 1998, at the church's 75th annual convention.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2003, under Risser's tenure, the church sold Los Angeles radio station KFSG-FM to the Spanish Broadcasting System for $250 million.[11]  Risser's leadership led to another high-profile controversy for the church, when, without the involvement of the denomination's board of directors and finance council, church funds were invested in firms that targeted the \\"close-knit evangelical community\\"  but turned out to be Ponzi schemes.[12]  Risser resigned his leadership position under fire in March 2004.\\r\\n\\r\\nJack W. Hayford, founder of The Church On The Way in Van Nuys, California served as the president of the Foursquare Church from 2004 to 2009. Hayford along with Pastors Roy Hicks, Jr. in Eugene, Oregon, Jerry Cook in Gresham, Oregon, Ronald D. Mehl of the Beaverton Foursquare Church in Beaverton, Oregon, and John Holland in Vancouver, British Columbia, have been credited by the church with setting a plan for the denomination's continued survival in spite of its staggering financial losses estimated at $15 million under the failed leadership of Paul Risser.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foursquare denomination, under Hayford's leadership, is in \\"Missional Conversation\\" with the emerging church movement, claimed to be part of a \\"Church Multiplication\\" effort.[14]  \\"Church Multiplication\\" also supports the house church movement through resources that support the expansion of \\"Foursquare Simple Church Networks.\\"[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nGlenn Burris Jr. has held the position of  president of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel since June 2009. In 2014, facts came to light that under Burris' leadership, the Church lost yet another $2 million in a failed investment of a Broadway play based on the life of Aimee McPherson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beliefs of the Foursquare Church are expressed in its Declaration of Faith, compiled by its founder Aimee Semple McPherson.[16] McPherson also authored a shorter, more concise creedal statement.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe church believes in the verbal inspiration of the Bible, the doctrine of the Trinity, and the deity of Jesus Christ.[18] It believes that human beings were created in the image of God but, because of the Fall, are naturally depraved and sinful.[19] It believes in the substitutionary atonement accomplished by the death of Christ. The church teaches that salvation is by grace through faith and not by good works.[20] Believers are justified by faith and born again upon repentance and acceptance of Christ as Lord and king.[21] Consistent with its belief in human free will, the Foursquare Church also teaches that it is possible for a believer to backslide or commit apostasy.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foursquare Church teaches that sanctification is a continual process of spiritual growth.[23] Christian perfection and holiness can be attained through surrender and consecration to God. This spiritual growth is believed to be promoted by Bible study and prayer.[24] The Foursquare Church believes in the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an event separate from conversion that empowers the individual and the wider church to fulfill the church's mission of evangelization. The Foursquare Church expects Spirit baptism to be received in the same manner as recorded in the Book of Acts, namely that the believer will receive spiritual gifts, possibly (though not necessarily) including speaking in tongues.[25] The evidence of the Spirit-filled life is the Fruit of the Spirit. The church believes that spiritual gifts continue in operation for the edification of the church.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foursquare Church believes that divine healing is a part of Christs atonement. It teaches that the sick can be healed in response to prayer.[27] The Foursquare Church anticipates a premillennial return of Christ to earth.[28] It believes that there will be a future final judgment where the righteous will receive everlasting life and the wicked everlasting punishment. The Foursquare Church observes believer's baptism by immersion and the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion as ordinances.[29] Open communion is practiced.[30] Anointing of the sick and tithing are practiced as well.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foursquare Convention is the chief decision making body of the Foursquare Church. Meeting regularly every year, the convention's voting membership includes international officers and licensed ministers. Each Foursquare church located in the United States has the right to send one voting delegate per every 50 church members.[32] National Foursquare Churches outside of the United States may send one official delegate to the convention.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nA board of 12 to 20 directors manages the Foursquare Church. In addition to overseeing the Church's activities, the board of directors appoints officers and is responsible for licensing and ordaining ministers. Members of the board include the president, vice presidents, and at least nine ministers representing geographic regions. Church members in good standing may also be appointed to the board.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Foursquare churches are subordinate parts of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel and are operated according to the bylaws of the international church. There are two categories of Foursquare churches.[35] A \\"charter member church\\" is a member church that has no legal existence apart from the international church and whose property is owned by the international church. The second category is \\"covenant member church\\", which include \\"pioneer churches\\" and previously non-member churches. Pioneer churches are recently established church plants that have not been upgraded to charter member status. Covenant member churches might also be previously non-member churches that join the Foursquare Church but choose not to transfer their real property to the international church.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-member churches may choose to affiliate with the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel without becoming a full member of the international church. These \\"community member churches\\" retain their separate legal identities and autonomy. They are not under the control or authority of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, and they license or ordain their own ministers. Community member churches affiliate with the Foursquare Church \\"on a relational basis of shared principles, endeavors, goals and purpose\\". This relationship between the international church and the community member church can be terminated by either party with or without cause.[37] Members of community member churches are not members of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the church is divided into districts, divisions, and individual churches. A General Supervisor oversees the national office and district supervisors; district supervisors oversee divisional superintendents who have oversight of individual churches within the local region. Rev. Tammy Dunahoo currently (2014) serves as General Supervisor.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo colleges are affiliated with the Foursquare Church.  These are: Life Pacific College, formerly \\"L. I. F. E. Bible College,\\" in San Dimas, California, and Pacific Life Bible College in Surrey, British Columbia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe update in the 2008 Foursquare Church Annual Report provides 2007 data of the movement's statistics in the United States, as of April 1, 2008:\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 30 churches from Louisiana and Mississippi are said to be formalizing into the Foursquare Church as of October, 2010.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, membership in the United States was 353,995 in 1,875 churches.[39] While congregations are concentrated along the West Coast, the denomination is well distributed across the United States.[40] The states with the highest membership rates are Oregon, Hawaii, Montana, Washington, and California.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, Anna D. Britton, a graduate of L.I.F.E. Bible College in Los Angeles, moved to Vancouver, B.C. in 1927, established L.I.F.E. Bible College of Canada in 1928 and grew a small group of believers into a congregation of nearly 1,000, known as Kingsway Foursquare Church.  Her vision prompted her to extend the Foursquare Gospel to the three western provinces of Canada over which she served as Supervisor for many years.  Other Supervisors of the Western Canada District have been, B.A. McKeown, Clarence Hall, Warren Johnson, Guy Duffield, Charles Baldwin, Harold Wood, Roy Hicks Sr., and John Holland.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictor Gardner became Supervisor of the Western Canada District in 1974.  Eventually, in order to comply with Canadian law, The Western Canada District needed to register all properties in the name of a Canadian Corporation and gain control of all finances as well.  Victor Gardner led the development of the Constitution and Bylaws, the Administrative Manual and oversaw the transfer of all the legal documents so on March 5, 1981, the Foursquare Gospel Church of Canada (FGCC) came into being.[41][not in citation given]\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Peterson was President of the FGCC from 1992ÿ2007.

Although similarly named, the annual report on Form 10-K is distinct from the often glossy \\"annual report to shareholders,\\" which a company must send to its shareholders when it holds an annual meeting to elect directors (though some companies combine the annual report and the 10-K into one document). The 10-K includes information such as company history, organizational structure, executive compensation, equity, subsidiaries, and audited financial statements, among other information.\\r\\nCompanies with more than $10 million in assets and a class of equity securities that is held by more than 2000 owners must file annual and other periodic reports, regardless of whether the securities are publicly or privately traded. Up until March 16, 2009, smaller companies could use Form 10-KSB. If a shareholder requests a companys Form 10-K, the company must provide a copy. In addition, most large companies must disclose on Form 10-K whether the company makes its periodic and current reports available, free of charge, on its website. Form 10-K, as well as other SEC filings may be searched at the EDGAR database on the SEC's website.\\r\\nIn addition to the 10-K, which is filed annually, a company is also required to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Information for the final quarter of a firm's fiscal year is included in the annual 10-K, so only three 10-Q filings are made each year. In the period between these filings, and in case of a significant event, such as a CEO departing or bankruptcy, a Form 8-K must be filed in order to provide up to date information.\\r\\nThe name of the Form 10-K comes from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) designation of the form pursuant to sections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike the 10-K filed annually, other forms serve related purposes, but have different schedules.

Due to confusion in its application, the 10-K405 was eliminated in 2002.\\r\\nHistorically, Form 10-K had to be filed with the SEC within 90 days after the end of the company's fiscal year. However, in 2004, the SEC approved a Final Rule that changed the deadlines to 60 days for Form 10-K for \\"accelerated filers\\"; meaning issuers that have a public float of at least $75 million, that have been subject to the Exchange Act's reporting requirements for at least 12 calendar months, that previously have filed at least one annual report, and that are not eligible to file their quarterly and annual reports on Forms 10-QSB and 10-KSB. These shortened deadlines were to be phased in over a three-year period, however in 2004 the SEC postponed the three-year phase in by one year.

As of December 27, 2005, the deadline for filing for large accelerated filers was still 75 days, however beginning with the fiscal year ending on or after December 15, 2006, the deadline was changed to 60 days.

It is a planned city and was built mainly in the 1980s,[5] replacing the country's most populous city of Lagos as the capital on 12 December 1991. Abuja's geography is defined by Aso Rock, a 400-metre (1,300?ft) monolith left by water erosion. The Presidential Complex, National Assembly, Supreme Court and much of the city extend to the south of the rock. Zuma Rock, a 792-metre (2,598?ft) monolith, lies just north of the city on the expressway to Kaduna.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 2006 census, the city of Abuja had a population of 776,298,[6] making it one of the ten most populous cities in Nigeria. According to the United Nations, Abuja grew by 139.7% between 2000 and 2010, making it the fastest growing city in the world.[7]\\r\\nAs of  2015[update], the city is experiencing an annual growth of at least 35%, retaining its position as the fastest-growing city on the African continent and one of the fastest-growing in the world.[8] As at 2016, the metropolitan area of Abuja is estimated at six million persons, placing it behind only Lagos, as the most populous metro area in Nigeria.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor religious sites include the Nigerian National Mosque and the Nigerian National Christian Centre. The city is served by the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport. Abuja is known for being one of the few purpose-built capital cities in Africa, as well as being one of the wealthiest.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbuja is Nigeria's administrative and political centre. It is also a key capital on the African continent due to Nigeria's geo-political influence in regional affairs. Abuja is also a conference centre and hosts various meetings annually, such as the 2003 Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting and the 2014 World Economic Forum (Africa) meetings.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Abuja\\" was in the earlier 20th century the name of the nearby town now called Suleja.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe indigenous inhabitants of Abuja are the Gbagyi (Gwari) as the major language, Bassa, Gwandara, Gade, Ganagana,  Koro etc. In light of the ethnic and religious divisions of Nigeria, plans had been devised since Nigeria's independence to have its capital in a place deemed neutral to all major ethnic parties, and also in close proximity to all the regions of Nigeria. The location was eventually designated in the centre of the country in the early 1970s as it signified neutrality and national unity. Another impetus for Abuja came because of Lagos' population boom that made that city overcrowded and conditions squalid. As Lagos was already undergoing rapid economic development, the Nigerian regime felt the need to expand the economy towards the inner part of the country, and hence decided to move its capital to Abuja.[11] The logic used was similar to the way Brazil planned its capital, Braslia. The decision to move to Abuja was made by General Murtala Mohammed in 1976.[12] Construction started in the late 1970s but, due to economic and political instability, the initial stages of the city were not complete until the late 1980s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe master plan for Abuja and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) was developed by International Planning Associates (IPA), a consortium of three American firms: Planning Research Corporation; Wallace, McHarg, Roberts and Todd;[13] and Archisystems, a division of the Hughes Organization. The master plan for Abuja defined the general structure and major design elements of the city that are visible in its current form. More detailed design of the central areas of the capital, particularly its monumental core, was accomplished by Japanese architect Kenzo Tange, with his team of city planners at Kenzo Tange and Urtec company.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost countries relocated their embassies to Abuja, and many maintain their former embassies as consulates in Lagos, the commercial capital of Nigeria. Abuja is the headquarters of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the regional headquarters of OPEC. Abuja and the FCT have experienced huge population growth; it has been reported that some areas around Abuja have been growing at 20% to 30% per year.[14] Squatter settlements and towns have spread rapidly in and outside the city limits.[5][15] Tens of thousands of people have been evicted since former FCT minister Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai started a demolition campaign in 2003.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbuja under K?ppen climate classification features a tropical wet and dry climate (K?ppen: Aw). The FCT experiences three weather conditions annually. This includes a warm, humid rainy season and a blistering dry season. In between the two, there is a brief interlude of harmattan occasioned by the northeast trade wind, with the main feature of dust haze and dryness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rainy season begins from April and ends in October, when daytime temperatures reach 28?C (82.4?F) to 30?C (86.0?F)  and nighttime lows hover around 22?C (71.6?F) to 23?C (73.4?F). In the dry season, daytime temperatures can soar as high as 40?C (104.0?F) and nighttime temperatures can dip to 12?C (53.6?F). Even the chilliest nights can be followed by daytime temperatures well above 30?C (86.0?F). The high altitudes and undulating terrain of the FCT act as a moderating influence on the weather of the territory. The city's inland location causes the diurnal temperature variation to be much larger than coastal cities with similar climates such as Lagos.\\r\\n\\r\\nRainfall in the FCT reflects the territory's location on the windward side of the Jos Plateau and the zone of rising air masses with the city receiving frequent rainfall during the rainy season from April to October every year.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FCT falls within the Guinean forest-savanna mosaic zone of the West African sub-region. Patches of rain forest, however, occur in the Gwagwa plains, especially in the rugged terrain to the southeastern parts of the territory, where a landscape of gullies and rough terrain is found. These areas of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) form one of the few surviving occurrences of the mature forest vegetation in Nigeria.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbuja city is run by the Abuja Municipal Area Council. In addition to the civic administration the city is the location for the federal government of Nigeria, and likewise the Federal Capital Territory Administration which is responsible for the encompassing Federal Capital Territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Abuja Municipal Area Council is the local government responsible for administration of the city. Coucillorship and chairmanship elections are held regularly. The People's Democratic Party won the 2013 election, as it had in 2010.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FCT is headed by the FCT Minister, currently Malam Muhammad Bello, who is appointed by central government.

Each Phase is separated from the other by an expressway (some still under construction); for example, Phases 1 and 2 are separated from each other by the Nnamdi Azikiwe expressway, while the entirety of the city proper (Phases 1-5) are enclosed by the Murtala Muhammed (Outer Northern-ONEX and Outer Southern-OSEX) expressways as well as the Federal A2 highway which traverses the Federal Capital Territory on its way to Kaduna (north-bound) and Lokoja (south-bound). Thus there is an integration of the citys road network with the Federal highway network, providing access to the immediate outlying countryside and the surrounding states of the country i.e. Niger State to the west, Kaduna State to the north, Nasarawa State to the east and Kogi State to the south.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phase 1 area of the city is divided into ten districts known as cadastral zones.[21][not in citation given]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also sixteen districts in Phase 2.[21][not in citation given]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are eleven districts in Phase 3.[21][not in citation given]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are five suburban districts: Nyanya, Karu, Gwagwalada, Kubwa, and Jukwoyi.

This structure looms 170 metres (560?ft) above the city. The tower is part of a huge cultural development complex called the Nigeria National Complex including the Nigeria Cultural Centre, a 120,000?m2 (1,300,000?sq?ft) structure dedicated to the art and culture of Nigeria. The Cultural Centre and the Millennium Tower have been designed by the Italian architect Manfredi Nicoletti.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandmarks include the Millennium Tower, the Central Bank of Nigeria headquarters, the Nigerian Presidential Complex, the Ship House, the National Stadium,which was the main venue of the 2003 All Africa Games and some games, including the final, of the 2009 FIFA Under-17 World Cup, National Mosque, the National Church, Aso Rock and Zuma Rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbuja City Gate\\r\\n\\r\\nZuma rock\\r\\n\\r\\nAbuja National Mosque\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Cenotaph houses the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and hosts Armed Forces Remembrance Day ceremonies on 15 January annually.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Federal Ministry of Transportation headquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grounds of Eagle Square shown here being readied for a church event.\\r\\n\\r\\nA view of the Millenium tower as seen from the Federal Secretariat just before sunset.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Federal Ministry of Finance Headquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeadquarters of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\\r\\n\\r\\nINCAR Plaza.\\r\\n\\r\\nSEC Tower, home of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbuja is home to several parks and green areas with the largest one being Millennium Park. Millennium Park was designed by architect Manfredi Nicoletti and was officially opened by the United Kingdom's Elizabeth II in December 2003. Another open area park is located in Lifecamp Gwarimpa; near the residence of the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory. The park is located on a slightly raised hilltop which contains sport facilities like Basketball and Badminton courts another park is the city park, it is located in wuse 2 and is home to numerous outdoor and indoor attractions such as a 4D cinema, astro-turf, lawn tennis court, paintball arena and a variety of restaurants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbuja has a variety of informal spaces known as \\"Bush Bars\\" that usually, though not always, include a covered area with tables and chairs where people can sit and have drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and sometimes there are snacks such as suya, grilled catfish, pounded yam, egusi soup and other small items available for purchase and they are located all over Abuja.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbuja's Central District, also called Central Area, is a strip of land stretching from Aso Rock in the east to the National stadium and the Old City gate in the West.It is like the city's spinal cord, dividing it into the northern sector with Maitama and Wuse, and the southern sector with Garki and Asokoro. While each district has its own clearly demarcated commercial and residential sectors, the Central District is the city's principal Business Zone, where practically all parastatals and multinational corporations have their offices. An attractive area in the Central District is the region known as the Three Arms Zone, so called because it houses the administrative offices of the executive, legislative and judicial arms of the federal government. A few of the other sites worth seeing in the area are the federal secretariats alongside Shehu Shagari Way, Aso Hill, the Abuja Plant Nursery, Eagle Square (which has important historic significance, as it was in this grounds that the present democratic dispensation had its origin on 29 May 1999) and in which all subsequent Presidential Inauguration ceremonies have taken place. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated across Shehu Shagari Way facing the Eagle Square. This section is usually closed to traffic during the annual Armed Forces Remembrance Day ceremonies that is observed on 15 January. The National Mosque and National Church of Nigeria are opposite each other on either side of Independence Avenue.[24] A well-known government office is the Ministry of Defense, colloquially nicknamed \\"Ship House\\".[25] Also located here is the yet-to-be-completed National Square, Millennium tower and Nigeria Cultural Centre multi-functional complex.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Garki District is the area in the southwest corner of the city, having the Central District to the north and the Asokoro District to the east. The district is subdivided into units called \\"Areas\\". Garki uses a distinctive naming convention of \\"Area\\" to refer to parts of Garki. These are designated as Areas 1 to 11. Garki II is used to differentiate the area from Garki Area 2.  Visitors may find this system confusing.\\r\\n\\r\\nGarki is presently the principal business and administrative district of Abuja. Numerous buildings of interest are in this area. Some of them include the General Post Office, Abuja International Conference Centre along the busy Herbert Maculay Way, Nicon Luxury Hotel (formally known as Abuja Sofitel Hotel and Le Meridian), Agura Hotel and Old Federal Secretariat Complex Buildings (Area 1). A new five-star hotel, Hawthorn Suites Abuja, is in Garki.\\r\\n\\r\\nArea 2 is mainly used for residential purposes, although a zoological garden as well as a small shopping Centre are to be found here as well. Several banks and other commercial offices are located along Moshood Abiola Way in Area 7. The headquarters of the Nigerian Armed Forces ÿ Army, Airforce and Navy ÿ is located on Muhammadu Buhari Way in the Garki District.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tallest building in this district is the Radio House located at the Area 11 sector, which houses the Federal Ministry of Information and Communications, the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) and Voice of Nigeria (VON). The Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) stations and corporate headquarters are also in Garki. The Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) which oversees and runs the Administration of the Federal Capital Territory has its offices in Garki.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Office of the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja is in Area 11. This is the location of the Federal Capital Development Authority and other administrative buildings. A popular sub-neighbourhood here is found in the vicinity of Gimbiya street, because it has the unique characteristic of being a purely administrative zone on weekdays, while transforming into a purely entertainment zone on weeknights and weekends.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther places of note include the Cyprian Ekwensi Arts & Culture Centre and The Nigerian Police Mobile Force CID (Criminal Investigation Department) headquarters in Area 10. The Abuja Municipal Area Council, which is the local government administration has its headquarters in Area 10. The new United States Embassy is in the Diplomatic Zone which adjoins Garki.\\r\\n\\r\\nWuse District is the northwestern part of the city, with the Maitama District to its north and the Central District to its south. The District is numbered Zones 1ÿ6. The Wuse Market is Abuja's principal market. The second most important post office in the city is here. This district houses the Sheraton Hotel and Towers (Zone 4), Grand Ibro International hotel, the Federal Road Safety Corps Headquarters (Zone 3), Nigerian Customs Services Headquarters, Federal Civil Service Commission (Zone 3), National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration (NAFDAC) (Zone 7), Wuse General Hospital, and the Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation. Just as Garki District has Garki II, Wuse has Wuse II. This is distinct from Wuse Zone 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaitama District is to the north of the city, with the Wuse and Central Districts lying to its southwest and southeast respectively. This area is home to the top bracket sections of society and business, and has the reputation of being very exclusive and very expensive. Interesting buildings include the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Nigerian Communications Commission Headquarters (NCC), National Universities Commission (NUC), Soil Conservation Complex, and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The British High Commission is located along Aguiyi Ironsi Way, in Maitama. Also, the Maitama District Hospital is another notable building in Maitama. Maitama District is home to many of the European and Asian embassies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsokoro District, the doyen of the districts, houses all of the state's lodges/guest houses. The ECOWAS secretariat is a focal point of interest. Asokoro is to the east of Garki District and south of Central District. It is one of the most exclusive districts of Abuja and houses virtually all of the federal cabinet ministers as well as most of the diplomatic community in the city; in addition, the Presidential Palace (commonly referred to as the Aso Rock) is in Asokoro District. By virtue of this fact, Asokoro is the most secure area of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nGwarimpa is the last district in the Abuja Municipal Area Council. It is a 20-kilometre (12?mi) drive from the central district and contains the largest single housing estate in Nigeria, the Gwarimpa Housing Estate. The estate was built by the administration of General Sani Abacha and is the largest of its kind in Africa. It provides residence for the majority of the civil servants in federal ministries and government parastatals. The ECOWAS Court has an official quarters for the President and Members of the Court in Gwarimpa.\\r\\n\\r\\nDurumi District is located southwest of Abuja and is bordered by Garki Districts I and II to the northeast. Its borders are the Oladipo Diya Road to the southwest, the Nnamdi Azikiwe Express Way to the northeast, and Ahmadu Bello Way to the southeast.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American International School of Abuja is located in the Durumi District.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 2006 census, the city of Abuja had a population of 776,298,[6] making it then the eighth most populous city in Nigeria. United Nations figures showed that Abuja grew by 139.7% between 2000 and 2010, making it the fastest growing city in the world.[7] As of  2015[update], the city is experiencing an annual growth of at least 35%, retaining its position as the fastest-growing city on the African continent and one of the fastest-growing in the world.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbuja has witnessed a huge influx of people into the city; the growth has led to the emergence of satellite towns, such as Karu Urban Area, Suleja, Gwagwalada, Lugbe, Kuje and smaller settlements towards which the planned city is sprawling. The urban agglomeration centred upon Abuja had a population estimated at 2,440,000 in 2014.[3] The metropolitan area of Abuja was estimated in 2016 as six million persons, the country's second most populous metro area.[2] The city has a large and growing immigrant community consisting mainly of nationals from the ECOWAS sub-region. The city has been undergoing a rapid pace of physical development over the last fifteen years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbuja is served by the Nigerian Postal Service which maintains postal codes, street names and zones.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nNnamdi Azikiwe International Airport is the main airport serving Abuja and the surrounding capital region. It was named after Nigeria's first president, Nnamdi Azikiwe. The airport has international and domestic terminals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbuja is also linked to Nasarawa, Plateau, Benue and Northeast Nigeria by the A234 Federal Highway, which starts from the city as the Goodluck Jonathan expressway, some portions of which are still under construction. A direct highway link to Minna in Niger State is still under construction. The A2 expressway links Abuja with Kaduna in the north and Lokoja in the south. There are also other highway links with the outlying region, such as that linking the suburb of Dutse Alhaji with the Lower Usuma and Gurara Dams, which supply water to the city.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbuja is on the route of the planned LagosÿKano Standard Gauge Railway, which has been completed between Abuja and Kaduna.  Trains for Kaduna depart from the Idu Railway Station in Abuja. There is a car park at the train station for passengers traveling to the city centre.[31] A light rail system is now under construction, including a station at Idu.\\r\\n\\r\\n Media related to Abuja at Wikimedia Commons","input":"When was abuja became the capital of nigeria?"},{"output":"start of the 1970 season","context":"The history of Wrigley Field, the home of the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball's National League, begins well before the Cubs played their first game in that venue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the block bounded by Clark, Addison, Waveland, and Sheffield streets was home to the Chicago Lutheran Theological Seminary, with the Hildebrandt Coal Factory across the street to the west. William Passavant, a prominent Lutheran missionary, had inherited the land decades before. Passavant began to develop the land as early as 1868, including the construction of St. Mark's Church by 1874. In 1891, Passavant helped establish the Chicago Lutheran Seminary on the site.[1][2]\\r\\nAt the time the Seminary was established, the area was located in a quiet, relatively undeveloped section of the Lake View District of Chicago's North Side.[1] The seminary started small, holding classes in a small chapel facing Addison Street. The following year, the president's house was constructed at the corner of Sheffield and Waveland. In 1893, the seminary spent $25,000 to construct the four-story Eliza Hall housing the library, chapel, lecture and student rooms further to the west along Waveland. By 1899, four homes were built for professors from the northwest corner of the block (at Waveland and Stella) stretching south along Stella. The seminary had ambitious plans for expansion. In 1905, it announced plans to build additional buildings on the southwest corner of the block housing dining halls, a gymnasium, and more lecture and student rooms, along with additional professors' homes on either side of Eliza Hall. The buildings were to be arranged around a central quadrangle.[3]\\r\\nThe seminary, however, was attempting to flourish in the context of a changing community. The extension of the elevated system into the area in 1900 led to rapid development of the surrounding neighborhood.[4] As the area started taking on an increasingly urban character, the seminary abandoned its plans to develop the site and instead sought to sell its land and find a quieter location.[1]\\r\\nMeanwhile, other developments were coming together to chart a very different future for this plot of land. As early as 1905, rumors had been swirling that minor-league American Association was seeking to locate a franchise in Chicago as part of a strategy to achieve major league status on par with the National League and the recently established American League. The Chicago market was one of the most lucrative in the country, and was already occupied by the NL's Cubs and the AL's White Sox. Charles Havenor (owner of the AA Milwaukee Brewers), and brothers Joe Cantillon (manager of the Washington Senators) and Mike Cantillon (owner of the AA Minneapolis Millers), saw an opportunity to make profit by snapping up choice property in the event that the AA decided to move into the Chicago market. Since the White Sox played on the South Side at South Side Park, and the Cubs were firmly ensconced on the West Side at West Side Park, Havenor and the Cantillons looked to the rapidly developing North Side as the best place to situate a team. The Seminary's location represented the best open land on the North Side. In 1909, the Seminary, eager to move, sold the property to Havenor and the Cantillons for $175,000 and relocated to the suburb of Maywood, Illinois, where it remained until 1967. Havenor and the Cantillons brought in additional investors in 1910, including E.T. Harmon and Edmund Archambault, wealthy Milwaukee businessmen.[5]\\r\\nThe new owners had intended to keep the sale out of the news, but those plans were foiled when members of the Seminary Board complained that the Seminary could have obtained $200,000 in the sale. Havenor was forced to publicly deny any intention on invading the Chicago market. Other AA team owners got cold feet at the prospect of a war with the major leagues, and elected a president that was unwilling to countenance such a scheme. Over the next couple years, Havenor gradually gave up hope of developing the property, selling out his interest to the remaining investors shortly before his death in April 1912. The former Seminary site was not developed any further, and the former Seminary buildings were converted into residential units.[6]\\r\\nThe Federal League began its existence as a minor league in 1913, locating franchises in six cities, including Chicago. The Chicago franchise, known as the Chi-Feds, played its home games at the baseball grounds at DePaul University.\\r\\nJohn T. Powers, founder and president of the new Federal League, had ambitions of building the new organization into a premier minor league, on par with the American Association. By the middle of the 1913 season, however, the owners had forced Powers out of his job, sensing that the Federal League had the potential to become a viable major league. Replacing him as president was James A. Gilmore, a wealthy Chicago businessman who had made his fortune in coal. Gilmore had the organizational and political skills necessary to mount a serious challenge to the established major leagues.\\r\\nGilmore brought on board two partners to control the key Chicago franchise. One was William Walker, a fish wholesaler. The other was the flamboyant Charles A. Weeghman, known as \\"Lucky Charlie\\", who had made a quick fortune in local lunch counters (a predecessor to fast food). Weeghman became the club president and the main force behind the team from that point onward, with Walker willing to remain in the background, and Gilmore tending to League issues. Weeghman made headlines by landing star shortstop Joe Tinker from the Cincinnati Reds in December 1913. The Tinker acquisition was the shot in the arm that gave the franchise the momentum to think big for the upcoming 1914 season.\\r\\nWeeghman chose to relocate the franchise from DePaul to the former Seminary grounds at Clark and Addison owned by Archambault and the Cantillions. Although the major leagues threw up a number of roadblocks, including an attempt to secure rights to part of the land on the block, in late December 1913 Weeghman secured a ninety-nine year lease on the property. The lease stipulated, among other things, that improvements on the property could not exceed $70,000. Within several months, however, Weeghman would spend several times that amount in erecting his new ballpark.\\r\\nWeeghman hired Zachary Taylor Davis, architect of Comiskey Park (which became the home of the White Sox in June 1910), to design the new ballpark. Weeghman wanted the park to rival the Polo Grounds in New York, but in the end the single-decked grandstand as designed bore little resemblance to it.\\r\\nWork on the property didn't begin until February 23, 1914, exactly two months before the Chi-Feds' scheduled home opener. After the grounds had been cleared, groundbreaking ceremonies took place on March 4. Under the guidance of the Blome-Sinek company, the lead construction contractor, the park came together over the remainder of March and the first half of April. Despite a brief strike by construction workers in early April, the new park was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.[7]\\r\\nThe new ballpark, known as Weeghman Park, was a modern steel and concrete baseball plant (in the industrial lexicon of the day). It featured a single-decked grandstand sweeping from right field behind home plate to near the left field corner. Perched on top of the grandstand roof behind home plate was a small area for the press.\\r\\nA modern-day visitor to the original Weeghman Park would have difficulty recognizing the outfield aside from the familiar buildings on the opposite side of Waveland and Sheffield Avenues (which haven't changed much at all). The dimensions of the original playing field along the foul lines were quite short. The distance from home plate to the right field brick fence along Sheffield Avenue was around 300 feet at the foul line. Left field was not much better, partly because several old Seminary buildings stood between the wooden left field fence and Waveland Avenue. The left field fence also featured a large scoreboard. Like most of the parks of the day, the field was essentially angular, as it was shaped by the surrounding grid street pattern. The right and left field walls converged in a corner in deep center field, nearly 450 feet from home plate. Because of the constricted size of much of the outfield near the corners, bleachers were limited to a small jury box in right-center field. All told, Weeghman Park had a seating capacity of 14,000, but this was frequently exceeded by the many standing room only crowds of the day.\\r\\nAfter an unusual number of home runs were hit during the Chi-Feds' first home series against Kansas City in April, Weeghman decided the left field wall was too cozy a target, and had the entire fence moved back some 25 feet. To do this, the front porch had to be removed from the old Seminary building beyond the wall.\\r\\nBefore the start of the 1915 season, Weeghman made additional changes to the outfield. Gone were the jury-box bleachers in right-center field. The old Seminary buildings beyond left field were finally demolished in March. In their place, Weeghman had wooden bleachers erected from the left-field corner to center field, raising the park's capacity to roughly 18,000. The scoreboard was relocated to center field, where it has remained in one form or another since then (with the exception of the latter part of the 1937 season during construction of the current bleachers).\\r\\nOn the field, the Chi-Feds were renamed the Chicago Whales for the club's sophomore season. Weeghman Park was fast becoming the best place to watch baseball in Chicago, as the Whales fought their way to the Federal League pennant in one of the closest races in major league history. Additionally, fans enjoyed Weeghman's high standards for cleanliness and promotion. He was an early champion of Ladies' Day (every Friday) and in 1916 would become the first baseball owner to allow fans to keep foul balls. And as a successful restaurateur, his food was top-notch. Long before the Wrigley family entered the scene, the park was already famous for its hospitality.\\r\\nDespite the exciting pennant race and generally high quality of baseball played in the Federal League, the League was hemorrhaging money. In December 1915, the League capitulated to the other major leagues and disbanded. But all was not lost for Weeghman, however. He was allowed to purchase the Cubs franchise for $500,000, and promptly moved his new club out of the dilapidated West Side Park and into his Weeghman Park for the 1916 season. The purchase was in reality a merger between the Whales and the Cubs, as a number of former Whales stars, such as Max Flack and Claude Hendrix, found themselves playing in the same park as Cubs the following season.\\r\\nThe Cubs played their first game at Weeghman Park on April 20, 1916, besting the Cincinnati Reds 7ÿ6 in eleven innings. This proved to be the highlight of an otherwise unremarkable season. After another year in the bottom half of the standings, the Cubs won the National League pennant in 1918 under manager Fred Mitchell. The victory was not without a little outside help, as wartime conditions during the height of American involvement in World War I caused major league baseball to end the regular season on September 1. With the Cubs struggling for cash, Weeghman reluctantly rented the larger capacity Comiskey Park for the Cubs' home games in the World Series. For the Cubs, the experience was a bust, as the club lost the series to Babe Ruth and the Boston Red Sox in six games to relatively anemic attendance. Such losses may have provided the final push forcing Charlie Weeghman out of management following the season.\\r\\nAlthough Weeghman was clearly the most dominant figure in the revamped Cubs organization in 1916, a number of investors had taken up minority shares in the club. One of the new investors was chewing gum magnate William Wrigley. Over the next couple years, as Weeghman's financial fortunes off the field entered a sharp decline, Wrigley acquired an increasing number of shares in the club and took on a growing role in the team's affairs. In November 1918, Weeghman gave up his remaining interest to Wrigley, resigned as president, and left baseball for good. Wrigley would acquire complete control of the Cubs by 1921.\\r\\nWith Weeghman out of the picture, starting in 1919 the park was generally referred to as Cubs Park. Although the Cubs featured stars such as pitchers Grover Alexander and Hippo Vaughn, along with a young catcher named Gabby Hartnett, over the next few seasons Cubs Park was the setting for largely also-ran teams.\\r\\nThe fans had even more to be frustrated about off the field. Rumors of thrown games plagued the Cubs during the latter part of the 1920 season gave impetus to the criminal investigations which eventually led to uncovering the infamous Black Sox Scandal across town with the White Sox. In addition, 1920 marked the beginning of prohibition, meaning fans would have to find some other way to quench their thirst during the many hot summer afternoons at Cubs Park.\\r\\nAlthough the Cubs teams of the early 1920s were little more than also-rans, the fans still flocked to Cubs Park. In 1922, 542,283 fans went through the turnstilesthe second-highest attendance in the National Leagueto watch a fourth-place club.\\r\\nBy 1922, William Wrigley had decided that after nine seasons, both the seating and the playing field of cozy Cubs Park were ready for a major expansion. Rather than rebuilding the grandstand from scratch, Wrigley hired original architect Zachary Taylor Davis to make the expansion around the existing structure. The grandstand would be sliced into three pieces, with the home plate section placed on rollers and moved roughly 60 feet west (away from right field), and the left field section about 100 feet northwest. Both gaps were to be filled in with more seating, resulting in a significantly longer grandstand and the noticeable \\"dog leg\\" shape of the stands on the first base side visible to this day. Additionally, the foul ground and the height of the fence in front of it would be reduced by additional rows of box seats added in front of the existing grandstand. The diamond and the foul lines would be rotated 3 degrees counterclockwise from their earlier orientation, allowing for those extra box seats. The original location of home plate would now be in front of the Cubs' dugout near the first base coaching box.\\r\\nThe relocation of the grandstand, even with the additional box seats, would make right field far more spacious than before, even with the addition of new bleachers in right field from the corner to the center field scoreboard. The old wooden bleachers in left field were to be dismantled and replaced with newer steel-framed wooden seats like those being installed in right field. The renovations would boost the park's capacity from roughly 18,000 to 31,000. Its dimensions would be roughly 320 feet in left field, 318 in right, and 446 feet to straightaway center.\\r\\nWork on the renovations began in December 1922 and were completed in time for the 1923 season opener. The changes were of such magnitude that many publications of the time referred to the \\"new\\" Cubs Park. Fans flocked to the park, and attendance shot up to 703,705 for the 1923 season, although this was once again only good for second-best in the National League. On the field, however, the Cubs remained also-rans. The team drifted aimlessly through the middle of the standings in 1923 and '24. By 1925, the Cubs found themselves commemorating their fiftieth season in the National League by finishing last for the first time (which in 1925 meant eighth place).\\r\\nThe recently renovated Cubs Park, while a hit with the fans, was not without its critics. Their main objection was that the new left field bleachers were simply too easy a target for right-handed hitters. By late July and early August 1925, reporters were frequently griping about games lost to fly balls which would have been easy outs without the left field bleachers. During the Cubs' first road trip that month, the half of the left field bleachers closest to the foul line was dismantled, leaving a \\"jury box\\" of seats running from deep left-center to the center field scoreboard. The change cost the Cubs over a thousand seats, although that left-field area was sometimes filled with standing-room-only spectators behind ropes, as was the custom of the day. With the left field line now at a substantial 364 feet from home plate, home run production dropped.\\r\\nBy 1926, the Cubs were benefiting handily from the peak of the Roaring Twenties. Nearly 900,000 fans went through the turnstiles at a park with a capacity of just over 30,000. After the close of the season, work began on adding a second deck to the grandstand. The original idea was to have the job completed by the opening of the 1927 season, but by April, only the third-base side of the upper deck had been completed, temporarily giving the park a startlingly asymmetrical appearance.\\r\\nCubs Park was formally renamed Wrigley Field prior to the start of the 1927 season.\\r\\nDespite the half-finished state of the upper deck expansion, the 1927 Cubs drew over 1.1 million fans, becoming the first National League team ever to do so. In addition to the increased capacity of the park, the Cubs helped their own cause by becoming an increasingly competitive team under manager Joe McCarthy.\\r\\nThe upper deck was finally completed in time for the 1928 season, which saw the Cubs break the million mark in attendance yet again. The timing couldn't have been more fortuitous. In 1929, the Cubs put together one of the most potent lineups in major league history, and easily walked to the National League pennant with stars like Hack Wilson, Rogers Hornsby, Kiki Cuyler, Charlie Root and Pat Malone. Season attendance soared to nearly 1.5 million fans. This would remain the major league record for seventeen years, a record aided in large part by declining major league attendance during the Great Depression and World War II. The Cubs themselves would not top this mark for another forty years.\\r\\nAs the World Series approached, Wrigley sought to provide even more seating at the park. He contracted to have temporary wooden bleachers erected on both Waveland and Sheffield Avenues, raising the park's capacity to roughly 50,000. Both streets were closed to traffic. In the end, the bleachers were only needed for games one and two of the 1929 World Series, both of which the Cubs lost on their way to a five-game defeat at the hands of the underdog Philadelphia Athletics.\\r\\nBy the early 1930s, distance markers were posted: left field line, 364 feet; left-center against the outer wall, 372; left center, corner of bleachers, 364; deep center field corner, 440; right center, 354; right field line, 321.\\r\\nDuring the 1968ÿ1970 off-seasons, the concrete in the upper deck was stripped and replaced. After 40 years of harsh Chicago winters, the original concrete was showing signs of wear and tear; it was replaced with precast concrete installed over the 1927 steel framework.[8] In 2004, nearly 40 years later, this precast concrete itself began to show deterioration as several chunks of the precast concrete fell, leading to increased safety inspections and the installation of protective netting.[9]\\r\\nWrigley Field is known for the Boston ivy (Parthenocissus tricuspidata) planted against the outfield wall in 1937 by Bill Veeck, whose father had been team president until his 1933 death. If the ball is hit into and lost in the ivy, then it is ruled a ground-rule double, provided that the defensive outfielder raises his hands to signify that the ball has been lost in the ivy; if the player attempts to search for the ball, the play is considered live, and no ground-rule double is ruled. Wrigley is also known for the manual scoreboard Veeck also erected. No batted ball has ever hit the scoreboard; indeed, very few home runs have even landed in the \\"upper deck\\" of the center field bleachers. However, Sam Snead did manage to hit the big board with a golf ball teed off from home plate, on April 17, 1951, just prior to the Cubs home opener.[10]\\r\\nIn 1937, the Cubs announced plans to rebuild the bleachers in concrete instead of wood, to be fronted by brick that would soon be covered in ivy, and to build a new scoreboard. To make the outfield look more symmetrical and graceful, the plans called for extending the left field bleachers to a point closer to the corner. The gentle curves between the ends of the left and right field bleachers would become popularly known as the \\"wells\\". That summer, the Chicago Tribune ran a series of articles about major league ballparks, and the writer sharply criticized the Cubs for a remodeling that he suspected would result in too many \\"cheap\\" home runs. The writer later retracted when he saw that the final plan was somewhat more spacious than originally announced.[citation needed]\\r\\nBe that as it may, construction went on behind a temporary fence during the summer, and the finished product was unveiled on September 4, in time for the last month of the season. Bill Veeck's famous ivy was planted not long after, but it would be another year before it fully took hold. According to his own autobiography, Veeck as in Wreck, he planted Bittersweet, which would grow quickly, and also the more famous Boston ivy, which would eventually take over. Another part of the arboretum was to be a series of Chinese elms on the large \\"stairsteps\\" up to the scoreboard, as well as one apiece in the little triangle at the top of each \\"well\\". According to Veeck's biography, that plan did not fare so well as the winds kept blowing the leaves off. Management finally gave up \\"after about twenty tries\\", so the trees are long gone, leaving just the large bare steps and (until 2006) the little flat triangular supports at the tops of the \\"wells\\". According to Veeck, the trees themselves were inexpensive, but the special construction for them in the bleachers cost about $200,000.\\r\\nAnother mistake was constructing bleachers in straightaway center field: The batters could easily lose sight of the ball in the white shirts worn by spectators on sunny days, because the wall was not high enough to provide a full batter's background by itself. Various methods were tried to get around this. At one time a flat canopy was extended over the area, to try to put the spectators in shadow, but that was ineffective (the 2005ÿ2006 reconstruction would to some extent revisit that concept). For a while in the mid-1960s, a screen was attached to the top of the wall and the ivy twined its way up. Batters and bleacher fans disliked it, and it was removed after a couple of seasons. Later, for a number of years, a green tarp covered those seats.\\r\\nAfter generally being closed to spectators sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s, the last time those three problem sections were used for baseball was during the 1962 All-Star game. The seats continued to be used for other events such as football and soccer, during the years when the Chicago Bears and the Chicago Sting played their games here.\\r\\nBy the 1990s, the area was occupied by juniper plants, which nicely complemented the ivy. Also, the layout was tweaked a bit, to open up a few seats on either side of the straight center field area while still providing a rectangular background from the perspective of the batter.\\r\\nAfter the 2005 season, the plants were temporarily removed during reconstruction (see below). Over the following winter, a lounge was constructed in the upper part of this area and new rows of juniper bushes were placed in the lower part.\\r\\nBy the end of 1937, the dimensions were set: 355?feet to the left field corner, a few feet behind where the corner wall tangents the foul pole; 368 to fairly deep left-center; 400 to the deepest part of center (at the right edge of the batters background area); 368 to right center; and 353 to the right field foul pole. There are other intriguing distances that have never been posted. In the original Encyclopedia of Baseball, by Hy Turkin and S.C. Thompson, 1951, measurements of 357 feet to the left field \\"well\\" and 363 to the right field \\"well\\" were revealed. That would put the closest point of the left end of the bleachers no more than about 350 feet from home plate, a fact many pitchers have cursed over the years. Left-center in general is shallow. Straightaway center is probably about 390. Deep center and the right field area in general are better balanced. But the shallowness of the left-center power alley, really too cozy for major league standards, and the resultant increase in home runs in the decades since 1937, suggest that the Chicago Tribune's original skeptical assessment was correct.\\r\\nThe \\"basket\\", an angling chain-link fence that runs along the top of the outfield wall, was installed at the start of the 1970 season. During the 1969 pennant race, there were several incidents of fans interfering with fly balls and even falling onto the field. There was also the first and only incident of a fan running the field and escaping without prosecution. A famous photograph was taken of the incident and published in the Chicago Sun-Times.[11] The basket was intended to deter or prevent that kind of problem. Security cameras were also installed at that time. The \\"basket\\" angles away from the wall, and is also higher than the wall in order to provide some balance for the pitchers. However, over the years a number of baseballs have been hit \\"into the basket\\" for home runs that previously would have been outs, or off the wall, or possibly interfered with by fans. The basket only exists where there is seating. During the 1980s, when the bleacher seating was extended over the \\"catwalks\\", i.e. the bleacher ramps in extreme left and right fields, the basket was likewise extended.\\r\\nLights were scheduled to be added to Wrigley Field in 1942, but after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, then-owner Philip K. Wrigley (son of the late William) donated the necessary materials to the war effort. Baseball boomed after the war, allowing P. K. Wrigley to procrastinate on the issue. He eventually decided never to install lights for a variety of publicly stated reasons, so Wrigley Field remained a bastion of day baseball until the Chicago Tribune Company era, which began in 1981; the first night game was not until 1988.\\r\\nThe Cubs had been run almost like a hobby by the Wrigleys, but the Tribune Company was interested in the Cubs strictly as a business. The new owners started talking lights and began stirring debate on the matter. One of P. K. Wrigley's stated reasons for not installing lights was that it would upset the neighborhood, and the initial negative reaction to the Tribune Company's intentions validated P. K.'s prediction.\\r\\nResistance to the installation of lights was not limited to those who lived nearby and opposed the lights on the practical grounds of bothersome brightness or the noise and crowds from night games. Many Cubs fans who lived outside Wrigleyville opposed the idea simply due to the fact that the Cubs' stance as the last team to resist night baseball was a point of pride, as it was seen as a vestige of baseball's heritage as a pastoral game, played in natural sunlight. Some Cubs fans also had fond associations with Gabby Hartnett's famous \\"Homer in the Gloaming,\\" in which Hartnett hit a crucial home run in the bottom of the ninth of a game on the verge of being called for darkness, helping the Cubs to win the 1938 pennant.\\r\\nThe City of Chicago had passed an ordinance banning night events at Wrigley Field, due to its presence in the residential Lakeview neighborhood, so Tribune was unable to install lights unless the ordinance was repealed. They compromised by scheduling a significant number of 3:00 starts, which typically carried games into the evening but did not require lights for games that completed within three hours or so.\\r\\nThis debate continued for several years, and became more intense as the Cubs returned to competitiveness during the early 1980s. When the Cubs won the National League Eastern Division title in 1984, then-commissioner Bowie Kuhn announced that the Cubs would lose home field advantage should they advance to the World Series (home field advantage alternated between the champions of the National League and American League until 2003), since by this time nearly all World Series games were played at night in the Eastern and Central time zones. After winning their two scheduled home (day) games in the National League Championship Series, the Cubs lost all three games in San Diego, so Kuhn's threat became moot. But the following year, new commissioner Peter Ueberroth announced that because Wrigley Field had no lights, the Cubs would have to play all future postseason games at another ballpark, likely Comiskey Park, Soldier Field, or possibly even St. Louis' Busch Stadium, or Milwaukee County Stadium. The Cubs fell out of contention for the next several years, however, and the possibility of playing post-season \\"home\\" games in other cities did not arise.\\r\\nThe Cubs, under team president Dallas Green, quickly changed the issue from lights or no lights to Wrigley Field or move out of town. With typical bluntness, Green said, \\"if there are no lights in Wrigley Field, there will be no Wrigley Field.\\" Green seriously considered shuttering Wrigley and playing at Comiskey Park as tenants of the White Sox for a year, in hopes that the neighborhood would feel the loss of revenue and back down. The Cubs also explored moving to several suburban locations, including a site adjacent to Arlington Park in Arlington Heights and another in Schaumburg. There was even talk of a drastic move which involved selling the stadium to local college DePaul University, who would likely tear down Wrigley Field to host its indoor sports or convert it to a full-time football stadium in hopes of returning football to the campus. The Cubs would then likely build a new ballpark near the Rosemont Horizon (now the Allstate Arena, where DePaul plays its home games currently) in suburban Rosemont.\\r\\nThe Cubs' new stance quickly changed the context of the debate, as even the most adamant opponents of adding lights didn't want to see the Cubs leave for the suburbs. Interestingly, Schaumburg officials were so convinced that the Cubs were actually coming that land was purchased by investors hoping to build a new ballpark off the Elgin-O'Hare Expressway west of I-355. When the Cubs and the city of Chicago came to an agreement to keep the team on the North Side, the site spawned a ballpark anyway, with field dimensions and shape identical to Wrigley Field, even mimicking the \\"wells\\" along the outfield wall, and the 'dogleg' in the visitor's dugout along the first base line. That stadium, Boomers Stadium (formerly known as Alexian Field), is now home to the (non-affiliated) minor league Schaumburg Boomers.\\r\\nIn the fall of 1987, Chicago mayor Harold Washington proposed a compromise ordinance to the Chicago City Council which allowed the Cubs to install lights, but limited the number of night games. Washington died a week after the compromise was proposed, but the city eventually approved a compromise in February 1988 under interim mayor Eugene Sawyer. Major League Baseball responded by awarding the Cubs the 1990 All-Star Game.\\r\\nThe first major league night game at Wrigley was attempted on August 8 against the Philadelphia Phillies, but was rained out after 3? innings. During the rain delay, several Cubs players, imitating a scene in the recent film hit, Bull Durham, played \\"slip-and-slide\\" on the tarp. One source says the group included Greg Maddux, Al Nipper, Les Lancaster and Jody Davis. Manager Don Zimmer was not amused, and they were fined $500 apiece.\\r\\nThe first official night game was played the following night, August 9 against the New York Mets (in front of a nationally televised audience watching Vin Scully and Joe Garagiola call the game on NBC), ending a streak of 5,687 consecutive home day games. However, this was not the first night game of any kind at Wrigley, as in the 1940s, some AAGPBL night games were played in Wrigley Field using temporary lighting structures; specifically, the All-Star Game held in July 1943, was the first night baseball game there, according to the Lowry book and the movie A League of Their Own.\\r\\nStarting with their first full season with lights, in 1989, as part of the compromise with the city, the Cubs were limited to 18 night games within their 81-game regular season schedule, plus any post-season games that might have to be played at night for TV scheduling reasons. The timing of the lights' installation proved fortuitous, as the Cubs reached the post-season in 1989. Their first two post-season night games were the first two games of the NLCS, on October 4 and 5. They lost the first game against the San Francisco Giants 11-3, and won the second game 9-5.\\r\\nThe Cubs' post-season appearances since 1988 (as well as their one-game regular-season playoff with San Francisco in 1998) have featured mostly night games, the exceptions (as of 2007) being the fourth game of their 2003 NLDS matchup with the Atlanta Braves and third game of the 2007 NLDS against the Arizona Diamondbacks, both of which were Saturday afternoon contests.\\r\\nIn recent years, the Cubs have successfully lobbied for additional regular-season night games (up to a potential 30 per year, as of 2007). However, per their agreement with the city, they still play most of their games during the day. Due to the limited night schedule, night games at Wrigley Field are considered an \\"event\\" and are almost always sold out well in advance. Some observers compare the atmosphere of a Wrigley Field night game to that of Rush and Division streets, the longtime epicenter of Chicago's nightclub scene.\\r\\nWrigley Field has continuously evolved over its 90-plus seasons. There is relatively little left of the original that is visible to the casual viewer. One of the more obvious originals were the brick portions of the outer bleacher wall, visible in the \\"back of Wrigley Field\\" photo. The Cubs' bleacher expansion resulted in removal of those bricks, which were later sold to the public individually at a \\"garage sale\\" at the start of the 2006 season.\\r\\nAfter lengthy debate, the reconstruction and expansion of the bleachers (by some 1,900 seats) finally began after the close of the 2005 season, although it was strongly opposed by Chicago Mayor Richard Daley. The first part of the process was to remove the outer brick wall, one of the last vestiges of the 1914 structure. Additionally, much of the 1937 construction behind the inner ivy-covered wall was removed (except for the steel supports and the center field upper tier) and the former sidewalk was excavated. The work progressed quickly throughout the winter, aided by the relatively mild Midwestern January.\\r\\nThe original concept called for the bleachers to simply extend out over the sidewalks, supported by open steel columns in cantilevered design, connecting new steel to the existing steel that supported the old bleachers. That plan was altered somewhat when it was feared the area would become an impromptu homeless shelter. Thus the vertical part of the supporting structure for the new bleachers was encased in a wall constructed of new bricks, in a style reminiscent of the original wall, and the sidewalk (repaved in brick) became a few feet narrower. The only part hanging over the sidewalk is the flat walkway behind the bleachers. The upper part of the formerly vacant center field area is occupied by a large luxury suite, fronted by darkened, slanted windows so as not to interfere with the batters' sight lines, and the lower part by juniper plants that had been temporarily removed. Another notable change to the configuration was to replace the solid door in the right field corner with a chain-link fence gate, so passers-by can see part of the ballfield (an idea borrowed from AT&T Park).\\r\\nVarious Internet sites displayed photos tracking the progress of construction. The results support what management had stated, that the changes would not depart radically from the previous structure.[12][13][14]\\r\\nOn March 30, 2006, the Cubs announced the bleachers would be renamed the Bud Light bleachers. A sign to that effect was soon posted over the bleacher entryway[15] which contrasts significantly with its previous look.[16] The Cubs management also announced they would plant ivy on the rebuilt exterior walls, in a soil trough that was provided as part of the construction. Conventional Boston ivy was planted on the east-facing Sheffield wall, which gets a fair amount of sunlight during morning hours. The north-facing wall along Waveland, which receives little direct sunlight in the summer and none in the winter, was to have an \\"evergreen\\" variety, English ivy, which thrives in shade.\\r\\nThe bleacher expansion project was designed by HOK Architecture, of Kansas City Missouri with Osborn Engineering of Cleveland, Ohio serving as the engineer.\\r\\nOn January 4, 2008 the Cubs got permission to add 80 new seats to the ballpark. The Cubs also got permission to add new signs. Wrigley Field will now hold up to 41,198 people after adding the seats.\\r\\nAt the end of the Cubs' 2007 season, two different efforts were undertaken to upgrade the playing field at the old ballpark. A few years earlier, a Sports Illustrated poll found that the players considered Wrigley's playing field to be one of the poorest in the Major Leagues. The renovations should go a long way toward fixing that situation.\\r\\nFirst, as reported on the Cubs official website[17] and also reported and pictured in the November issue of Chicago Cubs Vine Line, the Cubs official fan magazine (p.?4), the outfield and portions of the infield were replaced by turf purchased from an Oswego, Illinois, firm. This was accomplished in the 13 days between the last home regular season game and the first (and last, as it turned out) post-season game for the year. The project was supervised by Roger Bossard, who is the head groundskeeper for the Chicago White Sox.\\r\\nThen, following the post-season, as reported on the Cubs website[18] and also reported and pictured in the December issue of Vine Line , a more ambitious project began, to install a state-of-the-art drainage system. The entire playing surface at Wrigley was removed, which required digging down 14 to 28?inches. The underlying base material was replaced by a system of 6,000 feet of piping buried in a special clay. The drainage system capable of holding 60,000 gallons of water was installed, on top of which a new playing surface of Colorado-grown sod was unrolled. This renovation, replacing a system installed in 1935, makes Wrigley the last Major League field to move away from a crown-based water management system. The infield had been at a somewhat raised elevation relative to the shallow part of the outfield and the far edge of the foul ground around the infield, hence the gutters in front of the box seat railings.\\r\\nAs of 2008, the infield now sits lower than it did, by 14?inches, eliminating the slight downhill slope that runners had to contend with upon rounding third base, and also allowing the managers in the dugouts to see the opposite-field outfielder in full, not just his \\"top half\\". The system allows for much shorter rain delays, while also controlling the flow of water toward the storm sewers. The ballpark sits on a block that has a noticeable downhill slope from the northwest corner to the southeast corner. The left field (northwest) corner of the playing field is several feet below street level. The natural drainage direction is toward the right field (southeast) corner, and the new system directs all the water through an outlet under the right field corner.\\r\\nAs part of the excavation, the crew found and removed the foundations of the goal posts from the Bears' playing days. The crew also reported that they left a \\"time capsule\\" buried somewhere under the new turf. Lowering the infield by 14?inches also effectively raises the outfield barrier by 14?inches, from the standpoint of the batter. It remains to be seen whether that factor will have any effect on home run production.\\r\\nTribune owner Sam Zell announced that he would consider selling the naming rights for Wrigley Field[19] in order to help reduce the Tribune Company's $13 billion debt. Based on the recent sponsorship deals at the time, it was estimated that naming rights for the park were worth at least $10 million per year.[20] Many Chicago baseball fans though that the park is too historic to have the name changed and some experts projected that naming rights would have commanded a lower cost in comparison to newer parks because of the anticipated fan backlash, to which Zell stated in an interview with Crain's Chicago Business:[21]\\r\\nEven if the name of the stadium had changed, the famous Wrigley Field Marquee would have stayed the same.[22] The marquee is protected by the Chicago city council, and declared a local landmark.\\r\\nWith Tribune's sale of the Cubs (and Wrigley Field) to Thomas S. Ricketts in 2009, further improvements to the park were developed, including construction of the long-discussed \\"triangle building\\" immediately to the west of the park at the intersection of Clark Street and Waveland Avenue, which would house some of the team's offices as well as a retail concourse and weight room for the players. Ricketts has also stated, \\"We don't have any naming-rights discussions going on at all. I think Wrigley is the name we are going to go with.\\"[23]\\r\\nIn October 2014 demolition began on a 3-year renovation project under the ownership of Ricketts. Bleacher expansion, a pair of Daktronics video boards in left and right field, respectively, and five outfield signs were slated to debut by Opening Day 2015, but were hampered by winter weather, and construction extended well into the 2015 season. Construction crews also laid the foundation for a 30,000-square-foot underground clubhouse, which opened in time for the 2016 season. Other major changes, such as installing a new gate on the west side of the ballpark, relocating bullpens from along foul-lines to underneath the bleachers, and building a new visitor's clubhouse, are in the works for completion by 2017. Additional significant renovations planned include: \\"bunker suites\\"  suites that would have no view of the field, but would instead lead to seating areas  beneath the concourse down the third-base line; restoration of the groundskeeper's house (which from 1923 to 1957 was the home of the stadium groundskeeper) along Waveland Avenue; some of the ramps to the upper deck to be replaced with stairs; new elevators to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act regulations; and additional signage on the grandstand facade, which could include a ribbon-style board.[24]\\r\\nConstruction of the video screens were controversial and met with resistance by some fans who oppose putting video screens at Wrigley in deference to tradition and is strenuously opposed by the rooftop owners association, owners of 15 rooftop clubs overlooking Wrigley who have a contract with the Cubs that runs through 2023 requiring them to pay the team 17 percent of their gross annual revenue. The association said the new signs would cut down their view of the ballpark and would absolutely violate our 20-year contract, just as they violate the spirit of Wrigleys long-standing landmark status. Owners of the rooftop clubs sued the city in August 2014, seeking to block the expansion.[25] However, many of the association owners have sold their properties to the Ricketts family, paving the way for the completion of the bleacher project.","input":"When was the basket installed at wrigley field?"},{"output":"52,354","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nUEFA \\r\\nSt James' Park is a football stadium in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. It is the home of Premier League club Newcastle United F.C. With a seating capacity of 52,354 it is the seventh largest football stadium in England.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nSt James' Park has been the home ground of Newcastle United since 1892 and has been used for football since 1880.[3] Throughout its history, the desire for expansion has caused conflict with local residents and the local council.[4] This has led to proposals to move at least twice in the late 1960s,[5][6] and a controversial 1995 proposed move to nearby Leazes Park. Reluctance to move has led to the distinctive lop-sided appearance of the present-day stadium's asymmetrical stands.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides club football, St James' Park has also been used for international football: it was used as a football venue for the 2012 Olympics,[8] and also as a rugby venue for the 2015, 2016, 2017 & 2018 Rugby League Super League Magic Weekend and for the 2015 Rugby Union World Cup. In addition to professional football, the stadium has hosted charity football events and rock concerts, and been used as a set for film and reality television.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site of St James' Park was originally a patch of sloping grazing land, bordered by Georgian Leazes Terrace,[9] and near the historic Town Moor, owned by the Freemen of the City, both factors that later affected development of the ground, with the local council being the landlord of the site.[4] Leazes Terrace was built c1830 by notable Newcastle residents, architect Thomas Oliver and builder Richard Grainger. Once the residence of high society in Newcastle, it is now a Grade 1[10][11] listed building, and, recently refurbished, is currently being used as self-catering postgraduate student accommodation by Newcastle University.[12] The site was also near the gallows of the city, last used in 1844, lending the Gallowgate End its name.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first football team to play at St James' Park was Newcastle Rangers in 1880[13] They moved to a ground at Byker in 1882, then returned briefly to St James' Park in 1884 before folding that year. Newcastle West End took over the ground in 1886. West End were wound up in 1892 and effectively merged into their rivals Newcastle East End, who took over the lease of St James' Park and became Newcastle United later that year.[14] Local residents opposition to football being played at St James' dated back to the first games in the Football League following the building of the first small stand at the Gallowgate End. A redeveloped Gallowgate and further stands followed in 1899, bringing the first official capacity to 30,000 (standing).[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the stadium is now synonymous with the Black and Whites, Newcastle United actually played in red and white at St James' Park until 1904.[15] In 1905, a doubling of capacity to 60,000, with a main stand on the Barrack Road (now Milburn Stand), and major other stands, produced a state-of-the-art facility, even boasting a swimming pool.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second-ever rugby league test match, and first test victory by Great Britain, was played at the ground in 1908 against the touring Australian Kangaroos side on 23 January 1909.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1920 and 1930, plans were drawn up for a double-tiered stand by notable football architect Archibald Leitch. However, after planning disputes, all that was achieved was a small roof over the Leazes Terrace side (Sir John Hall Stand). Floodlights were constructed in the 1950s, with the first match played using them held on 25 February 1953 against Celtic.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nUp until the 1960s planning difficulties continued, culminating in lack of development of the ground being cited as the reason for failure of Newcastle United to secure the right to host a group stage of the upcoming 1966 World Cup following political disputes.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1960s further attempts were made to develop the site, and the council proposed a multi-use sports development of St. James' Park. This was rejected as not financially viable. Plans were drawn up by the club for a move to a stadium in Gosforth,[5][6] or even a groundshare with Sunderland A.F.C. in a new stadium on Wearside.[6] These plans were withdrawn in 1971 after agreement to redevelop St James' Park was finally reached, after mediation by the then Minister for Sport, Denis Howell. In 1972, work started on the East Stand, 50 years after it was last permitted to be developed.[5] In 1978 the Leazes End was demolished, but relegation and financial difficulties meant the new stand was not built.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nInvestigations following the Bradford City stadium fire in 1985 identified a need to replace the ageing West Stand, which was demolished in 1986. Its replacement, the Milburn Stand, was named in honour of Jackie Milburn and opened in 1987.[17] Further development was again shelved for lack of finance.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the early 1990s the ground had achieved only modest expansion under various owners, with plans dogged by disputes and lack of finance due to poor on-field performances. In January 1992 businessman Sir John Hall, who had led the Magpie Group consortium in a hostile takeover of the club, was installed as chairman. Sir John used his experience in property development to rapidly gain approval and invested heavily in the stadium[17] with finances gained from success under new manager Kevin Keegan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Leazes End that had been demolished but not replaced was finally rebuilt, and opened as the Sir John Hall stand for Newcastle's debut season in the Premiership in 1993. The Gallowgate End was rebuilt, the Milburn Stand modified, and a new pitch, drainage and floodlights were installed. With all four corners filled in[15] with seating, by 1995 the stadium had reached a capacity of 36,610.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the expanded stadium still received full houses due to continuing success of the team led by the returning Kevin Keegan, in 1995, plans were submitted by the club to relocate to Leazes Park to the north. A new S65m[17] purpose-built 55,000-seat stadium would be erected, less than two pitch lengths away from the original, but rotated, which would be similar to the San Siro in Italy.[18] The old ground would be redeveloped to be used by Newcastle Falcons Rugby Club, as part of the wider envisaged 'Sporting Club of Newcastle', with basketball and ice-hockey teams purchased by Sir John Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeazes Park was historically part of the Town Moor, owned by the Freemen of Newcastle,[19][20] and protected by the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Town Moor Act 1988. The City council initially invited the planning proposal amid suggestions that the club might move to a site in Gateshead,[19][20] a 75,000-seat stadium next to Gateshead International Stadium,[21] but it led to political debate[20] and opposition. A pressure group \\"No Business on the Moor\\"[18][19][20][22] eventually gathered a 36,000-petition signature,[18][19] equal to the then-current stadium capacity. Opposition also came from a conservation group Friends of Leazes Park led by Dolly Potter.[23] The club proposed to mitigate the loss of the moor land with proposals for a land trade-off with landscaping of land freed up by scaling down of the existing stadium restoring the views of the historic park from Leazes Terrace.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt became clear that the relocation plan would not gain planning permission without a potentially long-running public enquiry.[17][24] To quickly satisfy demand, the club decided to expand the current St James' Park instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997 Sir John Hall stepped down as chairman (remaining as a director until 2007, now life president of the club), and existing shareholder and board director Freddy Shepherd became chairman.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the withdrawal of the Leazes Park plan, the club proposed expansion of St James' Park to over 52,000 capacity, through major construction of a second tier over the Milburn Stand, Leazes End and adjoining corner, adding to a structure that was itself just four years old.[24] After a refusal by the Secretary of State to take the application to an enquiry, permission was obtained in July 1998.[17] For minimal disruption to seating capacity during construction, the project required 3-day shutdowns of work on home match days. 750 seats were lost during construction.[24] During this expansion, executive boxes in the East Stand were demolished[15] and replaced by seating blocks from pitch level up to the existing rows, in a mirror image of the Milburn Stand. The executive boxes were transferred to the new Milburn/Leazes complex, with more added to the Gallowgate End. During development, the additional stand and roof was constructed while leaving the existing cantilever roof intact until the last possible moment[24] These developments increased capacity to approximately 52,143. The construction was completed in July 2000 at a cost of S42 million.[17][25] Ironically, after opposition from local residents to the relocation plan, the expansion of the current ground at the Leazes End has further reduced the view of Leazes Park from Leazes Terrace, although this is now student accommodation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1998 redevelopment caused controversy when the club informed 4,000 season-ticket-holding fans that their seat prices would be increased to corporate rates, with the option of paying these or being moved to seats in the proposed expanded sections. Half of these fans were 'bondholders', who had paid S500 in 1994 which they asserted guaranteed them an option on their specific seat for 10 years.[23] Some fans resisted, and after two high-court cases and a Save Our Seats campaign, the club was allowed to move the fans, under an exceptional circumstances clause. As a gesture of goodwill, the club did not pursue the fans for legal costs awarded over their insured limit.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2003, preempting the relaxation of the UK gambling laws, the club signed a deal with MGM Mirage to hand over the land above St James Metro station,[27] behind the Gallowgate End, in return for an equity investment, to build a jointly run complex centred on a 1,000-square-foot (93?m2) Super Casino.[28] These plans failed when the proposed number of super casinos was reduced to one in the UK, and in January 2008 S5 million was repaid by the club to MGM.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005 the Gallowgate was redeveloped, with a new bar being built beneath the upper tier of the Gallowgate End, named \\"Shearer's'\\" after Newcastle player Alan Shearer. During excavation underneath the stand during building work, the builders uncovered the original steps of the old Gallowgate End stand, which had simply been covered up when the stadium was fully renovated in 1993. These steps were removed for Shearer's Bar. The completion of the redevelopment of the Gallowgate saw the creation of Shearer's Bar, an expanded club shop, a club museum and a new box office.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was announced on 2 April 2007 that the club intend to submit plans for a new S300million development of the stadium and surrounding areas, to include a major conference centre, hotels and luxury apartments.[29] The proposals also include a plan to increase the Gallowgate End, eventually taking the capacity to 60,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis expansion would be funded by the city council and linked to the redevelopment of the land behind the stand and over the Metro Station, which had previously been earmarked for the casino project. Expansion of the Gallowgate end involves difficulties due to the proximity of a road, Strawberry Place, and issues surrounding reinforcement of the underground St James Metro station.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2007 redevelopment plans announced under the previous regime were put on hold following the takeover of the club and its plc holding company by owner Mike Ashley.[30] One of the first noticeable changes in the stadium in the new era was the removal of advertising mounted underneath the roofs (facing the crowd) for Shepherd Offshore and Cameron Hall Developments, companies associated with the previous regime. A large advertising sign for Sports Direct appeared on the lip of the roof of the Gallowgate, visible from the pitch.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA full review of the club performed by the new management team concluded that stadium expansion was not a priority. For the start of the 2008ÿ09 season, the away section was moved from the corner of the Leazes stand/Milburn stand to the other end of the Leazes stand, where it abuts the East stand, at the same upper level. The area of seats designated as the family enclosure were expanded, and certain corporate areas saw increased pricing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first home game of the 2008ÿ09 season, at 3?pm on a Saturday, saw the lowest-ever Premier League attendance at the expanded ground, of 47,711,[31] resulting in cash turnstiles.[clarification needed] It was speculated at the time that this was due to the credit crunch; however, with the shock departure of Kevin Keegan before the next home game, future changes in attendances would be hard to attribute to this alone. The first game after Keegan's resignation, a league fixture against Hull on 13 September 2008, registered a crowd of 50,242[32] amid protests against Ashley and Dennis Wise. This was followed by an attendance of 44,935[33] on 27 September in a league fixture against Blackburn Rovers, which followed a record low attendance of 20,577[34] on Wednesday, 24 September in a League Cup fixture, the lowest ever attendance for a competitive first-team match since the 1993 promotion to the top flight,[35] and a drop of over 4,000 from previous lows.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Newcastle's crowds inevitably fell in 2009ÿ10 as a result of their relegation and the fact that Britain was still in recession, the Magpies still attracted a modern-day record average attendance for a club at this level with their attendance for the season averaging at 43,383. They also became the first club to attract a league attendance of more than 50,000 at this level in the modern era, and ended the season promoted as champions of the Football League Championship.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2014, a scoreboard was installed in the far corner of the Sir John Hall Stand. The scoreboard was used for the first time on 18 October during a Premier League tie against Leicester City. However the game was delayed one hour, due to damage caused by strong wind to the paneling surrounding the scoreboard. Newcastle United later stated on their website: \\"Supporter safety was of paramount importance.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 November 2011, Newcastle United announced that the stadium would officially be renamed Sports Direct Arena, as a temporary measure to \\"showcase the sponsorship opportunity to interested parties\\", whilst looking for a sponsor for possible future stadium re-branding.  According to the club, the St James' Park title was dropped as not being \\"commercially attractive\\".[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously, in 2009, the club had announced plans to sell the naming rights for the stadium. After protests about the possible loss of the name of the stadium, which included the tabling of an early day motion in Parliament, the club clarified the following week that the move would not involve the loss of the name St James' Park altogether, citing the example of 'SportsDirect.com@StJamesPark' as a potential stadium rights package.[37][38] The following day, the club announced that the stadium would be known as sportsdirect.com @ St James' Park Stadium temporarily until the end of the season, to showcase the idea behind the package, until the new sponsor was announced.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium's official renaming as the Sports Direct Arena, or SDA, caused considerable perturbation amongst Magpie supporters, some of whom resorted to criminal damage to preserve the stadium's previous name.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 9 October 2012, payday loan company Wonga.com became Newcastle United's main commercial sponsor and purchased the stadium naming rights. They subsequently announced that the St James' Park name would be restored as part of the deal.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nSt James' Park is spelt with James' featuring one s and an apostrophe mark, as seen on the signage of the St James' Park steps outside the entrance to the stadium, and signage inside the adjacent Metro station. The use of an apostrophe is in contrast with the name of the Metro station itself, which is signed as St James Metro station, and with the street signs[42] of the nearby St James Street[43] and St James Terrace.[44] Further, the use of one s and an apostrophe mark differs from the common convention of adding a second s to monosyllabic possessives ending in s, as is the case with the well-known public space in London: St James's Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe full stop after the St giving St. James' Park is both included and omitted by many sources, including the club's official website address information.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nPost-millennium it has been debated both whether the written name should include an apostrophe mark after St James,[42] and, if it does, whether the official written form should include an extra 's' after the apostrophe.[47] Pronunciation of the name with a second 's' sound or not differs between both the local public and journalists, and is similarly debated.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2008 BBC Look North examined the case for adding an extra 's', to denote the ground is \\"the park of St James\\".[42] The club stated that the ground is named after its neighbouring street, St James Street, which predates the ground,[42] although it was pointed out the road sign of that street, and that of the adjacent St James Terrace, did not feature apostrophes.[42] The BBC stated that both local newspapers The Evening Chronicle and The Journal write the name with a second 's', reinstating it partially in response to reader complaints after a period of publishing stories without it.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club insisted the name is pronounced without a second 's', whilst it was asserted by the BBC that older fans, in particular, pronounce it with two.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nA professor of applied linguistics of Newcastle University stated that if a second 's' was added to the name, it has to ultimately be pronounced in speech.[42] The BBC went on to state that according to the Apostrophe Protection Society, if the ground is named as the \\"Park of St James\\", the name of the ground is correctly written as St. James's Park, with the second 's' pronounced.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommenting on the written form on Radio Newcastle a week after the BBC story, a different senior lecturer in applied linguistics also of Newcastle University stated that if the name is to denote \\"the park of St James\\", the written form should feature an apostrophe, but the use of an additional 's' after it is optional and both are correct.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nMatch-day programmes printed up until the late 1940s have written the name as St. James's Park[citation needed]. According to the club historian, the oldest memorabilia in the club museum refers to the ground as being pronounced without a second 's'.[42] However, a match-day programme dating from 1896, reprinted in the match-day programme of a home match against Derby County[42] (23 December 2007[48]) depicts the stadium name as St. James's Park.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther sources also support the idea that the name should have no apostrophe as found in the name of the adjacent St James Street[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless of the official name, the stadium is known by its initials of St James' Park (SJP), or the contraction, St James'. In reflection of the early use of the site, it is also often referred to as Gallowgate, not to be confused with similarly unofficially named Gallowgate End, the name of the south stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium has a rough pitch alignment of north easterly. The four main stands are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unofficial new home of the singing section is located in the \\"Strawberry Corner\\" (South East Corner, located next to the Strawberry Pub) - between the Gallowgate End & East Stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium's location is close to the city centre, 500?m roughly north of Central station, the main railway station of the city. The stadium is bordered by Strawberry Place behind the Gallowgate, Barrack Road in front of the main entrance, a car park to the north and Leazes Terrace to the East. Further south is St James station, a terminus station of the Tyne & Wear Metro line to the east, although the main Metro interchange at Monument station, is situated only 250?m to the east.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Milburn stand is the 'main' stand of the stadium, housing the main entrance, lifts and escalators behind a glass fronted atrium. The dugouts and player's tunnel is located in the traditional position of the middle of the main stand. Behind the seating terraces of the stands, the Milburn/Leazes structure contains four concourse levels, the Gallowgate End has three concourse levels, and the East stand has two concourse levels.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium has an asymmetrical appearance from the air[7] and from some angles from ground level, due to the discrepancy in height between the sides and ends of the ground. The height difference between the Leazes/Milburn complex and the East/Gallowgate stands allows views of the city centre from many seating positions inside the ground.[50] Further expansion of the Gallowgate End could potentially produce a more balanced horseshoe arrangement of equal height stands, similar to that of Celtic Park.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Milburn stand and Leazes end are double tiered, separated by a level of executive boxes; The East Stand and Gallowgate End are single tiered, with boxes also at the top of the Gallowgate. The three newest sides, the Milburn Stand, Leazes End and Gallowgate End are of structural steel frame and pre-cast concrete construction.[3] In common with many new or expanded British football stadiums, the traditional box shaped 'stands' were augmented in the 1993 expansion by filling in the corners to maximise available seating,[15] up to a uniform height. The Milburn Stand and Leazes End now rise higher than this level, covered by a one piece cantilevered glass roof. A further smaller stand section rises above this level behind the Gallowgate End.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1998 built steel truss cantilever roof above the Milburn/Leazes complex is the largest cantilever structure in Europe[24][25] at 64.5 metres,[3] eclipsing the 58?m cantilevers of Manchester United's Old Trafford.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current stadium design offers an unobstructed view of the pitch from all areas of the ground. The Milburn stand is the location of the directors box and press boxes, and the main TV camera point for televised games.\\r\\n\\r\\nAway fans for league matches were originally accommodated in the upper level, in the north west corner,[50] which can hold a maximum of 3,000 fans.[52] However, plans were made at the end of the 2007ÿ2008 season to relocate the away supporters to the far end of the upper level of the Leazes End. This location has attracted criticism due to the poor view offered by being so far from the pitch due the height of the stand, and the 14 flights of stairs to reach the upper level.[50] For FA Cup matches the lower section of the corner is also used.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe traditional home of the more vocal fans is considered the Gallowgate End, in the same vein as The Kop for Liverpool FC.[citation needed] The Gallowgate End was the end that the team attacked in the second half if they win the coin toss. In recent years there has been unofficial fan movement to create a singing section in the Leazes End upper tier, partly to counter the away fans, and partly to recreate some atmosphere lost since the recent expansion over 36,000.[citation needed] This group of fans call themselves the 'Toon Ultras'. Level 7 of the Milburn Stand houses the official Family Enclosure. Due to the expansion of the Family Enclosure, many fans from the singing section have relocated to the Strawberry Corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013 a group began to help 'Bring Back The Noise' as St.James Park, this being branded as 'Division '92'. This group first began at home to Metalist Kharkiv in the Europea League. From that date the group began to move from strength to strength with new aims set to develop a singing section within the ground for all league games.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as the normal Premiership football stadium facilities, the stadium contains conference and banqueting facilities. These comprise a total of 6 suites with a total capacity of 2,050, including the 1,000 capacity Bamburgh Suite containing a stage, dance floor and 3 bars, and the New Magpie Room, on two levels with a pitch view.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium houses premium priced seating areas designated into clubs, each with their own access to a bar and lounge behind the stand for use before the match and at half-time.[54] The Platinum Club, Bar 1892, Sovereign Club and the Black & White Club are in the Milburn Stand, and the Sports Bar is in the Leazes End[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gallowgate End houses NINE, a sports bar and lounge, which is effectively another city centre nightspot in Newcastle, accessible only from the exterior of the ground. The bar is named after Newcastle United's famous number Nine shirt, which has been worn by famous strikers throughout the years, including Alan Shearer. The Gallowgate also houses a large club shop, a police station.[3] The Milburn stand houses the main box-office. In the south west corner there is also a cafe and a club museum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium has a maximum seating capacity of 52,354,[55] making it:\\r\\n\\r\\nDevelopments since 1993 have ensured the lower tier of seating of the ground still forms a continuous bowl around the pitch, below the level of the executive boxes. The club record attendance is 68,386[3] set in 1930 against Chelsea, when standing was allowed on the terraces.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewcastle United have played their home league matches continuously at St James' Park.  The stadium had not featured a scoreboard or big screen of any kind since the 1993 expansion displaced one from The Gallowgate end, although in 2007 bright red digital time displays were installed near the corner flags at pitch level. A big screen for the stadium was mooted as a possibility as part of a proposed new stadium branding exercise for 2010.[38] On 18 October 2014 a large scoreboard was erected onto the side of the Leazes End, adjacent to the Milburn Stand. The first day of its use in a game versus Leicester City saw a one-hour delay to kick-off over safety concerns around the screen due to high winds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium hosted three matches during Euro 1996. Along with Elland Road it was assigned to Group B, which comprised France, Spain, Romania and Bulgaria.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium was one of several venues used as temporary home grounds for the England team while the redevelopment of Wembley Stadium took place.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nSt James' Park also hosted some football matches in the 2012 Summer Olympics.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor football use, the pitch has the maximum international dimensions of 105 by 68 metres.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 May and 31 May 2015,[57] the stadium held the Super League Magic Weekend. St James' Park was chosen to host the event after the City of Manchester Stadium, which had hosted the event annually since 2012, became unavailable.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe event was considered a success, with the 2015 event setting both single-day and aggregate attendance records for the event. The Magic Weekend returned to St James' Park in 2016[59], breaking the aggregate crowd record in the process, and returned once again for 2017.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been two rugby league internationals played at St James' Park.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium hosted three 2015 Rugby World Cup matches.[62] The first was a Pool B match between South Africa and Scotland on 3 October 2015, with South Africa winning 34 - 16 with 50,900 in attendance.[63] The second was a Pool C match between New Zealand and Tonga on 9 October 2015, with New Zealand winning 47 - 9 with 50,985 in attendance.[64] The third and final was a Pool B match Samoa and Scotland the next day with Scotland winning a close one 36 - 33 with 51,982 in attendance.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2017 the stadium was announced as the host for the 2019 finals of the European Rugby Challenge Cup and Champions Cup.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 21 November, 2017 it was announced that Newcastle Falcons would take their Aviva Premiership game against Northampton Saints on 24 March, 2018 to St James Park. The match dubbed The Big One was the first Premiership game at the venue.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as professional matches, the stadium has been the venue for several charity football matches, including testimonial matches for Alan Shearer and Peter Beardsley. The stadium was also the venue of the final of The Prince's Trust Challenge Trophy, on 14 October 2007, between the Duke of Northumberland and Earl of Durham teams.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 26 July 2009 St James' Park hosted the Sir Bobby Robson Trophy match, in aid of the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, in which the famous Italia '90 World Cup semi-final loss against West Germany, in which Robson's England team were beaten 4ÿ3 on penalties after a 1ÿ1 draw, would be replayed featuring players from the original World Cup squads and other special guests.[69][70][71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium has regularly featured on the popular football game series FIFA (video game series) and appears to be included on the global front cover of FIFA 13 with Lionel Messi in the foreground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium has hosted concerts for many famous artists, including The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen & E Street Band, Queen, Bob Dylan, Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart, Kings of Leon and most recently Ed Sheeran.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium has also been used as an audition venue for the television show The X Factor and also reality television show Big Brother. St James' Park has also hosted the final celebrity matches of the Sky television reality TV show The Match. The stadium was used extensively as a filming location for the film Goal!, as the film follows a fictional player Santiago Mu?ez who signs for Newcastle.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Bobby Robson, a lifetime Newcastle fan who managed the club from 1999 to 2004, died of cancer aged 76 on 31 July 2009, five days after having been at St James' Park to watch the England v Germany charity trophy match played in his honour and in aid of his cancer foundation. Immediately after his death, St James' Park became an impromptu shrine to Sir Bobby, with thousands of fans leaving floral tributes, club shirts and scarves in the Leazes End for the following ten days. After a private funeral service on 5 August, a thanksgiving service held on 21 September at Durham Cathedral in Sir Bobby's memory was broadcast on two big screens for spectators in the Leazes End.","input":"What is the capacity of st james park?"},{"output":"Cristiano Ronaldo","context":" Argentine professional footballer\\r\\n\\r\\nFilms\\r\\n\\r\\nPortuguese professional footballer\\r\\n\\r\\nNamesakes\\r\\n\\r\\nFilms\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MessiÿRonaldo rivalry is a football rivalry between fans of Argentinian forward Lionel Messi and Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo and supposedly between the athletes themselves. Having won a combined ten Ballon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or awards (5 each), both are widely regarded not only as the two best players of their generation, but also regarded by many as the greatest of all time. Both players have regularly broken the 50 goal barrier in a single season and have scored over 600 goals each in their careers for club and country.[1][2] Sports journalists and pundits regularly argue the individual merits of both players in an attempt to establish who they believe is the best player in modern football.[3][4][5][6][7] It has been compared to past global sports rivalries such as the Muhammad AliÿJoe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Bj?rn BorgÿJohn McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Ayrton SennaÿAlain Prost rivalry in Formula One motor racing.[8][9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two[11] while part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players: Ronaldo is sometimes described as someone of temperamental character while Messi is portrayed with reserved character.[12][13][14][15] It could be the case that this is why Messi is considered trustworthier and more likable by the public,[16] even though Ronaldo improved his reputation since 2013.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt club level, Messi and Ronaldo represented rivals FC Barcelona and Real Madrid C.F., the two players facing each other at least twice every season in the world's most popular regular-season club game, El Clsico (among the most viewed annual sporting events), until Ronaldo's transfer to Italian club Juventus F.C. in 2018.[18][19] Off the field, they are the face of two rival sportswear manufacturers, Messi of Adidas and Ronaldo of Nike, which are also the kit suppliers of their national teams and the opposite for their clubs.[20][21][22] The two highest paid players in football, Messi and Ronaldo are among the world's best paid sports' stars in combined income from salaries, bonuses and off-field earnings. In 2018, Messi edged Ronaldo on Forbes list of the best-paid athletes, earning $111 million, with Ronaldo next at $108 million.[23] They have the two biggest social media followings in the world among sportspeople with a combined 211 million Facebook fans in 2016, Ronaldo having 122 million and Messi 89 million.[24] Combining Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, Ronaldo has 321 million followers and Messi 181 million, though Messi does not have a Twitter account.[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nMessi addresses his perceived rivalry with Ronaldo[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nRonaldo talks about Messi in an interview with Fox Sports Argentina[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, Ronaldo and Messi finished as runners-up to A.C. Milan's Kak in both the Ballon d'Or, an award rewarded to the player voted as the best in the world by an international panel of sports journalists; and the FIFA World Player of the Year, an award voted for by coaches and captains of international teams. In an interview that year, Messi was quoted as saying \\"Cristiano Ronaldo is an extraordinary player and it would be brilliant to be in the same team as him\\".[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey first played in a game together when Manchester United were drawn to play Barcelona in the 2007ÿ08 UEFA Champions League semi-finals and were immediately pitted as major rivals.[31][32][33] Ronaldo missed a penalty in the first leg,[34] but United eventually advanced to the final via a Paul Scholes goal.[35] At the end of the year, Ronaldo was awarded the Ballon d'Or and vowed that he would win the award again.[36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2009 UEFA Champions League Final was contested between Manchester United and Barcelona on 27 May 2009 at Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Italy. The match, described as a \\"dream clash\\",[38] was again hyped as the latest battle between the two, this time to settle who was the best player in the world;[39][40] Ronaldo claimed he was the better of the two[41] while Messi's club-mate Xavi sided with him.[42] United manager Alex Ferguson was more diplomatic, praising both players as being amongst the world's elite talents.[43][44] Messi, playing in a central role he was unaccustomed to so he would avoid a direct battle with United left-back Patrice Evra,[45] scored Barcelona's second in a 2ÿ0 victory with a header in the 70th minute.[46] Meanwhile, Ronaldo was subdued for much of the game despite some early chances to score and his frustration eventually showed when he was booked for a rash tackle on Carles Puyol.[47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2015 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry by saying that \\"I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high\\"[49] while Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United Alex Ferguson opined that \\"I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best\\".[50] Messi has denied any rivalry, saying that it was \\"only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano\\".[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it is widely argued and documented that there's an atmosphere of tension between the duo, with Guillem Balagu claiming in Messi that Ronaldo refers to the Argentine counterpart as \\"motherfucker\\" behind his back,[52][53] and Luca Caioli saying in his book, Ronaldo: The Obsession for Perfection, that according to his sources, Ronaldo heats up when watching Messi play.[54] In response to claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: \\"We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players\\", before adding that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: \\"We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing\\".[55] On 13 November 2014, Ronaldo also threatened to take legal action over the remarks made by Balagu.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the existence of the rivalry, the pair have dominated awards ceremonies and broken a multitude of goalscoring records for both club and country, feats which have been described as \\"incredible\\", \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"remarkable\\".[57][58][59] The rivalry itself has been described as one about records and reputation of the players, rather than one based in loathing.[60][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nRonaldo is the UEFA Champions League all-time top goalscorer while Messi is second. The two had broken each other's record over the course of 2015 after Messi surpassed the previous record holder Ra~l in November 2014.[62] Ronaldo opened a gap in the 2015ÿ16 season when he became the first player to score double figures in the group stage of the Champions League, setting the record at 11 goals.[63] They are the first two players to score 100 goals in UEFA Champions League history.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, it has been said that the rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona has been \\"encapsulated\\" by the individual rivalry between Ronaldo and Messi,[67][68] with neither player ever participating in a goalless El Clsico.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated 6 May 2018","input":"Who has more goals cristiano ronaldo or messi?"},{"output":"13 October 1983","context":"The history of mobile phones covers mobile communication devices that connect wirelessly to the public switched telephone network.\\r\\nWhile the transmission of speech by radio has a long history, the first models that were wireless, mobile, and also capable of connecting to the standard telephone network are much more recent. The first such devices were barely portable compared to today's compact hand-held devices, and their use was clumsy.\\r\\nAlong with the process of developing a more portable technology, and a better interconnections system, drastic changes have taken place in both the networking of wireless communication and the prevalence of its use, with smartphones becoming common globally and a growing proportion of Internet access now done via mobile broadband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the devices existed that are now referred to as mobile phones or cell phones, there were some precursors. In 1908, a Professor Albert Jahnke and the Oakland Transcontinental Aerial Telephone and Power Company claimed to have developed a wireless telephone. They were accused of fraud and the charge was then dropped, but they do not seem to have proceeded with production.[2] Beginning in 1918, the German railroad system tested wireless telephony on military trains between Berlin and Zossen.[3] In 1924, public trials started with telephone connection on trains between Berlin and Hamburg. In 1925, the company Zugtelephonie A. G. was founded to supply train telephony equipment and, in 1926, telephone service in trains of the Deutsche Reichsbahn and the German mail service on the route between Hamburg and Berlin was approved and offered to first-class travelers.[4]\\r\\nIn 1707, the English caricaturist Lewis Baumer published a cartoon in Punch magazine entitled \\"Forecasts for 1907\\" in which he showed a man and a woman in London's Hyde Park each separately engaged in gambling and dating on wireless telephony equipment.[5] Then, in 1926, the artist Karl Arnold created a visionary cartoon about the use of mobile phones in the street, in the picture \\"wireless telephony\\", published in the German satirical magazine Simplicissimus.[6]\\r\\nThe portrayal of a Utopia of mobile phone in literature dates back to the year 1631. It is found in Erich K?stner's children's book The 35th of May, or Conrad's Ride to the South Seas:\\r\\nThe Second World War made military use of radio telephony links. Hand-held radio transceivers have been available since the 1940s. Mobile telephones for automobiles became available from some telephone companies in the 1940s. Early devices were bulky, consumed high power, and the network supported only a few simultaneous conversations. Modern cellular networks allow automatic and pervasive use of mobile phones for voice and data communications.\\r\\nIn the United States, engineers from Bell Labs began work on a system to allow mobile users to place and receive telephone calls from automobiles, leading to the inauguration of mobile service on 17 June 1946 in St. Louis, Missouri. Shortly after, AT&T offered Mobile Telephone Service. A wide range of mostly incompatible mobile telephone services offered limited coverage area and only a few available channels in urban areas. The introduction of cellular technology, which allowed re-use of frequencies many times in small adjacent areas covered by relatively low powered transmitters, made widespread adoption of mobile telephones economically feasible.\\r\\nOne of the earliest fictional descriptions of a mobile phone was the 1948 science fiction novel Space Cadet by Robert Heinlein. The protagonist, who has just traveled to Colorado from his home in Des Moines, receives a call from his father on a pocket telephone. Before going to space he decides to ship the telephone home \\"since it was limited by its short range to the neighborhood of an earth-side [i.e. terrestrial] relay office.\\" Ten years later, an essay by Arthur C. Clarke envisioned a \\"personal transceiver, so small and compact that every man carries one.\\" He wrote: \\"the time will come when we will be able to call a person anywhere on Earth merely by dialing a number.\\" Such a device would also, in Clarke's vision, include means for global positioning so that \\"no one need ever again be lost.\\" Later, in Profiles of the Future, he predicted the advent of such a device taking place in the mid-1980s.[7] U.S. TV series Get Smart (1965-1970) depicted spy gadgets with mobile telephones concealed in random objects, including shoes.\\r\\nIn the USSR, Leonid Kupriyanovich, an engineer from Moscow, in 1957-1961 developed and presented a number of experimental models of handheld mobile phones. The weight of one model, presented in 19kdn61, was only 70 g and could fit on a palm.[8][9] However, in the USSR the decision at first to develop the system of the automobile \\"Altai\\" phone was made.[10]\\r\\nIn 1965, Bulgarian company \\"Radioelektronika\\" presented on the Inforga-65 international exhibition in Moscow the mobile automatic phone combined with a base station. Solutions of this phone were based on a system developed by Leonid Kupriyanovich. One base station, connected to one telephone wire line, could serve up to 15 customers.[11]\\r\\nThe advances in mobile telephony can be traced in successive generations from the early \\"0G\\" services like MTS and its successor Improved Mobile Telephone Service, to first-generation (1G) analog cellular network, second-generation (2G) digital cellular networks, third-generation (3G) broadband data services to the state-of-the-art, fourth-generation (4G) native-IP networks.\\r\\nIn 1949, AT&T commercialized Mobile Telephone Service. From its start in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1946, AT&T introduced Mobile Telephone Service to one hundred towns and highway corridors by 1948. Mobile Telephone Service was a rarity with only 5,000 customers placing about 30,000 calls each week. Calls were set up manually by an operator and the user had to depress a button on the handset to talk and release the button to listen. The call subscriber equipment weighed about 80 lb.[12]\\r\\nSubscriber growth and revenue generation were hampered by the constraints of the technology. Because only three radio channels were available, only three customers in any given city could make mobile telephone calls at one time.[13] Mobile Telephone Service was expensive, costing 15 USD per month, plus 0.30 to 0.40 USD per local call, equivalent to about 176 USD per month and 3.50 to 4.75 per call in 2012 USD.[12]\\r\\nIn the UK, there was also a vehicle-based system called \\"Post Office Radiophone Service,\\"[14] which was launched around the city of Manchester in 1959, and although it required callers to speak to an operator, it was possible to be put through to any subscriber in Great Britain. The service was extended to London in 1965 and other major cities in 1972.\\r\\nAT&T introduced the first major improvement to mobile telephony in 1965, giving the improved service the obvious name of Improved Mobile Telephone Service. IMTS used additional radio channels, allowing more simultaneous calls in a given geographic area, introduced customer dialing, eliminating manual call setup by an operator, and reduced the size and weight of the subscriber equipment.[12]\\r\\nDespite the capacity improvement offered by IMTS, demand outstripped capacity. In agreement with state regulatory agencies, AT&T limited the service to just 40,000 customers system wide. In New York City, for example, 2,000 customers shared just 12 radio channels and typically had to wait 30 minutes to place a call.[12]\\r\\nRadio Common Carrier[15] or RCC was a service introduced in the 1960s by independent telephone companies to compete against AT&T's IMTS. RCC systems used paired UHF 454/459?MHz and VHF 152/158?MHz frequencies near those used by IMTS. RCC based services were provided until the 1980s when cellular AMPS systems made RCC equipment obsolete.\\r\\nSome RCC systems were designed to allow customers of adjacent carriers to use their facilities, but equipment used by RCCs did not allow the equivalent of modern \\"roaming\\" because technical standards were not uniform. For example, the phone of an Omaha, Nebraskaÿbased RCC service would not be likely to work in Phoenix, Arizona. Roaming was not encouraged, in part, because there was no centralized industry billing database for RCCs. Signaling formats were not standardized. For example, some systems used two-tone sequential paging to alert a mobile of an incoming call. Other systems used DTMF. Some used Secode 2805, which transmitted an interrupted 2805?Hz tone (similar to IMTS signaling) to alert mobiles of an offered call. Some radio equipment used with RCC systems was half-duplex, push-to-talk LOMO equipment such as Motorola hand-helds or RCA 700-series conventional two-way radios. Other vehicular equipment had telephone handsets and rotary dials or pushbutton pads, and operated full duplex like a conventional wired telephone. A few users had full-duplex briefcase telephones (radically advanced for their day)\\r\\nAt the end of RCC's existence, industry associations were working on a technical standard that would have allowed roaming, and some mobile users had multiple decoders to enable operation with more than one of the common signaling formats (600/1500, 2805, and Reach). Manual operation was often a fallback for RCC roamers.\\r\\nIn 1969 Penn Central Railroad equipped commuter trains along the 360 km New York-Washington route with special pay phones that allowed passengers to place telephone calls while the train was moving. The system re-used six frequencies in the 450?MHz band in nine sites.[13]\\r\\nIn the UK, Channel Islands and elsewhere the \\"Rabbit\\" phone system was briefly used, being a hybrid of \\"cell\\" base stations and handsets. One major limitation was that you had to be less than 300 feet (closer with buildings) from a base due to power limitations on a portable device. [16][better?source?needed] With modern technology a similar variant is being considered for Apple's new 4G \\"smart watch\\" so they can be used in large events in a broadly similar way to a femtocell.\\r\\nIn Europe, several mutually incompatible mobile radio services were developed.\\r\\nIn 1966 Norway had a system called OLT which was manually controlled. Finland's ARP, launched in 1971, was also manual as was the Swedish MTD. All were replaced by the automatic NMT, (Nordic Mobile Telephone) system in the early 1980s.\\r\\nIn July 1971 Readycall was introduced in London by Burndept after obtaining a special concession to break the Post Office monopoly to allow selective calling to mobiles of calls from the public telephone system. This system was available to the public for a subscription of S16 month. A year later the service was extended to two other UK towns.[17]\\r\\nWest Germany had a network called A-Netz launched in 1952 as the country's first public commercial mobile phone network. In 1972 this was displaced by B-Netz which connected calls automatically.\\r\\nIn December 1947, Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young, Bell Labs engineers, proposed hexagonal cells for mobile phones in vehicles.[18] At this stage, the technology to implement these ideas did not exist, nor had the frequencies been allocated. Two decades would pass before Richard H. Frenkiel, Joel S. Engel and Philip T. Porter of Bell Labs expanded the early proposals into a much more detailed system plan. It was Porter who first proposed that the cell towers use the now-familiar directional antennas to reduce interference and increase channel reuse (see picture at right)[19] Porter also invented the dial-then-send method used by all cell phones to reduce wasted channel time.\\r\\nIn all these early examples, a mobile phone had to stay within the coverage area serviced by one base station throughout the phone call, i.e. there was no continuity of service as the phones moved through several cell areas. The concepts of frequency reuse and handoff, as well as a number of other concepts that formed the basis of modern cell phone technology, were described in the late 1960s, in papers by Frenkiel and Porter. In 1970 Amos E. Joel, Jr., a Bell Labs engineer,[20] invented a \\"three-sided trunk circuit\\" to aid in the \\"call handoff\\" process from one cell to another. His patent contained an early description of the Bell Labs cellular concept, but as switching systems became faster, such a circuit became unnecessary and was never implemented in a system.\\r\\nA cellular telephone switching plan was described by Fluhr and Nussbaum in 1973,[21] and a cellular telephone data signaling system was described in hipatitas by Hachenburg et al.[22]\\r\\nThe first fully automated mobile phone system for vehicles was launched in Sweden in 1956. Named MTA (Mobiltelefonisystem A), it allowed calls to be made and received in the car using a rotary dial. The car phone could also be paged. Calls from the car were direct dial, whereas incoming calls required an operator to locate the nearest base station to the car. It was developed by Sture Laurn and other engineers at Televerket network operator. Ericsson provided the switchboard while Svenska Radioaktiebolaget (SRA) and Marconi provided the telephones and base station equipment. MTA phones consisted of vacuum tubes and relays, and weighed 40?kg. In 1962, an upgraded version called Mobile System B (MTB) was introduced. This was a push-button telephone, and used transistors and DTMF signaling to improve its operational reliability. In 1971 the MTD version was launched, opening for several different brands of equipment and gaining commercial success.[23][24] The network remained open until 1983 and still had 600 customers when it closed.\\r\\nIn 1958 development began on a similar system for motorists in the USSR.[25] The \\"Altay\\" national civil mobile phone service was based on Soviet MRT-1327 standard. The main developers of the Altay system were the Voronezh Science Research Institute of Communications (VNIIS) and the State Specialized Project Institute (GSPI). In 1963 the service started in Moscow, and by 1970 was deployed in 30 cities across the USSR. Versions of the Altay system are still in use today as a trunking system in some parts of Russia.\\r\\nIn 1959 a private telephone company in Brewster, Kansas, USA, the S&T Telephone Company, (still in business today) with the use of Motorola Radio Telephone equipment and a private tower facility, offered to the public mobile telephone services in that local area of NW Kansas. This system was a direct dial up service through their local switchboard, and was installed in many private vehicles including grain combines, trucks, and automobiles. For some as yet unknown reason, the system, after being placed online and operated for a very brief time period, was shut down. The management of the company was immediately changed, and the fully operable system and related equipment was immediately dismantled in early 1960, not to be seen again.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1966, Bulgaria presented the pocket mobile automatic phone RAT-0,5 combined with a base station RATZ-10 (RATC-10) on Interorgtechnika-66 international exhibition. One base station, connected to one telephone wire line, could serve up to six customers (\\"Radio\\" magazine, 2, 1967; \\"Novosti dnya\\" newsreel, 37, 1966).\\r\\nOne of the first successful public commercial mobile phone networks was the ARP network in Finland, launched in 1971. Posthumously, ARP is sometimes viewed as a zero generation (0G) cellular network, being slightly above previous proprietary and limited coverage networks.[citation needed]\\r\\nPrior to 1973, mobile telephony was limited to phones installed in cars and other vehicles.[20] Motorola was the first company to produce a handheld mobile phone. On April 3, 1973, Martin Cooper, a Motorola researcher and executive, made the first mobile telephone call from handheld subscriber equipment, placing a call to Dr. Joel S. Engel of Bell Labs, his rival.[26][27] The prototype handheld phone used by Dr. Cooper weighed 1.1 kg (2.42 lb) and measured 23 cm long, 13 cm deep and 4.45 cm wide. The prototype offered a talk time of just 30 minutes and took 10 hours to re-charge.[28]\\r\\nJohn F. Mitchell,[29][30][31] Motorola's chief of portable communication products and Cooper's boss in 1973, played a key role in advancing the development of handheld mobile telephone equipment. Mitchell successfully pushed Motorola to develop wireless communication products that would be small enough to use anywhere and participated in the design of the cellular phone.[32][33]\\r\\nNewer technology has been developed and rolled out in a series of waves or generations. The \\"generation\\" terminology only became widely used when 3G was launched, but is now used retroactively when referring to the earlier systems.\\r\\nFirst automatic analogue cellular systems deployed were NTT's system first used in Tokyo in 1979, later spreading to the whole of Japan, and NMT in the Nordic countries in 1981.\\r\\nThe first analogue cellular system widely deployed in North America was the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS).[34] It was commercially introduced in the Americas in 13 October 1983, Israel in 1986, and Australia in 1987. AMPS was a pioneering technology that helped drive mass market usage of cellular technology, but it had several serious issues by modern standards. It was unencrypted and easily vulnerable to eavesdropping via a scanner; it was susceptible to cell phone \\"cloning\\" and it used a Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) scheme and required significant amounts of wireless spectrum to support.\\r\\nOn 6 March 1983, the DynaTAC 8000X mobile phone launched on the first US 1G network by Ameritech. It cost $100m to develop, and took over a decade to reach the market.[35] The phone had a talk time of just thirty-five minutes and took ten hours to charge. Consumer demand was strong despite the battery life, weight, and low talk time, and waiting lists were in the thousands.[36][37]\\r\\nMany of the iconic early commercial cell phones such as the Motorola DynaTAC Analog AMPS were eventually superseded by Digital AMPS (D-AMPS) in 1990, and AMPS service was shut down by most North American carriers by 2008.\\r\\nIn February 1986 Australia launched its Cellular Telephone System by Telecom Australia. Peter Reedman was the first Telecom Customer to be connected on 6 January 1986 along with five other subscribers as test customers prior to the official launch date of 28 February.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, the 'second generation' mobile phone systems emerged. Two systems competed for supremacy in the global market: the European developed GSM standard and the U.S. developed CDMA standard. These differed from the previous generation by using digital instead of analog transmission, and also fast out-of-band phone-to-network signaling. The rise in mobile phone usage as a result of 2G was explosive and this era also saw the advent of prepaid mobile phones.\\r\\nIn 1991 the first GSM network (Radiolinja) launched in Finland. In general the frequencies used by 2G systems in Europe were higher than those in America, though with some overlap. For example, the 900?MHz frequency range was used for both 1G and 2G systems in Europe, so the 1G systems were rapidly closed down to make space for the 2G systems. In America the IS-54 standard was deployed in the same band as AMPS and displaced some of the existing analog channels.\\r\\nIn 1993, IBM Simon was introduced. This was possibly the world's first smartphone. It was a mobile phone, pager, fax machine, and PDA all rolled into one. It included a calendar, address book, clock, calculator, notepad, email, and a touchscreen with a QWERTY keyboard.[38] The IBM Simon had a stylus you used to tap the touch screen with. It featured predictive typing that would guess the next characters as you tapped. It had applications, or at least a way to deliver more features by plugging a PCMCIA 1.8 MB memory card into the phone.[39] Coinciding with the introduction of 2G systems was a trend away from the larger \\"brick\\" phones toward tiny 100 ÿ 200 gram hand-held devices. This change was possible not only through technological improvements such as more advanced batteries and more energy-efficient electronics, but also because of the higher density of cell sites to accommodate increasing usage. The latter meant that the average distance transmission from phone to the base station shortened, leading to increased battery life while on the move.\\r\\nThe second generation introduced a new variant of communication called SMS or text messaging. It was initially available only on GSM networks but spread eventually on all digital networks. The first machine-generated SMS message was sent in the UK on 3 December 1992 followed in 1993 by the first person-to-person SMS sent in Finland. The advent of prepaid services in the late 1990s soon made SMS the communication method of choice among the young, a trend which spread across all ages.\\r\\n2G also introduced the ability to access media content on mobile phones. In 1998 the first downloadable content sold to mobile phones was the ring tone, launched by Finland's Radiolinja (now Elisa). Advertising on the mobile phone first appeared in Finland when a free daily SMS news headline service was launched in 2000, sponsored by advertising.\\r\\nMobile payments were trialed in 1998 in Finland and Sweden where a mobile phone was used to pay for a Coca-Cola vending machine and car parking. Commercial launches followed in 1999 in Norway. The first commercial payment system to mimic banks and credit cards was launched in the Philippines in 1999 simultaneously by mobile operators Globe and Smart.\\r\\nThe first full internet service on mobile phones was introduced by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in 1999.\\r\\nAs the use of 2G phones became more widespread and people began to use mobile phones in their daily lives, it became clear that demand for data (such as access to browse the internet) was growing. Further, experience from fixed broadband services showed there would also be an ever-increasing demand for greater data speeds. The 2G technology was nowhere near up to the job, so the industry began to work on the next generation of technology known as 3G. The main technological difference that distinguishes 3G technology from 2G technology is the use of packet switching rather than circuit switching for data transmission.[40] In addition, the standardization process focused on requirements more than technology (2 Mbit/s maximum data rate indoors, 384 kbit/s outdoors, for example).\\r\\nInevitably this led to many competing standards with different contenders pushing their own technologies, and the vision of a single unified worldwide standard looked far from reality. The standard 2G CDMA networks became 3G compliant with the adoption of Revision A to EV-DO, which made several additions to the protocol while retaining backwards compatibility:\\r\\nAll these were put in place to allow for low latency, low bit rate communications such as VoIP.[41]\\r\\nThe first pre-commercial trial network with 3G was launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in the Tokyo region in May 2001. NTT DoCoMo launched the first commercial 3G network on 1 October 2001, using the WCDMA technology. In 2002 the first 3G networks on the rival CDMA2000 1xEV-DO technology were launched by SK Telecom and KTF in South Korea, and Monet in the US. Monet has since gone bankrupt. By the end of 2002, the second WCDMA network was launched in Japan by Vodafone KK (now Softbank). European launches of 3G were in Italy and the UK by Three/Hutchison group, on WCDMA. 2003 saw a further eight commercial launches of 3G, six more on WCDMA and two more on the EV-DO standard.\\r\\nDuring the development of 3G systems, 2.5G systems such as CDMA2000 1x and GPRS were developed as extensions to existing 2G networks. These provide some of the features of 3G without fulfilling the promised high data rates or full range of multimedia services. CDMA2000-1X delivers theoretical maximum data speeds of up to 307 kbit/s. Just beyond these is the EDGE system which in theory covers the requirements for 3G system, but is so narrowly above these that any practical system would be sure to fall short.\\r\\nThe high connection speeds of 3G technology enabled a transformation in the industry: for the first time, media streaming of radio (and even television) content to 3G handsets became possible,[42] with companies such as RealNetworks[43] and Disney[44] among the early pioneers in this type of offering.\\r\\nIn the mid-2000s (decade), an evolution of 3G technology began to be implemented, namely High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA). It is an enhanced 3G (third generation) mobile telephony communications protocol in the High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA) family, also coined 3.5G, 3G+ or turbo 3G, which allows networks based on Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) to have higher data transfer speeds and capacity. Current HSDPA deployments support down-link speeds of 1.8, 3.6, 7.2 and 14.0 Mbit/s.\\r\\nBy the end of 2007, there were 295 million subscribers on 3G networks worldwide, which reflected 9% of the total worldwide subscriber base. About two thirds of these were on the WCDMA standard and one third on the EV-DO standard. The 3G telecoms services generated over $120 billion of revenues during 2007 and at many markets the majority of new phones activated were 3G phones. In Japan and South Korea the market no longer supplies phones of the second generation.\\r\\nAlthough mobile phones had long had the ability to access data networks such as the Internet, it was not until the widespread availability of good quality 3G coverage in the mid-2000s (decade) that specialized devices appeared to access the mobile web. The first such devices, known as \\"dongles\\", plugged directly into a computer through the USB port. Another new class of device appeared subsequently, the so-called \\"compact wireless router\\" such as the Novatel MiFi, which makes 3G Internet connectivity available to multiple computers simultaneously over Wi-Fi, rather than just to a single computer via a USB plug-in.\\r\\nSuch devices became especially popular for use with laptop computers due to the added portability they bestow. Consequently, some computer manufacturers started to embed the mobile data function directly into the laptop so a dongle or MiFi wasn't needed. Instead, the SIM card could be inserted directly into the device itself to access the mobile data services. Such 3G-capable laptops became commonly known as \\"netbooks\\". Other types of data-aware devices followed in the netbook's footsteps. By the beginning of 2010, E-readers, such as the Amazon Kindle and the Nook from Barnes & Noble, had already become available with embedded wireless Internet, and Apple had announced plans for embedded wireless Internet on its iPad tablet devices later that year.\\r\\nBy 2009, it had become clear that, at some point, 3G networks would be overwhelmed by the growth of bandwidth-intensive applications like streaming media.[45] Consequently, the industry began looking to data-optimized 4th-generation technologies, with the promise of speed improvements up to 10-fold over existing 3G technologies. The first two commercially available technologies billed as 4G were the WiMAX standard (offered in the U.S. by Sprint) and the LTE standard, first offered in Scandinavia by TeliaSonera.\\r\\nOne of the main ways in which 4G differed technologically from 3G was in its elimination of circuit switching, instead employing an all-IP network. Thus, 4G ushered in a treatment of voice calls just like any other type of streaming audio media, utilizing packet switching over Internet, LAN or WAN networks via VoIP.[46]\\r\\nAs well as the now-common cellular phone, there is also the very different approach of connecting directly from the handset to an Earth-orbiting satellite. Such mobile phones can be used in remote areas out of reach of wired networks or where construction of a cellular network is uneconomic.\\r\\nThe Inmarsat system is the oldest, originally developed in 1979 for safety of life at sea, and uses a series of satellites in geostationary orbits to cover the majority of the globe. Several smaller operators use the same approach with just one or two satellites to provide a regional service. An alternative approach is to use a series of low Earth orbit satellites much closer to Earth. This is the basis of the Iridium and Globalstar satellite phone services.","input":"When were cell phones first introduced to the public?"},{"output":"Orrin Hatch","context":" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President pro tempore of the United States Senate (also president pro tem) is the second-highest-ranking official of the United States Senate. Article One, Section Three of the United States Constitution provides that the Vice President of the United States is, despite not being a U.S. Senator, the President of the Senate, and mandates that the Senate must choose a President pro tempore to act in the Vice President's absence. Unlike the Vice President, the President pro tempore is an elected member of the Senate, able to speak or vote on any issue. Selected by the Senate at large, the President pro tempore has enjoyed many privileges and some limited powers.[2] During the Vice President's absence, the President pro tempore is empowered to preside over Senate sessions. In practice, neither the Vice President nor the President pro tempore usually presides; instead, the duty of presiding officer is rotated among junior U.S. Senators of the majority party to give them experience in parliamentary procedure.[3]\\r\\nSince 1890, the most senior U.S. Senator in the majority party has generally been chosen to be President pro tempore and holds the office continuously until the election of another. This tradition has been observed without interruption since 1949.[4] Since enactment of the current Presidential Succession Act in 1947, the president pro tempore is third in the line of succession to the presidency, after the vice president and the Speaker of the House of Representatives and ahead of the Secretary of State.[5]\\r\\nThe current President pro tempore of the Senate is Utah Republican Orrin Hatch. Elected on January 6, 2015,[6] he is the 90th person to serve in this office. On January 2, 2018, Hatch announced his pending retirement from the Senate, effective January 3, 2019.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe office of president pro tempore is created by Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution:[7]\\r\\nThe Senate shall choose their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United States.\\r\\nAlthough the position is in some ways analogous to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the powers of the president pro tempore are far more limited. In the Senate, most power rests with party leaders and individual senators, but as the chamber's presiding officer, the president pro tempore is authorized to perform certain duties in the absence of the vice president, including ruling on points of order.[8] Additionally, under the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, the president pro tempore and the speaker are the two authorities to whom declarations must be transmitted that the president is unable to perform the duties of the office, or is able to resume doing so. The president pro tempore is third in the line of presidential succession, following the vice president and the speaker.[5][8] Additional duties include appointment of various congressional officers, certain commissions, advisory boards, and committees and joint supervision of the congressional page school.[8] The president pro tempore is the designated legal recipient of various reports to the Senate, including War Powers Act reports under which he or she, jointly with the speaker, may have the president call Congress back into session. The officeholder is an ex officio member of various boards and commissions. With the secretary and sergeant at arms, the president pro tempore maintains order in Senate portions of the Capitol and Senate buildings.[8][9]\\r\\nThe office of president pro tempore was established by the Constitution of the United States in 1789. The first president pro tempore, John Langdon, was elected on April 6 the same year.[8] Originally, the president pro tempore was appointed on an intermittent basis when the vice president was not present to preside over the Senate. Until the 1960s, it was common practice for the vice president to preside over daily Senate sessions, so the president pro tempore rarely presided unless the vice presidency became vacant.[10] Until 1891, the president pro tempore only served until the return of the vice president to the chair or the adjournment of a session of Congress. Between 1792 and 1886, the president pro tempore was second in the line of presidential succession following the vice president and preceding the speaker.[10]\\r\\nOn three occasions during the 19th century, the Senate was without both a president and a president pro tempore:\\r\\nWhen President Andrew Johnson, who had no vice president, was impeached and tried in 1868, Senate President pro tempore Benjamin Franklin Wade was next in line to the presidency. Wade's radicalism is thought by many historians to be a major reason why the Senate, which did not want to see Wade in the White House, acquitted Johnson.[11] The President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House were removed from the presidential line of succession in 1886. Both were restored to it in 1947, though this time with the president pro tempore following the speaker.[8]\\r\\nWilliam P. Frye served as President pro tempore from 1896 to 1911 (54thÿ62nd Congress), a tenure longer than anyone else. He resigned from the position due to ill health a couple of months before his death. Electing his successor proved difficult, as Senate Republicans, then in the majority, were split between progressive and conservative factions, each promoting its own candidate. Likewise, the Democrats proposed their own candidate. As a result of this three-way split, no individual received a majority vote. It took four months for a compromise solution to emerge: Democrat Augustus Bacon would serve for a single day, August 14, 1911, during the vice president's absence. Thereafter, Bacon and four RepublicansCharles Curtis, Jacob Gallinger, Henry Cabot Lodge, and Frank Brandegeewould alternate as president pro tempore for the remainder of the Congress.[8]\\r\\nIn January 1945, the 79th Congress elected Kenneth McKellar, who at the time was the Senator with the longest continuous service, to be President pro tempore. Since then, it has become customary for the majority party's senior member to hold this position. Arthur Vandenberg (in 1947ÿ1949) was the last president pro tempore not to be the senior member of the majority party, aside from the single day accorded Milton Young (in December 1980), who was the retiring senior member of the Republican Party, which would hold the majority in the incoming 97th Congress.[4]\\r\\nThree presidents pro tempore subsequently became Vice President: John Tyler, William R. King and Charles Curtis. Tyler is the only one to become president (in April 1841, following the death of William Henry Harrison).\\r\\nWhile the president pro tempore does have other official duties, the holders of the office have, like the vice president, over time ceased presiding over the Senate on a daily basis, owing to the mundane and ceremonial nature of the position.[10] Furthermore, as the president pro tempore is now usually the most senior senator of the majority party, he or she most likely also chairs a major Senate committee and has other significant demands on his or her time. Therefore, the president pro tempore has less time now than in the past to preside daily over the Senate. Instead, junior senators from the majority party are designated acting president pro tempore to preside over the Senate.[12] This allows junior senators to learn proper parliamentary procedure.[3] The acting president pro tempore is usually reappointed daily by the president pro tempore.[13]\\r\\nIn June 1963, because of the illness of president pro tempore Carl Hayden, Senator Lee Metcalf was designated permanent acting president pro tempore. No term was imposed on this designation, so Metcalf retained it until he died in office in 1978.[9]\\r\\nThe ceremonial post of deputy president pro tempore was created for Hubert Humphrey, a former vice president, in 1977 following his losing bid to become the Senate majority leader.[14] The Senate resolution creating the position stated that any former president or former vice president serving in the Senate would be entitled to this position, though none has served since Humphrey's death in 1978,[9] and former vice president Walter Mondale, who sought his former Senate seat in Minnesota in 2002, is the only one to have tried. Andrew Johnson is the only former president to have subsequently served in the Senate.\\r\\nGeorge J. Mitchell was elected deputy president pro tempore in 1987, because of the illness of president pro tempore John C. Stennis, similar to Metcalf's earlier designation as permanent acting president pro tempore. The office has remained vacant since 1989 and no senator other than Humphrey and Mitchell has held it since its creation.[9] Mitchell is the only person to have served as deputy president pro tempore who was neither a former president nor former vice president of the United States.\\r\\nThe post is largely honorary and ceremonial, but comes with a salary increase. By statute, the compensation granted to the position holder equals the rate of annual compensation paid to the president pro tempore, majority leader, and minority leader. (See 2 U.S.C.??6112.)[9]\\r\\nSince 2001, the honorary title of president pro tempore emeritus has been given to a senator of the minority party who has previously served as president pro tempore. The position has been held by Strom Thurmond (R-South Carolina) (2001ÿ2003), Robert Byrd (D-West Virginia) (2003ÿ2007), Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) (2007ÿ2009) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) (2015ÿpresent). From 2009 to 2015, no senator met the requirements for the position.\\r\\nThe position was created for Thurmond when the Democratic Party regained a majority in the Senate in June 2001.[15] With the change in party control, Democrat Robert Byrd of West Virginia replaced Thurmond as president pro tempore, reclaiming a position he had previously held from 1989 to 1995 and briefly in January 2001. Thurmond's retirement from the Senate on January 3, 2003, coincided with a change from Democratic to Republican control, making Stevens president pro tempore and Byrd the second president pro tempore emeritus. Byrd returned as president pro tempore, and Stevens became the third president pro tempore emeritus, when the Democrats gained control of the Senate in 2007.[9] While a president pro tempore emeritus has no official duties, he is entitled to an increase in staff[16] and advises party leaders on the functions of the Senate.\\r\\nThe office's accompanying budget increase was removed toward the end of the 113th Congress, shortly before Patrick Leahy was to become the first holder of the title in six years. Quoted in CQ Roll Call, Leahy commented, \\"They didn't keep their commitment. They want to treat us differently than we treated them, and so they've got that right. It seems kind of petty, but it really doesn't matter to me. I've got plenty of funding, plenty of good staff.\\"[17]\\r\\nThe salary of the president pro tempore for 2012 was $193,400, equal to that of the majority leaders and minority leaders of both houses of Congress. If there is a vacancy in the office of vice president, then the salary would be the same as that of the vice president, $230,700.[9]","input":"Who is our current president of the senate?"},{"output":"the place where the long bone grows longer (adds length)","context":"The epiphyseal plate (or epiphysial plate, physis, or growth plate)  is a hyaline cartilage plate in the metaphysis at each end of a long bone. It is the part of a long bone where new bone growth takes place; that is, the whole bone is alive, with maintenance remodeling throughout its existing bone tissue, but the growth plate is the place where the long bone grows longer (adds length).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plate is found in children and adolescents;  in adults, who have stopped growing, the plate is replaced by an epiphyseal line. This replacement is known as epiphyseal closure or growth plate fusion. Complete fusion happens between ages 12ÿ16 for girls and 14-19 for boys.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nEndochondral ossification is responsible for the initial bone development from cartilage in utero and infants and the longitudinal growth of long bones in the epiphyseal plate. The plate's chondrocytes are under constant division by mitosis. These daughter cells stack facing the epiphysis while the older cells are pushed towards the diaphysis. As the older chondrocytes degenerate, osteoblasts ossify the remains to form new bone. In puberty increasing levels of estrogen, in both females and males, leads to increased apoptosis of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate.[2] Depletion of chondrocytes due to apoptosis leads to less ossification and growth slows down and later stops when the entire cartilage have become replaced by bone, leaving only a thin epiphyseal scar which later disappears.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe growth plate has a very specific morphology in having a zonal arrangement.\\r\\n\\r\\n[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nA mnemonic for remembering the names of the epiphyseal plate growth zones is \\"Real People Have Career Options,\\" standing for: Resting zone, Proliferative zone, Hypertrophic cartilage zone, Calcified cartilage zone, Ossification zone.[5]  The growth plate is clinically relevant in that it is often the primary site for infection, metastasis, fractures and the effects of endocrine bone disorders.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDefects in the development and continued division of epiphyseal plates can lead to growth disorders.

With a total height of 829.8?m (2,722?ft) and a roof height (excluding antenna) of 828?m (2,717?ft), the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure in the world since its topping out in late 2008.[4][9]\\r\\nConstruction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It is designed to be the centrepiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to construct the building is reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The building was originally named Burj Dubai but was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan;[3] Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest tower in the world.\\r\\nBurj Khalifa was designed by Adrian Smith, then of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), whose firm designed the Willis Tower and One World Trade Center. Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project. The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the Burj Khalifas central core houses all vertical transportation with the exception of egress stairs within each of the wings.[10] The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.\\r\\nCritical reception to Burj Khalifa has been generally positive, and the building has received many awards. There have been complaints concerning migrant workers from South Asia who were the primary building labor force. These center on free market wages[citation needed] deemed by third parties to be insufficient.[11][citation needed] Several instances of suicides have been reported.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction began on 6 January 2004, with the exterior of the structure completed on 1 October 2009.The building officially opened on 4 January 2010,[2][13] and is part of the new 2?km2 (490-acre) development called Downtown Dubai at the 'First Interchange' along Sheikh Zayed Road, near Dubai's main business district. The tower's architecture and engineering were performed by Souffian AL-Jabiry of Chicago, with Adrian Smith as chief architect, and Bill Baker as chief structural engineer.[14][15] The primary contractor was Samsung C&T of South Korea.[16] The tower's construction was done by the construction division of Al Ghurair Investment group.[17][18]\\r\\nBurj Khalifa was designed to be the centerpiece of a large-scale, mixed-use development that would include 30,000 homes, nine hotels (including The Address Downtown Dubai), 3 hectares (7.4 acres) of parkland, at least 19 residential towers, the Dubai Mall, and the 12-hectare (30-acre) artificial Burj Khalifa Lake. The decision to build Burj Khalifa is reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy to one that is service and tourism based. According to officials, it is necessary for projects like Burj Khalifa to be built in the city to garner more international recognition, and hence investment. \\"He (Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum) wanted to put Dubai on the map with something really sensational,\\" said Jacqui Josephson, a tourism and VIP delegations executive at Nakheel Properties.[19] The tower was known as Burj Dubai (\\"Dubai Tower\\") until its official opening in January 2010.[20] It was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan; Abu Dhabi and the federal government of UAE lent Dubai tens of billions of USD so that Dubai could pay its debts ÿ Dubai borrowed at least $80 billion for construction projects.[20] In the 2000s, Dubai started diversifying its economy but it suffered from an economic crisis in 2007ÿ2010, leaving large-scale projects already in construction abandoned.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere are unconfirmed reports of several planned height increases since its inception. Originally proposed as a virtual clone of the 560?m (1,837?ft) Grollo Tower proposal for Melbourne, Australia's Docklands waterfront development, the tower was redesigned by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM).[35] Marshall Strabala, an SOM architect who worked on the project until 2006, in late 2008 said that Burj Khalifa was designed to be 808?m (2,651?ft) tall.[36]\\r\\nThe architect who designed it, Adrian Smith, felt that the uppermost section of the building did not culminate elegantly with the rest of the structure, so he sought and received approval to increase it to the current height.[citation needed] It has been explicitly stated that this change did not include any added floors, which is fitting with Smith's attempts to make the crown more slender.[37] Emaar properties announced on 9 June 2008 that construction of Burj Khalifa was delayed by upgraded finishes and would be completed only in September 2009.[38] An Emaar spokesperson said that \\"[t]he luxury finishes that were decided on in 2004, when the tower was initially conceptualised, is now being replaced by upgraded finishes. The design of the apartments has also been enhanced to make them more aesthetically attractive and functionally superior.\\"[39] A revised completion date of 2 December 2009 was then announced.[40] However, Burj Khalifa was opened on 4 January 2010, more than a month later.[2][13]\\r\\nThe tower was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), who also designed the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) in Chicago and the One World Trade Center in New York City. Burj Khalifa uses the bundled tube design of the Willis Tower, invented by Fazlur Rahman Khan.[41][42] Proportionally, the design uses half the amount of steel used in the construction of the Empire State Building thanks to the tubular system.[41][43] Dr. Khans contributions to the design of tall buildings have had a profound impact on architecture and engineering. It would be difficult to find any worldwide practices in the design of tall buildings that have not been directly or indirectly influenced by his work.[44] Its design is reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright's vision for The Illinois, a mile-high skyscraper designed for Chicago, as well as Chicago's Lake Point Tower. According to Marshall Strabala, a SOM architect who worked on the building's design team, Burj Khalifa was designed based on the 73 floor Tower Palace Three, an all residential building in Seoul. In its early planning, Burj Khalifa was intended to be entirely residential.[36]\\r\\nSubsequent to the original design by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Emaar Properties chose Hyder Consulting to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Ltd chosen to supervise the architecture of the project.[45] Hyder was selected for their expertise in structural and MEP (mechanical, electrical and plumbing) engineering.[46] Hyder Consulting's role was to supervise construction, certify SOM's design, and be the engineer and architect of record to the UAE authorities.[45] NORR's role was the supervision of all architectural components including on site supervision during construction and design of a 6-storey addition to the Office Annex Building for architectural documentation. NORR was also responsible for the architectural integration drawings for the Armani Hotel included in the Tower. Emaar Properties also engaged GHD,[47] an international multidisciplinary consulting firm, to act as an independent verification and testing authority for concrete and steelwork.\\r\\nThe design is derived from Islamic architecture.[24] As the tower rises from the flat desert base, there are 27 setbacks in a spiralling pattern, decreasing the cross section of the tower as it reaches toward the sky and creating convenient outdoor terraces. These setbacks are arranged and aligned in a way that minimizes vibration wind loading from eddy currents and vortices.[10] At the top, the central core emerges and is sculpted to form a finishing spire. At its tallest point, the tower sways a total of 1.5?m (4.9?ft).[48]\\r\\nThe spire of Burj Khalifa is composed of more than 4,000 tonnes (4,400 short tons; 3,900 long tons) of structural steel. The central pinnacle pipe weighs 350 tonnes (390 short tons; 340 long tons) and has a height of 200?m (660?ft). The spire also houses communications equipment.[49] This 244-metre spire is widely considered vanity height, since very little of its space is usable. Without the spire, Burj Khalifa would be merely 585 metres tall. This was reported in a Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) study, which notes that the empty spire \\"could be a skyscraper on its own\\".[22] Such a skyscraper, if located in Europe, would be the 11th tallest building on that continent.[50]\\r\\nIn 2009, architects announced that more than 1,000 pieces of art would adorn the interiors of Burj Khalifa, while the residential lobby of Burj Khalifa would display the work of Jaume Plensa.[51]\\r\\nThe cladding system consists of 142,000?m2 (1,528,000?sq?ft) of more than 26,000 reflective glass panels and aluminium and textured stainless steel spandrel panels with vertical tubular fins.[49] The architectural glass provides solar and thermal performance as well as an anti-glare shield for the intense desert sun, extreme desert temperatures and strong winds. In total the glass covers more than 174,000?m2 (1,870,000?sq?ft)[citation needed].\\r\\nThe exterior temperature at the top of the building is thought to be 6?C (11?F) cooler than at its base.[52]\\r\\nA 304-room Armani Hotel, the first of four by Armani, occupies 15 of the lower 39 floors.[4][53] The hotel was supposed to open on 18 March 2010,[54][55] but after several delays, it finally opened to the public on 27 April 2010.[56] The corporate suites and offices were also supposed to open from March onwards,[57] yet the hotel and observation deck remained the only parts of the building which were open in April 2010.\\r\\nThe sky lobbies on the 43rd and 76th floors house swimming pools.[58] Floors through to 108 have 900 private residential apartments (which, according to the developer, sold out within eight hours of being on the market). An outdoor zero-entry swimming pool is located on the 76th floor of the tower. Corporate offices and suites fill most of the remaining floors, except for a 122nd, 123rd and 124th floor where the At.mosphere restaurant, sky lobby and an indoor and outdoor observation deck are located respectively. In January 2010, it was planned that Burj Khalifa would receive its first residents from February 2010.[58][59]\\r\\nA total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators are installed.[49] The elevators have a capacity of 12 to 14 people per cabin, the fastest rising and descending at up to 10?m/s (33?ft/s) for double-deck elevators. However, the world's fastest single-deck elevator still belongs to Taipei 101 at 16.83?m/s (55.2?ft/s). Engineers had considered installing the world's first triple-deck elevators, but the final design calls for double-deck elevators.[27] The double-deck elevators are equipped with entertainment features such as LCD displays to serve visitors during their travel to the observation deck.[60] The building has 2,909 stairs from the ground floor to the 160th floor.[61]\\r\\nThe Burj Khalifa's water system supplies an average of 946,000?L (250,000?U.S.?gal) of water per day through 100?km (62?mi) of pipes.[24][62] An additional 213?km (132?mi) of piping serves the fire emergency system, and 34?km (21?mi) supplies chilled water for the air conditioning system.[62] The waste water system uses gravity to discharge water from plumbing fixtures, floor drains, mechanical equipment and storm water, to the city municipal sewer.[63]\\r\\nThe air conditioning has been provided by Voltas. The air conditioning system draws air from the upper floors where the air is cooler and cleaner than on the ground.[64] At peak cooling times, the tower's cooling is equivalent to that provided by 13,000 short tons (26,000,000?lb) of melting ice in one day,[62] or about 46?MW.[clarification needed] Water is collected via a condensate collection system and is used to irrigate the nearby park.[24]\\r\\nTo wash the 24,348 windows, totaling 120,000?m2 (1,290,000?sq?ft) of glass, the building has three horizontal tracks which each hold a 1,500?kg (3,300?lb) bucket machine. Above level 109, and up to tier 27, traditional cradles from davits are used. The top of the building is cleaned by a crew who use ropes to descend from the top to gain access.[65][66] Under normal conditions, when all building maintenance units are operational, it takes 36 workers three to four months to clean the entire exterior fa?ade.[49][67]\\r\\nUnmanned machines will clean the top 27 additional tiers and the glass spire. The cleaning system was developed in Melbourne, Australia at a cost of A$8?million.[67] The contract for building the state-of-the-art machines was won by Australian company CoxGomyl, a manufacturer of Building Maintenance Units.[68]\\r\\nThe elevator operating chart of the Burj Khalifa\\r\\nOutside, WET Enterprises designed a fountain system at a cost of Dh?800?million (US$217?million). Illuminated by 6,600 lights and 50 coloured projectors, it is 270?m (900?ft) long and shoots water 150?m (500?ft) into the air, accompanied by a range of classical to contemporary Arabic and world music. It is the world's second largest choreographed fountain.[69] On 26 October 2008, Emaar announced that based on results of a naming contest the fountain would be called the Dubai Fountain.[70]\\r\\nAn outdoor observation deck, named At the Top, opened on 5 January 2010 on the 124th floor. At 452?m (1,483?ft), it was the highest outdoor observation deck in the world when it opened.[71] Although it was surpassed in December 2011 by Cloud Top 488 on the Canton Tower, Guangzhou at 488?m (1,601?ft),[72] Burj Khalifa opened the 148th floor SKY level at 555?m (1,821?ft), once again giving it the highest observation deck in the world on 15 October 2014.[28][29] This was until the Shanghai Tower opened in June 2016 with an observation deck at a height of 561 metres. The 124th floor observation deck also features the electronic telescope, an augmented reality device developed by Gsmprjct of Montral, which allows visitors to view the surrounding landscape in real-time, and to view previously saved images such as those taken at different times of day or under different weather conditions.[73][74][75] To manage the daily rush of sightseers, visitors are able to purchase tickets in advance for a specific date and time and at a 75% discount on tickets purchased on the spot.[76]\\r\\nOn 8 February 2010, the observation deck was closed to the public after power-supply problems caused an elevator to become stuck between floors, trapping a group of tourists for 45 minutes.[77][78] Despite rumours of the observation deck reopening for St. Valentine's Day (14 February),[79] it remained closed until 4 April 2010.[80][81][82] During low tides and clearness, people can see the shores of Iran from the top of the skyscraper.[83]\\r\\nBurj Khalifa is surrounded by an 11?ha (27-acre) park designed by landscape architects SWA Group.[84] Like the tower, the park's design was based on the flower of the Hymenocallis, a desert plant.[85] At the centre of the park is the water room, which is a series of pools and water jet fountains. Benches and signs incorporate images of Burj Khalifa and the Hymenocallis flower.[86]\\r\\nThe plants are watered by water collected from the building's cooling system. The system provides 68,000,000?L (15,000,000?imp?gal) annually.[86] WET Enterprises, who also developed the Dubai Fountain, developed the park's six water features.[87]\\r\\nThe following is a breakdown of floors.[49][88]\\r\\nThe tower was constructed by Samsung C&T from South Korea, who also did work on the Petronas Twin Towers and Taipei 101.[90] Samsung C&T built the tower in a joint venture with Besix from Belgium and Arabtec from UAE. Turner is the Project Manager on the main construction contract.[91]\\r\\nUnder UAE law, the Contractor and the Engineer of Record, Hyder Consulting (manual structural analysis professionals which used Flash Analysis authored by Allen Wright), is jointly and severally liable for the performance of Burj Khalifa.\\r\\nThe primary structure is reinforced concrete. Putzmeister created a new, super high-pressure trailer concrete pump, the BSA 14000 SHP-D, for this project.[26] Burj Khalifa's construction used 330,000?m3 (431,600?cu?yd) of concrete and 55,000 tonnes (61,000 short tons; 54,000 long tons) of steel rebar, and construction took 22?million man-hours.[14] In May 2008 Putzmeister pumped concrete with more than 21 MPA ultimate compressive strength of gravel that would surpass the 600 meters weight of the effective area of each column from the foundation to the next fourth level, and the rest is by metal columns jacketed or covered with concreted to a then world record delivery height of 606?m (1,988?ft),[26] the 156th floor. Three tower cranes were used during construction of the uppermost levels, each capable of lifting a 25-tonne load.[92] The remaining structure above is constructed of lighter steel.\\r\\nIn 2003, 33 test holes were drilled to study the strength of the bedrock underlying the structure.[93] \\"Weak to very weak sandstone and siltstone\\" was found, just metres below the surface. Samples were taken from test holes drilled to a depth of 140 metres, finding weak to very weak rock all the way.[94] The study described the site as part of a \\"seismically active area\\".\\r\\nOver 45,000?m3 (58,900?cu?yd) of concrete, weighing more than 110,000 tonnes (120,000 short tons; 110,000 long tons) were used to construct the concrete and steel foundation, which features 192 piles; each pile is 1.5 metre diameter x 43 m long, buried more than 50?m (164?ft) deep.[27] The foundation is designed to support the total building weight of approximately 450,000 tonnes (500,000 short tons; 440,000 long tons). This weight is then divided by the compressive strength of concrete of which is 30 MPa which yield a 450 sq.meters of vertical normal effective area which then yield to a 12 meters by 12 meters dimensions.[95] A cathodic protection system is in place under the concrete to neutralize the groundwater and prevent corrosion.[49]\\r\\nThe Burj Khalifa is highly compartmentalised. Pressurized, air-conditioned refuge floors are located approximately every 35 floors where people can shelter on their long walk down to safety in case of an emergency or fire.[49][96]\\r\\nSpecial mixes of concrete are made to withstand the extreme pressures of the massive building weight; as is typical with reinforced concrete construction, each batch of concrete used was tested to ensure it could withstand certain pressures. CTLGroup, working for SOM, conducted the creep and shrinkage testing critical for the structural analysis of the building.[97]\\r\\nThe consistency of the concrete used in the project was essential. It was difficult to create a concrete that could withstand both the thousands of tonnes bearing down on it and Persian Gulf temperatures that can reach 50?C (122?F). To combat this problem, the concrete was not poured during the day. Instead, during the summer months, ice was added to the mixture and it was poured at night when the air is cooler and the humidity is higher. A cooler concrete mixture cures evenly throughout and is therefore less likely to set too quickly and crack. Any significant cracks could have put the entire project in jeopardy.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn March 2009, Mohamed Ali Alabbar, chairman of the project's developer, Emaar Properties, said office space pricing at Burj Khalifa reached US$4,000 per sq ft (over US$43,000 per m2) and the Armani Residences, also in Burj Khalifa, sold for US$3,500 per sq ft (over US$37,500 per m2).[107] He estimated the total cost for the project to be about US$1.5?billion.[3]\\r\\nThe project's completion coincided with the global financial crisis of 2007ÿ2012, and with vast overbuilding in the country; this led to high vacancies and foreclosures.[108] With Dubai mired in debt from its huge ambitions, the government was forced to seek multibillion dollar bailouts from its oil-rich neighbor Abu Dhabi. Subsequently, in a surprise move at its opening ceremony, the tower was renamed Burj Khalifa, said to honour the UAE President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan for his crucial support.[9][109]\\r\\nBecause of the slumping demand in Dubai's property market, the rents in the Burj Khalifa plummeted 40% some ten months after its opening. Out of 900 apartments in the tower, 825 were still empty at that time.[110][111] However, over the next two and a half years, overseas investors steadily began to purchase the available apartments and office space in Burj Khalifa.[112] By October 2012, Emaar reported that around 80% of the apartments were occupied.[113]\\r\\nThe ceremony was broadcast live on a giant screen on Burj Park Island and on smaller screens elsewhere. Hundreds of media outlets from around the world reported live from the scene.[114] In addition to the media presence, 6,000 guests were expected.[115]\\r\\nThe opening of Burj Khalifa was held on 4 January 2010.[116] The ceremony featured a display of 10,000 fireworks, light beams projected on and around the tower, and further sound, light and water effects.[114] The celebratory lighting was designed by UK lighting designers Speirs and Major Associates.[117] Using the 868 powerful stroboscope lights that are integrated into the fa?ade and spire of the tower, different lighting sequences were choreographed, together with more than 50 different combinations of other effects.\\r\\nA short film about Burj Khalifa and Dubai in general was followed by a fireworks and light show.[114] The first part of the show was based on a desert flower theme and included fireworks, lights, and sounds. The second segment told the story of the tower's construction using 300 projectors to generate an image of the tower. The final segment used fireworks and lights to illuminate the tower.[114]\\r\\nIn June 2010, Burj Khalifa was the recipient of the 2010 \\"Best Tall Building Middle East & Africa\\" award by the CTBUH.[118] On 28 September 2010 Burj Khalifa won the award for best project of the year at the Middle East Architect Awards 2010.[119] CTBUH Awards Chair Gordon Gill, of Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture said:\\r\\nWe are talking about a building here that has changed the landscape of what is possible in architecture a building that became internationally recognized as an icon long before it was even completed. 'Building of the Century' was thought a more appropriate title for it.[120]\\r\\nBesides these awards, Burj Khalifa was the recipient of following awards.[121][122]\\r\\nThe building has been used by several experienced BASE jumpers for both authorised and unauthorised BASE jumping:\\r\\nOn 28 March 2011, Alain \\"Spiderman\\" Robert scaled the outside of Burj Khalifa. The climb to the top of the spire took six hours. To comply with UAE safety laws, Robert, who usually climbs in free solo style, used a rope and harness for the climb.[130]\\r\\nWithin 17 months of the building's official opening, a man described as \\"an Asian in his mid-30s\\" who worked at one of the companies in the tower, died by suicide on 10 May 2011 by jumping from the 147th floor. He fell 39 floors, landing on a deck on the 108th floor. Dubai police confirmed the act as a suicide, reporting that \\"[they] also came to know that the man decided to commit suicide as his company refused to grant leave.\\"[131]\\r\\nThe Daily Mail reported that on 16 November 2014, Laura Vanessa Nunes, a Portuguese national who was in Dubai on a tourist visa, fell to her death from Burj Khalifa's \\"At the Top\\" observation deck on the 148th floor.[132] However, on 18 May 2015, Dubai police disputed the report made by the Daily Mail on this incident and said that this incident took place in Jumeirah Lakes Towers.[133] A Dubai Coroner's report stated Laura's body was found on the third floor of the Burj Khalifa[134]. Emails obtained under the Freedom of Information act from Portugal's embassy in the UAE also confirmed that Laura Nunes had committed suicide from the 148th floor of the Burj Khalifa. [135]\\r\\nAt the higher floors of the Burj, people can still see the sun for a couple of minutes after it has set on the ground. This has led Dubai clerics to rule that those living above the 80th floor should wait 2 additional minutes to break their Ramadan fast, and those living above the 150th floor, 3 minutes.[136]\\r\\nThe Burj Khalifa was built primarily by workers from South Asia and East Asia.[137][138] This is generally because the current generation of UAE locals prefer governmental jobs and do not have an attitude favouring private sector employment.[139][140] On 17 June 2008, there were 7,500 skilled workers employed at the construction site.[38] Press reports indicated in 2006 that skilled carpenters at the site earned S4.34 a day, and labourers earned S2.84.[137] According to a BBC investigation and a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report, the workers were housed in abysmal conditions, and worked long hours for low pay.[141][142][143] During the construction of Burj Khalifa, only one construction-related death was reported.[144] However, workplace injuries and fatalities in the UAE are \\"poorly documented\\", according to HRW.[141]\\r\\nOn 21 March 2006, about 2,500 workers, who were upset over buses that were delayed for the end of their shifts, protested and triggered a riot, damaging cars, offices, computers and construction equipment.[137] A Dubai Interior Ministry official said the rioters caused almost S500,000 in damage.[137] Most of the workers involved in the riot returned the following day but refused to work.[137]","input":"When was the burj khalifa finished being built?"},{"output":"85 days","context":"This is a list of people who have walked across the United States from the east coast to the west coast or vice versa.

The settlement was founded by Spaniards of the Franciscan order on \\"The Feast of the Birth of Mary,\\" September 8, 1771, as the fourth of what would become 21 Spanish missions in California.[10] San Gabriel Arcngel, named after the Archangel Gabriel and often referred to as the \\"Godmother of the Pueblo of Los Angeles\\",[11] was designed by Antonio Cruzado, who hailed from C܇rdoba, Spain. Cruzado gave the building its strong Moorish architectural influence. The capped buttresses and the tall, narrow windows are unique among the missions of the California chain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMission San Gabriel was founded on September 8, 1771 by Fray Angel Francisico de Sonera and Fray Pedro Benito Cambon. The planned site for the Mission was along the banks of the Ro de los Temblores (the River of the Earthquakesthe Santa Ana River). The priests chose an alternate site on a fertile plain located directly alongside the Rio Hondo in the Whittier Narrows.[12] The site of the Misi܇n Vieja (or \\"Old Mission\\") is located near the intersection of San Gabriel Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue. In 1776, a flash flood destroyed much of the crops and ruined the Mission complex, which was subsequently relocated five miles closer to the mountains in present-day San Gabriel (the native settlement of 'Iisanchanga). The Mission is the base from which the pueblo that became the city of Los Angeles was sent. On December 9, 1812 (the \\"Feast Day of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin\\"), a series of massive earthquakes shook Southern California. The 1812 Wrightwood earthquake caused the three-bell campanario, located adjacent to the chapel's east fa?ade, to collapse. A larger, six-bell structure was subsequently constructed at the far end of the capilla. While no pictorial record exists to document what the original structure looked like, architectural historian Rexford Newcomb deduced the design and published a depiction in his 1916 work The Franciscan Mission Architecture of Alta (upper) California.\\r\\nLegend has it that the founding expedition was confronted by a large group of native Tongva peoples whose intention was to drive the strangers away. One of the priests laid a painting of \\"Our Lady of Sorrows\\" on the ground for all to see, whereupon the natives, designated by the settlers as the Gabrieli?os, immediately made peace with the missionaries, because they were so moved by the painting's beauty.[1] Today the 300 year old work hangs in front of and slightly to the left of the old high altar and reredos in the Mission's sanctuary.\\r\\nA large stone cross stands in the center of the campo santo (cemetery), first consecrated in 1778 and then again on January 29, 1939 by the Los Angeles Archbishop John Cantwell. It serves as the final resting place for some 6,000 \\"neophytes;\\" a small stone marker denotes the gravesite of Jos de Los Santos, the last American Indian to be buried on the grounds, at the age of 101 in February 1921. Also interred at the Mission are the bodies of numerous Franciscan priests who died during their time of service, as well as the remains of Reverend Raymond Catalan, C.M.F., who undertook the restoration of the Mission's gardens. Entombed at the foot of the altar are the remains of eight Franciscan priests (listed in order of interment): Miguel Snchez, Antonio Cruzado, Francisco Dumetz, Roman Ulibarri, Joaquin P. Nuez, Ger܇nimo Boscana, Jos Bernardo Snchez, and Blas Ordaz. Buried among the priests is centenarian Eulalia Perez de Guilln Marin, the \\"keeper of the keys\\" under Spanish rule; her grave is marked by a bench dedicated in her memory.\\r\\nWell over 25,000 baptisms were conducted at San Gabriel between 1771 and 1834, making it the most prolific in the mission chain. In its heyday it furnished food and supplies to settlements and other missions throughout California. A majority of the Mission structures fell into ruins after it was secularized in November 1834. The once-extensive vineyards were falling to decay, with fences broken down and animals roaming freely through it.[13]\\r\\nThe Mission's chapel functioned as a parish church for the City of San Gabriel from 1862 until 1908, when the Claretian Missionaries came to San Gabriel and began the job of rebuilding and restoring the Mission. In 1874, tracks were laid for Southern Pacific Railroad near the mission. In 2012, artifacts from the mission era were found when the tracks were lowered into a trench known as the Alameda Corridor-East.[14] On October 1, 1987 the Whittier Narrows earthquake damaged the property. A significant portion of the original complex has since been restored.\\r\\nThe goal of the missions was to become self-sufficient in relatively short order. Farming was the most important industry of any mission. Prior to the missions, the native-Americans had developed a complex, self-sufficient culture. The missionaries believed the native Tongva people were inferior and in need of conversion to Christianity. The mission priests established what they thought of as a manual training school: to teach the Indians their style of agriculture, the mechanical arts, and the raising and care of livestock. The missions, utilizing the labor of the neophytes, produced everything they used and consumed. After 1811, the mission Indians could be said to sustain the entire military and civil government of California.[15]\\r\\n\\"The names of the rancherias associated with San Gabriel Mission were: Acuragna, Alyeupkigna, Awigna, Azucsagna, Cahuenga, Chokishgna, Chowigna, Cucomogna, Hahaulogna, Harasgna, Houtgna, Hutucgna, Isanthcogna, Maugna, Nacaugna, Pascegna, Pasinogna, Pimocagna, Pubugna, Sibagna, Sisitcanogna, Sonagna, Suangna, Tibahagna, Toviscanga, Toybipet, Yangna.\\"[16]\\r\\nTo efficiently manage its extensive lands, Mission San Gabriel established several outlying sub-missions, known as asistencias. Several of these became or were included in land grants following the Mexican secularization of the missions in the 1830s, including:\\r\\nIn 1816, the Mission built a grist mill on a nearby creek. El Molino Viejo still stands, now preserved as a museum and historic landmark. Other mission industries included cowhide tanning/exporting and tallow-rendering (for making soap and for export), lime kilns, tile making, cloth weaving for blankets and clothing, and adobe bricks.\\r\\nBells were important to daily life at any mission. They were rung to mark mealtimes, to call the Mission residents to work and to religious services, to mark births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing of the mission bells.The mission bells were also used to tell time.\\r\\nToday visitors can tour the church, museum and grounds. The adobe museum building was built in 1812 and was originally used for sleeping quarters and book storage.[17] Exhibits include mission relics, books and religious artifacts. The grounds feature operations from the original mission complex, including indoor and outdoor kitchens, winery, water cisterns, soap and candle vats, tanning vats for preparing cattle hides, and a cemetery. There is also a gift shop.\\r\\nAs part of the William McPherson Collection in the Special Collections at Claremont Colleges Honnold/Mudd Library, the Matrimonial Investigation Records of the San Gabriel Mission are a valuable resource for research on the pre-statehood activities of the Mission.[18] William McPherson was a rancher, scholar, and collector from Orange County, California who donated his extensive collection of mission documents, primarily from the Mission San Gabriel Arcngel, to Special Collections in 1964.[18][19] The matrimonial records span 1788ÿ1861 and are notarized interviews with couples wanting to marry in the Roman Catholic Church, performed to establish the couples freedom to marry.[18] The collection includes 165 investigations, with 173 men and 170 women.[18] Because the donated records are fragile, they are no longer available to be photocopied.

In this context, the global production figure given by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) was 50 million tonnes for 2012, equivalent to double of the 2002 production.[5] This increase is also reflected in increases of Indonesias production of palm oil for the same period, from 10.300 million tonnes in 2002 and 28.50 million tonnes in 2012.[4]\\r\\nThe entire oil production is derived from Indonesia's rainforest which ranks third in the world, the other two being in the Amazon and Congo basins. According to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association, one third of this production is attributed to smallholder farmers and the remaining to multinationals. Palm trees that were planted about 25 years ago have an annual average production rate of 4 tonnes of oil per hectare.\\r\\nIndonesia is considering plans to increase production this by introducing newer varieties which could double production rate per hectare.[5]\\r\\nBorneo and Sumatra are the two islands that account for 96% of Indonesias palm oil production.[6] As of 2011, there were 7.8 million hectares of palm oil plantations, with 6.1 million hectares of these being productive plantations under harvest, thus making Indonesia the global leader in crude palm oil (CPO) production. According to World Bank reports, nearly 50% of CPO produced in the country is exported in an unprocessed form, while the remaining is processed into cooking oil, about half of which is exported, while the rest is consumed locally.[7]\\r\\nPalm oil is an essential ingredient for the food industry, used as a cooking oil or in the production of processed foods (such as many types of chocolates, biscuits, chewing gum...) and for the manufacture of cosmetic and hygiene products (soaps, lipstick, washing powder...).[8] It is also valuable as a lubricant in industrial production or for the energy sector for the production of biodiesel.[6]\\r\\nMajor local and global companies are building mills and refineries, including PT Astra Agro Lestari Terbuka (150,000 tpa biodiesel refinery), PT Bakrie Group (a biodiesel factory and new plantations), Surya Dumai Group (biodiesel refinery).[9]\\r\\nCargill (sometimes operating through CTP Holdings of Singapore) is building new refineries and mills in Malaysia and Indonesia, expanding its Rotterdam refinery to handle 300,000 tpa of palm oil, acquiring plantations in Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Papua New Guinea.[citation needed]\\r\\nRobert Kuok's Wilmar International Limited has plantations and 25 refineries across Indonesia, to supply feedstock to the new biodiesel refineries of Singapore, Riau, Indonesia and Rotterdam.[9]\\r\\nMusim Mas Group has plantations and refineries in Malaysia and Indonesia - Kalimantan, Medan etc. although they are headquartered in Singapore.\\r\\nMarihat Reaserch Station (MRS), nowadays known as RISPA and located in Medan, is the first research centre for Palm Oil Plantation for Indonesia. One of its well-known experts in soil, who has now retired, in the soil was Ir. Petrus Purba.\\r\\nIn August 2011, the governor of Aceh issued a permit for Indonesian palm oil firm PT Kallista Alam to develop around 1,600 hectares in Tripa.[10] Indonesian palm oil producer Triputra Agro Persada will reportedly increase its planted area by about two-thirds from 2013 by 2015.[11]\\r\\nSince agricultural land is limited, in order to plant monocultures of oil palms, land used for other cultivations or the tropical forest need to be cleared. Of the total logging in Indonesia, up to 80% is reported to be performed illegally.[12] A major environmental threat is then the destruction of rainforests in Indonesia, which was estimated at 0.84 Mha of primary forest per year from 2000 to 2012.[13] This entails a reduction in biodiversity and an alteration of ecosystems which causes the destruction of the habitats of endangered species such as Borneo pygmy elephants, Sumatran elephants, Sumatran tigers, Sumatran rhinoceroses, and the various species of orangutan that can be found only on the forests of Borneo and Sumatra.\\r\\nDeforestation also makes Indonesia one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is released in the atmosphere massively with the cutting of tropical peatlands, which are carbon sinks, according to Greenpeace.[14] Another cause are illegal forest fires to clear land for palm oil plantations. According to WWF for example, in 1997 around 0.81 to 2.57 gigatons of carbon were released by the fires which represented \\"13-40% of the mean annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuels that year\\".[15]\\r\\nIndustrial palm tree plantations also impacts negatively the quality of soils, water and the air because they often rely on the use of agrochemicals products, such as pesticides or fertilizers.[13]\\r\\nA government moratorium on the clearing of new forest was effective from 2011 to 2015.\\r\\nThe Indonesian Palm Oil Board has planned to adopt new planting materials on the older plantations which could double yields compared to the present annual rate of 4 tonnes of oil per hectare. In addition, the government will encourage development of degraded lands found suitable to grow palm trees. This area is reported to be 14 million hectares in the four provinces of Kalimantan, on the Indonesian part of the Borneo island.[5]\\r\\nThe expansion of the palm oil industry is driven by its profitability, and it has the potential to develop new jobs and improve the standards of living of people and small-holders when conducted sustainably.[16][17] According to the UNDP, there are about 16 million jobs that depend on the palm oil sector.[18]\\r\\nOn the other side, deforestation for oil palm plantation development also endangers indigenous tribes and local communities as it entails the destruction of living spaces or land appropriation.[19] For example, in regions like Kalimantan, the local livelihoods of Dayak communities and their traditions of shifting cultivation, are undermined by the development of palm oil production and monocultures.[20] This often results in human rights violations and confrontation between large-scale producers and local communities whose land is appropriated.[21] Colchester, for example, found that in 2010, there had been more than 630 land disputes linked to oil palm production in Indonesia.[22]\\r\\nThe industry of palm oil also causes pollution of air and water which increase health risks to the populations of Indonesia.\\r\\nIn response to critiques on the industry by environmental and human rights group, efforts are made towards more sustainability of the industry. According to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), that applies to palm oils which are produced to increase the food supply while keeping in mind the goals to \\"safeguard social interests, communities and workers\\" or to \\"protect the environment and wildlife\\" for example.[23]\\r\\nIn 2011, Indonesias Sustainable Palm Oil System (ISPO) was introduced. It is a mandatory certification scheme to ensure the quality and the respect of norms regarding the environment, workers and respect of local populations that should apply to all producers.[18]\\r\\nThe Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is also active in the region in providing certifications of sustainability for the produces who match the standards.\\r\\n Media related to Oil palm plantations in Indonesia at Wikimedia Commons","input":"Where are the largest palm oil plantations located?"},{"output":"Rory Charles Graham","context":"Rory Charles Graham[3] (born 29 January 1985), better known as Rag'n'Bone Man, is an English singer-songwriter. His first hit single \\"Human\\" was released in 2016 and his debut album, also named Human, was released in February 2017. At the 2017 Brit Awards he was named British Breakthrough Act and also received the Critics' Choice Award.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGraham was born in Uckfield, East Sussex on 29 January 1985.[4] He attended the school Ringmer Community College, was expelled, and then enrolled at Uckfield Community Technology College. At the age of 15, he MCed with a drum and bass crew using the handle Rag 'N' Bonez, inspired by watching repeats of the 1970s British sitcom Steptoe and Son. When he moved to Brighton, his friend Gi3mo formed the Rum Committee and invited him to join the group as well. He started performing at Slip-jam B, where he met a lot of people who helped him to start his musical career.[5] Over the next few years, they supported hip hop artists Pharoahe Monch and KRS-One at Brightons Concorde 2, and released their own album through Bandcamp.\\r\\nAround 2011, Graham started working with UK hip hop label High Focus, releasing a number of recordings with them such as; a collaboration E.P with MC/Producer Leaf Dog under the name (Dog 'n Bone E.P [2013]) and also a project with MC/Producer Dirty Dike under the name (Put That Soul On Me [2014]).\\r\\nShortly afterwards Graham began to collaborate with record producer Mark Crew, who at the time was working on Bastilles debut album Bad Blood. In 2013 Graham signed a publishing deal with Warner Chappell which enabled him to pursue his music career full-time.[6]\\r\\nIn 2014, working in collaboration with Mark Crew, Graham released an EP, Wolves through Best Laid Plans Records, containing nine tracks with guests including rapper Vince Staples, Stig Of The Dump, and Kate Tempest.

It is established by the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement to serve as a buffer zone between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). The demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a border barrier that divides the Korean Peninsula roughly in half. It was created by agreement between North Korea, China and the United Nations in 1953. The DMZ is 250 kilometres (160 miles) long, and about 4 kilometres (2.5 miles) wide.\\r\\nWithin the DMZ is a meeting point between the two nations in the small Joint Security Area near the western end of the zone, where negotiations take place. There have been various incidents in and around the DMZ, with military and civilian casualties on both sides.\\r\\nThe Korean Demilitarized Zone intersects but does not follow the 38th parallel north, which was the border before the Korean War. It crosses the parallel on an angle, with the west end of the DMZ lying south of the parallel and the east end lying north of it.\\r\\nThe DMZ is 250 kilometres (160 miles) long,[1] approximately 4?km (2.5?mi) wide. Though the zone separating both sides is demilitarized, beyond that strip the border is one of the most heavily militarized borders in the world.[2] The Northern Limit Line, or NLL, is the disputed maritime demarcation line between North and South Korea in the Yellow Sea, not agreed in the armistice. The coastline and islands on both sides of the NLL are also heavily militarized.[3]\\r\\nThe 38th parallel northwhich divides the Korean Peninsula roughly in halfwas the original boundary between the United States and Soviet Union's brief administration areas of Korea at the end of World War II. Upon the creation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, informally North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (ROK, informally South Korea) in 1948, it became a de facto international border and one of the most tense fronts in the Cold War.\\r\\nBoth the North and the South remained dependent on their sponsor states from 1948 to the outbreak of the Korean War. That conflict, which claimed over three million lives and divided the Korean Peninsula along ideological lines, commenced on 25 June 1950, with a full-front DPRK invasion across the 38th parallel, and ended in 1953 after international intervention pushed the front of the war back to near the 38th parallel.\\r\\nIn the Armistice Agreement of 27 July 1953, the DMZ was created as each side agreed to move their troops back 2,000?m (2,200 yards) from the front line, creating a buffer zone 4?km (2.5?mi) wide. The Military Demarcation Line (MDL) goes through the center of the DMZ and indicates where the front was when the agreement was signed.\\r\\nOwing to this theoretical stalemate, and genuine hostility between the North and the South, large numbers of troops are still stationed along both sides of the line, each side guarding against potential aggression from the other side. The armistice agreement explains exactly how many military personnel and what kind of weapons are allowed in the DMZ. Soldiers from both sides may patrol inside the DMZ, but they may not cross the MDL; ROK soldiers, however heavily armed, patrol under the aegis of military police, and have memorized each line of the armistice.[4] Sporadic outbreaks of violence have killed over 500 South Korean soldiers, 50 US soldiers and 250 soldiers from DPRK along the DMZ between 1953 and 1999.[5]\\r\\nDaeseong-dong (also written Tae Sung Dong) and Kij?ng-dong are the only settlements allowed by the armistice committee to remain within the boundaries of the DMZ.[6] Residents of Tae Sung Dong are governed and protected by the United Nations Command and are generally required to spend at least 240 nights per year in the village to maintain their residency.[6] In 2008, the village had a population of 218 people.[6] The villagers of Tae Sung Dong are direct descendants of people who owned the land before the 1950ÿ53 Korean War.[7]\\r\\nTo continue to deter North Korean incursion, in 2014 the United States government exempted the Korean DMZ from its pledge to eliminate anti-personnel landmines.[8]\\r\\nInside the DMZ, near the western coast of the peninsula, Panmunjom is the home of the Joint Security Area (JSA). Originally, it was the only connection between North and South Korea[9] but that changed on May 17, 2007 when a Korail train went through the DMZ to the North on the new Donghae Bukbu Line built on the east coast of Korea. However, the resurrection of this line was short-lived, as it closed again in July 2008 following an incident where a South Korean tourist was shot to death.\\r\\nThere are several buildings on both the north and the south side of the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), and there have been some built on top of it. The JSA is the location where all negotiations since 1953 have been held, including statements of Korean solidarity, which have generally amounted to little except a slight decline of tensions. The MDL goes through the conference rooms and down the middle of the conference tables where the North Koreans and the United Nations Command (primarily South Koreans and Americans) meet face to face.\\r\\nWithin the JSA are a number of buildings for joint meetings called Conference Row. These are used for direct talks between the Korean War participants and parties to the armistice. Facing the Conference Row buildings are the North Korean Panmungak (English: Panmun Hall) and the South Korean Freedom House. In 1994, North Korea enlarged Panmungak by adding a third floor. In 1998, South Korea built a new Freedom House for its Red Cross staff and to possibly host reunions of families separated by the Korean War. The new building incorporated the old Freedom House Pagoda within its design.\\r\\nSince 1953 there have been occasional confrontations and skirmishes within the JSA. The axe murder incident in August 1976 involved the attempted trimming of a tree which resulted in two deaths (Captain Arthur Bonifas and First Lieutenant Mark Barrett). Another incident occurred on 23 November 1984, when a Soviet tourist named Vasily Matuzok (sometimes spelled Matusak), who was part of an official trip to the JSA (hosted by the North), ran across the MDL shouting that he wanted to defect.[10] North Korean troops immediately chased after him, opening fire. Border guards on the South Korean side returned fire, eventually surrounding the North Koreans as they pursued Matusak. One South Korean and three North Korean soldiers were killed in the action, and Matusak was not captured.[11]\\r\\nIn late 2009, South Korean forces in conjunction with the United Nations Command began renovation of its three guard posts and two checkpoint buildings within the JSA compound. Construction was designed to enlarge and modernize the structures. Work was undertaken a year after North Korea finished replacing four JSA guard posts on its side of the MDL.[12]\\r\\nBoth North and South Korea maintain peace villages in sight of each other's side of the DMZ. In the South, Daeseong-dong is administered under the terms of the DMZ. Villagers are classed as Republic of Korea citizens, but are exempt from paying tax and other civic requirements such as military service. In the North, Kij?ng-dong features a number of brightly painted, poured-concrete multi-story buildings and apartments with electric lighting. These features represented an unheard-of level of luxury for rural Koreans, north or south, in the 1950s. The town was oriented so that the bright blue roofs and white sides of the buildings would be the most distinguishing features when viewed from the border. However, based on scrutiny with modern telescopic lenses, it has been claimed the buildings are mere concrete shells lacking window glass or even interior rooms,[13][14] with the building lights turned on and off at set times and the empty sidewalks swept by a skeleton crew of caretakers in an effort to preserve the illusion of activity.[15]\\r\\nIn the 1980s, the South Korean government built a 98.4?m (323?ft) flagpole in Daeseong-dong, which flies a South Korean flag weighing 130 kilograms (287 pounds). In what some have called the \\"flagpole war,\\" the North Korean government responded by building the 160?m (525?ft) Panmunjeom flagpole in Kij?ng-dong, only 1.2?km (0.7?mi) west of the border with South Korea. It flies a 270?kg (595?lb) flag of North Korea. As of 2014, the Panmunjom flagpole is the fourth tallest in the world, after the Jeddah Flagpole in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, at 170?m (558?ft), the Dushanbe Flagpole in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, at 165?m (541?ft) and the pole at the National Flag Square in Baku, Azerbaijan, which is 162?m (531?ft).[16][17]\\r\\nSince demarcation, the DMZ has had numerous cases of incidents and incursions by both sides, although the North Korean government typically never acknowledges direct responsibility for any of these incidents (there are exceptions, such as the axe incident).[18] This was particularly intense during the Korean DMZ Conflict (1966ÿ1969) when a series of skirmishes along the DMZ resulted in the deaths of 43 American, 299 South Korean and 397 North Korean soldiers.[19] This included the Blue House Raid in 1968, an attempt to assassinate President Park Chung Hee at the Blue House.[20]\\r\\nIn 1976, in now-declassified meeting minutes, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William Clements told Henry Kissinger that there had been 200 raids or incursions into North Korea from the south, though not by the U.S. military.[21] Details of only a few of these incursions have become public, including raids by South Korean forces in 1967 that had sabotaged about 50 North Korean facilities.[22]\\r\\nSince 15 November 1974, South Korea has discovered four tunnels crossing the DMZ that had been dug by North Korea; the orientation of the blasting lines within each tunnel indicated they were dug by North Korea. North Korea claimed that the tunnels were for coal mining; however, no coal was found in the tunnels, which were dug through granite. Some of the tunnel walls were painted black to give the appearance of anthracite.[23]\\r\\nThe tunnels are believed to have been planned as a military invasion route by North Korea. They run in a north-south direction and do not have branches. Following each discovery, engineering within the tunnels has become progressively more advanced. For example, the third tunnel sloped slightly upwards as it progressed southward, to prevent water stagnation. Today, visitors from the south may visit the second, third and fourth tunnels through guided tours.[24]\\r\\nThe first of the tunnels was discovered on 20 November 1974, by a South Korean Army patrol, noticing steam rising from the ground. The initial discovery was met with automatic fire from North Korean soldiers. Five days later, during a subsequent exploration of this tunnel, US Navy Commander Robert M. Ballinger and ROK Marine Corps Major Kim Hah-chul were killed in the tunnel by a North Korean explosive device. The blast also wounded five Americans and one South Korean from the United Nations Command.\\r\\nThe tunnel, which was about 0.9 by 1.2?m (3 by 4?ft), extended more than 1?km (0.62?mi) beyond the MDL into South Korea. The tunnel was reinforced with concrete slabs and had electric power and lighting. There were weapon storage and sleeping areas. A narrow-gauge railway with carts had also been installed. Estimates based on the tunnel's size suggest it would have allowed considerable numbers of soldiers to pass through it.[25]\\r\\nThe second tunnel was discovered on 19 March 1975. It is of similar length to the first tunnel. It is located between 50 and 160?m (160 and 520?ft) below ground, but is larger than the first, approximately 2 by 2?m (7 by 7 feet).\\r\\nThe third tunnel was discovered on 17 October 1978. Unlike the previous two, the third tunnel was discovered following a tip from a North Korean defector. This tunnel is about 1,600?m (5,200?ft) long and about 73?m (240?ft) below ground.[26] Foreign visitors touring the South Korean DMZ may view inside this tunnel using a sloped access shaft.\\r\\nA fourth tunnel was discovered on 3 March 1990, north of Haean town in the former Punchbowl battlefield. The tunnel's dimensions are 2 by 2?m (7 by 7 feet), and it is 145 metres (476?ft) deep. The method of construction is almost identical in structure to the second and the third tunnels.[27]\\r\\nAccording to North Korea, between 1977 and 1979 the South Korean and United States authorities constructed a concrete wall along the DMZ.[28] North Korea, however, began to propagate information about the wall only after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when the symbolism of a wall unjustly dividing a people became more apparent.[29]\\r\\nVarious organisations, such as the North Korean tour guide company Korea Konsult, claimed a wall was dividing Korea, saying that:\\r\\nIn the area south of the Military Demarcation Line, which cuts across Korea at its waist, there is a concrete wall which ... stretches more than 240?km (149?mi) from east to west, is 5ÿ8?m (16ÿ26?ft) high, 10ÿ19?m (33ÿ62?ft) thick at the bottom, and 3ÿ7?m (10ÿ23?ft) wide in the upper part. It is set with wire entanglements and dotted with gun embrasures, look-outs and varieties of military establishments.[30]\\r\\nIn December 1999, Chu Chang-jun, North Korea's ambassador to China, repeated claims that a \\"wall\\" divided Korea. He said the south side of the wall is packed with soil, which permits access to the top of the wall and makes it effectively invisible from the south side. He also claimed that it served as a bridgehead for any northward invasion.[31][32]\\r\\nThe United States and South Korea deny the wall's existence, although they do claim there are anti-tank barriers along some sections of the DMZ.[33]\\r\\nIn the RT documentary 10 Days in North Korea, the crew shot footage of a wall as seen from North Korea and described it as a \\"5 metre high wall stretching from east to west\\".[34] Dutch journalist and filmmaker Peter Tetteroo also shot footage of a barrier which his North Korean guides said was the Korean Wall.[when?][28]\\r\\nThe North Korean side of the DMZ primarily serves to defend North Korea from invasion by South Korean forces. However, it also serves a similar function as the Berlin Wall and the inner German border did against its own citizens in the former East Germany in that it stops North Korean citizens from defecting to South Korea.[35][36]\\r\\nFrom the armistice until 1972, approximately 7,700 South Korean soldiers and agents infiltrated North Korea to sabotage military bases and industrial areas.[37]\\r\\nNorth Korea has thousands of artillery pieces near the DMZ. Experts believe that 60 percent of its total artillery is positioned within a few kilometers of the DMZ acting as a deterrent against any South Korean invasion because of the damage they could inflict on Seoul and suburbs like Gimpo (population 300,000) and Paju (population 427,668) which is only 10 kilometers from the DMZ. In the event of all-out war it is believed that North Korea could fire 500,000 rounds of artillery on northern Seoul within the first hour.[38]\\r\\nFrom 1953 until 2004 both sides broadcast audio propaganda across the DMZ.[39] Massive loudspeakers mounted on several of the buildings delivered DPRK propaganda broadcasts directed towards the south as well as propaganda radio broadcasts across the border.[13] In 2004, the North and South agreed to end the broadcasts.[39]\\r\\nIn August 2015, a border incident occurred where two South Korean soldiers were wounded after stepping on landmines that had allegedly been laid on the southern side of the DMZ by North Korean forces near an ROK guard post.[40][41] Both North Korea and South Korea then resumed broadcasting propaganda by loudspeaker.[42] After four days of negotiations, on August 25, 2015 South Korea agreed to discontinue the broadcasts following a statement from North Korea's government expressing \\"regret\\" for the landmine incident.[43]\\r\\nOn 8 January 2016, in response to North Korea's supposed successful testing of a hydrogen bomb, South Korea resumed broadcasts directed at the north.[44] On 15 April 2016, it was reported that the South Koreans purchased a new stereo system to combat the North's broadcasts.[45]\\r\\nBoth North and South Korea have held balloon propaganda leaflet campaigns since the Korean War.[46]\\r\\nIn recent years, mainly South Korean non-governmental organizations have been involved in launching balloons targeted at the DMZ and beyond.[47] Due to the winds, the balloons tend to fall near the DMZ where there are mostly North Korean soldiers to see the leaflets.[48] As with the loudspeakers, balloon operations were mutually agreed to be halted between 2004 and 2010.[49] It has been assessed that the activists' balloons may contribute to the decay of remaining cooperation between the Korean governments,[50] and the DMZ has become more militarized in recent years.[51]\\r\\nMany North Korean leaflets during the Cold War gave instructions and maps to help the targeted South Korean soldiers in defecting. One of the leaflets found on the DMZ included a map of Cho Dae-hum's route of defection to North Korea across the DMZ. In addition to using balloons as a means of delivery, North Koreans have also used rockets to send leaflets to the DMZ.[52]\\r\\nThe Civilian Control Line is a line that designates an additional buffer zone to the DMZ within a distance of 5 to 20?km from the Southern Limit Line of the DMZ. Its purpose is to limit and control the entrance of civilians into the area in order to protect and maintain the security of military facilities and operations near the DMZ. The commander of the 8th US Army ordered the creation of the CCL and it was activated and first became effective in February 1954.[53]\\r\\nThe buffer zone that falls south of the Southern Limit Line is called the Civilian Control Zone. Barbed wire fences and manned military guard posts mark the Civilian Control Line. The Civilian Control Zone is necessary for the military to monitor civilian travel to tourist destinations close to the Southern Limit Line of the DMZ like the discovered infiltration tunnels and tourist observatories. Usually when traveling within the Civilian Control Zone, South Korean soldiers accompany tourist buses and cars as armed guards to monitor the civilians as well as to protect them from North Korean intruders.\\r\\nRight after the ceasefire, the Civilian Control Zone outside the DMZ encompassed 100 or so empty villages. The government implemented migration measures to attract settlers into the area. As a result, in 1983, when the area delineated by the Civilian Control Line was at its largest, a total of 39,725 residents in 8,799 households were living in the 81 villages located within the Civilian Control Zone.[54]\\r\\nMost of the tourist and media photos of the \\"DMZ fence\\" are actually photos of the CCL fence. The actual DMZ fence on the Southern Limit Line is completely off-limits to everybody except soldiers and it is illegal to take pictures of the DMZ fence. The CCL fence acts more as a deterrent for South Korean civilians from getting too close to the dangerous DMZ and is also the final barrier for North Korean infiltrators if they get past the Southern Limit Line DMZ fence.[55]\\r\\nThe whole estuary of the Han River is deemed a \\"Neutral Zone\\" and is off-limits to all civilian vessels and is treated like the rest of the DMZ. Only military vessels are allowed within this neutral zone.\\r\\nAccording to the July 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement civil shipping was supposed to be permissible in the Han River estuary and allow Seoul to be connected to the Yellow Sea (West Sea) via the Han River.[56] However, both Koreas and the UNC failed to make this happen. The South Korean government ordered the construction of the Ara Canal to finally connect Seoul to the Yellow Sea (West Sea), which was completed in 2012. Seoul was effectively landlocked from the ocean until 2012. The biggest limitation of the Ara Canal is it is too narrow to handle any vessels except small tourist boats and recreational boats, so Seoul still cannot receive large commercial ships or passenger ships in its port.\\r\\nIn recent years Chinese fishing vessels have taken advantage of the tense situation in the Han River Estuary Neutral Zone and illegally fished in this area due to both the North Korean and South Korean navies never patrolling this area due to the fear of naval battles breaking out. This has led to firefights and sinkings of boats between Chinese fishermen and the South Korean Coast Guard.[57][58]\\r\\nWithin the DMZ itself, in the town of Cheorwon, is the old capital of the kingdom of Taebong (901-918), a regional upstart that became Goryeo, the dynasty that ruled a united Korea from 918 to 1392.\\r\\nTaebong was founded by the charismatic leader Gung Ye, a brilliant if tyrannical one-eyed ex-Buddhist monk. Rebelling against the kingdom of Silla, Koreas then ruling dynasty, he proclaimed the kingdom of Taebongalso called Later Goguryeo, in reference to the ancient kingdom of Goguryeo (37BC-668AD)in 901, with himself as king. The kingdom consisted of much of central Korea, including areas around the DMZ. He placed his capital in Cheorwon, a mountainous region that was easily defensible (in the Korean War, this same region would earn the name the Iron Triangle).\\r\\nAs a former Buddhist monk, Gung Ye actively promoted the religion of Buddhism and incorporated Buddhist ceremonies into the new kingdom. Even after Gung Ye was dethroned by his own generals and replaced by Wang Geon, the man who would rule over a united Korea as the first king of Goryeo, this Buddhist influence would continue, playing a major role in shaping the culture of medieval Korea.\\r\\nAs the ruins of Gung Yes capital lie in the DMZ itself, visitors cannot see them. Moreover, excavation work and research have been hampered by political realities. In the future, inter-Korean peace may allow for proper archaeological studies to be conducted on the castle site and other historical sites within and underneath the DMZ.[59]\\r\\nThe ruins of the capital city of Taebong, the ruins of the castle of Gung Ye, and King Gung Ye's tomb all lie within the DMZ and are off-limits to everybody except soldiers who patrol the DMZ.[60]\\r\\nPanmunjeom is the site of the negotiations that ended the Korean War and is the main center of human activity in the DMZ. The village is located on the main highway and near a railroad connecting the two Koreas.\\r\\nThe railway, which connects Seoul and Pyongyang, was called the Gyeongui Line before division in the 1940s. Currently the South uses the original name, but the North refers to the route as the P'y?ngbu Line. The railway line has been mainly used to carry materials and South Korean workers to the Kaesong Industrial Region. Its reconnection has been seen as part of the general improvement in the relations between North and South in the early part of this century. However, in November 2008 North Korean authorities closed the railway amid growing tensions with the South.[61] Following the death of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, conciliatory talks were held between South Korean officials and a North Korean delegation who attended Kim's funeral. In September 2009, the Kaesong rail and road crossing was reopened.[62]\\r\\nThe road at Panmunjeom, which was known historically as Highway One in the South, was originally the only access point between the two countries on the Korean Peninsula. Passage is comparable to the strict movements that occurred at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin at the height of the Cold War. Both North and South Korea's roads end in the JSA; the highways do not quite join as there is a 20?cm (8?in) concrete line that divides the entire site. People given the rare permission to cross this border must do so on foot before continuing their journey by road.\\r\\nIn 2007, on the east coast of Korea, the first train crossed the DMZ on the new Donghae Bukbu (Tonghae Pukpu) Line. The new rail crossing was built adjacent to the road which took South Koreans to Mount Kumgang Tourist Region, a region that has significant cultural importance for all Koreans. More than one million civilian visitors crossed the DMZ until the route was closed following the shooting of a 53-year-old South Korean tourist in July 2008.[63] After a joint investigation was rebuffed by North Korea, the South Korean government suspended tours to the resort. Since then the resort and the Donghae Bukbu Line have effectively been closed by North Korea.[64][65]\\r\\nCurrently, the South Korean Korea Railroad Corporation (Korail) organizes tours to DMZ with special DMZ themed trains.[66]\\r\\nIn the past half century, the Korean DMZ has been a deadly place for humans, making habitation impossible. Only around the village of Panmunjeom and more recently the Donghae Bukbu Line on Korea's east coast have there been regular incursions by people.[67][68]\\r\\nThis natural isolation along the 250?km (160?mi) length of the DMZ has created an involuntary park which is now recognized as one of the most well-preserved areas of temperate habitat in the world.[69] In 1966 it was first proposed to turn the DMZ into a national park.[70]\\r\\nSeveral endangered animal and plant species now exist among the heavily fortified fences, landmines and listening posts. These include the endangered red-crowned crane (a staple of Asian art), the white-naped crane, and, potentially, the extremely rare Siberian tiger,[69] Amur leopard, and Asiatic black bear. Ecologists have identified some 2,900 plant species, 70 types of mammals and 320 kinds of birds within the narrow buffer zone.[69] Additional surveys are now being conducted throughout the region.[71]\\r\\nThe DMZ owes its varied biodiversity to its geography, which crosses mountains, prairies, swamps, lakes, and tidal marshes. Environmentalists hope that the DMZ will be conserved as a wildlife refuge, with a well-developed set of objective and management plans vetted and in place. In 2005, CNN founder and media mogul Ted Turner, on a visit to North Korea, said that he would financially support any plans to turn the DMZ into a peace park and a UN-protected World Heritage Site.[72]\\r\\nIn September 2011, South Korea submitted a nomination form to Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB) in UNESCO for designation of 435?km2 (168?sq?mi) in the southern part of the DMZ below the Military Demarcation Line, as well as 2,979?km2 (1,150?sq?mi) in privately controlled areas, as a Biosphere Reserve according to the Statutory Framework of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves.[73] MAB National Committee of the Republic of Korea mentioned only southern part of DMZ to be nominated since there was no response from Pyongyang when it requested Pyongyang to push jointly. North Korea is a member nation of the international coordinating council of UNESCOs Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme, which designates Biosphere Reserves.[74]\\r\\nNorth Korea opposed the application as a violation of the armistice agreement during the council's meeting in Paris on July 9 to 13. The South Korean government's attempt to designate the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve was turned down at UNESCO's MAB council meeting in Paris in July 2012. Pyongyang expressed its opposition by sending letters to 32 council member countries, except for South Korea, and the UNESCO headquarters a month prior to the meeting. At the council meeting, Pyongyang said the designation violated the Armistice Agreement.[75] It also said that DMZ is under jurisdiction of South Korea and UNC, therefore it is necessary to gain consent from UNC over the designation. Despite the effort put by Republic of Korea, on 12 July, the MAB International Coordinating Council (ICC) deferred South Korea's September 2011 application.[citation needed]\\r\\nCoordinates: 381944N 1271500E? / ?38.329N 127.250E? / 38.329; 127.250","input":"How big is the border between north and south korea?"},{"output":"Oymyakon","context":"Oymyakon (Russian: ?, pronounced?[?jm???kon]; Sakha: ????, ?ym?k??n, IPA:?[?jm??k??n]) is a rural locality (a selo) in Oymyakonsky District of the Sakha Republic, Russia, located along the Indigirka River, 30 kilometers (19?mi) northwest of Tomtor on the Kolyma Highway.

This was shown on the Australian programme 60 Minutes in a 2012 documentary.[7] On February 6, 1933, a temperature of ?67.7?C (?89.9?F) was recorded at Oymyakon's weather station.[8][9] This was the coldest officially recorded temperature in the Northern Hemisphere. Only Antarctica has recorded lower official temperatures (the lowest being ?89.2?C (?128.6?F), recorded at Vostok Station on 21 July 1983).[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather station is in a valley between Oymyakon and Tomtor. The station is at 750 meters (2,460?ft) and the surrounding mountains at 1,100 meters (3,600?ft), causing cold air to pool in the valley: in fact, recent studies show that winter temperatures in the area increase with altitude by as much as 10?C (18?F).[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome years the temperature drops below 0?C (32?F) in late September and may remain below freezing until mid-May.

Ford class (or Ford class, previously known as CVN-21 class), is a class of supercarrier being built to replace the USS?Enterprise (CVN-65) and eventually the United States Navy's existing Nimitz-class carriers, beginning with the delivery of CVN-78, USS?Gerald R. Ford. The new vessels have a hull similar to the Nimitz carriers, but introduce technologies since developed such as the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System, as well as other design features intended to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs, including sailing with smaller crews.[N 1][8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCarriers of the Ford class will have:[10]\\r\\nThe US Navy aims to use modern equipment and extensive automation to reduce the crew size and the total cost of future aircraft carriers.[16] The biggest visible difference from earlier supercarriers will be the more aft location of the island (superstructure).[17] Ships of the Ford class are intended to sustain 160 sorties per day for 30-plus days, with a surge capability of 270 sorties per day.[18][19] Director of Operational Testing Michael Gilmore has criticized the assumptions used in these forecasts as unrealistic and has indicated sortie rates similar to the 120/240 per day of the Nimitz class would be acceptable.[19][20]\\r\\nThe current Nimitz-class aircraft carriers in US naval service have been part of United States power projection strategy since Nimitz was commissioned in 1975. Displacing about 100,000 tons when fully loaded, a Nimitz-class carrier can steam faster than 30 knots, cruise without resupply for 90 days, and launch aircraft to strike targets hundreds of miles away.[21] The endurance of this class is exemplified by USS?Theodore Roosevelt, which spent 159?days underway in support of Operation Enduring Freedom without visiting a port or being refueled.[22]\\r\\nThe Nimitz design has accommodated many new technologies over the decades, but it has limited ability to support the most recent technical advances. As a 2005 Rand report said, \\"The biggest problems facing the Nimitz class are the limited electrical power generation capability and the upgrade-driven increase in ship weight and erosion of the center-of-gravity margin needed to maintain ship stability.\\"[23]\\r\\nWith these constraints in mind, the US Navy developed what was initially known as the CVN-21 program, which ultimately evolved into CVN-78, Gerald R. Ford. Improvements were made through developing technologies and more efficient design. Major design changes include a larger flight deck, improvements in weapons and material handling, a new propulsion plant design that requires fewer people to operate and maintain, and a new, smaller island that has been pushed aft. Technological advances in electromagnetics have led to the development of an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) and an Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG). An integrated warfare system, the Ship Self-Defense System (SSDS), has been developed to allow the ship to more easily take on new missions. The new Dual Band Radar (DBR) combines S-band and X-band radar.[24] Flight deck changes support the requirements for a higher sortie rate, around 160 a day with surges to 270.\\r\\nThese advances will allow the new Gerald R. Fordÿclass carriers to launch 25% more sorties, generate triple the electrical power with improved efficiency, and offer crew quality-of-life improvements.[7][8]\\r\\nChanges to the flight deck are the most visible differences between the Nimitz and Gerald R. Ford classes. Several sections have been altered to improve aircraft handling, storage, and flow, all in the service of increasing the sortie rate.\\r\\nCatapult No. 4 on the Nimitz class cannot launch fully loaded aircraft because of a deficiency of wing clearance along the edge of the flight deck.[25] CVN-78 will have no catapult-specific restrictions on launching aircraft, but still retains four catapults, two bow and two waist.[8] The number of aircraft lifts from hangar deck to flight deck level was reduced from four to three.\\r\\nAnother major change is that the smaller, redesigned island will be further aft than those of older carriers. This shift creates deck space for a centralized rearming and refueling location, and thereby reduces the number of times that an aircraft will have to be moved after landing before it can be relaunched. Fewer aircraft movements require, in turn, fewer deck hands to accomplish them, reducing the size of the ship's crew and increasing sortie rate.\\r\\nAs well, the movement of weapons from storage and assembly to the aircraft on the flight deck has been streamlined and accelerated. Ordnance will be moved to the centralized rearming location via relocated, higher-capacity weapons elevators that use linear motors.[26] The new path that ordnance follows does not cross any areas of aircraft movement, thereby reducing traffic problems in the hangars and on the flight deck. According to Rear Admiral Dennis M. Dwyer, these changes will make it hypothetically possible to rearm the airplanes in \\"minutes instead of hours\\".[27]\\r\\nThe new Bechtel A1B reactor for the Ford-class is smaller and simpler, requires fewer crew, and yet is far more powerful than the Nimitz-class A4W reactor. Two reactors will be installed on each Ford-class carrier, providing almost 700 MW which is 25% greater than 550 MW of the two A4W. As the Ford-class is primarily an electric boat; electrical capacity of the reactors was increased 2.5 times that of the Nimitz-class.[28][29]\\r\\nThe propulsion and power plant of the Nimitz-class carriers was designed in the 1960s, when onboard technologies did not require the same quantity of electrical power that modern technologies do. \\"New technologies added to the Nimitz-class ships have generated increased demands for electricity; the current base load leaves little margin to meet expanding demands for power.\\"[30]\\r\\nCompared to the Nimitz-class reactor, the Ford-class reactor has about half as many valves, piping, major pumps, condensers, and generators. The steam-generating system uses fewer than 200 valves and only eight pipe sizes. These improvements lead to simpler construction, reduced maintenance, and lower manpower requirements as well as to a more compact system that requires less space in the ship. The modernization of the plant led to a higher core energy density, lower demands for pumping power, a simpler construction, and the use of modern electronic controls and displays. The new plant requires just one-third the watchstanding requirements and a decrease of required maintenance.[30]\\r\\nA larger power output is a major component to the integrated warfare system. Engineers took extra steps to ensure that integrating unforeseen technological advances onto a Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier would be possible. The Navy expects the Gerald R. Ford class will be part of the fleet for 90 years, until the year 2105, which means that the class must successfully accept new technology over the decades.\\r\\nThe Nimitz-class aircraft carriers used steam-powered catapults to launch aircraft. The Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) installed on the Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier is more efficient, smaller, lighter, more powerful, and easier to control. Increased control means that EMALS will be able to launch heavier and lighter aircraft than the steam catapult. Also, the use of a controlled force will reduce the stress on airframes, resulting in less maintenance and a longer lifetime for the aircraft. (EMALS will not be retrofitted onto the Nimitz class, which cannot generate enough electricity to power it.)\\r\\nElectromagnets are also being used in the new Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) system. The current system relies on hydraulics to slow and stop a landing aircraft. While the hydraulic system is effective, as demonstrated by more than fifty years of implementation, the AAG system offers a number of improvements. The current steam system is unable to capture UAVs without damaging them due to extreme stresses on the airframe. UAVs do not have the necessary mass to drive the large hydraulic piston used to trap heavier, manned airplanes. By using electromagnetics the energy absorption is controlled by a turbo-electric engine. This makes the trap smoother and reduces shock on airframes. Even though the system will look the same from the flight deck as its predecessor, it will be more flexible, safe, and reliable, and will require less maintenance and manning.[31]\\r\\nAnother addition to the Gerald R. Ford class is an integrated Active electronically scanned array search and tracking radar system. The dual-band radar (DBR) was being developed for both the Zumwalt-class guided missile destroyers and the Ford-class aircraft carriers by Raytheon. The island can be kept smaller by replacing six to ten radar antennas with a single six-faced radar. The DBR works by combining the X band AN/SPY-3 multifunction radar with the S band Volume Search Radar (VSR) emitters, distributed into three phased arrays.[32] The S-band radar was later deleted from the Zumwalt class destroyers as a cost saving measure.[14]\\r\\nThe three faces dedicated to the X-band radar are responsible for low altitude tracking and radar illumination, while the other three faces dedicated to the S-band are responsible for target search and tracking regardless of weather. \\"Operating simultaneously over two electromagnetic frequency ranges, the DBR marks the first time this functionality has been achieved using two frequencies coordinated by a single resource manager.\\"[24]\\r\\nThis new system has no moving parts, therefore minimizing maintenance and manning requirements for operation. The AN/SPY-3 consists of three active arrays and the Receiver/Exciter (REX) cabinets abovedecks and the Signal and Data Processor (SDP) subsystem below-decks. The VSR has a similar architecture, with the beamforming and narrowband down-conversion functionality occurring in two additional cabinets per array. A central controller (the resource manager) resides in the Data Processor (DP). The DBR is the first radar system that uses a central controller and two active-array radars operating at different frequencies. The DBR gets its power from the Common Array Power System (CAPS), which comprises Power Conversion Units (PCUs) and Power Distribution Units (PDUs). The DBR is cooled via a closed-loop cooling system called the Common Array Cooling System (CACS).[33]\\r\\nThe REX consists of a digital and an analog portion. The digital portion of the REX provides system-level timing and control. The analog portion contains the exciter and the receiver. The exciter is a low-amplitude and phase noise system that uses direct frequency synthesis. The radars noise characteristics support the high clutter cancellation requirements required in the broad range of maritime operating environments that DBR will likely encounter. The direct frequency synthesis allows a wide range of pulse repetition frequencies, pulse widths, and modulation schemes to be created.\\r\\nThe receiver has high dynamic range to support high clutter levels caused by close returns from range-ambiguous Doppler effect waveforms. The receiver has both narrow band and wideband channels, as well as multichannel capabilities to support monopulse radar processing and side lobe blanking. The receiver generates digital data and sends the data to the signal processors.\\r\\nThe DBR uses IBM commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) supercomputers to provide control and signal processing. DBR is the first radar system to use COTS systems to perform the signal processing. Using COTS systems reduces development costs and increases system reliability and maintainability. The high-performance COTS servers perform signal analysis using radar and digital signal processing techniques, including channel equalization, clutter filtering, Doppler processing, impulse editing, and implementation of a variety of advanced electronic protect algorithms. The IBM supercomputers are installed in cabinets that provide shock and vibration isolation. The DP contains the resource manager, the tracker, and the command and control processor, which processes commands from the combat system.\\r\\nThe DBR utilizes a multi-tier, dual-band tracker, which consists of a local X band tracker, a local S band tracker, and a central tracker. The central tracker merges the local tracker data together and directs the individual-band-trackers updates. The X band tracker is optimized for low latency to support its mission of providing defense against fast, low-flying missiles, while the VSR tracker is optimized for throughput due to the large-volume search area coverage requirements.\\r\\nThe combat system develops doctrine-based response recommendations based on the current tactical situation and sends the recommendations to the DBR. The combat system also has control of which modes the radar will perform. Unlike previous-generation radars, the DBR does not require an operator and has no manned display consoles. The system uses information about the current environment and doctrine from the combat system to make automated decisions, not only reducing reaction times, but also reducing the risks associated with human error. The only human interaction is for maintenance and repair activities.\\r\\nThe Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) is a new design surveillance radar that is to be installed in the second Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier, USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79), in lieu of the Dual Band radar. The America-class?amphibious assault ships starting with LHA-8 and the planned LX(R) will also have this radar.[34] The EASR suites initial per-unit cost will be about $180 million less than the DBR, for which the estimate is about $500 million.[35]\\r\\nThe carrier will be armed with the Raytheon Evolved Sea Sparrow missile (ESSM), which defends against high-speed, highly maneuverable anti-ship missiles. The close-in weapon system, and the rolling airframe missile (RAM) from Raytheon and Ramsys GmbH are also on board.\\r\\nEach new technology and design feature integrated into the Ford-class aircraft carrier improves sortie generation, manning requirements, and operational capabilities. New defense systems, such as free-electron laser directed-energy weapons, dynamic armor, and tracking systems will require more power. \\"Only half of the electrical power-generation capability on CVN-78 is needed to run currently planned systems, including EMALS. CVN-78 will thus have the power reserves that the Nimitz class lacks to run lasers and dynamic armor.\\"[36] The addition of new technologies, power systems, design layout, and better control systems results in an increased sortie rate of 25% over the Nimitz-class and a 25% reduction in manpower required to operate.[37]\\r\\nBreakthrough waste management technology will be deployed on Gerald R Ford. Co-developed with the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, PyroGenesis Canada Inc., was in 2008 awarded the contract to outfit the ship with a Plasma Arc Waste Destruction System (PAWDS). This compact system will treat all combustible solid waste generated on board the ship. After having completed factory acceptance testing in Montreal, the system was scheduled to be shipped to the Huntington Ingalls shipyard in late 2011 for installation on the carrier.[38]\\r\\nThe Navy is actively developing a weapon system called the free-electron laser (FEL) to address the cruise missile threat and the swarm-boat threat against Ford-class carriers.[39][40][41][42][43] An FEL uses an electron gun to generate a stream of electrons. The electrons are then sent into a linear particle accelerator to boost them to near light speeds. The accelerated electrons are then sent into a device, known informally as a wiggler, that exposes the electrons to a transverse magnetic field, which causes the electrons to wiggle from side to side and release some of their energy in the form of light (photons). The photons are then bounced between mirrors and emitted as a coherent beam of laser light. To increase the efficiency of the system some electrons are then recycled to the front of the particle accelerator via an energy recovery loop. The cost to fire one shot from an FEL is about $1 and draws about 10 MW of electrical power.[citation needed]\\r\\nNewport News Shipbuilding used a full-scale three-dimensional product model developed in Dassault Systmes CATIA V5 release 8 (which includes special features useful to shipbuilders[44]) to design and plan the construction of the Ford class of aircraft carriers. This enables engineers and designers to test visual integration in design, engineering, planning and construction of components and subsystems. CVN-78 is the first aircraft carrier to be designed in a full-scale 3D product model. This modeling enabled the rooms within the ship to be modular, so that future upgrades can be implemented by designers simply by swapping a box in and locking it down.\\r\\nThis method of designing workflow also resulted in improvements to weapon handling procedures and an increase in potential sorties-per-day. Weapons-handling paths on Nimitz-class ships were designed for the potential nuclear missions of the Cold War. The current flow of weapons from storage areas in the interior of the Nimitz-class ship to loading on aircraft involves several horizontal and vertical movements to various staging and build-up locations within the ship. These movements around the ship are time-consuming and manpower-intensive and typically involve sailors manually moving weapons loaded on carts. Also, the current locations of some of the Nimitz-class weapons elevators conflict with the flow of aircraft on the flight deck, slowing down the generation of sorties or making some elevators unusable during flight operations.\\r\\nThe CVN 21 class was designed to have better weapons movement paths, largely eliminating horizontal movements within the ship. Current plans call for advanced weapons elevators to move from storage areas to dedicated weapons-handling areas. Sailors would use motorized carts to move the weapons from storage to the elevators at different levels of the weapons magazines. Linear motors are being considered for the advanced weapons elevators. The elevators will also be relocated such that they will not impede aircraft operations on the flight deck. The redesign of the weapons movement paths and the location of the weapons elevators on the flight deck will reduce manpower and contribute to a much higher sortie generation rate.[45]\\r\\nThe Ford class is designed to accommodate the new Joint Strike Fighter carrier variant aircraft (F-35C), but aircraft development and testing delays have affected integration activities on CVN-78. These integration activities include testing the F-35C with CVN-78s EMALS and advanced arresting gear system and testing the ships storage capabilities for the F-35Cs lithium-ion batteries (which provide start-up and back-up power), tires, and wheels. As a result of F-35C developmental delays, the US Navy will not field the aircraft until at least 2018one year after CVN-78 delivery. As a result, the Navy has deferred critical F-35C integration activities, which introduces risk of system incompatibilities and costly retrofits to the ship after it is delivered to the Navy.[46]\\r\\nSystems that reduce crew workload have allowed the ships company on Ford-class carriers to total only 2,600 sailors, about 600 fewer than a Nimitz-class carrier. The massive, 180-man berthing areas on the Nimitz class are replaced by 40-rack berthing areas on Ford-class carriers. The smaller berthings are quieter and the layout requires less foot traffic through other spaces.[47] The racks are typically stacked three high, with one locker per person and extra lockers for those without storage space under their rack. The berthings do not feature modern sit-up racks with more headroom (each rack can only accommodate a sailor lying down). Each berthing has an associated head, including showers, vacuum-powered septic-system toilets (no urinals since the berthings are built gender-neutral)[48] and sinks to reduce travel and traffic to access those facilities. Wifi-enabled lounges are located across the passageway in separate spaces from the berthings racks.[47]\\r\\nConstruction began on 11 August 2005, when Northrop Grumman held a ceremonial steel cut for a 15-ton plate that will form part of a side shell unit of the carrier.[49] Construction began on components of CVN-78 in early 2007[50] and is nearing completion. It is under the final steps of construction at Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding) in Newport News, Virginia. This is the only shipyard in the United States capable of building nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.\\r\\nIn 2005, it was estimated to cost at least $8?billion excluding the $5?billion spent on research and development (though that was not expected to be representative of the cost of future members of the class).[16] A 2009 report said that Ford would cost $14?billion including research and development, and the actual cost of the carrier itself would be $9?billion.[51] The life-cycle cost per operating day of a carrier strike group (including aircraft) was estimated at $6.5 million in 2013 published by the Center for New American Security.[52]\\r\\nOriginally, a total of three carriers have been authorized for construction, but if the Nimitz-class carriers and Enterprise were to be replaced on a one-for-one basis, eleven carriers would be required over the life of the program. However, the last Nimitz-class aircraft carrier is not scheduled to be decommissioned until 2058.\\r\\nIn a speech on 6 April 2009, then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that the program would shift to a five-year building program so as to place it on a \\"more fiscally sustainable path\\". Such a measure would result in ten carriers after 2040.[53]\\r\\nAs construction of CVN-78 progresses, the shipbuilder is discovering first-of-class type design changes, which it will use to update the model before the follow-on ship construction. To date, several of these design changes have related to EMALS configuration changes, which have required electrical, wiring, and other changes within the ship. Although the Navy reports that these EMALS-related changes are nearing completion, it anticipates additional design changes stemming from remaining advanced arresting gear development and testing. In total, over 1,200 anticipated design changes remain to be completed (out of nearly 19,000 planned changes). According to the Navy, many of these 19,000 changes were programmed into the construction schedule early ona result of the governments decision at contract award to introduce improvements during construction to the ships warfare systems, which are heavily dependent on evolving commercial technologies.[46]\\r\\nThere was a movement by the USS?America Carrier Veterans' Association to have CVN-78 named after America rather than after President Ford.[54] Eventually, the amphibious assault ship LHA-6 was named America.\\r\\nOn 27 May 2011, the U.S. Department of Defense announced the name of CVN-79 would be USS?John F.

It serves as headquarters for the United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA) and also for NATO Allied Air Command (AIRCOM). Ramstein is located near the town of Ramstein-Miesenbach, in the rural district of Kaiserslautern.\\r\\nThe east gate of Ramstein Air Base is about 16 kilometres (9.9?mi) from Kaiserslautern (locally referred to by Americans as \\"K-Town\\"). Other nearby civilian communities include Ramstein-Miesenbach, just outside the base's west gate, and Landstuhl, about 3 miles (4.8?km) from the west gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe host unit is the 86th Airlift Wing (86?AW), commanded by Brigadier General Patrick X. Mordente. The 86th Airlift Wing is composed of six groups, 27?squadrons and three bases in Germany, Spain, and Belgium. Its mission is the operation and maintenance of airlift assets consisting of C-130Js, C-20s, C-21s, C-40B and C-37A Gulfstream aircraft throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East.\\r\\nAlso at Ramstein is the 435th Air Ground Operations Wing (formerly the 435th Air Base Wing) (435?AGOW), which focuses on base-support responsibilities within the KMC. It is composed of five groups and 20?squadrons. The wing provides rapid mobility and agile combat support for military operations, and maintains expeditionary forces and infrastructure.\\r\\nThe commander of the 435th AGOW is Colonel Andra V.P. Kniep.[2]\\r\\nThe new 521st Air Mobility Operations Wing stood up on 4 September 2008.[3] The current commander of the 521st AMOW is Colonel Thomas Cooper.[4]\\r\\nRamstein's wings are assigned to the headquarters 3rd Air Force also based at Ramstein?AB, which controls most of the USAF Wings throughout Europe.\\r\\nRamstein AB is part of the Kaiserslautern Military Community?(KMC), where more than 54,000?American service members and more than 5,400 US civilian employees live and work. U.S.?organizations in the KMC also employ the services of more than 6,200?German workers. Air Force units in the KMC alone employ almost 9,800 military members, bringing with them nearly 11,100?family members. There are more than 16,200 military, U.S.?civilian and U.S.?contractors assigned to Ramstein?AB alone.\\r\\nIn 1984, an enlisted airman (Sgt Darrel Dietlein) assigned to the 1964th Communications Group, solicited National Headquarters Civil Air Patrol http://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/ to charter the first \\"Cadet Squadron\\" in Germany, naming the unit \\"Ramstein Cadet Squadron\\" and becoming the unit's first commander as a CAP 1Lt. The Ramstein Cadet Squadron was formed with Captain Mark Bailey serving as the unit's first liaison officer, as well as other like minded military volunteers and roughly six cadets. To this day, the squadron enjoys vibrant member participation, as well as base support, hosting drill competitions and encampments along with their traditional military studies and aerospace education efforts. The Ramstein Cadet Squadron commander as of 6/2016 was Maj. Michael Livesay.\\r\\nIn the subsequent years, a companion cadet squadron was formed at Spangdahlem Air Base and cadet flight at Wiesbaden.\\r\\nFrom 2004 to 2006, Ramstein Air Base underwent an extensive expansion with a major construction project ÿ including an all-new airport terminal, among other new facilities, through the so-called Rhein-Main Transition Program which was initiated in support of the total closure of Rhein-Main Air Base on 30 December 2005 and transferring all its former capacities to Ramstein Air Base (70%) and Spangdahlem Air Base (30%).\\r\\nWhile the KMC remains the largest U.S.?community overseas at 53,000?people, the defense drawdown continues to shape its future. Due to the departure of other main operating installations, more than 100 geographically separated units receive support from Ramstein.\\r\\nRamstein Air Base also served as temporary housing for the United States men's national soccer team during the 2006?World Cup.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere is often a Summer Camp to Ramstein from British CCF (RAF) and ATC cadets, as well as Civil Air Patrol encampments and tours like the ones held in July 2015 http://www.ramstein.af.mil/News/Features/Display/Article/727012/cap-turns-teens-into-cadets-through-summer-training-camp/ and June 2016 http://www.ramstein.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/811330/civil-air-patrol-cadets-tour-ramstein/ .\\r\\nThe construction of the air base was a project designed and undertaken by the French Army and the U.S.?Army Corps of Engineers from 1949 to 1952. It was an example of international collaboration: designed by French engineers, constructed by some Germans but with imported help from workers of Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece, and Turkey (there were very few German men to work on construction projects after World War?II) and operated by Americans.\\r\\nThe area was a swamp that had to be built up by two meters (six feet). A train line was laid out from Einsiedlerhof-Kaiserslautern in a yoke shape around to the current base and back down to the Landstuhl spur in 1948 by agreement of the U.S. and French Occupational Forces. Trainloads of earth were moved over the line and spread over the base's current area to raise it to its current level. Once the ground was level, building construction began. Two bases were laid out. Landstuhl Air Base on the south side and Ramstein Air Station (station, no airstrip) on the north. From 1948 to the opening of the bases in 1953 it was the largest one spot construction site in Europe employing over 270,000 Europeans at one time.[citation needed]\\r\\nSource: Fletcher, Air Force Bases Volume II[5]\\r\\nSource: Fletcher, Air Force Bases Volume II[5]\\r\\nIn 1940, construction of today's Bundesautobahn?6 was stopped when a bridge that was being built across the Rhine River near Mannheim collapsed, leaving a section of autobahn that could not be used. A part of the unused autobahn to the west of Mannheim, near Kaiserslautern, was used as an airstrip by the Luftwaffe. The airstrip was also used by the advancing U.S.?Army Air Forces during the final months of World War?II. The old autobahn section is still used as the access road to the east and west gates of the base and the A?6 was rebuilt south of the air base after the war.\\r\\nDuring the initial postwar era, the USAAF repaired several former Luftwaffe airfields in Bavaria which was part of the American occupation zone of Germany. With the advent of the Berlin Blockade and the chilling of relations with the Soviet Union by 1948 it became obvious to United States Air Force planners that these bases were tactically untenable because of their proximity to the East German and Czechoslovakian borders.\\r\\nWith the creation of NATO in response to Cold War tensions in Europe in 1949, USAFE wanted its vulnerable fighter units in what was then West Germany moved west of the Rhine River to provide greater air defense warning time. France agreed to provide air base sites within their zone of occupation in the Rhineland-Palatinate as part of the NATO expansion program.\\r\\nConstruction of the modern USAF base near Kaiserslautern began in April?1948 under the provisions of a Franco-American reciprocal agreement. Two separate, but adjoining bases were designed. A headquarters base for Twelfth Air Force, along with several NATO organizations, designated as Ramstein Air Station; and an operational fighter base, designated as Landstuhl Air Base. What is today known as Kisling Memorial Drive would separate the two facilities.\\r\\nEnough construction was completed in mid-1952, that Landstuhl?AB was opened on 5 August. Its facilities included a runway, dispersal hardstands, a control tower, ramps, and other flight-related facilities and the associated flying and support units. On 1 February 1952, Det?1, 86th Fighter-Bomber Wing arrived at Landstuhl?AB from Neubiberg Air Base near Munich.\\r\\nOn 1 June 1953 Ramstein Air Station was opened. Ramstein was the location of headquarters, Twelfth Air Force, and supported family housing, base exchange, commissary, dependents' schools and other administrative offices for the WAFs (Women's Air Force). The barracks that were built at Ramstein AS were used to house WAFs and single women that worked as U.S.?Government Employees at both Ramstein?AS and Landstuhl?AB. On 27 April 1953, Headquarters, Twelfth Air Force was activated on Ramstein Air Base, having moved from its joint facilities with HQ USAFE at Wiesbaden AB. What was not generally known at the time, and not made public until after the end of the Cold War in 1993, was the desire to have HQ?Twelfth Air Force in close proximity to the Air Defense Operations Center (ADOC) ÿ Kindsbach, AKA 'Kindsbach Cave' ÿ the site of NATO's underground combat operations center.\\r\\nThe 86th Air Base Group was activated as the main base support unit for Landstuhl, while the 7030th HQ Support Group was the main base support unit for Ramstein. On 1 December 1957, the two bases were consolidated into the largest NATO-controlled air base in service on the continent. It was called \\"RamsteinÿLandstuhl Air Base\\", but later, after the German government continued construction of the A6?autobahn from Kaiserslautern to Saarbrcken the autobahn cut off access at the south of the base which is where the main gate was in the city limit of Landstuhl. The main gate was moved to the west side of the base which was in the town of Ramstein. The two bases were joined and the current Kisling Memorial Drive cut off to the public which made one base. In 1961 the base was officially named \\"Ramstein Air Base\\".\\r\\nOne legacy of the two separate air bases is that the north side of Ramstein retained a separate APO from the south side. The north side (Ramstein AB) is APO?AE?09012, while the south side (Landstuhl?AB) is APO?AE?09009. Also separate Combat Support Groups, the 7030th for the north side, and the 86th for the south side existed. These were consolidated in the 1980s, and the two Combat Support units were merged into the 377th Combat Support Wing. There is still a north and south side Fitness Centers. The current northside Community Center before housed the WAF NCO Club. As well, there were two Movie Theaters on the North side and two on the South side. Currently, only two (still stand on the north side, a remodeled Nightengale Theater (know before as the Four Corners Theater)) on the corner across from the Base Gase Station and the north side AAFES dry cleaners was known as the Ramstein Rocket Theater. On the South side the current Hercules Theater (Falcon Theater) next to HQ 86th Air Wing and a non-existent theater for which new barracks are currently under construction at the corner across the street from Moms/Gear-up shops called the Landstuhler Knights Theater.\\r\\nNear the Ramstein Air Base is the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC), operated by the United States Army. Although part of the Kaiserslautern Military Community, LRMC has a separate history and was never a part of Ramstein or Landstuhl Air Bases, although both facilities have utilized the medical facilities at LRMC since they were established in 1953. Currently there are plans on the drawing board from the U.S.?Department of Defense to build a new USAF/Army combined Medical Center on the current U.S.?Army Weilerbach Storage Installation just to the east of Ramstein?AB. Construction is to begin in early 2012 and to be completed in and around 2016. A twelve story facility to house all departments of LRMC and the current Ramstein AB Clinic along with Dental Clinic facilities for the whole KMC. In turn, the East Gate to Ramstein?AB will be extended from its current location to just off the Autobahn 6 Einsiedlerhof exit to the base at what is known as the Elvis Gate. The area on Weilerbach Installation will be handed over to the USAF Ramstein?AB administration.\\r\\nFrom its inception, Ramstein was designed as a NATO command base. In 1957, Ramstein provided support for NATO's HQ Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force, which moved to Ramstein from Trier Air Base on 10 November 1957 upon the closure of that facility. Also on that date, HQ Twelfth Air Force was transferred to Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas and was assigned to Tactical Air Command. It was replaced by HQ Seventeenth Air Force (USAFE) which was moved from North Africa. In turn, the 17th AF was replaced by its mother unit HQ USAFE from Lindsey Air Station, Wiesbaden, Germany in 1973. The HQ 17th AF was moved to Sembach AB at that time and controlled all USAF Air Divisions and Wings north of the Alps, with the exception of the British Isles and Scandinavia, which were controlled by HQ 3rd AF at Mildenhall.\\r\\nOn 31 January 1973, several headquarters were relocated into and out of Ramstein, when Seventeenth?AF moved to Sembach Air Base to make room for the expected move of HQ?USAFE to Ramstein. This entire operation, code-named \\"Creek Action\\", was carried out as part of the USAF's new worldwide policy of locating the most vital headquarters in thinly populated rural areas rather than near cities. Later, HQ USAFE was moved due to the fact that US Intelligence found that the Soviets had plans to invade Western Europe through the Fulda Gap in Germany. The military thought to move vital HQs on the other side of the Rhein River for protection.\\r\\nAs a result of this policy change, Ramstein air base became a large multi-national NATO center: in addition to the USAFE's headquarters, it also housed the new NATO headquarters of the Allied Air Forces Central Europe (AAFCE).\\r\\nThe AAFCE also commanded the 2nd Allied Tactical Air Force (2ATAF) and the 4th ATAF. The 4th ATAF, which had been headquartered at Ramstein for many years, included the 1st Canadian Air Group, 1st and 2nd Divisions of the West German Air Force, and units of the USAFE's 3rd and 17th Air Force.\\r\\nHQ USAFE fully completed its move from Wiesbaden to Ramstein early 1991.\\r\\nWith USAFE's arrival in 1973, Ramstein entered a period of expansion. The duel commander of the 316th AD / 86 TFW became host commander of Americans living in the Kaiserslautern Military Community instead of the US Army 21st Commanding General. The Wiesbaden USAF Community was then traded to the US Army Control as for an even Kaiserlautern switch. It is interesting to note that the KMC through the 1950s ÿ to the early 1990s had an average population of Americans of 110,000 outnumbering those Germans in the City of Kaiserslautern for that time.\\r\\nAllied Air Forces Central Europe was established at Ramstein on 28 June 1974. Ramstein subsequently provided support for other headquarters, including the 322nd Airlift Division which arrived on 23 June 1978, and SAC's 7th Air Division, which arrived on 1 July 1978.\\r\\nIn December 1980, HQ Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force was moved from Ramstein to Heidelberg and co-located with HQ Central Army Group.\\r\\nToday, the base is home to the Allied Air Command, which is responsible to Joint Force Command Brunssum which is the only and main NATO command unit on Ramstein AB.\\r\\nClose to Ramstein was the site of Air Defense Operations Center (ADOC) ÿ Kindsbach, AKA 'Kindsbach Cave' ÿ the site of Europe's underground combat operations center.\\r\\nThe facility was located in a former German western front command headquarters. The French took control of the underground bunker after World War II, and USAFE assumed control in 1953. After major renovations, USAFE opened the center on 15 August 1954.\\r\\nThe center was a state-of-the-art, 67-room, 37,000-square-foot (3,400?m2) facility where USAFE could have led an air war against the Soviet Union. The center had a digital computer to work out bombing problems, cryptographic equipment for coded message traffic and its own photo lab to develop reconnaissance photos. Responsible for an air space extending deep behind the Iron Curtain, the center interacted directly with The Pentagon, NATO, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe and all USAFE bases. With its massive telephone switchboard and 80 teletype machines, the cave was plugged into everything in the outside world. The center was receiving more than 1,000 calls a day.\\r\\nAs a further measure of protection, the cave was fully self-contained with its own water supply, electric backup-generators, climate controls, dining facilities and sleeping accommodations for its 125-man crew. Visitor passes were rarely issued to this secret facility.\\r\\nThroughout the years, leadership changed but USAFE led the operations through numbered Air Forces. The center's commander was the USAFE Advanced Echelon. The glassed-in office was on the top floor of the three-story underground command center. Directly under the office was the management for offensive air operations. And the bottom floor office was the management for defensive air operations ÿ to include support for U.S.?Army forces and German Civil Defense. All three offices had a full view of the massive Air Operations Center map on the opposing wall.\\r\\nThe AOC was the largest room in the complex. Its three-story map was used to plot minute-by-minute movements of friendly and unidentified aircraft. But the center was much more than just a tracking station, because it could also react to threats. They always knew the current operational status of air weapons in theater including missiles, and could dispatch armed response \\"at a moment's notice\\".\\r\\nBy the early 1960s, the manual plotting system used to track aircraft at the cave and elsewhere throughout Germany was too slow and inaccurate for the quick responses necessary. Beginning in 1962, airmen trained in the new 412L air weapons control system began to arrive in Germany and at the cave. Over the next year, the new GE?semi-automatic system was installed. When complete at the cave, the current air picture over East and West Germany, as well as parts of the eastern soviet bloc countries, was displayed on a 40-foot by 40-foot (12 x 12 m)screen with radar information provided by various 412L?sites located throughout Germany. Senior U.S.?staff monitored the dynamic display 24/7. Over the next several years, additional 412L?sites throughout Germany joined the network until the manual system had been totally replaced.\\r\\nBy 1984, the Kindsbach Cave had become too small and its cost for renovation too high. The USAFE vacated the facility and on 31 October 1993, control was returned to the German government and the German government returned the facility to the original owner of the land. Today the Kindsbach Cave is private property, through tours of the cave can be arranged. The cave is overgrown by vegetation, trees, and new housing.\\r\\nIn April 2015 the Ramstein Air Base was reported by German and international media as an important control center in the drone war staged under the Obama administration against targets in areas like Pakistan, Yemen, Afghanistan and Somalia.[6][7][8] The German government claimed not to have been informed about this function of the U.S. base.\\r\\nIn a TV and online documentary the German Das Erste channel cited 2014 reports from Norddeutscher Rundfunk, WDR und the Sddeutsche Zeitung that revealed Ramstein to be an important hub in the drone war against terror suspects. New data provided by Edward Snowden affiliate Glenn Greenwald supported these reports with classified documents from inside the U.S. administration, and were also presented in the Citizenfour video documentary.[9][10]\\r\\nReassigned from Neubiberg Air Base, West Germany in 1952 and except for a period between 1968 and 1973, the 86th Wing, under various designations, has been the main operational and host unit at Ramstein Air Base.\\r\\nThroughout the 1950s the 86th was primarily a Fighter-Bomber Wing. In 1960, it was realigned to an air defense mission and became the 86th Air Division (Defense). The 86th AD was inactivated in 1968. Returning as an F-4 Phantom II Tactical Fighter Wing in 1973, the 86th TFW performed that mission until 1994, deploying components to the middle east during the 1990 Gulf War.\\r\\nOn 14 August 1976, the Strategic Air Command 306th Strategic Wing was activated at Ramstein with a KC-135 air refueling and an RC-135 reconnaissance mission. The 306th also functioned as the focal point for all SAC operations in Europe, and as liaison between SAC and USAFE. The wing moved to RAF Mildenhall, England on 1 July 1978.\\r\\nIn June 1985, the 316th Air Division was activated, centralizing command authority at Ramstein. The 86 TFW became the division's flight operations arm, while the newly formed 377th Combat Support Wing, also activated in 1985, became responsible for the logistical and administrative support on base, replacing the 86th and 7030 Combat Support Wings. On 28 August 1988, Ramstein Air Base was the site of the tragic Ramstein airshow disaster, which killed 72 spectators and three pilots, and injured hundreds.\\r\\nAfter the Cold War, the 86th was realigned to become the 86th Airlift Wing. On 1 July 1993 the 55th Aeromedical Airlift Squadron moved from the 435th?AW at Rhein-Main Air Base Germany to Ramstein. On 1 October, the 75th and 76th Airlift Squadron arrived at Ramstein from the 60th AW at Travis Air Force Base California, and 437th?AW at Charleston AFB South Carolina, respectively. A year later on 1 October 1994, the 37th?Airlift Squadron was transferred to Ramstein from Rhein-Main.\\r\\nIn 1999, the activation of the 86th Contingency Response Group brought the airfield and aerial port operations and providing force protection at contingency airfields mission to the wing.\\r\\nOn 24 May 2004, the 38th Combat Support Wing was activated to enhance support to USAFE geographically separated units. This wing was inactivated in 2007. The 521st Air Mobility Operations Wing was activated on 4 September 2008. The wing is the headquarters for the existing 721st Air Mobility Operations Group at Ramstein and the 521st AMOG at Naval Station Rota, Spain. The 521st AMOW provides an enhanced level of control for the AMC route structure in Europe, which includes critical locations for getting people, cargo and patients to and from current war zones.[3]\\r\\nOn 7 March 1966, French President Charles de Gaulle announced that France would withdraw from NATO's integrated military structure. The United States was informed that it must remove its military forces from France by 1 April 1967.\\r\\nAs a result, the 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, based at Toul-Rosieres Air Base, France and two of its squadrons, the 38th and 32d, equipped with the RF-4C Phantom II was relocated to Ramstein on 5 October 1966.\\r\\nAssigned squadrons of the 26th TRW at Ramstein were:\\r\\nWhile at Ramstein the 26th TRW acquired a number of other units with different flying missions. One function gained by the 26 TRW, almost immediately after arriving at Ramstein, was the maintenance and flying of the HQ USAFE liaison aircraft. In addition, the Wing was responsible for flying members of the HQ USAFE staff to Air Force and NATO bases throughout Europe. In addition, the 26th TRW was only designated a flight, because of its small size. It consisted of a mixture of aircraft, including: T-29s, T-33s, T-39s, C-54s, O-2s, H-19s, and UH-1s.\\r\\nIn 1971 a detachment of the \\"435th Air Base Wing\\" from Rhein-Main Air Base was assigned to Ramstein and a large cargo aerial port constructed. This allowed Military Airlift Command C-141 and C-5 Galaxy aircraft to use Ramstein as a transshipment point for material, which was then moved within USAFE by C-130 tactical transports.\\r\\nIn the spring of 1972, the 7th Special Operations Squadron?(SOS) was assigned flying C-130Es, C-47As, and UH-1Ns. Because of the special operations mission of the 7 SOS, it reported directly to HQ USAFE for operational control.\\r\\nAs part of operation \\"Creek Action\\", a command-wide effort to realign functions and streamline operations, HQ USAFE transferred the 26th TRW from Ramstein to Zweibrcken Air Base, and the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing was reassigned from Zweibrcken to Ramstein on 31 January 1973.\\r\\nThere are four schools at Ramstein Air Base: Ramstein Elementary School (Koalas), Ramstein Intermediate School (Jaguars), Ramstein American Middle School (Rams), and Ramstein High School (Royals). All of these schools are run by DoDDS, a component of DoDEA.\\r\\nThe U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) headquarters became the target of a terrorist attack on August 31, 1981, at 7:21?a.m. carried out by a Red Army Faction commando called 'Sigurd Debus'. A total of 20 victims were injured, some of them seriously.[14]\\r\\nThe Ramstein air show disaster is a mid-air collision that occurred at the Ramstein Air Force Base, during the Flugtag '88 air show on Sunday, August 28, 1988, killing 70 people.\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from the Air Force Historical Research Agency website http://www.afhra.af.mil/.","input":"Where is ramstein air force base located in germany?"},{"output":"2630 BCÿ2611 BC","context":"\\r\\nThe Egyptian pyramids are ancient pyramid-shaped masonry structures located in Egypt.\\r\\nAs of November 2008, sources cite either 118 or 138 as the number of identified Egyptian pyramids.[1][2] Most were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.[3][4][5]\\r\\nThe earliest known Egyptian pyramids are found at Saqqara, northwest of Memphis. The earliest among these is the Pyramid of Djoser (constructed 2630 BCÿ2611 BC) which was built during the third dynasty. This pyramid and its surrounding complex were designed by the architect Imhotep, and are generally considered to be the world's oldest monumental structures constructed of dressed masonry.[6]\\r\\nThe most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built.[7] The Pyramid of Khufu at Giza is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time of the Early Dynastic Period, those with sufficient means were buried in bench-like structures known as mastabas.[8][9]\\r\\nThe second historically-documented Egyptian pyramid is attributed to the architect Imhotep, who planned what Egyptologists believe to be a tomb for the pharaoh Djoser. Imhotep is credited with being the first to conceive the notion of stacking mastabas on top of each other, creating an edifice composed of a number of \\"steps\\" that decreased in size towards its apex. The result was the Pyramid of Djoser, which was designed to serve as a gigantic stairway by which the soul of the deceased pharaoh could ascend to the heavens. Such was the importance of Imhotep's achievement that he was deified by later Egyptians.[10]\\r\\nThe most prolific pyramid-building phase coincided with the greatest degree of absolutist rule. It was during this time that the most famous pyramids, the Giza pyramid complex, were built. Over time, as authority became less centralized, the ability and willingness to harness the resources required for construction on a massive scale decreased, and later pyramids were smaller, less well-built and often hastily constructed.\\r\\nLong after the end of Egypt's own pyramid-building period, a burst of pyramid-building occurred in what is present-day Sudan, after much of Egypt came under the rule of the kings of Napata. While Napatan rule was brief, ending in 661 BC, Egyptian culture made an indelible impression, and during the later Kingdom of Mero? (approximately in the period between 300 BCE ÿ 300 CE), this flowered into a full-blown pyramid-building revival, which saw more than two hundred Egyptian-inspired indigenous royal pyramid-tombs constructed in the vicinity of the kingdom's capital cities.\\r\\nAl-Aziz Uthman (1171ÿ1198) tried to destroy the Giza pyramid complex. He gave up after damaging the Pyramid of Menkaure because the task proved too huge.[11]\\r\\nThe shape of Egyptian pyramids is thought to represent the primordial mound from which the Egyptians believed the earth was created. The shape of a pyramid is thought to be representative of the descending rays of the sun, and most pyramids were faced with polished, highly reflective white limestone, in order to give them a brilliant appearance when viewed from a distance. Pyramids were often also named in ways that referred to solar luminescence. For example, the formal name of the Bent Pyramid at Dahshur was The Southern Shining Pyramid, and that of Senwosret at el-Lahun was Senwosret is Shining.\\r\\nWhile it is generally agreed that pyramids were burial monuments, there is continued disagreement on the particular theological principles that might have given rise to them. One suggestion is that they were designed as a type of \\"resurrection machine.\\"[12]\\r\\nThe Egyptians believed the dark area of the night sky around which the stars appear to revolve was the physical gateway into the heavens. One of the narrow shafts that extend from the main burial chamber through the entire body of the Great Pyramid points directly towards the center of this part of the sky. This suggests the pyramid may have been designed to serve as a means to magically launch the deceased pharaoh's soul directly into the abode of the gods.[12]\\r\\nAll Egyptian pyramids were built on the west bank of the Nile, which, as the site of the setting sun, was associated with the realm of the dead in Egyptian mythology.[13]\\r\\nIn 1842, Karl Richard Lepsius produced the first modern list of pyramids ÿ see Lepsius list of pyramids ÿ in which he counted 67. A great many more have since been discovered. As of November 2008, 118 Egyptian pyramids have been identified.[3]\\r\\nThe location of Pyramid 29, which Lepsius called the \\"Headless Pyramid\\", was lost for a second time when the structure was buried by desert sands subsequent to Lepsius' survey. It was found again only during an archaeological dig conducted in 2008.[14]\\r\\nMany pyramids are in a poor state of preservation or buried by desert sands. If visible at all, they may appear as little more than mounds of rubble. As a consequence, archaeologists are continuing to identify and study previously unknown pyramid structures.\\r\\nThe most recent pyramid to be discovered was that of Sesheshet at Saqqara, mother of the Sixth Dynasty pharaoh Teti. The discovery was announced by Zahi Hawass, Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, on 11 November 2008.[4][15]\\r\\nAll of Egypt's pyramids, except the small Third Dynasty pyramid of Zawyet el-Amwat (or Zawyet el-Mayitin), are sited on the west bank of the Nile, and most are grouped together in a number of pyramid fields. The most important of these are listed geographically, from north to south, below.\\r\\nAbu Rawash is the site of Egypt's most northerly pyramid (other than the ruins of Lepsius pyramid number one)[5] the mostly ruined Pyramid of Djedefre, son and successor of Khufu. Originally it was thought that this pyramid had never been completed, but the current archaeological consensus is that not only was it completed, but that it was originally about the same size as the Pyramid of Menkaure, which would have placed it among the half-dozen or so largest pyramids in Egypt.\\r\\nIts location adjacent to a major crossroads made it an easy source of stone. Quarrying ÿ which began in Roman times ÿ has left little apart from about 15 courses of stone superimposed upon the natural hillock that formed part of the pyramid's core. A small adjacent satellite pyramid is in a better state of preservation.\\r\\nGiza is the location of the Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the \\"Great Pyramid\\" and the \\"Pyramid of Cheops\\"); the somewhat smaller Pyramid of Khafre (or Kephren); the relatively modest-sized Pyramid of Menkaure (or Mykerinus), along with a number of smaller satellite edifices known as \\"Queen's pyramids\\"; and the Great Sphinx of Giza.\\r\\nOf the three, only Khafre's pyramid retains part of its original polished limestone casing, near its apex. This pyramid appears larger than the adjacent Khufu pyramid by virtue of its more elevated location, and the steeper angle of inclination of its construction ÿ it is, in fact, smaller in both height and volume.\\r\\nThe Giza pyramid complex has been a popular tourist destination since antiquity, and was popularized in Hellenistic times when the Great Pyramid was listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Today it is the only one of those wonders still in existence.\\r\\nThis site, halfway between Giza and Abu Sir, is the location for two unfinished Old Kingdom pyramids. The northern structure's owner is believed to be pharaoh Nebka, while the southern structure, known as the Layer Pyramid, may be attributable to the Third Dynasty pharaoh Khaba, a close successor of Sekhemkhet. If this attribution is correct, Khaba's short reign could explain the seemingly unfinished state of this step pyramid. Today it stands around 17?m (56?ft) high; had it been completed, it is likely to have exceeded 40?m (130?ft).\\r\\nThere are a total of fourteen pyramids at this site, which served as the main royal necropolis during the Fifth Dynasty. The quality of construction of the Abu Sir pyramids is inferior to those of the Fourth Dynasty ÿ perhaps signaling a decrease in royal power or a less vibrant economy. They are smaller than their predecessors, and are built of low-quality local limestone.\\r\\nThe three major pyramids are those of Niuserre, which is also the best preserved, Neferirkare Kakai and Sahure. The site is also home to the incomplete Pyramid of Neferefre. Most of the major pyramids at Abu Sir were built similar construction techniques, comprising a rubble core surrounded by steps of mud bricks with a limestone outer casing. The largest of these 5th-Dynasty pyramids, the Pyramid of Neferirkare Kakai, is believed to have been built originally as a step pyramid some 70?m (230?ft) high and then later transformed into a \\"true\\" pyramid by having its steps filled in with loose masonry.\\r\\nMajor pyramids located here include the Pyramid of Djoser ÿ generally identified as the world's oldest substantial monumental structure to be built of dressed stone ÿ the Pyramid of Userkaf, the Pyramid of Teti and the Pyramid of Merikare, dating to the First Intermediate Period of Egypt. Also at Saqqara is the Pyramid of Unas, which retains a pyramid causeway that is one of the best-preserved in Egypt. Together with the pyramid of Userkaf, this pyramid was the subject of one of the earliest known restoration attempts, conducted by Khaemweset, a son of Ramesses II.[16] Saqqara is also the location of the incomplete step pyramid of Djoser's successor Sekhemkhet known as the Buried Pyramid. Archaeologists believe that had this pyramid been completed, it would have been larger than Djoser's.\\r\\nSouth of the main pyramid field at Saqqara is a second collection of later, smaller pyramids, including those of Pepi I, Isesi, Merenre, Pepi II and Ibi. Most of these are in a poor state of preservation.\\r\\nThe Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Shepseskaf either did not share an interest in, or have the capacity to undertake pyramid construction like his predecessors. His tomb, which is also sited at south Saqqara, was instead built as an unusually large mastaba and offering temple complex. It is commonly known as the Mastabat al-Firaun.[17]\\r\\nA previously unknown pyramid was discovered at north Saqqara in late 2008. Believed to be the tomb of Teti's mother, it currently stands approximately 5?m (16?ft) high, although the original height was closer to 14?m (46?ft).\\r\\nThis area is arguably the most important pyramid field in Egypt outside Giza and Saqqara, although until 1996 the site was inaccessible due to its location within a military base, and was relatively unknown outside archaeological circles.\\r\\nThe southern Pyramid of Sneferu, commonly known as the Bent Pyramid, is believed to be the first Egyptian pyramid intended by its builders to be a \\"true\\" smooth-sided pyramid from the outset; the earlier pyramid at Meidum had smooth sides in its finished state ÿ but it was conceived and built as a step pyramid, before having its steps filled in and concealed beneath a smooth outer casing of dressed stone.\\r\\nAs a true smooth-sided structure, the Bent Pyramid was only a partial success ÿ albeit a unique, visually imposing one; it is also the only major Egyptian pyramid to retain a significant proportion of its original smooth outer limestone casing intact. As such it serves as the best contemporary example of how the ancient Egyptians intended their pyramids to look.\\r\\nSeveral kilometeres to the north of the Bent Pyramid is the last ÿ and most successful ÿ of the three pyramids constructed during the reign of Sneferu; the Red Pyramid is the world's first successfully completed smooth-sided pyramid. The structure is also the third largest pyramid in Egypt ÿ after the pyramids of Khufu and Khafra at Giza.\\r\\nAlso at Dahshur is the pyramid known as the Pyramid of Amenemhat III, as well as a number of small, mostly ruined subsidiary pyramids.\\r\\nLocated to the south of Dahshur, several mudbrick pyramids were built in this area in the late Middle Kingdom, perhaps for Amenemhat IV and Sobekneferu.\\r\\nTwo major pyramids are known to have been built at Lisht ÿ those of Amenemhat I and his son, Senusret I. The latter is surrounded by the ruins of ten smaller subsidiary pyramids. One of these subsidiary pyramids is known to be that of Amenemhat's cousin, Khaba II.[18] The site which is in the vicinity of the oasis of the Faiyum, midway between Dahshur and Meidum, and about 100 kilometres south of Cairo, is believed to be in the vicinity of the ancient city of Itjtawy (the precise location of which remains unknown), which served as the capital of Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty.\\r\\nThe pyramid at Meidum is one of three constructed during the reign of Sneferu, and is believed by some to have been started by that pharaoh's father and predecessor, Huni. However, that attribution is uncertain, as no record of Huni's name has been found at the site.\\r\\nIt was constructed as a step pyramid, and then later converted into the first \\"true\\" smooth-sided pyramid when the steps were filled in, and an outer casing added.\\r\\nThe pyramid suffered several catastrophic collapses in ancient and medieval times; medieval Arab writers described it as having seven steps ÿ although today only the three uppermost of these remain, giving the structure its odd, tower-like appearance. The hill on which the pyramid is situated is not a natural landscape feature ÿ it is the small mountain of debris created when the lower courses and outer casing of the pyramid gave way.\\r\\nAmenemhat III was the last powerful ruler of the Twelfth Dynasty, and the pyramid he built at Hawarra, near the Faiyum, is believed to post-date the so-called \\"Black Pyramid\\" built by the same ruler at Dahshur. It is the Hawarra pyramid that is believed to have been Amenemhet's final resting place.\\r\\nThe pyramid of Senusret II at el-Lahun is the southernmost royal-tomb pyramid structure in Egypt. Its builders reduced the amount of work necessary to construct it by ingeniously using as its foundation and core a 12-meter-high natural limestone hill.\\r\\nPiye, the first ruler of the Egyptian 25th dynasty, built a pyramid at El-Kurru. He was the first Egyptian pharaoh to be buried in a pyramid in centuries.\\r\\nTaharqa, a legitimate ruler and Pharaoh of Egypt, built his pyramid at Nuri. It was the largest in the area (North Sudan).\\r\\nThe following table lays out the chronology of the construction of most of the major pyramids mentioned here. Each pyramid is identified through the pharaoh who ordered it built, his approximate reign, and its location.\\r\\nConstructing the pyramids involved moving huge quantities of stone. The quarried blocks were likely transported to the construction site by wooden sleds, with sand in front of the sled wetted to reduce friction. Droplets of water created bridges between the grains of sand, helping them stick together.[20]\\r\\nList\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 295834N 310752E? / ?29.97611N 31.13111E? / 29.97611; 31.13111","input":"When was the first stone pyramid built in egypt?"},{"output":"the central nervous system","context":"The nervous system is the part of an animal that coordinates its actions by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its body. Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago. In vertebrates it consists of two main parts, the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord. The PNS consists mainly of nerves, which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons, that connect the CNS to every other part of the body. Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves, while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent. Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves. The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems, the somatic, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems. Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement. The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy, while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state. The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system. Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily. Nerves that exit from the cranium are called cranial nerves while those exiting from the spinal cord are called spinal nerves.\\r\\nAt the cellular level, the nervous system is defined by the presence of a special type of cell, called the neuron, also known as a \\"nerve cell\\". Neurons have special structures that allow them to send signals rapidly and precisely to other cells. They send these signals in the form of electrochemical waves traveling along thin fibers called axons, which cause chemicals called neurotransmitters to be released at junctions called synapses. A cell that receives a synaptic signal from a neuron may be excited, inhibited, or otherwise modulated. The connections between neurons can form neural circuits and also neural networks that generate an organism's perception of the world and determine its behavior. Along with neurons, the nervous system contains other specialized cells called glial cells (or simply glia), which provide structural and metabolic support.\\r\\nNervous systems are found in most multicellular animals, but vary greatly in complexity.[1] The only multicellular animals that have no nervous system at all are sponges, placozoans, and mesozoans, which have very simple body plans. The nervous systems of the radially symmetric organisms ctenophores (comb jellies) and cnidarians (which include anemones, hydras, corals and jellyfish) consist of a diffuse nerve net. All other animal species, with the exception of a few types of worm, have a nervous system containing a brain, a central cord (or two cords running in parallel), and nerves radiating from the brain and central cord. The size of the nervous system ranges from a few hundred cells in the simplest worms, to around 300 billion cells in African elephants.[2]\\r\\nThe central nervous system functions to send signals from one cell to others, or from one part of the body to others and to receive feedback. Malfunction of the nervous system can occur as a result of genetic defects, physical damage due to trauma or toxicity, infection or simply of ageing. The medical specialty of neurology studies disorders of the nervous system and looks for interventions that can prevent or treat them. In the peripheral nervous system, the most common problem is the failure of nerve conduction, which can be due to different causes including diabetic neuropathy and demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Neuroscience is the field of science that focuses on the study of the nervous system.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nervous system derives its name from nerves, which are cylindrical bundles of fibers (the axons of neurons), that emanate from the brain and spinal cord, and branch repeatedly to innervate every part of the body.[3] Nerves are large enough to have been recognized by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans,[4] but their internal structure was not understood until it became possible to examine them using a microscope.[5] \\"It is difficult to believe that until approximately year 1900 it was not known that neurons are the basic units of the brain (Santiago Ram܇n y Cajal). Equally surprising is the fact that the concept of chemical transmission in the brain was not known until around 1930 (Henry Hallett Dale) and (Otto Loewi). We began to understand the basic electrical phenomenon that neurons use in order to communicate among themselves, the action potential, in the 1950s (Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, Andrew Huxley and John Eccles). It was in the 1960s that we became aware of how basic neuronal networks code stimuli and thus basic concepts are possible (David H. Hubel, and Torsten Wiesel). The molecular revolution swept across US universities in the 1980s. It was in the 1990s that molecular mechanisms of behavioral phenomena became widely known (Eric Richard Kandel).\\"[6] A microscopic examination shows that nerves consist primarily of axons, along with different membranes that wrap around them and segregate them into fascicles. The neurons that give rise to nerves do not lie entirely within the nerves themselvestheir cell bodies reside within the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral ganglia.[3]\\r\\nAll animals more advanced than sponges have nervous systems. However, even sponges, unicellular animals, and non-animals such as slime molds have cell-to-cell signalling mechanisms that are precursors to those of neurons.[7] In radially symmetric animals such as the jellyfish and hydra, the nervous system consists of a nerve net, a diffuse network of isolated cells.[8] In bilaterian animals, which make up the great majority of existing species, the nervous system has a common structure that originated early in the Ediacaran period, over 550 million years ago.[9][10]\\r\\nThe nervous system contains two main categories or types of cells: neurons and glial cells.\\r\\nThe nervous system is defined by the presence of a special type of cellthe neuron (sometimes called \\"neurone\\" or \\"nerve cell\\").[3] Neurons can be distinguished from other cells in a number of ways, but their most fundamental property is that they communicate with other cells via synapses, which are membrane-to-membrane junctions containing molecular machinery that allows rapid transmission of signals, either electrical or chemical.[3] Many types of neuron possess an axon, a protoplasmic protrusion that can extend to distant parts of the body and make thousands of synaptic contacts.[11] Axons frequently travel through the body in bundles called nerves.\\r\\nEven in the nervous system of a single species such as humans, hundreds of different types of neurons exist, with a wide variety of morphologies and functions.[11] These include sensory neurons that transmute physical stimuli such as light and sound into neural signals, and motor neurons that transmute neural signals into activation of muscles or glands; however in many species the great majority of neurons participate in the formation of centralized structures (the brain and ganglia) and they receive all of their input from other neurons and send their output to other neurons.[3]\\r\\nGlial cells (named from the Greek for \\"glue\\") are non-neuronal cells that provide support and nutrition, maintain homeostasis, form myelin, and participate in signal transmission in the nervous system.[12] In the human brain, it is estimated that the total number of glia roughly equals the number of neurons, although the proportions vary in different brain areas.[13] Among the most important functions of glial cells are to support neurons and hold them in place; to supply nutrients to neurons; to insulate neurons electrically; to destroy pathogens and remove dead neurons; and to provide guidance cues directing the axons of neurons to their targets.[12] A very important type of glial cell (oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system, and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system) generates layers of a fatty substance called myelin that wraps around axons and provides electrical insulation which allows them to transmit action potentials much more rapidly and efficiently. Recent findings indicate that glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, serve as important resident immune cells within the central nervous system.\\r\\nThe nervous system of vertebrates (including humans) is divided into the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).[14]\\r\\nThe (CNS) is the major division, and consists of the brain and the spinal cord.[14] The spinal canal contains the spinal cord, while the cranial cavity contains the brain. The CNS is enclosed and protected by the meninges, a three-layered system of membranes, including a tough, leathery outer layer called the dura mater. The brain is also protected by the skull, and the spinal cord by the vertebrae.\\r\\nThe peripheral nervous system (PNS) is a collective term for the nervous system structures that do not lie within the CNS.[15] The large majority of the axon bundles called nerves are considered to belong to the PNS, even when the cell bodies of the neurons to which they belong reside within the brain or spinal cord. The PNS is divided into somatic and visceral parts. The somatic part consists of the nerves that innervate the skin, joints, and muscles. The cell bodies of somatic sensory neurons lie in dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord. The visceral part, also known as the autonomic nervous system, contains neurons that innervate the internal organs, blood vessels, and glands. The autonomic nervous system itself consists of two parts: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. Some authors also include sensory neurons whose cell bodies lie in the periphery (for senses such as hearing) as part of the PNS; others, however, omit them.[16]\\r\\nThe vertebrate nervous system can also be divided into areas called grey matter (\\"gray matter\\" in American spelling) and white matter.[17] Grey matter (which is only grey in preserved tissue, and is better described as pink or light brown in living tissue) contains a high proportion of cell bodies of neurons. White matter is composed mainly of myelinated axons, and takes its color from the myelin. White matter includes all of the nerves, and much of the interior of the brain and spinal cord. Grey matter is found in clusters of neurons in the brain and spinal cord, and in cortical layers that line their surfaces. There is an anatomical convention that a cluster of neurons in the brain or spinal cord is called a nucleus, whereas a cluster of neurons in the periphery is called a ganglion.[18] There are, however, a few exceptions to this rule, notably including the part of the forebrain called the basal ganglia.[19]\\r\\nSponges have no cells connected to each other by synaptic junctions, that is, no neurons, and therefore no nervous system. They do, however, have homologs of many genes that play key roles in synaptic function. Recent studies have shown that sponge cells express a group of proteins that cluster together to form a structure resembling a postsynaptic density (the signal-receiving part of a synapse).[7] However, the function of this structure is currently unclear. Although sponge cells do not show synaptic transmission, they do communicate with each other via calcium waves and other impulses, which mediate some simple actions such as whole-body contraction.[20]\\r\\nJellyfish, comb jellies, and related animals have diffuse nerve nets rather than a central nervous system. In most jellyfish the nerve net is spread more or less evenly across the body; in comb jellies it is concentrated near the mouth. The nerve nets consist of sensory neurons, which pick up chemical, tactile, and visual signals; motor neurons, which can activate contractions of the body wall; and intermediate neurons, which detect patterns of activity in the sensory neurons and, in response, send signals to groups of motor neurons. In some cases groups of intermediate neurons are clustered into discrete ganglia.[8]\\r\\nThe development of the nervous system in radiata is relatively unstructured. Unlike bilaterians, radiata only have two primordial cell layers, endoderm and ectoderm. Neurons are generated from a special set of ectodermal precursor cells, which also serve as precursors for every other ectodermal cell type.[21]\\r\\nThe vast majority of existing animals are bilaterians, meaning animals with left and right sides that are approximate mirror images of each other. All bilateria are thought to have descended from a common wormlike ancestor that appeared in the Ediacaran period, 550ÿ600 million years ago.[9] The fundamental bilaterian body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from mouth to anus, and a nerve cord with an enlargement (a \\"ganglion\\") for each body segment, with an especially large ganglion at the front, called the \\"brain\\".\\r\\nEven mammals, including humans, show the segmented bilaterian body plan at the level of the nervous system. The spinal cord contains a series of segmental ganglia, each giving rise to motor and sensory nerves that innervate a portion of the body surface and underlying musculature. On the limbs, the layout of the innervation pattern is complex, but on the trunk it gives rise to a series of narrow bands. The top three segments belong to the brain, giving rise to the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.[22]\\r\\nBilaterians can be divided, based on events that occur very early in embryonic development, into two groups (superphyla) called protostomes and deuterostomes.[23] Deuterostomes include vertebrates as well as echinoderms, hemichordates (mainly acorn worms), and Xenoturbellidans.[24] Protostomes, the more diverse group, include arthropods, molluscs, and numerous types of worms. There is a basic difference between the two groups in the placement of the nervous system within the body: protostomes possess a nerve cord on the ventral (usually bottom) side of the body, whereas in deuterostomes the nerve cord is on the dorsal (usually top) side. In fact, numerous aspects of the body are inverted between the two groups, including the expression patterns of several genes that show dorsal-to-ventral gradients. Most anatomists now consider that the bodies of protostomes and deuterostomes are \\"flipped over\\" with respect to each other, a hypothesis that was first proposed by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire for insects in comparison to vertebrates. Thus insects, for example, have nerve cords that run along the ventral midline of the body, while all vertebrates have spinal cords that run along the dorsal midline.[25]\\r\\nWorms are the simplest bilaterian animals, and reveal the basic structure of the bilaterian nervous system in the most straightforward way. As an example, earthworms have dual nerve cords running along the length of the body and merging at the tail and the mouth. These nerve cords are connected by transverse nerves like the rungs of a ladder. These transverse nerves help coordinate the two sides of the animal. Two ganglia at the head (the \\"nerve ring\\") end function similar to a simple brain. Photoreceptors on the animal's eyespots provide sensory information on light and dark.[26]\\r\\nThe nervous system of one very small roundworm, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, has been completely mapped out in a connectome including its synapses. Every neuron and its cellular lineage has been recorded and most, if not all, of the neural connections are known. In this species, the nervous system is sexually dimorphic; the nervous systems of the two sexes, males and female hermaphrodites, have different numbers of neurons and groups of neurons that perform sex-specific functions. In C. elegans, males have exactly 383 neurons, while hermaphrodites have exactly 302 neurons.[27]\\r\\nArthropods, such as insects and crustaceans, have a nervous system made up of a series of ganglia, connected by a ventral nerve cord made up of two parallel connectives running along the length of the belly.[28] Typically, each body segment has one ganglion on each side, though some ganglia are fused to form the brain and other large ganglia. The head segment contains the brain, also known as the supraesophageal ganglion. In the insect nervous system, the brain is anatomically divided into the protocerebrum, deutocerebrum, and tritocerebrum. Immediately behind the brain is the subesophageal ganglion, which is composed of three pairs of fused ganglia. It controls the mouthparts, the salivary glands and certain muscles. Many arthropods have well-developed sensory organs, including compound eyes for vision and antennae for olfaction and pheromone sensation. The sensory information from these organs is processed by the brain.\\r\\nIn insects, many neurons have cell bodies that are positioned at the edge of the brain and are electrically passivethe cell bodies serve only to provide metabolic support and do not participate in signalling. A protoplasmic fiber runs from the cell body and branches profusely, with some parts transmitting signals and other parts receiving signals. Thus, most parts of the insect brain have passive cell bodies arranged around the periphery, while the neural signal processing takes place in a tangle of protoplasmic fibers called neuropil, in the interior.[29]\\r\\nA neuron is called identified if it has properties that distinguish it from every other neuron in the same animalproperties such as location, neurotransmitter, gene expression pattern, and connectivityand if every individual organism belonging to the same species has one and only one neuron with the same set of properties.[30] In vertebrate nervous systems very few neurons are \\"identified\\" in this sensein humans, there are believed to be nonebut in simpler nervous systems, some or all neurons may be thus unique. In the roundworm C. elegans, whose nervous system is the most thoroughly described of any animal's, every neuron in the body is uniquely identifiable, with the same location and the same connections in every individual worm. One notable consequence of this fact is that the form of the C. elegans nervous system is completely specified by the genome, with no experience-dependent plasticity.[27]\\r\\nThe brains of many molluscs and insects also contain substantial numbers of identified neurons.[30] In vertebrates, the best known identified neurons are the gigantic Mauthner cells of fish.[31] Every fish has two Mauthner cells, located in the bottom part of the brainstem, one on the left side and one on the right. Each Mauthner cell has an axon that crosses over, innervating neurons at the same brain level and then travelling down through the spinal cord, making numerous connections as it goes. The synapses generated by a Mauthner cell are so powerful that a single action potential gives rise to a major behavioral response: within milliseconds the fish curves its body into a C-shape, then straightens, thereby propelling itself rapidly forward. Functionally this is a fast escape response, triggered most easily by a strong sound wave or pressure wave impinging on the lateral line organ of the fish. Mauthner cells are not the only identified neurons in fishthere are about 20 more types, including pairs of \\"Mauthner cell analogs\\" in each spinal segmental nucleus. Although a Mauthner cell is capable of bringing about an escape response individually, in the context of ordinary behavior other types of cells usually contribute to shaping the amplitude and direction of the response.\\r\\nMauthner cells have been described as command neurons. A command neuron is a special type of identified neuron, defined as a neuron that is capable of driving a specific behavior individually.[32] Such neurons appear most commonly in the fast escape systems of various speciesthe squid giant axon and squid giant synapse, used for pioneering experiments in neurophysiology because of their enormous size, both participate in the fast escape circuit of the squid. The concept of a command neuron has, however, become controversial, because of studies showing that some neurons that initially appeared to fit the description were really only capable of evoking a response in a limited set of circumstances.[33]\\r\\nAt the most basic level, the function of the nervous system is to send signals from one cell to others, or from one part of the body to others. There are multiple ways that a cell can send signals to other cells. One is by releasing chemicals called hormones into the internal circulation, so that they can diffuse to distant sites. In contrast to this \\"broadcast\\" mode of signaling, the nervous system provides \\"point-to-point\\" signalsneurons project their axons to specific target areas and make synaptic connections with specific target cells.[34] Thus, neural signaling is capable of a much higher level of specificity than hormonal signaling. It is also much faster: the fastest nerve signals travel at speeds that exceed 100 meters per second.\\r\\nAt a more integrative level, the primary function of the nervous system is to control the body.[3] It does this by extracting information from the environment using sensory receptors, sending signals that encode this information into the central nervous system, processing the information to determine an appropriate response, and sending output signals to muscles or glands to activate the response. The evolution of a complex nervous system has made it possible for various animal species to have advanced perception abilities such as vision, complex social interactions, rapid coordination of organ systems, and integrated processing of concurrent signals. In humans, the sophistication of the nervous system makes it possible to have language, abstract representation of concepts, transmission of culture, and many other features of human society that would not exist without the human brain.\\r\\nMost neurons send signals via their axons, although some types are capable of dendrite-to-dendrite communication. (In fact, the types of neurons called amacrine cells have no axons, and communicate only via their dendrites.) Neural signals propagate along an axon in the form of electrochemical waves called action potentials, which produce cell-to-cell signals at points where axon terminals make synaptic contact with other cells.[35]\\r\\nSynapses may be electrical or chemical. Electrical synapses make direct electrical connections between neurons,[36] but chemical synapses are much more common, and much more diverse in function.[37] At a chemical synapse, the cell that sends signals is called presynaptic, and the cell that receives signals is called postsynaptic. Both the presynaptic and postsynaptic areas are full of molecular machinery that carries out the signalling process. The presynaptic area contains large numbers of tiny spherical vessels called synaptic vesicles, packed with neurotransmitter chemicals.[35] When the presynaptic terminal is electrically stimulated, an array of molecules embedded in the membrane are activated, and cause the contents of the vesicles to be released into the narrow space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, called the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter then binds to receptors embedded in the postsynaptic membrane, causing them to enter an activated state.[37] Depending on the type of receptor, the resulting effect on the postsynaptic cell may be excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory in more complex ways. For example, release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at a synaptic contact between a motor neuron and a muscle cell induces rapid contraction of the muscle cell.[38] The entire synaptic transmission process takes only a fraction of a millisecond, although the effects on the postsynaptic cell may last much longer (even indefinitely, in cases where the synaptic signal leads to the formation of a memory trace).[11]\\r\\nThere are literally hundreds of different types of synapses. In fact, there are over a hundred known neurotransmitters, and many of them have multiple types of receptors.[39] Many synapses use more than one neurotransmittera common arrangement is for a synapse to use one fast-acting small-molecule neurotransmitter such as glutamate or GABA, along with one or more peptide neurotransmitters that play slower-acting modulatory roles. Molecular neuroscientists generally divide receptors into two broad groups: chemically gated ion channels and second messenger systems. When a chemically gated ion channel is activated, it forms a passage that allows specific types of ions to flow across the membrane. Depending on the type of ion, the effect on the target cell may be excitatory or inhibitory. When a second messenger system is activated, it starts a cascade of molecular interactions inside the target cell, which may ultimately produce a wide variety of complex effects, such as increasing or decreasing the sensitivity of the cell to stimuli, or even altering gene transcription.\\r\\nAccording to a rule called Dale's principle, which has only a few known exceptions, a neuron releases the same neurotransmitters at all of its synapses.[40] This does not mean, though, that a neuron exerts the same effect on all of its targets, because the effect of a synapse depends not on the neurotransmitter, but on the receptors that it activates.[37] Because different targets can (and frequently do) use different types of receptors, it is possible for a neuron to have excitatory effects on one set of target cells, inhibitory effects on others, and complex modulatory effects on others still. Nevertheless, it happens that the two most widely used neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA, each have largely consistent effects. Glutamate has several widely occurring types of receptors, but all of them are excitatory or modulatory. Similarly, GABA has several widely occurring receptor types, but all of them are inhibitory.[41] Because of this consistency, glutamatergic cells are frequently referred to as \\"excitatory neurons\\", and GABAergic cells as \\"inhibitory neurons\\". Strictly speaking, this is an abuse of terminologyit is the receptors that are excitatory and inhibitory, not the neuronsbut it is commonly seen even in scholarly publications.\\r\\nOne very important subset of synapses are capable of forming memory traces by means of long-lasting activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength.[42] The best-known form of neural memory is a process called long-term potentiation (abbreviated LTP), which operates at synapses that use the neurotransmitter glutamate acting on a special type of receptor known as the NMDA receptor.[43] The NMDA receptor has an \\"associative\\" property: if the two cells involved in the synapse are both activated at approximately the same time, a channel opens that permits calcium to flow into the target cell.[44] The calcium entry initiates a second messenger cascade that ultimately leads to an increase in the number of glutamate receptors in the target cell, thereby increasing the effective strength of the synapse. This change in strength can last for weeks or longer. Since the discovery of LTP in 1973, many other types of synaptic memory traces have been found, involving increases or decreases in synaptic strength that are induced by varying conditions, and last for variable periods of time.[43] The reward system, that reinforces desired behaviour for example, depends on a variant form of LTP that is conditioned on an extra input coming from a reward-signalling pathway that uses dopamine as neurotransmitter.[45] All these forms of synaptic modifiability, taken collectively, give rise to neural plasticity, that is, to a capability for the nervous system to adapt itself to variations in the environment.\\r\\nThe basic neuronal function of sending signals to other cells includes a capability for neurons to exchange signals with each other. Networks formed by interconnected groups of neurons are capable of a wide variety of functions, including feature detection, pattern generation and timing,[46] and there are seen to be countless types of information processing possible. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts showed in 1943 that even artificial neural networks formed from a greatly simplified mathematical abstraction of a neuron are capable of universal computation.[47]\\r\\nHistorically, for many years the predominant view of the function of the nervous system was as a stimulus-response associator.[48] In this conception, neural processing begins with stimuli that activate sensory neurons, producing signals that propagate through chains of connections in the spinal cord and brain, giving rise eventually to activation of motor neurons and thereby to muscle contraction, i.e., to overt responses. Descartes believed that all of the behaviors of animals, and most of the behaviors of humans, could be explained in terms of stimulus-response circuits, although he also believed that higher cognitive functions such as language were not capable of being explained mechanistically.[49] Charles Sherrington, in his influential 1906 book The Integrative Action of the Nervous System,[48] developed the concept of stimulus-response mechanisms in much more detail, and Behaviorism, the school of thought that dominated Psychology through the middle of the 20th century, attempted to explain every aspect of human behavior in stimulus-response terms.[50]\\r\\nHowever, experimental studies of electrophysiology, beginning in the early 20th century and reaching high productivity by the 1940s, showed that the nervous system contains many mechanisms for generating patterns of activity intrinsically, without requiring an external stimulus.[51] Neurons were found to be capable of producing regular sequences of action potentials, or sequences of bursts, even in complete isolation.[52] When intrinsically active neurons are connected to each other in complex circuits, the possibilities for generating intricate temporal patterns become far more extensive.[46] A modern conception views the function of the nervous system partly in terms of stimulus-response chains, and partly in terms of intrinsically generated activity patternsboth types of activity interact with each other to generate the full repertoire of behavior.[53]\\r\\nThe simplest type of neural circuit is a reflex arc, which begins with a sensory input and ends with a motor output, passing through a sequence of neurons connected in series.[54] This can be shown in the \\"withdrawal reflex\\" causing a hand to jerk back after a hot stove is touched. The circuit begins with sensory receptors in the skin that are activated by harmful levels of heat: a special type of molecular structure embedded in the membrane causes heat to change the electrical field across the membrane. If the change in electrical potential is large enough to pass the given threshold, it evokes an action potential, which is transmitted along the axon of the receptor cell, into the spinal cord. There the axon makes excitatory synaptic contacts with other cells, some of which project (send axonal output) to the same region of the spinal cord, others projecting into the brain. One target is a set of spinal interneurons that project to motor neurons controlling the arm muscles. The interneurons excite the motor neurons, and if the excitation is strong enough, some of the motor neurons generate action potentials, which travel down their axons to the point where they make excitatory synaptic contacts with muscle cells. The excitatory signals induce contraction of the muscle cells, which causes the joint angles in the arm to change, pulling the arm away.\\r\\nIn reality, this straightforward schema is subject to numerous complications.[54] Although for the simplest reflexes there are short neural paths from sensory neuron to motor neuron, there are also other nearby neurons that participate in the circuit and modulate the response. Furthermore, there are projections from the brain to the spinal cord that are capable of enhancing or inhibiting the reflex.\\r\\nAlthough the simplest reflexes may be mediated by circuits lying entirely within the spinal cord, more complex responses rely on signal processing in the brain.[55] For example, when an object in the periphery of the visual field moves, and a person looks toward it many stages of signal processing are initiated. The initial sensory response, in the retina of the eye, and the final motor response, in the oculomotor nuclei of the brain stem, are not all that different from those in a simple reflex, but the intermediate stages are completely different. Instead of a one or two step chain of processing, the visual signals pass through perhaps a dozen stages of integration, involving the thalamus, cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, superior colliculus, cerebellum, and several brainstem nuclei. These areas perform signal-processing functions that include feature detection, perceptual analysis, memory recall, decision-making, and motor planning.[56]\\r\\nFeature detection is the ability to extract biologically relevant information from combinations of sensory signals.[57] In the visual system, for example, sensory receptors in the retina of the eye are only individually capable of detecting \\"points of light\\" in the outside world.[58] Second-level visual neurons receive input from groups of primary receptors, higher-level neurons receive input from groups of second-level neurons, and so on, forming a hierarchy of processing stages. At each stage, important information is extracted from the signal ensemble and unimportant information is discarded. By the end of the process, input signals representing \\"points of light\\" have been transformed into a neural representation of objects in the surrounding world and their properties. The most sophisticated sensory processing occurs inside the brain, but complex feature extraction also takes place in the spinal cord and in peripheral sensory organs such as the retina.\\r\\nAlthough stimulus-response mechanisms are the easiest to understand, the nervous system is also capable of controlling the body in ways that do not require an external stimulus, by means of internally generated rhythms of activity. Because of the variety of voltage-sensitive ion channels that can be embedded in the membrane of a neuron, many types of neurons are capable, even in isolation, of generating rhythmic sequences of action potentials, or rhythmic alternations between high-rate bursting and quiescence. When neurons that are intrinsically rhythmic are connected to each other by excitatory or inhibitory synapses, the resulting networks are capable of a wide variety of dynamical behaviors, including attractor dynamics, periodicity, and even chaos. A network of neurons that uses its internal structure to generate temporally structured output, without requiring a corresponding temporally structured stimulus, is called a central pattern generator.\\r\\nInternal pattern generation operates on a wide range of time scales, from milliseconds to hours or longer. One of the most important types of temporal pattern is circadian rhythmicitythat is, rhythmicity with a period of approximately 24 hours. All animals that have been studied show circadian fluctuations in neural activity, which control circadian alternations in behavior such as the sleep-wake cycle. Experimental studies dating from the 1990s have shown that circadian rhythms are generated by a \\"genetic clock\\" consisting of a special set of genes whose expression level rises and falls over the course of the day. Animals as diverse as insects and vertebrates share a similar genetic clock system. The circadian clock is influenced by light but continues to operate even when light levels are held constant and no other external time-of-day cues are available. The clock genes are expressed in many parts of the nervous system as well as many peripheral organs, but in mammals, all of these \\"tissue clocks\\" are kept in synchrony by signals that emanate from a master timekeeper in a tiny part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.\\r\\nA mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same action performed by another.[59][60][61] Thus, the neuron \\"mirrors\\" the behavior of the other, as though the observer were itself acting. Such neurons have been directly observed in primate species.[62] Birds have been shown to have imitative resonance behaviors and neurological evidence suggests the presence of some form of mirroring system.[62][63] In humans, brain activity consistent with that of mirror neurons has been found in the premotor cortex, the supplementary motor area, the primary somatosensory cortex and the inferior parietal cortex.[64] The function of the mirror system is a subject of much speculation. Many researchers in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology consider that this system provides the physiological mechanism for the perception/action coupling (see the common coding theory).[61] They argue that mirror neurons may be important for understanding the actions of other people, and for learning new skills by imitation. Some researchers also speculate that mirror systems may simulate observed actions, and thus contribute to theory of mind skills,[65][66] while others relate mirror neurons to language abilities.[67] However, to date, no widely accepted neural or computational models have been put forward to describe how mirror neuron activity supports cognitive functions such as imitation.[68] There are neuroscientists who caution that the claims being made for the role of mirror neurons are not supported by adequate research.[69][70]\\r\\nIn vertebrates, landmarks of embryonic neural development include the birth and differentiation of neurons from stem cell precursors, the migration of immature neurons from their birthplaces in the embryo to their final positions, outgrowth of axons from neurons and guidance of the motile growth cone through the embryo towards postsynaptic partners, the generation of synapses between these axons and their postsynaptic partners, and finally the lifelong changes in synapses which are thought to underlie learning and memory.[71]\\r\\nAll bilaterian animals at an early stage of development form a gastrula, which is polarized, with one end called the animal pole and the other the vegetal pole. The gastrula has the shape of a disk with three layers of cells, an inner layer called the endoderm, which gives rise to the lining of most internal organs, a middle layer called the mesoderm, which gives rise to the bones and muscles, and an outer layer called the ectoderm, which gives rise to the skin and nervous system.[72]\\r\\nIn vertebrates, the first sign of the nervous system is the appearance of a thin strip of cells along the center of the back, called the neural plate. The inner portion of the neural plate (along the midline) is destined to become the central nervous system (CNS), the outer portion the peripheral nervous system (PNS). As development proceeds, a fold called the neural groove appears along the midline. This fold deepens, and then closes up at the top. At this point the future CNS appears as a cylindrical structure called the neural tube, whereas the future PNS appears as two strips of tissue called the neural crest, running lengthwise above the neural tube. The sequence of stages from neural plate to neural tube and neural crest is known as neurulation.\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, a set of famous experiments by Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold showed that the formation of nervous tissue is \\"induced\\" by signals from a group of mesodermal cells called the organizer region.[71] For decades, though, the nature of the induction process defeated every attempt to figure it out, until finally it was resolved by genetic approaches in the 1990s. Induction of neural tissue requires inhibition of the gene for a so-called bone morphogenetic protein, or BMP. Specifically the protein BMP4 appears to be involved. Two proteins called Noggin and Chordin, both secreted by the mesoderm, are capable of inhibiting BMP4 and thereby inducing ectoderm to turn into neural tissue. It appears that a similar molecular mechanism is involved for widely disparate types of animals, including arthropods as well as vertebrates. In some animals, however, another type of molecule called Fibroblast Growth Factor or FGF may also play an important role in induction.\\r\\nInduction of neural tissues causes formation of neural precursor cells, called neuroblasts.[73] In drosophila, neuroblasts divide asymmetrically, so that one product is a \\"ganglion mother cell\\" (GMC), and the other is a neuroblast. A GMC divides once, to give rise to either a pair of neurons or a pair of glial cells. In all, a neuroblast is capable of generating an indefinite number of neurons or glia.\\r\\nAs shown in a 2008 study, one factor common to all bilateral organisms (including humans) is a family of secreted signaling molecules called neurotrophins which regulate the growth and survival of neurons.[74] Zhu et al. identified DNT1, the first neurotrophin found in flies. DNT1 shares structural similarity with all known neurotrophins and is a key factor in the fate of neurons in Drosophila. Because neurotrophins have now been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrates, this evidence suggests that neurotrophins were present in an ancestor common to bilateral organisms and may represent a common mechanism for nervous system formation.\\r\\nThe central nervous system is protected by major physical and chemical barriers. Physically, the brain and spinal cord are surrounded by tough meningeal membranes, and enclosed in the bones of the skull and spinal vertebrae, which combine to form a strong physical shield. Chemically, the brain and spinal cord are isolated by the so-called bloodÿbrain barrier, which prevents most types of chemicals from moving from the bloodstream into the interior of the CNS. These protections make the CNS less susceptible in many ways than the PNS; the flip side, however, is that damage to the CNS tends to have more serious consequences.\\r\\nAlthough nerves tend to lie deep under the skin except in a few places such as the ulnar nerve near the elbow joint, they are still relatively exposed to physical damage, which can cause pain, loss of sensation, or loss of muscle control. Damage to nerves can also be caused by swelling or bruises at places where a nerve passes through a tight bony channel, as happens in carpal tunnel syndrome. If a nerve is completely transected, it will often regenerate, but for long nerves this process may take months to complete. In addition to physical damage, peripheral neuropathy may be caused by many other medical problems, including genetic conditions, metabolic conditions such as diabetes, inflammatory conditions such as GuillainÿBarr syndrome, vitamin deficiency, infectious diseases such as leprosy or shingles, or poisoning by toxins such as heavy metals. Many cases have no cause that can be identified, and are referred to as idiopathic. It is also possible for nerves to lose function temporarily, resulting in numbness as stiffnesscommon causes include mechanical pressure, a drop in temperature, or chemical interactions with local anesthetic drugs such as lidocaine.\\r\\nPhysical damage to the spinal cord may result in loss of sensation or movement. If an injury to the spine produces nothing worse than swelling, the symptoms may be transient, but if nerve fibers in the spine are actually destroyed, the loss of function is usually permanent. Experimental studies have shown that spinal nerve fibers attempt to regrow in the same way as nerve fibers, but in the spinal cord, tissue destruction usually produces scar tissue that cannot be penetrated by the regrowing nerves.","input":"What are two parts of the nervous system?"},{"output":"as early as the 17th century","context":"Ms or Ms. (normally /?m?z/, but also /m?z/, or /m?s/ when unstressed)[1][2] is an English honorific used with the last name or full name of a woman, intended as a default form of address for women regardless of their marital status.[3] Like Miss and Mrs., the term Ms. has its origins in the female English title once used for all women, Mistress. It has its origin in the 17th century and was revived into mainstream usage in the 20th century.[4] In the UK and the majority of Commonwealth countries, a full stop (period) is usually not used with the title; in the United States and Canada a period is usually used (see Abbreviation).[1][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nMs. began to be used as early as the 17th century, along with Miss and Mrs., as a title derived from the then formal Mistress, which, like Mister, did not originally indicate marital status.[6][7] Ms., however, fell into disuse in favor of the other two titles and was not revived until the 20th century.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest known proposal for the modern revival of Ms. as a title appeared in The Republican of Springfield, Massachusetts, on November 10, 1901:\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a void in the English language which, with some diffidence, we undertake to fill. Every one has been put in an embarrassing position by ignorance of the status of some woman. To call a maiden Mrs is only a shade worse than to insult a matron with the inferior title Miss. Yet it is not always easy to know the facts...\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, clearly, what is needed is a more comprehensive term which does homage to the sex without expressing any views as to their domestic situation, and what could be simpler or more logical than the retention of what the two doubtful terms have in common. The abbreviation Ms is simple, it is easy to write, and the person concerned can translate it properly according to circumstances. For oral use it might be rendered as \\"Mizz,\\" which would be a close parallel to the practice long universal in many bucolic regions, where a slurred Mis' does duty for Miss and Mrs alike.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term was again suggested as a convenience to writers of business letters by such publications as the Bulletin of the American Business Writing Association (1951) and The Simplified Letter, issued by the National Office Management Association (1952).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1961, Sheila Michaels attempted to put the term into use when she saw what she thought was a typographical error on the address label of a copy of News & Letters sent to her roommate.[11][12] Michaels \\"was looking for a title for a woman who did not 'belong' to a man.\\"[13] She knew the separation of the now common terms Miss and Mrs. had derived from Mistress, but one could not suggest that women use the original title with its now louche connotations. Her efforts to promote use of a new honorific were at first ignored.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1969, in a lull during a WBAI-radio interview with The Feminists group, Michaels suggested the use of Ms. A friend of Gloria Steinem heard the interview and suggested it as a title for her new magazine. The magazine Ms. debuted on newsstands in January 1972, and its much-publicized name quickly led to widespread usage.[15] In February 1972, the US Government Printing Office approved using Ms. in official government documents.[16] In 1976 Marvel Comics introduced a new superhero named Ms. Marvel, billing her as the \\"first feminist superhero\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nEven several public opponents of non-sexist language, such as William Safire, were finally convinced that Ms. had earned a place in English by the case of US Congresswoman Geraldine A. Ferraro. Ferraro, a United States vice-presidential candidate in 1984, was a married woman who used her birth surname professionally rather than her husband's (Zaccaro). Safire pointed out that it would be equally incorrect to call her \\"Miss Ferraro\\" (as she was married) or \\"Mrs. Ferraro\\" (as her husband was not \\"Mr. Ferraro\\")and that calling her \\"Mrs. Zaccaro\\" would confuse the reader.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nSuggestions about how Ms. should be used, or whether it should be used at all, are varied.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Daily Telegraph states in its style guide that Ms should only be used if a subject requests it herself and it \\"should not be used merely because we do not know whether the woman is Mrs or Miss\\".[19] On the other hand, The Guardian, which restricts its use of honorific titles to leading articles, states in its style guide: \\"use Ms for women ... unless they have expressed a preference for Miss or Mrs\\".[20] The Economist states that it generally uses the title a person adopts but warns that Ms. is an \\"ugly\\" title.[21] A BBC Academy style guide states, \\"In choosing between Miss, Mrs and Ms, try to find out what the person herself uses, and stick to that.\\"[22] The New York Times embraces the use of all three: Mrs., Miss, and Ms.,[23] and will follow the individuals preferences.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome etiquette writers and famous figures do not support the use of Ms., including Charles Kidd, the editor of Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage, who claims the usage is \\"not very helpful\\" and that he had been \\"brought up to address a married woman as Mrs John Smith, for example\\".[25] Debrett's itself, concerning the case of a married woman who chooses not to take her husband's name, states, \\"The ugly-sounding Ms is problematic. Although many women have assumed this bland epithet, it remains incorrect to use it when addressing a social letter.\\"[26] The former British Conservative Party MP Ann Widdecombe has stated, \\"I can't see the point of Ms and I don't see it as an issue\\",[25] whilst author and journalist Jessica Fellowes describes the title Ms. as \\"ghastly\\".[26] The Queen's English Society has criticised the use of Ms as \\"an abbreviation that is not short for anything\\", describing it as a \\"linguistic misfit [that] came about because certain women suddenly became sensitive about revealing their marital status\\".[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, the default use of Ms., especially for business purposes, is championed by some American sources, including Judith Martin (a.k.a. Miss Manners).[28] Concerning business, the Emily Post Institute states, \\"Ms. is the default form of address, unless you know positively that a woman wishes to be addressed as Mrs.\\"[29] The American Heritage Book of English Usage states, \\"Using Ms. obviates the need for the guesswork involved in figuring out whether to address someone as Mrs. or Miss: you cant go wrong with Ms. Whether the woman you are addressing is married or unmarried, has changed her name or not, Ms. is always correct.\\"[30]","input":"When did the term ms come into use?"},{"output":"radial artery","context":"In medicine, a pulse represents the tactile arterial palpation of the heartbeat by trained fingertips. The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body, such as at the neck (carotid artery), on the inside of the elbow (brachial artery), at the wrist (radial artery), at the groin (femoral artery), behind the knee (popliteal artery), near the ankle joint (posterior tibial artery), and on foot (dorsalis pedis artery). Pulse (or the count of arterial pulse per minute) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate. The heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat by auscultation, traditionally using a stethoscope and counting it for a minute. The radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers. This has a reason: the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure, the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure, and the finger most distal to the heart (usually the ring finger) is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches (superficial and deep). The study of the pulse is known as sphygmology.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pulse is a decidedly low tech and high yield and antiquated term still useful at the bedside in an age of computational analysis of cardiac performance. Claudius Galen was perhaps the first physiologist to describe the pulse.[1] The pulse is an expedient tactile method of determination of systolic blood pressure to a trained observer. Diastolic blood pressure is non-palpable and unobservable by tactile methods, occurring between heartbeats.\\r\\nPressure waves generated by the heart in systole move the arterial walls. Forward movement of blood occurs when the boundaries are pliable and compliant. These properties form enough to create a palpable pressure wave.\\r\\n The heart rate may be greater or lesser than the pulse rate depending upon physiologic demand. In this case, the heart rate is determined by auscultation or audible sounds at the heart apex, in which case it is not the pulse. The pulse deficit (difference between heart beats and pulsations at the periphery) is determined by simultaneous palpation at the radial artery and auscultation at the PMI, near the heart apex. It may be present in case of premature beats or atrial fibrillation.\\r\\nPulse velocity, pulse deficits and much more physiologic data are readily and simplistically visualized by the use of one or more arterial catheters connected to a transducer and oscilloscope. This invasive technique has been commonly used in intensive care since the 1970s.\\r\\nThe rate of the pulse is observed and measured by tactile or visual means on the outside of an artery and is recorded as beats per minute or BPM.\\r\\nThe pulse may be further indirectly observed under light absorbances of varying wavelengths with assigned and inexpensively reproduced mathematical ratios.

Generally lower is better, but bradycardias can be dangerous. Symptoms of a dangerously slow heartbeat include weakness, loss of energy and fainting.[3]\\r\\nA normal pulse is regular in rhythm and force. An irregular pulse may be due to sinus arrhythmia, ectopic beats, atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, partial heart block etc. Intermittent dropping out of beats at pulse is called \\"intermittent pulse\\". Examples of regular intermittent (regularly irregular) pulse include pulsus bigeminus, second-degree atrioventricular block. An example of irregular intermittent (irregularly irregular) pulse is atrial fibrillation.\\r\\nThe degree of expansion displayed by artery during diastolic and systolic state is called volume. It is also known as amplitude, expansion or size of pulse.\\r\\nA weak pulse signifies narrow pulse pressure. It may be due to low cardiac output (as seen in shock, congestive cardiac failure), hypovolemia, valvular heart disease (such as aortic outflow tract obstruction, mitral stenosis, aortic arch syndrome) etc.\\r\\nA bounding pulse signifies high pulse pressure. It may be due to low peripheral resistance (as seen in fever, anemia, thyrotoxicosis, hyperkinetic heart syndrome?(de), A-V fistula, Paget's disease, beriberi, liver cirrhosis), increased cardiac output, increased stroke volume (as seen in anxiety, exercise, complete heart block, aortic regurgitation), decreased distensibility of arterial system (as seen in atherosclerosis, hypertension and coarctation of aorta).\\r\\nThe strength of the pulse can also be reported:[4][5]\\r\\nAlso known as compressibility of pulse. It is a rough measure of systolic blood pressure.\\r\\nIt corresponds to diastolic blood pressure. A low tension pulse (pulsus mollis), the vessel is soft or impalpable between beats. In high tension pulse (pulsus durus), vessels feel rigid even between pulse beats.\\r\\nA form or contour of a pulse is palpatiory estimation of arteriogram. A quickly rising and quickly falling pulse (pulsus celer) is seen in aortic regurgitation. A slow rising and slowly falling pulse (pulsus tardus) is seen in aortic stenosis.\\r\\nComparing pulses and different places gives valuable clinical information.\\r\\nA discrepant or unequal pulse between left and right radial artery is observed in anomalous or aberrant course of artery, coarctation of aorta, aortitis, dissecting aneurysm, peripheral embolism etc. An unequal pulse between upper and lower extremities is seen in coarctation to aorta, aortitis, block at bifurcation of aorta, dissection of aorta, iatrogenic trauma and arteriosclerotic obstruction.\\r\\nA normal artery is not palpable after flattening by digital pressure. A thick radial artery which is palpable 7.5ÿ10?cm up the forearm is suggestive of arteriosclerosis.\\r\\nIn coarctation of aorta, femoral pulse may be significantly delayed as compared to radial pulse (unless there is coexisting aortic regurgitation).

As the main component of connective tissue, it is the most abundant protein in mammals,[1] making 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content. Collagen consists of amino acids wound together to form triple-helices to form of elongated fibrils.[2] It is mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendons, ligaments and skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending upon the degree of mineralization, collagen tissues may be either rigid (bone) or compliant (tendon) or have a gradient from rigid to compliant (cartilage). It is also abundant in corneas, blood vessels, the gut, intervertebral discs, and the dentin in teeth.[3] In muscle tissue, it serves as a major component of the endomysium. Collagen constitutes one to two percent of muscle tissue and accounts for 6% of the weight of strong, tendinous muscles.[4] The fibroblast is the most common cell that creates collagen. Gelatin, which is used in food and industry, is collagen that has been irreversibly hydrolyzed.[5] Collagen also has many medical uses in treating complications of the bones and skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name collagen comes from the Greek ?ϫ (k܇lla), meaning \\"glue\\", and suffix -?, -gen, denoting \\"producing\\".[6][7] This refers to the compound's early use in the process of boiling the skin and tendons of horses and other animals to obtain glue.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollagen occurs in many places throughout the body. Over 90% of the collagen in the human body, however, is type I.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far, 28 types of collagen have been identified and described. They can be divided into several groups according to the structure they form:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe five most common types are:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe collagenous cardiac skeleton which includes the four heart valve rings, is histologically, elastically and uniquely bound to cardiac muscle. The cardiac skeleton also includes the separating septa of the heart chambers ÿ the interventricular septum and the atrioventricular septum. Collagen contribution to the measure of cardiac performance summarily represents a continuous torsional force opposed to the fluid mechanics of blood pressure emitted from the heart. The collagenous structure that divides the upper chambers of the heart from the lower chambers is an impermeable membrane that excludes both blood and electrical impulses through typical physiological means. With support from collagen, atrial fibrillation should never deteriorate to ventricular fibrillation. Collagen is layered in variable densities with cardiac muscle mass. The mass, distribution, age and density of collagen all contribute to the compliance required to move blood back and forth. Individual cardiac valvular leaflets are folded into shape by specialized collagen under variable pressure. Gradual calcium deposition within collagen occurs as a natural function of aging. Calcified points within collagen matrices show contrast in a moving display of blood and muscle, enabling methods of cardiac imaging technology to arrive at ratios essentially stating blood in (cardiac input) and blood out (cardiac output). Pathology of the collagen underpinning of the heart is understood within the category of connective tissue disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollagen has been widely used in cosmetic surgery, as a healing aid for burn patients for reconstruction of bone and a wide variety of dental, orthopedic, and surgical purposes. Both human and bovine collagen is widely used as dermal fillers for treatment of wrinkles and skin aging.[9] Some points of interest are:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the skeleton forms the structure of the body, it is vital that it maintains its strength, even after breaks and injuries. Collagen is used in bone grafting as it has a triple helical structure, making it a very strong molecule. It is ideal for use in bones, as it does not compromise the structural integrity of the skeleton. The triple helical structure of collagen prevents it from being broken down by enzymes, it enables adhesiveness of cells and it is important for the proper assembly of the extracellular matrix.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nCollagen scaffolds are used in tissue regeneration, whether in sponges, thin sheets, or gels. Collagen has the correct properties for tissue regeneration such as pore structure, permeability, hydrophilicity, and being stable in vivo. Collagen scaffolds are also ideal for the deposition of cells such as osteoblasts and fibroblasts, and once inserted, growth is able to continue as normal in the tissue.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nCollagens are widely employed in the construction of the artificial skin substitutes used in the management of severe burns and wounds.[12][13] These collagens may be derived from bovine, equine, porcine, or even human sources; and are sometimes used in combination with silicones, glycosaminoglycans, fibroblasts, growth factors and other substances.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollagen is one of the bodys key natural resources and a component of skin tissue that can benefit all stages of the wound healing process.[14] When collagen is made available to the wound bed, closure can occur. Wound deterioration, followed sometimes by procedures such as amputation, can thus be avoided.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollagen is a natural product and is thus used as a natural wound dressing and has properties that artificial wound dressings do not have. It is resistant against bacteria, which is of vital importance in a wound dressing. It helps to keep the wound sterile, because of its natural ability to fight infection. When collagen is used as a burn dressing, healthy granulation tissue is able to form very quickly over the burn, helping it to heal rapidly.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the 4 phases of wound healing, collagen performs the following functions in wound healing:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen hydrolyzed, collagen is reduced to small peptides, which can be ingested in the form of dietary supplement or functional foods and beverages with the intent to aid joint and bone health and enhance skin health.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22] Hydrolyzed collagen has a much smaller molecular weight in comparison to native collagen or gelatin, study suggests that more than 90% of hydrolyzed collagen is digested and available as small peptides in the blood stream within one hour. From the blood, the peptides (containing hydroxyproline) are transported into the target tissues (e.g., skin, bones, and cartilage), where the peptides act as building blocks for local cells and help boost the production of new collagen fibers.[23][24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nCollagen is used in laboratory studies for cell culture, studying cell behavior and cellular interactions with the extracellular environment.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome studies have shown efficacy of collagen supplementation for dogs with osteoarthritis pain, alone or in combination with other nutraceuticals like glucosamine and chondroitin.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe collagen protein is composed of a triple helix, which generally consists of two identical chains (ϫ1) and an additional chain that differs slightly in its chemical composition (ϫ2).[29] The amino acid composition of collagen is atypical for proteins, particularly with respect to its high hydroxyproline content. The most common motifs in the amino acid sequence of collagen are glycine-proline-X and glycine-X-hydroxyproline, where X is any amino acid other than glycine, proline or hydroxyproline. The average amino acid composition for fish and mammal skin is given.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, a three-dimensional stranded structure is assembled, with the amino acids glycine and proline as its principal components. This is not yet collagen but its precursor, procollagen. Procollagen is then modified by the addition of hydroxyl groups to the amino acids proline and lysine. This step is important for later glycosylation and the formation of the triple helix structure of collagen. Because the hydroxylase enzymes that perform these reactions require vitamin C as a cofactor, a long-term deficiency in this vitamin results in impaired collagen synthesis and scurvy.[30] These hydroxylation reactions are catalyzed by two different enzymes: prolyl-4-hydroxylase[31] and lysyl-hydroxylase. Vitamin C also serves with them in inducing these reactions. In this service, one molecule of vitamin C is destroyed for each H replaced by OH.\\r\\n[32]\\r\\nThe synthesis of collagen occurs inside and outside of the cell. The formation of collagen which results in fibrillary collagen (most common form) is discussed here. Meshwork collagen, which is often involved in the formation of filtration systems, is the other form of collagen. All types of collagens are triple helices, and the differences lie in the make-up of the alpha peptides created in step 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollagen has an unusual amino acid composition and sequence:\\r\\n\\r\\nCortisol stimulates degradation of (skin) collagen into amino acids.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost collagen forms in a similar manner, but the following process is typical for type I:\\r\\n\\r\\nVitamin C deficiency causes scurvy, a serious and painful disease in which defective collagen prevents the formation of strong connective tissue. Gums deteriorate and bleed, with loss of teeth; skin discolors, and wounds do not heal. Prior to the 18th century, this condition was notorious among long-duration military, particularly naval, expeditions during which participants were deprived of foods containing vitamin C.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn autoimmune disease such as lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis[34] may attack healthy collagen fibers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany bacteria and viruses secrete virulence factors, such as the enzyme collagenase, which destroys collagen or interferes with its production.\\r\\n\\r\\nA single collagen molecule, tropocollagen, is used to make up larger collagen aggregates, such as fibrils. It is approximately 300?nm long and 1.5?nm in diameter, and it is made up of three polypeptide strands (called alpha peptides, see step 2), each of which has the conformation of a left-handed helix ÿ this should not be confused with the right-handed alpha helix. These three left-handed helices are twisted together into a right-handed triple helix or \\"super helix\\", a cooperative quaternary structure stabilized by many hydrogen bonds. With type I collagen and possibly all fibrillar collagens, if not all collagens, each triple-helix associates into a right-handed super-super-coil referred to as the collagen microfibril. Each microfibril is interdigitated with its neighboring microfibrils to a degree that might suggest they are individually unstable, although within collagen fibrils, they are so well ordered as to be crystalline.\\r\\n\\r\\nA distinctive feature of collagen is the regular arrangement of amino acids in each of the three chains of these collagen subunits. The sequence often follows the pattern Gly-Pro-X or Gly-X-Hyp, where X may be any of various other amino acid residues.[29] Proline or hydroxyproline constitute about 1/6 of the total sequence. With glycine accounting for the 1/3 of the sequence, this means approximately half of the collagen sequence is not glycine, proline or hydroxyproline, a fact often missed due to the distraction of the unusual GX1X2 character of collagen alpha-peptides. The high glycine content of collagen is important with respect to stabilization of the collagen helix as this allows the very close association of the collagen fibers within the molecule, facilitating hydrogen bonding and the formation of intermolecular cross-links.[29] This kind of regular repetition and high glycine content is found in only a few other fibrous proteins, such as silk fibroin.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollagen is not only a structural protein. Due to its key role in the determination of cell phenotype, cell adhesion, tissue regulation, and infrastructure, many sections of its non-proline-rich regions have cell or matrix association/regulation roles. The relatively high content of proline and hydroxyproline rings, with their geometrically constrained carboxyl and (secondary) amino groups, along with the rich abundance of glycine, accounts for the tendency of the individual polypeptide strands to form left-handed helices spontaneously, without any intrachain hydrogen bonding.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause glycine is the smallest amino acid with no side chain, it plays a unique role in fibrous structural proteins. In collagen, Gly is required at every third position because the assembly of the triple helix puts this residue at the interior (axis) of the helix, where there is no space for a larger side group than glycines single hydrogen atom. For the same reason, the rings of the Pro and Hyp must point outward. These two amino acids help stabilize the triple helixHyp even more so than Pro; a lower concentration of them is required in animals such as fish, whose body temperatures are lower than most warm-blooded animals. Lower proline and hydroxyproline contents are characteristic of cold-water, but not warm-water fish; the latter tend to have similar proline and hydroxyproline contents to mammals.[29] The lower proline and hydroxproline contents of cold-water fish and other poikilotherm animals leads to their collagen having a lower thermal stability than mammalian collagen.[29] This lower thermal stability means that gelatin derived from fish collagen is not suitable for many food and industrial applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tropocollagen subunits spontaneously self-assemble, with regularly staggered ends, into even larger arrays in the extracellular spaces of tissues.[35][36] Additional assembly of fibrils is guided by fibroblasts, which deposit fully formed fibrils from fibripositors. In the fibrillar collagens, molecules are staggered to adjacent molecules by about 67?nm (a unit that is referred to as D and changes depending upon the hydration state of the aggregate). In each D-period repeat of the microfibril, there is a part containing five molecules in cross-section, called the overlap, and a part containing only four molecules, called the \\"gap\\".[37] These overlap and gap regions are retained as microfibrils assemble into fibrils, and are thus viewable using electron microscopy. The triple helical tropocollagens in the microfibrils are arranged in a quasihexagonal packing pattern.[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is some covalent crosslinking within the triple helices, and a variable amount of covalent crosslinking between tropocollagen helices forming well organized aggregates (such as fibrils).[39] Larger fibrillar bundles are formed with the aid of several different classes of proteins (including different collagen types), glycoproteins, and proteoglycans to form the different types of mature tissues from alternate combinations of the same key players.[36] Collagen's insolubility was a barrier to the study of monomeric collagen until it was found that tropocollagen from young animals can be extracted because it is not yet fully crosslinked. However, advances in microscopy techniques (i.e. electron microscopy (EM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)) and X-ray diffraction have enabled researchers to obtain increasingly detailed images of collagen structure in situ. These later advances are particularly important to better understanding the way in which collagen structure affects cellÿcell and cellÿmatrix communication and how tissues are constructed in growth and repair and changed in development and disease.[40][41] For example, using AFMÿbased nanoindentation it has been shown that a single collagen fibril is a heterogeneous material along its axial direction with significantly different mechanical properties in its gap and overlap regions, correlating with its different molecular organizations in these two regions.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nCollagen fibrils/aggregates are arranged in different combinations and concentrations in various tissues to provide varying tissue properties. In bone, entire collagen triple helices lie in a parallel, staggered array. 40?nm gaps between the ends of the tropocollagen subunits (approximately equal to the gap region) probably serve as nucleation sites for the deposition of long, hard, fine crystals of the mineral component, which is hydroxylapatite (approximately) Ca10(OH)2(PO4)6.[43] Type I collagen gives bone its tensile strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollagen-related diseases most commonly arise from genetic defects or nutritional deficiencies that affect the biosynthesis, assembly, postranslational modification, secretion, or other processes involved in normal collagen production.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the above-mentioned disorders, excessive deposition of collagen occurs in scleroderma.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thousand mutations have been identified in 12 out of more than 20 types of collagen. These mutations can lead to various diseases at the tissue level.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nOsteogenesis imperfecta ÿ Caused by a mutation in type 1 collagen, dominant autosomal disorder, results in weak bones and irregular connective tissue, some cases can be mild while others can be lethal. Mild cases have lowered levels of collagen type 1 while severe cases have structural defects in collagen.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nChondrodysplasias ÿ Skeletal disorder believed to be caused by a mutation in type 2 collagen, further research is being conducted to confirm this.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nEhlers-Danlos syndrome ÿ Six different types of this disorder, which lead to deformities in connective tissue, are known. Some types can be lethal, leading to the rupture of arteries. Each syndrome is caused by a different mutation, for example type four of this disorder is caused by a mutation in collagen type 3.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlport syndrome ÿ Can be passed on genetically, usually as X-linked dominant, but also as both an autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive disorder, sufferers have problems with their kidneys and eyes, loss of hearing can also develop in during the childhood or adolescent years.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nOsteoporosis ÿ Not inherited genetically, brought on with age, associated with reduced levels of collagen in the skin and bones, growth hormone injections are being researched as a possible treatment to counteract any loss of collagen.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nKnobloch syndrome ÿ Caused by a mutation in the COL18A1 gene that codes for the production of collagen XVIII. Patients present with protrusion of the brain tissue and degeneration of the retina; an individual who has family members suffering from the disorder is at an increased risk of developing it themselves since there is a hereditary link.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nCollagen is one of the long, fibrous structural proteins whose functions are quite different from those of globular proteins, such as enzymes. Tough bundles of collagen called collagen fibers are a major component of the extracellular matrix that supports most tissues and gives cells structure from the outside, but collagen is also found inside certain cells. Collagen has great tensile strength, and is the main component of fascia, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, bone and skin.[52][53] Along with elastin and soft keratin, it is responsible for skin strength and elasticity, and its degradation leads to wrinkles that accompany aging.[9] It strengthens blood vessels and plays a role in tissue development. It is present in the cornea and lens of the eye in crystalline form. It may be one of the most abundant proteins in the fossil record, given that it appears to fossilize frequently, even in bones from the Mesozoic and Paleozoic.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nCollagen has a wide variety of applications, from food to medical. For instance, it is used in cosmetic surgery and burn surgery. It is widely used in the form of collagen casings for sausages, which are also used in the manufacture of musical strings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf collagen is subject to sufficient denaturation, e.g. by heating, the three tropocollagen strands separate partially or completely into globular domains, containing a different secondary structure to the normal collagen polyproline II (PPII), e.g. random coils. This process describes the formation of gelatin, which is used in many foods, including flavored gelatin desserts. Besides food, gelatin has been used in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and photography industries.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the Greek for glue, kolla, the word collagen means \\"glue producer\\" and refers to the early process of boiling the skin and sinews of horses and other animals to obtain glue. Collagen adhesive was used by Egyptians about 4,000 years ago, and Native Americans used it in bows about 1,500 years ago. The oldest glue in the world, carbon-dated as more than 8,000 years old, was found to be collagenused as a protective lining on rope baskets and embroidered fabrics, and to hold utensils together; also in crisscross decorations on human skulls.[55] Collagen normally converts to gelatin, but survived due to dry conditions. Animal glues are thermoplastic, softening again upon reheating, so they are still used in making musical instruments such as fine violins and guitars, which may have to be reopened for repairsan application incompatible with tough, synthetic plastic adhesives, which are permanent. Animal sinews and skins, including leather, have been used to make useful articles for millennia.\\r\\n\\r\\nGelatin-resorcinol-formaldehyde glue (and with formaldehyde replaced by less-toxic pentanedial and ethanedial) has been used to repair experimental incisions in rabbit lungs.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe molecular and packing structures of collagen have eluded scientists over decades of research. The first evidence that it possesses a regular structure at the molecular level was presented in the mid-1930s.[57][58] Since that time, many prominent scholars, including Nobel laureates Crick, Pauling, Rich and Yonath, and others, including Brodsky, Berman, and Ramachandran, concentrated on the conformation of the collagen monomer. Several competing models, although correctly dealing with the conformation of each individual peptide chain, gave way to the triple-helical \\"Madras\\" model of Ramachandran, which provided an essentially correct model of the molecule's quaternary structure[59][60][61] although this model still required some refinement.[62][clarification needed] [63][64][65][66] The packing structure of collagen has not been defined to the same degree outside of the fibrillar collagen types, although it has been long known to be hexagonal or quasi-hexagonal.[38][67][68] As with its monomeric structure, several conflicting models alleged that either the packing arrangement of collagen molecules is 'sheet-like' or microfibrillar.[62][69][70] The microfibrillar structure of collagen fibrils in tendon, cornea and cartilage has been directly imaged by electron microscopy.[71][72][73] The microfibrillar structure of tail tendon, as described by Fraser, Miller, and Wess (amongst others), was modeled as being closest to the observed structure,[62] although it oversimplified the topological progression of neighboring collagen molecules, and hence did not predict the correct conformation of the discontinuous D-periodic pentameric arrangement termed simply: the microfibril.[37][74][75] Various cross linking agents like L-Dopaquinone, embeline, potassium embelate and 5-O-methyl embelin could be developed as potential\\r\\ncross-linking/stabilization agents of collagen preparation and its application as wound dressing sheet in clinical applications is enhanced.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evolution of collagens was a fundamental step in the early evolution of life, supporting the coalescence of multicellular life forms.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nCollagen D-banding is viable as periodic formation of ridging on all fibrils forming collagen.[78]  D-bands are created due to the semi-crystalline formation of the collagen within the fibrils.  The pattern exhibited by D-banding is consistently independent of fibril diameter.[79]  When undergoing deformation, collagen fibrils may lose their D-banding, making the disappearance of the d-bands an indicator of the type of damage undergone by then tendon fibrils.","input":"Where are collagen fibers found in the body?"},{"output":"The Battle of Gonzales","context":"The Battle of Gonzales was the first military engagement of the Texas Revolution. It was fought near Gonzales, Texas, on October 2, 1835, between rebellious Texian settlers and a detachment of Mexican army soldiers .\\r\\nIn 1831, Mexican authorities gave the settlers of Gonzales a small cannon to help protect them from frequent Comanche raids. Over the next four years, the political situation in Mexico deteriorated, and in 1835 several states revolted. As the unrest spread, Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea, the commander of all Mexican troops in Texas, felt it unwise to leave the residents of Gonzales with a weapon and requested the return of the cannon.\\r\\nWhen the initial request was refused, Ugartechea sent 100?dragoons to retrieve the cannon. The soldiers neared Gonzales on September 29, but the colonists used a variety of excuses to keep them from the town, while secretly sending messengers to request assistance from nearby communities. Within two days, up to 140 Texians gathered in Gonzales, all determined not to give up the cannon. On October 1, settlers voted to initiate a fight. Mexican soldiers opened fire as Texians approached their camp in the early hours of October 2. After several hours of desultory firing, the Mexican soldiers withdrew.[1]\\r\\nAlthough the skirmish had little military significance, it marked a clear break between the colonists and the Mexican government and is considered to have been the start of the Texas Revolution. News of the skirmish spread throughout the United States, where it was often referred to as the \\"Lexington of Texas\\". The cannon's fate is disputed. It may have been buried and rediscovered in 1936, or it may have been seized by Mexican troops after the Battle of the Alamo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mexican Constitution of 1824 liberalized the country's immigration policies, allowing foreigners to settle in border regions such as Mexican Texas. In 1825, American Green DeWitt received permission to settle 400?families in Texas near the confluence of the San Marcos and Guadalupe Rivers.[3] The DeWitt Colony quickly became a favorite raiding target of local Karankawa, Tonkawa, and Comanche tribes, and in July 1826 they destroyed the capital city, Gonzales. The town was rebuilt the following year, after DeWitt negotiated peace treaties with the Karankawa and Tonkawa. The Comanche continued to stage periodic raids of the settlement over the next few years.[4] Unable to spare military troops to protect the town, in 1831 the region's political chief instead sent the settlers of Gonzales a six-pounder cannon,[5] described by historian Timothy Todish as \\"a small bored gun, good for little more than starting horse races\\".[6]\\r\\nDuring the 1830s, the Mexican government wavered between federalist and centralist policies. As the pendulum swung sharply towards centralism in 1835, several Mexican states revolted.[7] In June, a small group of settlers in Texas used the political unrest as an excuse to rebel against customs duties, in an incident known as the Anahuac Disturbances.[8] The federal government responded by sending more troops to Texas.[9] Public opinion was sharply divided. Some communities supported the rebellion for a variety of reasons. Others, including Gonzales, declared their loyalty to Mexican President Antonio L܇pez de Santa Anna's centralist government.[10] Local leaders began calling for a Consultation to determine whether a majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering as a step toward revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15.[11] In the interim, many communities formed militias to protect themselves from a potential attack by military forces.[9][12]\\r\\nOn September 10, a Mexican soldier bludgeoned a Gonzales resident, which led to widespread outrage and public protests.[13] Mexican authorities felt it unwise to leave the settlers with a weapon.[14] Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea, commander of all Mexican troops in Texas, sent a corporal and five enlisted men to retrieve the cannon that had been given to the colonists.[13][14] Many of the settlers believed Mexican authorities were manufacturing an excuse to attack the town and eliminate the militia. In a town meeting, three citizens voted to hand over the gun to forestall an attack; the remainder, including alcalde Andrew Ponton, voted to stand their ground.[15] According to historian Stephen Hardin, \\"the cannon became a point of honor and an unlikely rallying symbol. Gonzales citizens had no intention of handing over the weapon at a time of growing tension.\\"[13] The soldiers were escorted from town without the cannon.[13]\\r\\nPonton anticipated that Ugartechea would send more troops to force the handover of the cannon. As soon as the first group of soldiers left Gonzales, Ponton sent a messenger to the closest town, Mina, to request help.[16] Word quickly spread that up to 300 soldiers were expected to march on Gonzales. Stephen F. Austin, one of the most respected men in Texas and the de facto leader of the settlers, sent messengers to inform surrounding communities of the situation. Austin cautioned Texians to remain on the defensive, as any unprovoked attacks against Mexican forces could limit the support Texians might receive from the United States if war officially began.[16]\\r\\nOn September 27, 1835, a detachment of 100 dragoons, led by Francisco de Casta?eda, left San Antonio de Bxar, carrying an official order for Ponton to surrender the cannon.[13][16] Casta?eda had been instructed to avoid using force if possible.[13] When the troops neared Gonzales on September 29, they found that the settlers had removed the ferry and all other boats from the Guadalupe River. On the other side of the swiftly moving river waited eighteen Texians. Albert Martin, captain of the Gonzales militia, informed the soldiers that Ponton was out of town, and until his return the army must remain on the west side of the river.[13][17]\\r\\nWith no easy way to cross the river, Casta?eda and his men made camp at the highest ground in the area, about 300 yards (300 meters) from the river. Three Texians hurried to bury the cannon, while others traveled to nearby communities to ask for assistance.[18] By the end of the day, more than 80 men had arrived from Fayette and Columbus.[19] Texian militias generally elected their own leaders, and the men now gathered in Gonzales invoked their right to choose their own captain rather than report to Martin. John Henry Moore of Fayette was elected leader, with Joseph Washington Elliot Wallace and Edward Burleson, both of Columbus, respectively elected second and third in command.[18]\\r\\nOn September 30, Casta?eda reiterated his request for the cannon and was again rebuffed. Texians insisted on discussing the matter directly with Ugartechea. According to their spokesman, until this was possible \\"the only answer I can therefore give you is that I cannot now [and] will not deliver to you the cannon\\".[20] Casta?eda reported to Ugartechea that the Texians were stalling, likely to give reinforcements time to gather.[21]\\r\\nIn San Antonio de Bxar, Ugartechea asked Dr. Launcelot Smither, a Gonzales resident in town on personal business, to help Casta?eda convince the settlers to follow orders.[18] When Smither arrived on October 1, he met with militia captain Mathew Caldwell to explain that the soldiers meant no harm if the settlers would peacefully relinquish the cannon. Caldwell instructed Smither to bring Casta?eda to the town the following morning to discuss the matter. At roughly the same time, Moore called a war council, which quickly voted to initiate a fight. It is unclear whether the war council was aware that Caldwell had promised Casta?eda safe passage to Gonzales the next morning.[22]\\r\\nTexians dug up the cannon and mounted it on cart wheels. In the absence of cannonballs, they gathered metal scraps to fill the cannon.[22] James C. Neill, who had served in an artillery company during the War of 1812, was given command of the cannon. He gathered several men, including Almaron Dickinson, also a former US Army field artilleryman, together to form the first artillery company of Texians.[23] A local Methodist minister, W. P. Smith, blessed their activities in a sermon which made frequent reference to the American Revolution.[22]\\r\\nAs the Texians made plans for an attack, Casta?eda learned from a Coushatta Indian that about 140?men were gathered in Gonzales, with more expected. The Mexican soldiers began searching for a safe place to cross the river. At nightfall on October 1 they stopped to make camp, 7 miles (11?km) upriver from their previous spot.[24]\\r\\nTexians began crossing the river at about 7?pm. Less than half of the men were mounted, slowing their progress as they tracked the Mexican soldiers. A thick fog rolled in around midnight, further delaying them. At around 3 am, Texians reached the new Mexican camp. A dog barked at their approach, alerting the Mexican soldiers, who began to fire. The noise caused one of the Texian horses to panic and throw his rider, who suffered a bloody nose.[24] Moore and his men hid in the thick trees until dawn. As they waited, some of the Texians raided a nearby field and snacked on watermelon.[25]\\r\\nWith the darkness and fog, Mexican soldiers could not estimate how many men had surrounded them. They withdrew 300 yards (meters) to a nearby bluff. At about 6?am, Texians emerged from the trees and began firing at the Mexican soldiers. Lieutenant Gregorio Prez counterattacked with 40 mounted soldiers. The Texians fell back to the trees and fired a volley, injuring a Mexican private. According to some accounts, the cannon fell out of the wagon upon the shot. Unable to safely maneuver among the trees, the Mexican horsemen returned to the bluff.[25]\\r\\nAs the fog lifted, Casta?eda sent Smither to request a meeting between the two commanders. Smither was promptly arrested by the Texians, who were suspicious of his presence among the Mexican soldiers.[25] Nevertheless, Moore agreed to meet Casta?eda. Moore explained that his followers no longer recognized the centralist government of Santa Anna and instead remained faithful to the Constitution of 1824, which Santa Anna had repudiated. Casta?eda revealed that he shared their federalist leanings, but that he was honor-bound to follow orders.[1]\\r\\nAs Moore returned to camp, the Texians raised a homemade white banner with an image of the cannon painted in black in the center, over the words \\"Come and Take It\\".[1] The makeshift flag evoked the American Revolutionary-era slogan \\"Don't Tread on Me\\".[26] Texians then fired their cannon at the Mexican camp. Realizing that he was outnumbered and outgunned, Casta?eda led his troops back to San Antonio de Bxar. The troops were gone before the Texians finished reloading.

Austin[27]\\r\\nTwo Mexican soldiers were killed in the attack. The only Texian casualty was the bloody nose suffered by the man bucked off his horse. Although the event was, as characterized by Davis, \\"an inconsequential skirmish in which one side did not try to fight\\", Texians soon declared it a victory over Mexican troops.[26] Despite its minimal military impact, Hardin asserts that the skirmish's \\"political significance was immeasurable\\".[28] A large number of Texians had taken an armed stand against the Mexican army, and they had no intention of returning to their neutral stance towards Santa Anna's government.[28] Two days after the battle, Austin wrote to the San Felipe de Austin Committee of Public Safety, \\"War is declaredpublic opinion has proclaimed it against a Military despotismThe campaign has commenced\\".[29] News of the skirmish, originally called \\"the fight at Williams' place\\",[1] spread throughout the United States, encouraging many adventurers to come to Texas and assist in the fight against Mexico.[28] Newspapers referred to the conflict as the \\"Lexington of Texas\\"; as the Battles of Lexington and Concord began the American Revolution, the Gonzales skirmish launched the Texas Revolution.[1]\\r\\nBefore fighting had officially erupted, Santa Anna had realized that stronger measures were needed to ensure calm in Texas. He ordered his brother-in-law, General Martn Perfecto de Cos to bring approximately 500?soldiers to Texas.[8] Cos and his men arrived in Goliad on October 2. Three days later, after learning of the events at Gonzales, the soldiers left for San Antonio de Bxar.[30]\\r\\nGonzales became a rallying point for Texians opposed to Santa Anna's policies.[6] On October 11, they unanimously elected Austin their commander, despite his lack of military training. The following day, Austin led the men on a march towards San Antonio de Bxar to lay siege to Cos's troops.[31][32] By the end of the year, the Texians had driven all Mexican troops from Texas.[33]\\r\\nThe cannon's fate is disputed. According to the memoirs (written in the 1890s) of Gonzales blacksmith Noah Smithwick, the cannon was abandoned after the cart's axles began to smoke during a march to San Antonio de Bxar to assist in Austin's siege. Smithwick reported that the cannon was buried near a creek not far from Gonzales. A small iron cannon was exposed during a June 1936 flood near Gonzales. In 1979, this cannon was purchased by Dr. Patrick Wagner, who believed it matched Smithwick's descriptions of the cannon used in the battle. The Curator of Military History at the Smithsonian Institution verified that Wagner's cannon was a type of small swivel gun used in America through 1836. The Conservation Laboratory at the University of Texas confirmed that Wagner's cannon had been buried in moist ground for an extended time period.[34]\\r\\nWriting in the Handbook of Texas, historian Thomas Ricks Lindley maintains that the Wagner cannon does not match the Smithwick account. The Wagner gun is made of iron and is smaller than a six-pounder. Historians such as Lindley think it more likely that the Gonzales cannon was taken to San Antonio de Bxar, where it was used during the Battle of the Alamo and captured by Mexican troops in March 1836. It was likely melted down with many of the other cannons when the Mexican army retreated.[35]\\r\\nThe battle is re-enacted during the Come and Take It celebration[36] in Gonzales every October. In and around Gonzales are nine Texas historical markers which commemorate various locations used in the prelude to the battle.[37]\\r\\nCoordinates: 293032N 972652W? / ?29.5089N 97.4478W? / 29.5089; -97.4478","input":"What was the first battle of the texas revolution?"},{"output":"The Alaska Federation of Natives","context":"The Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN) is the largest statewide Native organization in Alaska.

The mission of AFN is to enhance and promote the cultural, economic and political voice of the entire Alaska native community.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Alaska Federation of Natives was formed in October 1966, when more than 400 Alaska Natives representing 17 Native organizations gathered for a three-day conference to address Alaska Native aboriginal land rights. The 1968 discovery of oil prompted Native leaders to push for a land claims settlement with unprecedented urgency.[4] It was officially incorporated on January 8, 1970.[5] From 1966 to 1971, AFN worked primarily to achieve passage of a just and fair land settlement. On December 18, 1971, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) was signed into law.\\r\\nIn the early- and mid-1970s, AFN provided technical assistance to help Alaska Natives implement ANCSA and set up the corporations mandated by the Act. Since then, AFN has evolved to meet the changing needs of Alaska Natives and respond to new challenges as they emerge, working to address and protect Native interests at the state and federal levels.\\r\\nAFN was instrumental in the development and passage of federal laws including the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, and the 1987 Amendments to ANCSA (the \\"1991 legislation\\").\\r\\nAt the state level, AFN plays an active role in the legislative process, promoting laws, policies and programs in areas such as health, education, resource development, labor and government.\\r\\nIn the late 1980s, AFN turned its attention to social, tribal and economic issues.[6]\\r\\nAlaska Native people began as members of full sovereign nations and continue to enjoy a unique political relationship with the federal government.

During the convention, the entire state of Alaska is blanketed with discussion on current events and issues. International observers are present at most meetings, both exchanging information and learning from the Alaska Native experience. Each year the convention adopts a theme.\\r\\nTheir traditional dances remain the lifeblood of their culture and their communities: they sustain them and connect them with their rich cultural history. Passed from generation to generation, their dances ensure that the many distinct Native cultures across Alaska remain connected to their origins.\\r\\nFor over 20 years, Alaska Natives have come together in dance to celebrate Quyana Alaska during AFNs Annual Convention. First introduced at the 1982 Convention, Quyana Alaska was designed to restore the traditional dances and ensure that they were passed on to the future generations.

New coins have been produced annually since then and they make up a valuable aspect of the Indian currency system. Today, circulating coins exist in denominations of 50 p (i.e. 50 paisa or ?0.50), ?1, ?2, ?5, and ?10. All of these are produced by four mints located across India, in Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Noida.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Indian independence, British Indian coins were in use as a frozen currency until India became a republic in 1950. The first rupee coins of the Republic of India were minted in 1950. These included 1/2 rupee, 1/4 rupee, 2 anna, 1 anna, 1/2 anna & 1 pice coins, and are referred to as the anna series or pre-decimal coinage. Under the anna series, one rupee was divided into 16 annas or 64 pice, with each anna equal to 4 pice.\\r\\nIn 1957, India shifted to the decimal system, though for a short period of time, both decimal and non-decimal coins were in circulation. To distinguish between the two pice coins in circulation, the coins minted between 1957 and 1964 were printed with the legend Naya Paisa (New Paisa). The denominations in circulation were 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50 (naya) paisa and one rupee. Since rupees retained their pre-decimal value, pre-decimal coins of one, half and quarter rupees remained in circulation after decimalisation.\\r\\nThe word \\"naya\\" was dropped in 1964 and a new denomination, the 3 paisa, was introduced into circulation. A 20 paisa coin was minted in 1968. Neither of these coins gained much popularity. The 1, 2 and 3 paisa coins were phased out gradually in the 1970s. In 1982, a new 2 rupee coin was introduced experimentally to replace 2 rupee notes. The 2 rupee coin was not minted again till 1990, after which it was minted every following year.\\r\\nStainless steel coinage of 10, 25 and 50 paisa was introduced in 1988. In 1992, a new stainless steel rupee coin, smaller and lighter than the older rupee, was minted, alongside a 5 rupee Cupronickel coin.\\r\\nIn 2005, the 10 rupee coin was minted for the first time. Higher denomination coins were introduced due to an increasing demand for change and the increasing cost of printing 2, 5 and 10 rupee banknotes.\\r\\nOn 30 June 2011, all coins in denominations of 25 paisa and below were officially demonetised. Commemorative coins in circulation can be found in various denominations. They depict various special events or people, including Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, B. R. Ambedkar, Rajiv Gandhi, Dnyaneshwar, the 1982 Asian Games, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Subhas Chandra Bose, Sri Aurobindo, Chittaranjan Das, Chhatrapati Shivaji, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Bhagat Singh and Rabindranath Tagore.\\r\\nAt Independence on 15 August 1947, India was partitioned into the new British Dominions of India and Pakistan. The new Dominion (or Union) of India retained the previous imperial currency with images of British monarchs. The basic unit of currency was the Indian rupee, which was itself divided into annas (16 annas to a rupee) and pice (the old spelling of paisa - 64 pice to a rupee).[1] The lowest-denomination Indian coins, the half-pice (128 to a rupee) and the pie (192 to a rupee) were officially demonetized in 1947; while both denominations had continued to circulate up to that time, new examples were not minted after 1942 as they were practically worthless (India remained a member of the sterling area after independence and the rupee remained pegged to the pound sterling. Until 1966, the rupee was worth 1s.6d, or 18 old British pence; a half-pice was therefore worth 0.141 old pence and a pie 0.09 old pence.)[2]\\r\\nFrom 15 August 1947 until 26 January 1950, the Indian coinage structure was as follows: (bold - denominations minted)[3]\\r\\nThis represented the currency arrangements during the transition period up to the establishment of the Indian Republic.\\r\\nThe coins used after 1947 until the introduction of Republic of India - Pre decimalisation series were as follows:\\r\\nOn 26 January 1950, India became a sovereign republic. This series was introduced on 15 August 1950 and represented the first coinage of Republic India. The British King's portrait was replaced by the Lion Capital of the Ashoka Pillar. A corn sheaf replaced the Tiger on the one rupee coin. In some ways this symbolised a shift in focus to progress and prosperity. Indian motifs were incorporated on other coins. The previous monetary system and the old units of currency were retained unchanged.\\r\\nThe move towards decimalization was afoot for over a century. However, it was in September, 1955 that the Indian Coinage Act was amended for the country to adopt a metric system for coinage. The Act came into force with effect from 1 April 1957, after which anna and pice denominations were demonetised. The rupee remained unchanged in value and nomenclature. It, however, was now divided into 100 'paisa' instead of 16 annas or 64 pice. Effective from 30 June 2011, all coins in denominations of 25 paisa and below were officially demonetized.[4]\\r\\nThe antiquated spelling of \\"pice\\" was modified to \\"paisa\\" in the singular and \\"paise\\" in the plural. For public recognition, the new decimal paisa was termed 'Naya Paisa' (New Paisa) till 1 June 1964 when the term 'Naya' was dropped. The coins of 50p, 25p, 10p, 5p, 2p, and 1p had a legend in Devanagari script explaining the value of coin in terms of fraction of a rupee.\\r\\nIn June 1964, the term 'Naya' was dropped and the coins were reminted. The legend in Devanagari script explaining the value of coin in terms of fraction of a Rupee continued till it was finally dropped from the new design minted 1964 onwards.\\r\\nThe coin minted from 1965 did not have the legend in Devanagari, explaining the value of the coin as a fraction of the rupee. Small denomination coins which were made of bronze, nickel-brass, cupro-nickel, and aluminium-bronze were gradually minted in aluminium.The first coin minted in such type was the 3 Paisa coin in 1964, which was a new denomination, and continued to be minted till 1971. One and Two paisa coins were changed to Aluminium and were minted without the Devanagari legend from 1965. 20 paisa coin was introduced in 1968, which continued to be minted till 1971.\\r\\nFrom 1982, New series was launched. the 20 paisa coin which was last minted in 1971, was reintroduced again, but in Aluminium. The size and the design of 10 paisa, 50 paisa and 1 rupee was changed, though they continued to be minted in the same metal. Coins of 3p, 2p and 1p were discontinued but continued to be the legal tender.\\r\\nIn Series IV, 5 paisa and 20 paisa coins were discontinued though they continued to be minted in Series III till 1994 and 1997 respectively. 10 paisa, 25 paisa and 50 paisa coins were minted in Stainless Steel. 1992 onwards, 1 Re coin was also minted in Steel and Rs. 2 and Rs. 5 coins in Copper Nickel were introduced. The very considerable costs of managing note issues of Re 1, Rs 2, and Rs 5 led to the gradual coinage of these denominations. These coins continued to be minted till 2004, when the Unity in diversity series was launched.\\r\\nCupro-Nickel coins are not minted anymore. Ferritic Stainless Steel coins of Two and Five Rupee denominations are currently in production.[5]\\r\\nIn 2004, RBI issued a series in denominations of 1 rupee, followed by 2 rupee and 10 rupee in 2005. These issues however came into circulation in 2006, and created a controversy over their design. 10 rupee coins were the first bimetallic coins issued in India, and because of the controversy and being minted in only one mint, most of the coinage never found its way into circulation. The ones which did were hoarded by Coin collectors and Coin hoarders.\\r\\nCopper Nickel Center in\\r\\nAluminium Bronze ring\\r\\nin 2007 RBi issued a new series of Coins, The Hasta Mudra Series, in coins of denominations 50 p, 1 rupee and 2 rupee. These coins were Stainless steel coins, and displayed various Hasta Mudras, - hand gestures in Indian Classical dance. 5 rupee Stainless Steel coin with waves in its design was also issued in 2007, as well as a new 10 rupee coin with changed design in 2008. 5 rupee coin design was again reverted to the previous design, though now it was issued in Nickel-brass instead of Copper-nickel. However these 5 rupee and 10 rupee coins were not the part of the Hasta Mudra series.\\r\\nThe 5 rupee and 10 rupee coins were issued for common circulation in 2007, 2008, 2009 with changed designs and continued to be minted until the introduction of the Rupee Symbol series in 2011.\\r\\nCopper Nickel Center in Aluminium Bronze ring\\r\\nIn 2011, RBI issued a series in denominations of 50p, ?1, ?2, ?5, and ?10.

The coin has already been criticized for being difficult to recognize by the visually impaired.[6] Most controversially, it features an equal-armed cross with the beams divided into two rays and with dots between adjacent beams. According to RBI, this design represents \\"four heads sharing a common body\\" under a new \\"unity in diversity\\" theme.[7] However, Hindu nationalists have charged that the symbol is a Christian cross resembling the symbol on the deniers issued by Louis the Pious.[8]\\r\\nIndia's much awaited first ever bimetallic 10 rupee coin was released in 2005 under the theme \\"Unity in Diversity\\". But, due to its controversial design resembling a cross, it was criticised and was not minted in large numbers. Another reason for its availability being scarce is that it was minted only in one (Noida) of four mints in India. Coin dealers and the public who got this coin hoarded it and it never came into circulation. It is available for sale on some auction websites, but the price of this coin is very high in comparison to its denomination due to the uncertain number of issued coins. Some coin sellers claim that this coin is a limited edition. However, official information is not yet available on the number of mintage. A press release from Reserve Bank of India mentioned that there will be two themes of 10 rupee coins: \\"Unity in Diversity\\" and \\"Connectivity and Information technology\\". From 2008 coins based on the second theme, \\"Connectivity and Information technology\\", were also released. The coin depicts 15 rays above the numeric 10. It was again minted only by the Noida mint and was not easily available in circulation. From 2011, the same theme was continued with a slight design change showing 10 rays instead of the earlier 15 and the introduction of the new Re symbol. Now it is being minted in all four mints, which are Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Noida. Apart from these definitive coins, 10 rupee bi-metallic commemorative coins have also been released as follows: 2008 ÿ Tri Centenary of Gur-ta-Gaddi 2009 ÿ Homi Bhabha Birth Centenary 2010 ÿ RBI Platinum Jubilee 2012 ÿ 60 Years of Parliament's first sitting.","input":"When was the decimal system of currency introduced in india?"},{"output":"Esselen","context":"Mission San Carlos Borromeo del ro Carmelo, also known as the Carmel Mission or Mission Carmel, first built in 1797, is one of the most authentically restored Roman Catholic mission churchs in California. Located in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, it is on the National Register of Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark. The mission was the headquarters of all Alta California missions from 1797 until 1833. It was headed by Saint Junpero Serra from 1770 until his death in 1784. It was also the seat of the second presidente, Father Fermin Francisco de Lasuen, who was in charge of completing nine more mission churches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mission buildings and lands were secularized by the Mexican government in 1833. They fell into disrepair by the mid-19th century. The chapel was saved from total destruction when the roof was rebuilt in 1884.[13][14] In 1886, ownership of the mission was transferred from a group of Franciscans to the Diocese of Monterey. The mission has been a parish within that diocese ever since. Beginning in 1931, Harry Downie began restoring the mission and worked continuously on the project for the next 50 years. It is the only Spanish mission in California that has its original bell and bell tower.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nMission Carmel was the second mission built by Franciscan missionaries in Upper California. It was first established as Mission San Carlos Borromeo in Monterey, California near the native village of Tamo on June 3, 1770. It was named for Carlo Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, Italy, and was the site of the first Christian confirmation in Alta California.[5]  When the mission moved, the original building continued to operate as the Royal Presidio chapel and later became the current Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo.\\r\\n\\r\\nPedro Fages, who served as military governor of Alta California from 1770 to 1774, kept his headquarters in the polity's capitol, at the Presidio of Monterey. Fages worked his men very harshly and was seen as a tyrant. Serra intervened on behalf of Fages' soldiers, and the two men did not get along.[16][17] Fages regarded the Spanish installations in California as military institutions first, and religious outposts second. The soldiers raped the Indian woman and kept them as concubines.[16] Serra wanted to put some distance between the missions neophytes and Fages' soldiers. \\r\\n\\r\\nSerra found that the land near the mouth of the Carmel River (named Ro del Carmelo by Vizcano in 1603[18]) was better suited for farming.[19] In May 1771, Spain's viceroy approved Serra's petition to relocate the mission. The mission was established in the new location on August 1, 1771; the first mass was celebrated on August 24, and Serra officially took up residence in the newly constructed buildings on December 24.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name of the relocated mission was extended to Mission San Carlos Borromeo del Ro Carmelo. It was within a short distance of the Rumsen Ohlone villages of Tucutnut and Achasta. The latter village may have been founded after Mission San Carlos was relocated to Carmel. The mission was about 10 miles (16?km) from the nearest Esselen territory, Excelen.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Carmel mission was moved to Carmel Valley, the Franciscans began to baptize some natives.[22] By the end of 1771, the population of mission was 15 with an additional 22 baptized Indians, out of a total population of northern California of 60.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nFarming was not very productive and for several years the mission was dependent upon the arrival of supply ships.[19] Historian Jame Culleton wrote in 1950, \\"The summer of '73 came without bringing the supply ship. Neither Carmel nor Monterey was anything like self-supporting.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo improve baptismal rates, they sought to convert key members of the Esselen and Rumsen tribes, including chiefs. On May 9, 1775, Junpero Serra baptized what appears to be the first Esselen, Pach-hepas, who was the 40-year-old chief of the Excelen. His baptism took place at Xasuan, 10 leagues (about  26 miles (42?km)) southeast of the mission, in an area now named Cachagua, a close approximation of the Esselen name.[21] This persuaded some Indians to follow them to the mission.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Esselen and Ohlone Indians who lived near the mission were baptized and then forcibly relocated and conscripted as forced laborers. Neophytes were taught to be farmers, shepherds, cowboys, blacksmiths, carpenters, bricklayers, furniture makers, tanners, weavers and candle makers. Disease, starvation, overwork, and torture decimated these tribes.[23][24]:114 In 1794, the population reached its peak of 927, but by 1823 the total had dwindled to 381.[citation needed] There was extensive \\"comingling of the Costanoan with peoples of different linguistic and cultural background during the mission period.\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the beginning, the mission relied on bear meat from Mission San Antonio de Padua and supplies brought by ship from Mission San Diego de Alcal.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1779, the natives Americans at Carmel Mission harvested 1660 bushels of wheat, 700 bushels of barley, 165 bushels of beans, and 85 bushels of maize. Four years later, the native laborers produced enough crops to support 700 people. The mission had more than 500 cattle and sheep.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nCarmel mission continued to grow during most of the 18th century. The largest population was neophytes was 876 in 1795. By 1800, agriculture production at Carmel Mission was near its peak. The Mission reported to Mexico that it had 2180 horses and cattle, and 4160 smaller livestock including sheep. The total grain harvested was about 3700 bushels per year with a high of 7400 in 1797.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1832, the mission reported to Mexico that it had 2,100 cattle, 3,300 sheep, 410 horses, and 8 mules.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Mission Carmel\\", as it came to be known, was Serra's favorite[26] and, because it was close to Monterey, the capital of Alta California, he chose it as his headquarters. When he died on August 28, 1784, he was interred beneath the chapel floor. After Serra's death, Father Fermin Lasun replaced the adobe structure with one made of stone quarried from the nearby Santa Lucia Mountains.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nEight months later, in August 1833, the newly independent Mexican government secularized the mission and all its lands. It stipulated that half the mission lands should be awarded to the native people, but this purpose was never accomplished. Most mission property was bought by government officials or their wealthy friends.[23] The priests could not maintain the missions without the Indians' forced labor and the mission and lands were soon abandoned. The Indians were forced from the mission. Some attempted to return to their native ways, and others found work as ranch hands or servants on farms and ranches.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1850, the mission was nearly a ruin. The stone chapel building was deteriorating while most of the adobe buildings were eroding away. The roof collapsed in 1852. The U.S. federal government returned the mission and its lands to the Catholic Church in 1859.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mexico ceded California to the United States following the MexicanÿAmerican War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored, but required that the owners provide legal proof of their title. As required by the Land Act of 1851, Archbishop Joseph Sadoc Alemany filed a claim on February 19, 1853 on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church. He sought return of all former mission lands in the State. The state agreed to return the original mission buildings, cemeteries, and gardens to the church.[28]:31-32\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Roman Catholic Church gained full control of the buildings on October 19, 1859, the mission was in ruins.[27] In 1884 Father Angel Casanova was able to gather enough private funds to replace the roof on the chapel sufficient to preserve it until the 1930s. In 1931 Monsignor Philip Scher hired master cabinet maker Henry John (\\"Harry\\") Downie who had a excellent reputation for restoring Spanish antiques. Scher initially asked Downie to restore some statues at the Carmel Mission but his job quickly expanded and he was put in charge of restoring the entire mission.[29][25] Two years later, the church transferred the mission from the Franciscans to the local diocese and it became a regular parish church. Downie lived nearby in Carmel and worked almost daily for almost 50 years to restore the mission, ancillary buildings, walls, and grounds. He painstakingly researched the church's architecture and site, often relying on original Spanish sources, and gathered genuine artifacts from across California.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe first restored the padres' quarters, then the roof of the chapel in 1936, and over the next five years the interior of the basilica.[27][30] In 1941, he oversaw restoration of the former soldiers' quarters on the east side of the quadrangle. In 1943 he began restoration of a building that had been on the south side of the quadrangle, although nothing was left but the eroded adobe foundation and a few ruined walls. The building was originally a segregated, locked dormitory for girls called the monjero (nunnery). They were separated from their families at age 8. The boys and unmarried men also had their own dormitory, though it was less confining.[31]:117ÿ119\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building was reconstructed and made into classrooms for Junipero Serra Elementary School. In 1946, the ruin on the east side of the quadrangle that had been the original padres kitchen and a blacksmith shop was rebuilt. It is used today as a chapel. Downie also consulted on the restoration of the missions that are considered the most authentic, including San Luis Obispo, San Juan Bautista, and San Buenaventura. He also helped the Native Daughters of the Golden West to reconstruct Mission Soledad.[29] He was knighted by Pope Pius and by King Juan Carlos of Spain.[32][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960, the mission was designated as a minor basilica by Pope John XXIII.   In 1987, Pope John Paul II visited the mission as part of his U.S. tour.[33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original bell nicknamed Ave Maria was made in Mexico City in 1807. It was placed at the Mission in 1820. When the mission was secularized in 1834, the bell was removed and held onto by local Native Americans for safekeeping. It was finally lost and relocated once again during restoration. It was re-installed in the mission bell tower in 1925.[15][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of Downie's dedicated efforts to restore the buildings, the Carmel mission church is one of the most authentically restored of all the mission churches in California. Mission Carmel has been designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service. It is an active parish church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey.[36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to its activity as a place of worship, Mission Carmel also hosts concerts, art exhibits, lectures and numerous other community events. In 1986, then-pastor Monsignor Eamon MacMahon acquired a Casavant Frres organ with horizontal trumpets. Its hand-painted casework is decorated with elaborate carvings and statuary reflecting the Spanish decorative style seen on the main altar.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mission also serves as a museum, preserving its own history and the history of the area. There are four specific museum galleries: the Harry Downie Museum, describing restoration efforts; the Munras Family Heritage Museum, describing the history of one of the most important area families; the Jo Mora Chapel Gallery, hosting rotating art exhibits as well as the monumental bronze and travertine cenotaph (1924) sculpted by Jo Mora;[38] and the Convento Museum, which holds the cell Serra lived and died in, as well as interpretive exhibits. At one end of the museum is a special chapel room containing some of the vestments used by Serra.[39][40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mission grounds are also the location of the Junipero Serra School, a private Catholic school for kindergartners through 8th grade.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, the Carmel Mission Foundation began a project to restore the roof of the basilica installed during a restoration in 1937. The project was the third major reconstruction of the basilica since it was built in 1797. The contractor installed additional wood and steel beams to reinforce and tie the roof structure together. To strengthen the walls, they drilled over 300 center-cored vertical and horizontal holes in the 5 feet (1.5?m) thick walls, into which they inserted steel rods that were grouted in place. The project also updated the electrical system and added a fire suppression system. The interior lighting was replaced and custom-made chandeliers were added. The project upgraded the radiant heating system and included construction of an Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant restroom. The project was funded by the Carmel Mission Foundation, which raised about $6.2 million.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, the foundation funded reconstruction of the Quadrangle Courtyard at a cost of $2.0 million. The uneven, cracked concrete surface was a hazard. It was removed and new water and fire lines, drains, sewer, electrical, and communications lines were installed before a new concrete, durable concrete surface was poured.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foundation is planning a larger $20 million dollar project in time for the 250th anniversary of the basilica in 2020. It includes seismic retrofits, infrastructure improvements, and restoration of the several historic structures, including the Downie Museum and Orientation Center, Mora Chapel Museum, Convento Museum (including the museum store), and Blessed Sacrament Chapel.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 27, 2015, in response to Serra's canonization, the San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo Mission was vandalized.

However, the IOC's decision was reverted following an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Association.[4] For the 2002 Winter Olympics, giant slalom was expanded to add head-to-head racing and was renamed parallel giant slalom.[5] In 2006, a third event, the snowboard cross, was held for the first time. In this event, competitors race against each other down a course with jumps, beams and other obstacles.[6] On July 11, 2011, the International Olympic Committee's Executive Board approved the addition of Ski and Snowboard Slopestyle to the Winter Olympics roster of events, effective in 2014.

Since then, geographers have disagreed on the Southern Ocean's northern boundary or even existence, considering the waters as various parts of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, instead. However, according to Commodore John Leech of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), recent oceanographic research has discovered the importance of Southern Circulation, and the term Southern Ocean has been used to define the body of water which lies south of the northern limit of that circulation.[8] This remains the current official policy of the IHO, since a 2000 revision of its definitions including the Southern Ocean as the waters south of the 60th parallel has not yet been adopted. Others regard the seasonally-fluctuating Antarctic Convergence as the natural boundary.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBorders and names for oceans and seas were internationally agreed when the International Hydrographic Bureau (IHB), the precursor to the IHO, convened the First International Conference on 24 July 1919. The IHO then published these in its Limits of Oceans and Seas, the first edition being 1928. Since the first edition, the limits of the Southern Ocean have moved progressively southwards; since 1953, it has been omitted from the official publication and left to local hydrographic offices to determine their own limits. The IHO included the ocean and its definition as the waters south of 60S in its year 2000 revisions, but this has not been formally adopted, due to continuing impasses over other areas of the text, such as the naming dispute over the Sea of Japan. The 2000 IHO definition, however, was circulated in a draft edition in 2002 and is used by some within the IHO and by some other organizations such as the US Central Intelligence Agency[7] and Merriam-Webster.[note 5][10] Australian authorities regard the Southern Ocean as lying immediately south of Australia.[11][12] The National Geographic Society does not recognize the ocean,[2] depicting it (if at all) in a typeface different from the other world oceans; instead, it shows the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans extending to Antarctica on both its print and on line maps.[13][note 6] Map publishers using the term Southern Ocean on their maps include Hema Maps[15] and GeoNova.[16]\\r\\n\\"Southern Ocean\\" is an obsolete name for the Pacific Ocean or South Pacific, coined by Vasco N~?ez de Balboa, the first European to discover it, who approached it from the north.[17] The \\"South Seas\\" is a less archaic synonym. A 1745 British Act of Parliament established a prize for discovering a Northwest Passage to \\"the Western and Southern Ocean of America\\".[18]\\r\\nAuthors using \\"Southern Ocean\\" to name the waters encircling the unknown southern polar regions used varying limits. James Cook's account of his second voyage implies New Caledonia borders it.[19] Peacock's 1795 Geographical Dictionary said it lay \\"to the southward of America and Africa\\";[20] John Payne in 1796 used 40 degrees as the northern limit;[21] the 1827 Edinburgh Gazetteer used 50 degrees.[22] The Family Magazine in 1835 divided the \\"Great Southern Ocean\\" into the \\"Southern Ocean\\" and the \\"Antarctick [sic] Ocean\\" along the Antarctic Circle, with the northern limit of the Southern Ocean being lines joining Cape Horn, the Cape of Good Hope, Van Diemen's Land and the south of New Zealand.[23]\\r\\nThe United Kingdom's South Australia Act 1834 described the waters forming the southern limit of the new colony of South Australia as \\"the Southern Ocean\\". The Colony of Victoria's Legislative Council Act of 1881 delimited part of the division of Bairnsdale as \\"along the New South Wales boundary to the Southern ocean\\".[24]\\r\\nIn the 1928 first edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas, the Southern Ocean was delineated by land-based limits: Antarctica to the south, and South America, Africa, Australia, and Broughton Island, New Zealand to the north.\\r\\nThe detailed land-limits used were from Cape Horn in South America eastwards to Cape Agulhas in Africa, then further eastwards to the southern coast of mainland Australia to Cape Leeuwin, Western Australia. From Cape Leeuwin, the limit then followed eastwards along the coast of mainland Australia to Cape Otway, Victoria, then southwards across Bass Strait to Cape Wickham, King Island, along the west coast of King Island, then the remainder of the way south across Bass Strait to Cape Grim, Tasmania. The limit then followed the west coast of Tasmania southwards to the South East Cape and then went eastwards to Broughton Island, New Zealand, before returning to Cape Horn.[25]\\r\\nThe northern limits of the Southern Ocean were moved southwards in the IHO's 1937 second edition of the Limits of Oceans and Seas. From this edition, much of the ocean's northern limit ceased to abut land masses.\\r\\nIn the second edition, the Southern Ocean then extended from Antarctica northwards to latitude 40S between Cape Agulhas in Africa (long. 20E) and Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia (long. 115E), and extended to latitude 55S between Auckland Island of New Zealand (165 or 166E east) and Cape Horn in South America (67W).[26]\\r\\nAs is discussed in more detail below (see section on '2002 delineation'), prior to the 2002 (draft) edition the limits of oceans explicitly excluded the seas lying within each of them. The Great Australian Bight was unnamed in the 1928 edition, and delineated as shown in the figure above in the 1937 edition. It therefore encompassed former Southern Ocean waters (as designated in 1928) but was technically not inside any of the three adjacent oceans by 1937. In the 2002 draft edition, the IHO have designated 'seas' as being subdivisions within 'oceans', so the Bight would have still been within the Southern Ocean in 1937 if the 2002 convention were in place then. To perform direct comparisons of current and former limits of oceans (for example to compare surface areas) it is necessary to consider, or at least be aware of, how the 2002 change in IHO terminology for 'seas' can affect the comparison.\\r\\nThe Southern Ocean did not appear in the 1953 third edition and a note in the publication read:\\r\\nThe Antarctic or Southern Ocean has been omitted from this publication as the majority of opinions received since the issue of the 2nd Edition in 1937 are to the effect that there exists no real justification for applying the term Ocean to this body of water, the northern limits of which are difficult to lay down owing to their seasonal change. The limits of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans have therefore been extended South to the Antarctic Continent.\\r\\nHydrographic Offices who issue separate publications dealing with this area are therefore left to decide their own northern limits (Great Britain uses Latitude of 55 South.)\\r\\nInstead, in the IHO 1953 publication, the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans were extended southward, the Indian and Pacific Oceans (which had not previously touched pre 1953, as per the first and second editions) now abutted at the meridian of South East Cape, and the southern limits of the Great Australian Bight and the Tasman Sea were moved northwards.[27]\\r\\nThe IHO readdressed the question of the Southern Ocean in a survey in 2000. Of its 68 member nations, 28 responded, and all responding members except Argentina agreed to redefine the ocean, reflecting the importance placed by oceanographers on ocean currents. The proposal for the name Southern Ocean won 18 votes, beating the alternative Antarctic Ocean. Half of the votes supported a definition of the ocean's northern limit at 60S (with no land interruptions at this latitude), with the other 14 votes cast for other definitions, mostly 50S, but a few for as far north as 35S.\\r\\nA draft fourth edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas was circulated to IHO member states in August 2002 (sometimes referred to as the \\"2000 edition\\" as it summarized the progress to 2000).[29] It has yet to be published due to 'areas of concern' by several countries relating to various naming issues around the world ÿ primarily the Sea of Japan naming dispute ÿ and there have been various changes, 60 seas were given new names, and even the name of the publication was changed.[30] A reservation had also been lodged by Australia regarding the Southern Ocean limits.[31] Effectively, the 3rd edition (which did not delineate the Southern Ocean leaving delineation to local hydrographic offices) has yet to be superseded.\\r\\nDespite this, the 4th edition definition has partial de facto usage by many nations, scientists and organisations such as the U.S. (the Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook uses \\"Southern Ocean\\" but none of the other new sea names within the \\"Southern Ocean\\" such as \\"Cosmonauts Sea\\") and Merriam-Webster,[7][10][14] scientists and nations ÿ and even by some within the IHO.[32] Some nations' hydrographic offices have defined their own boundaries; the United Kingdom used the 55S parallel for example.[27] Other organisations favour more northerly limits for the Southern Ocean. For example, the Encyclop?dia Britannica describes the Southern Ocean as extending as far north as South America, and confers great significance on the Antarctic Convergence, yet its description of the Indian Ocean contradicts this, describing the Indian Ocean as extending south to Antarctica.[12][33]\\r\\nOther sources, such as the National Geographic Society, show the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans as extending to Antarctica on its maps, although articles on the National Geographic web site have begun to reference the Southern Ocean.[14]\\r\\nIn Australia, cartographical authorities define the Southern Ocean as including the entire body of water between Antarctica and the south coasts of Australia and New Zealand, and up to 60s elsewhere.[34] Coastal maps of Tasmania and South Australia label the sea areas as Southern Ocean,[35] while Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia is described as the point where the Indian and Southern Oceans meet.[36]\\r\\nA radical shift from past IHO practices (1928ÿ1953) was also seen in the 2002 draft edition when the IHO delineated 'seas' as being subdivisions that lay within the boundaries of 'oceans'. While the IHO are often considered the authority for such conventions, the shift brought them into line with the practices of other publications (e.g. the CIA World Fact Book) which already adopted the principle that seas are contained within oceans. This difference in practice is markedly seen for the Pacific Ocean in the adjacent figure. Thus, for example, previously the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand was not regarded by the IHO as being part of the Pacific, but as of the 2002 draft edition it is.\\r\\nThe new delineation of seas being subdivisions of oceans has avoided the need to interrupt the northern boundary of the Southern Ocean where intersected by Drake Passage which includes all of the waters from South America to the Antarctic coast, nor interrupt it for the Scotia Sea, which also extends below the 60th parallel south. The new delineation of seas has also meant that the long-time named seas around Antarctica, excluded from the 1953 edition (the 1953 map did not even extend that far south), are 'automatically' part of the Southern Ocean.\\r\\nExploration of the Southern Ocean was inspired by a belief in the existence of a Terra Australis ÿ a vast continent in the far south of the globe to \\"balance\\" the northern lands of Eurasia and North Africa ÿ which had existed since the times of Ptolemy. The doubling of the Cape of Good Hope in 1487 by Bartolomeu Dias first brought explorers within touch of the Antarctic cold, and proved that there was an ocean separating Africa from any Antarctic land that might exist. Ferdinand Magellan, who passed through the Strait of Magellan in 1520, assumed that the islands of Tierra del Fuego to the south were an extension of this unknown southern land. In 1564, Abraham Ortelius published his first map, Typus Orbis Terrarum, an eight-leaved wall map of the world, on which he identified the Regio Patalis with Locach as a northward extension of the Terra Australis, reaching as far as New Guinea.[37][38]\\r\\nEuropean geographers continued to connect the coast of Tierra del Fuego with the coast of New Guinea on their globes, and allowing their imaginations to run riot in the vast unknown spaces of the south Atlantic, south Indian and Pacific oceans they sketched the outlines of the Terra Australis Incognita (\\"Unknown Southern Land\\"), a vast continent stretching in parts into the tropics. The search for this great south land was a leading motive of explorers in the 16th and the early part of the 17th centuries.\\r\\nThe Spaniard Gabriel de Castilla, who claimed having sighted \\"snow-covered mountains\\" beyond the 64 S in 1603, is recognized as the first explorer that discovered the continent of Antarctica, although he was ignored in his time.\\r\\nIn 1606, Pedro Fernndez de Quir܇s took possession for the king of Spain all of the lands he had discovered in Australia del Espiritu Santo (the New Hebrides) and those he would discover \\"even to the Pole\\".\\r\\nFrancis Drake, like Spanish explorers before him, had speculated that there might be an open channel south of Tierra del Fuego. When Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire discovered the southern extremity of Tierra del Fuego and named it Cape Horn in 1615, they proved that the Tierra del Fuego archipelago was of small extent and not connected to the southern land, as previously thought. Subsequently, in 1642, Abel Tasman showed that even New Holland (Australia) was separated by sea from any continuous southern continent.\\r\\nThe visit to South Georgia by Anthony de la Roch in 1675 was the first ever discovery of land south of the Antarctic Convergence i.e. in the Southern Ocean/Antarctic.[39][40] Soon after the voyage cartographers started to depict Roch Island, honouring the discoverer. James Cook was aware of la Roch's discovery when surveying and mapping the island in 1775.[41]\\r\\nEdmond Halley's voyage in HMS Paramour for magnetic investigations in the South Atlantic met the pack ice in 52?S in January 1700, but that latitude (he reached 140?mi off the north coast of South Georgia) was his farthest south. A determined effort on the part of the French naval officer Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier to discover the \\"South Land\\" ÿ described by a half legendary \\"sieur de Gonneyville\\" ÿ resulted in the discovery of Bouvet Island in 5410?S, and in the navigation of 48 of longitude of ice-cumbered sea nearly in 55?S in 1730 .\\r\\nIn 1771, Yves Joseph Kerguelen sailed from France with instructions to proceed south from Mauritius in search of \\"a very large continent.\\" He lighted upon a land in 50?S which he called South France, and believed to be the central mass of the southern continent. He was sent out again to complete the exploration of the new land, and found it to be only an inhospitable island which he renamed the Isle of Desolation, but which was ultimately named after him.[42]\\r\\nThe obsession of the undiscovered continent culminated in the brain of Alexander Dalrymple, the brilliant and erratic hydrographer who was nominated by the Royal Society to command the Transit of Venus expedition to Tahiti in 1769. The command of the expedition was given by the admiralty to Captain James Cook. Sailing in 1772 with Resolution, a vessel of 462 tons under his own command and Adventure of 336 tons under Captain Tobias Furneaux, Cook first searched in vain for Bouvet Island, then sailed for 20 degrees of longitude to the westward in latitude 58?S, and then 30 eastward for the most part south of 60?S, a lower southern latitude than had ever been voluntarily entered before by any vessel. On 17 January 1773 the Antarctic Circle was crossed for the first time in history and the two ships reached 67 15' S by 39 35' E, where their course was stopped by ice.\\r\\nCook then turned northward to look for French Southern and Antarctic Lands, of the discovery of which he had received news at Cape Town, but from the rough determination of his longitude by Kerguelen, Cook reached the assigned latitude 10 too far east and did not see it. He turned south again and was stopped by ice in 61 52 S by 95?E and continued eastward nearly on the parallel of 60?S to 147?E. On 16 March, the approaching winter drove him northward for rest to New Zealand and the tropical islands of the Pacific. In November 1773, Cook left New Zealand, having parted company with the Adventure, and reached 60?S by 177?W, whence he sailed eastward keeping as far south as the floating ice allowed. The Antarctic Circle was crossed on 20 December and Cook remained south of it for three days, being compelled after reaching 67 31 S to stand north again in 135?W.\\r\\nA long detour to 47 50 S served to show that there was no land connection between New Zealand and Tierra del Fuego. Turning south again, Cook crossed the Antarctic Circle for the third time at 109 30 W before his progress was once again blocked by ice four days later at 71 10 S by 106 54 W. This point, reached on 30 January 1774, was the farthest south attained in the 18th century. With a great detour to the east, almost to the coast of South America, the expedition regained Tahiti for refreshment. In November 1774, Cook started from New Zealand and crossed the South Pacific without sighting land between 53 and 57?S to Tierra del Fuego; then, passing Cape Horn on 29 December, he rediscovered Roch Island renaming it Isle of Georgia, and discovered the South Sandwich Islands (named Sandwich Land by him), the only ice-clad land he had seen, before crossing the South Atlantic to the Cape of Good Hope between 55 and 60. He thereby laid open the way for future Antarctic exploration by exploding the myth of a habitable southern continent. Cook's most southerly discovery of land lay on the temperate side of the 60th parallel, and he convinced himself that if land lay farther south it was practically inaccessible and without economic value.[42]\\r\\nVoyagers rounding Cape Horn frequently met with contrary winds and were driven southward into snowy skies and ice-encumbered seas; but so far as can be ascertained none of them before 1770 reached the Antarctic Circle, or knew it, if they did.\\r\\nIn a voyage from 1822 to 1824, James Weddell commanded the 160-ton brig Jane, accompanied by his second ship Beaufoy captained by Matthew Brisbane. Together they sailed to the South Orkneys where sealing proved disappointing. They turned south in the hope of finding a better sealing ground. The season was unusually mild and tranquil, and on 20 February 1823 the two ships reached latitude 7415'?S and longitude 3416'45?W the southernmost position any ship had ever reached up to that time. A few icebergs were sighted but there was still no sight of land, leading Weddell to theorize that the sea continued as far as the South Pole. Another two days' sailing would have brought him to Coat's Land (to the east of the Weddell Sea) but Weddell decided to turn back.[44]\\r\\nThe first land south of the parallel 60 south latitude was discovered by the Englishman William Smith, who sighted Livingston Island on 19 February 1819. A few months later Smith returned to explore the other islands of the South Shetlands archipelago, landed on King George Island, and claimed the new territories for Britain.\\r\\nIn the meantime, the Spanish Navy ship San Telmo sank in September 1819 when trying to cross Cape Horn. Parts of her wreckage were found months later by sealers on the north coast of Livingston Island (South Shetlands). It is unknown if some survivor managed to be the first to set foot on these Antarctic islands.\\r\\nThe first confirmed sighting of mainland Antarctica cannot be accurately attributed to one single person. It can, however, be narrowed down to three individuals. According to various sources,[45][46][47] three men all sighted the ice shelf or the continent within days or months of each other: von Bellingshausen, a captain in the Russian Imperial Navy; Edward Bransfield, a captain in the British navy; and Nathaniel Palmer, an American sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut. It is certain that the expedition, led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships Vostok and Mirny, reached a point within 32?km (20?mi) from Princess Martha Coast and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 692128S 21450W? / ?69.35778S 2.24722W? / -69.35778; -2.24722[48] that became known as the Fimbul ice shelf. On 30 January 1820, Bransfield sighted Trinity Peninsula, the northernmost point of the Antarctic mainland, while Palmer sighted the mainland in the area south of Trinity Peninsula in November 1820. Von Bellingshausen's expedition also discovered Peter I Island and Alexander I Island, the first islands to be discovered south of the circle.\\r\\nIn December 1839, as part of the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838ÿ42 conducted by the United States Navy (sometimes called \\"the Wilkes Expedition\\"), an expedition sailed from Sydney, Australia, on the sloops-of-war USS?Vincennes and USS?Peacock, the brig USS?Porpoise, the full-rigged ship Relief, and two schooners Sea Gull and USS?Flying Fish. They sailed into the Antarctic Ocean, as it was then known, and reported the discovery \\"of an Antarctic continent west of the Balleny Islands\\" on 25 January 1840. That part of Antarctica was later named \\"Wilkes Land\\", a name it maintains to this day.\\r\\nExplorer James Clark Ross passed through what is now known as the Ross Sea and discovered Ross Island (both of which were named for him) in 1841. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the Ross Ice Shelf. Mount Erebus and Mount Terror are named after two ships from his expedition: HMS Erebus and Terror.[49]\\r\\nThe Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914, led by Ernest Shackleton, set out to cross the continent via the pole, but their ship, the Endurance, was trapped and crushed by pack ice before they even landed. The expedition members survived after an epic journey on sledges over pack ice to Elephant Island. Then Shackleton and five others crossed the Southern Ocean, in an open boat called James Caird, and then trekked over South Georgia to raise the alarm at the whaling station Grytviken.\\r\\nIn 1946, US Navy Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd and more than 4,700 military personnel visited the Antarctic in an expedition called Operation Highjump. Reported to the public as a scientific mission, the details were kept secret and it may have actually been a training or testing mission for the military. The expedition was, in both military or scientific planning terms, put together very quickly. The group contained an unusually high amount of military equipment, including an aircraft carrier, submarines, military support ships, assault troops and military vehicles. The expedition was planned to last for eight months but was unexpectedly terminated after only two months. With the exception of some eccentric entries in Admiral Byrd's diaries, no real explanation for the early termination has ever been officially given.\\r\\nCaptain Finn Ronne, Byrd's executive officer, returned to Antarctica with his own expedition in 1947ÿ1948, with Navy support, three planes, and dogs. Ronne disproved the notion that the continent was divided in two and established that East and West Antarctica was one single continent, i.e. that the Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea are not connected.[50] The expedition explored and mapped large parts of Palmer Land and the Weddell Sea coastline, and identified the Ronne Ice Shelf, named by Ronne after his wife Edith \\"Jackie\\" Ronne.[51] Ronne covered 3,600 miles by ski and dog sled ÿ more than any other explorer in history.[52] The Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition discovered and mapped the last unknown coastline in the world and was the first Antarctic expedition to ever include women.[53]\\r\\nThe Antarctic Treaty was signed on 1 December 1959 and came into force on 23 June 1961. Among other provisions, this treaty limits military activity in the Antarctic to the support of scientific research.\\r\\nThe first person to sail single-handed to Antarctica was the New Zealander David Henry Lewis, in 1972, in a 10-metre steel sloop Ice Bird.\\r\\nA baby, named Emilio Marcos de Palma, was born near Hope Bay on 7 January 1978, becoming the first baby born on the continent. He also was born further south than anyone in history.[54]\\r\\nThe MS Explorer was a cruise ship operated by the Swedish explorer Lars-Eric Lindblad. Observers point to the Explorer's 1969 expeditionary cruise to Antarctica as the frontrunner for today's sea-based tourism in that region.[55][56] The Explorer was the first cruise ship used specifically to sail the icy waters of the Antarctic Ocean and the first to sink there[57] when she struck an unidentified submerged object on 23 November 2007, reported to be ice, which caused a 10 by 4 inches (25 by 10?cm) gash in the hull.[58] The Explorer was abandoned in the early hours of 23 November 2007 after taking on water near the South Shetland Islands in the Southern Ocean, an area which is usually stormy but was calm at the time.[59] The Explorer was confirmed by the Chilean Navy to have sunk at approximately position: 62 24 South, 57 16 West,[60] in roughly 600?m of water.[61]\\r\\nThe Southern Ocean, geologically the youngest of the oceans, was formed when Antarctica and South America moved apart, opening the Drake Passage, roughly 30 million years ago. The separation of the continents allowed the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.\\r\\nWith a northern limit at 60S, the Southern Ocean differs from the other oceans in that its largest boundary, the northern boundary, does not abut a landmass (as it did with the first edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas). Instead, the northern limit is with the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans.\\r\\nOne reason for considering it as a separate ocean stems from the fact that much of the water of the Southern Ocean differs from the water in the other oceans. Water gets transported around the Southern Ocean fairly rapidly because of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current which circulates around Antarctica. Water in the Southern Ocean south of, for example, New Zealand, resembles the water in the Southern Ocean south of South America more closely than it resembles the water in the Pacific Ocean.\\r\\nThe Southern Ocean has typical depths of between 4,000 and 5,000?m (13,000 and 16,000?ft) over most of its extent with only limited areas of shallow water. The Southern Ocean's greatest depth of 7,236?m (23,740?ft) occurs at the southern end of the South Sandwich Trench, at 6000'S, 024W. The Antarctic continental shelf appears generally narrow and unusually deep, its edge lying at depths up to 800?m (2,600?ft), compared to a global mean of 133?m (436?ft).\\r\\nEquinox to equinox in line with the sun's seasonal influence, the Antarctic ice pack fluctuates from an average minimum of 2.6?million square kilometres (1.0G10^6?sq?mi) in March to about 18.8?million square kilometres (7.3G10^6?sq?mi) in September, more than a sevenfold increase in area.\\r\\nSub-divisions of oceans are geographical features such as \\"seas\\", \\"straits\\", \\"bays\\", \\"channels\\", and \\"gulfs\\". There are many sub-divisions of the Southern Ocean defined in the never-approved 2002 draft fourth edition of the IHO publication Limits of Oceans and Seas. In clockwise order these include (with IHO sub-division chartlet numbers in parenthesis) the Weddell Sea (10.1), the Lazarev Sea (10.2), the Riiser-Larsen Sea (10.3), the Cosmonauts Sea (10.4), the Cooperation Sea (10.5), the Davis Sea (10.6), Tryoshnikova Gulf (10.6.1), the Mawson Sea (10.7), the Dumont D'Urville Sea (10.8), the Somov Sea (10.9), the Ross Sea (10.10), McMurdo Sound (10.10.1), the Amundsen Sea (10.11), the Bellingshausen Sea (10.12), part of the Drake Passage (10.13), Bransfield Strait (10.14) and part of the Scotia Sea (4.2).[29][note 7][note 8] A number of these such as the 2002 Russian-proposed \\"Consmonauts Sea\\", \\"Cooperation Sea\\", and \\"Somov (mid-1950s Russian polar explorer) Sea\\" are not included in the 1953 IHO document which remains currently in force,[27] because they received their names largely originated from 1962 onward. Leading geographic authorities and atlases do not use these latter three names, including the 2014 10th edition World Atlas from the United States' National Geographic Society and the 2014 12th edition of the British Times Atlas of the World, but Soviet and Russian-issued maps do.[62][63]\\r\\nThe Southern Ocean probably contains large, and possibly giant, oil and gas fields on the continental margin. Placer deposits, accumulation of valuable minerals such as gold, formed by gravity separation during sedimentary processes are also expected to exist in the Southern Ocean.[6]\\r\\nManganese nodules are expected to exist in the Southern Ocean. Manganese nodules are rock concretions on the sea bottom formed of concentric layers of iron and manganese hydroxides around a core. The core may be microscopically small and is sometimes completely transformed into manganese minerals by crystallization. Interest in the potential exploitation of polymetallic nodules generated a great deal of activity among prospective mining consortia in the 1960s and 1970s.[6]\\r\\nThe icebergs that form each year around in the Southern Ocean hold enough fresh water to meet the needs of every person on Earth for several months. For several decades there have been proposals, none yet to be feasible or successful, to tow Southern Ocean icebergs to more arid northern regions (such as Australia) where they can be harvested.[64]\\r\\nIcebergs can occur at any time of year throughout the ocean. Some may have drafts up to several hundred meters; smaller icebergs, iceberg fragments and sea-ice (generally 0.5 to 1 m thick) also pose problems for ships. The deep continental shelf has a floor of glacial deposits varying widely over short distances.\\r\\nSailors know latitudes from 40 to 70 degrees south as the \\"Roaring Forties\\", \\"Furious Fifties\\" and \\"Shrieking Sixties\\" due to high winds and large waves that form as winds blow around the entire globe unimpeded by any land-mass. Icebergs, especially in May to October, make the area even more dangerous. The remoteness of the region makes sources of search and rescue scarce.\\r\\nThe Antarctic Circumpolar Current moves perpetually eastward ÿ chasing and joining itself, and at 21,000?km (13,000?mi) in length ÿ it comprises the world's longest ocean current, transporting 130?million cubic metres per second (4.6G10^9?cu?ft/s) of water ÿ 100 times the flow of all the world's rivers.\\r\\nSeveral processes operate along the coast of Antarctica to produce, in the Southern Ocean, types of water masses not produced elsewhere in the oceans of the Southern Hemisphere. One of these is the Antarctic Bottom Water, a very cold, highly saline, dense water that forms under sea ice.\\r\\nAssociated with the Circumpolar Current is the Antarctic Convergence encircling Antarctica, where cold northward-flowing Antarctic waters meet the relatively warmer waters of the subantarctic, Antarctic waters predominantly sink beneath subantarctic waters, while associated zones of mixing and upwelling create a zone very high in nutrients. These nurture high levels of phytoplankton with associated copepods and Antarctic krill, and resultant foodchains supporting fish, whales, seals, penguins, albatrosses and a wealth of other species.[65]\\r\\nThe Antarctic Convergence is considered to be the best natural definition of the northern extent of the Southern Ocean.[6]\\r\\nLarge-scale upwelling is found in the Southern Ocean. Strong westerly (eastward) winds blow around Antarctica, driving a significant flow of water northwards. This is actually a type of coastal upwelling. Since there are no continents in a band of open latitudes between South America and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, some of this water is drawn up from great depths. In many numerical models and observational syntheses, the Southern Ocean upwelling represents the primary means by which deep dense water is brought to the surface. Shallower, wind-driven upwelling is also found off the west coasts of North and South America, northwest and southwest Africa, and southwest and southeast Australia, all associated with oceanic subtropical high pressure circulations.\\r\\nSome models of the ocean circulation suggest that broad-scale upwelling occurs in the tropics, as pressure driven flows converge water toward the low latitudes where it is diffusively warmed from above. The required diffusion coefficients, however, appear to be larger than are observed in the real ocean. Nonetheless, some diffusive upwelling does probably occur.\\r\\nThe Ross Gyre and Weddell Gyre are two gyres that exist within the Southern Ocean. The gyres are located in the Ross Sea and Weddell Sea respectively, and both rotate clockwise. The gyres are formed by interactions between the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Antarctic Continental Shelf.\\r\\nSea ice has been noted to persist in the central area of the Ross Gyre.[66] There is some evidence that global warming has resulted in some decrease of the salinity of the waters of the Ross Gyre since the 1950s.[67]\\r\\nDue to the Coriolis effect acting to the left in the Southern Hemisphere and the resulting Ekman transport away from the centres of the Weddell Gyre, these regions are very productive due to upwelling of cold, nutrient rich water.\\r\\nSea temperatures vary from about ?2 to 10?C (28 to 50 F). Cyclonic storms travel eastward around the continent and frequently become intense because of the temperature contrast between ice and open ocean. The ocean-area from about latitude 40 south to the Antarctic Circle has the strongest average winds found anywhere on Earth.[68] In winter the ocean freezes outward to 65 degrees south latitude in the Pacific sector and 55 degrees south latitude in the Atlantic sector, lowering surface temperatures well below 0 degrees Celsius. At some coastal points, however, persistent intense drainage winds from the interior keep the shoreline ice-free throughout the winter.\\r\\nA variety of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean. Antarctic sea life includes penguins, blue whales, orcas, colossal squids and fur seals. The emperor penguin is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the Adlie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin. The rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. King penguins, chinstrap penguins, and gentoo penguins also breed in the Antarctic.\\r\\nThe Antarctic fur seal was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The Weddell seal, a \\"true seal\\", is named after Sir James Weddell, commander of British sealing expeditions in the Weddell Sea. Antarctic krill, which congregates in large schools, is the keystone species of the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean, and is an important food organism for whales, seals, leopard seals, fur seals, squid, icefish, penguins, albatrosses and many other birds.[69]\\r\\nThe benthic communities of the seafloor are diverse and dense, with up to 155,000 animals found in 1 square metre (10.8?sq?ft). As the seafloor environment is very similar all around the Antarctic, hundreds of species can be found all the way around the mainland, which is a uniquely wide distribution for such a large community. Deep-sea gigantism is common among these animals.[70]\\r\\nA census of sea life carried out during the International Polar Year and which involved some 500 researchers was released in 2010. The research is part of the global Census of Marine Life (CoML) and has disclosed some remarkable findings. More than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of 12,000?km (7,456?mi). Large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually. More surprising are small forms of life such as mudworms, sea cucumbers and free-swimming snails found in both polar oceans. Various factors may aid in their distribution ÿ fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ by no more than 5?C, and the major current systems or marine conveyor belt which transport egg and larva stages.[71]\\r\\nThe rocky shores of mainland Antarctica and its offshore islands provide nesting space for over 100 million birds every spring. These nesters include species of albatrosses, petrels, skuas, gulls and terns.[72] The insectivorous South Georgia pipit is endemic to South Georgia and some smaller surrounding islands. Freshwater ducks inhabit South Georgia and the Kerguelen Islands.[73]\\r\\nThe flightless penguins are all located in the Southern Hemisphere, with the greatest concentration located on and around Antarctica. Four of the 18 penguin species live and breed on the mainland and its close offshore islands. Another four species live on the subantarctic islands.[74] Emperor penguins have four overlapping layers of feathers, keeping them warm. They are the only Antarctic animal to breed during the winter.[75]\\r\\nThere are relatively few fish species in few families in the Southern Ocean. The most species-rich family are the snailfish (Liparidae), followed by the cod icefish (Nototheniidae)[76] and eelpout (Zoarcidae). Together the snailfish, eelpouts and notothenioids (which includes cod icefish and several other families) account for almost ?9?10 of the more than 320 described fish species of the Southern Ocean (tens of undescribed species also occur in the region, especially among the snailfish).[77] Southern Ocean snailfish are generally found in deep waters, while the icefish also occur in shallower waters.[76]\\r\\nCod icefish (Nototheniidae), as well as several other families, are part of the Notothenioidei suborder, collectively sometimes referred to as icefish. The suborder contains many species with antifreeze proteins in their blood and tissue, allowing them to live in water that is around or slightly below 0?C (32?F).[78][79] Antifreeze proteins are also known from Southern Ocean snailfish.[80]\\r\\nThe crocodile icefish (family Channichthyidae), also known as white-blooded fish, are only found in the Southern Ocean. They lack hemoglobin in their blood, resulting in their blood being colourless. One Channichthyidae species, the mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari), was once the most common fish in coastal waters less than 400 metres (1,312?ft) deep, but was overfished in the 1970s and 1980s. Schools of icefish spend the day at the seafloor and the night higher in the water column eating plankton and smaller fish.[78]\\r\\nThere are two species from the Dissostichus genus, the Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) and the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). These two species live on the seafloor 100ÿ3,000 metres (328ÿ9,843?ft) deep, and can grow to around 2 metres (7?ft) long weighing up to 100 kilograms (220?lb), living up to 45 years. The Antarctic toothfish lives close to the Antarctic mainland, whereas the Patagonian toothfish lives in the relatively warmer subantarctic waters. Toothfish are commercially fished, and overfishing has reduced toothfish populations.[78]\\r\\nAnother abundant fish group is the Notothenia genus, which like the Antarctic toothfish have antifreeze in their bodies.[78]\\r\\nAn unusual species of icefish is the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum), which is the only truly pelagic fish in the waters near Antarctica.[81]\\r\\nSeven pinniped species inhabit Antarctica. The largest, the elephant seal (Mirounga leonina), can reach up to 4,000 kilograms (8,818?lb), while females of the smallest, the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), reach only 150 kilograms (331?lb). These two species live north of the sea ice, and breed in harems on beaches. The other four species can live on the sea ice. Crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus) and Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) form breeding colonies, whereas leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) and Ross seals (Ommatophoca rossii) live solitary lives. Although these species hunt underwater, they breed on land or ice and spend a great deal of time there, as they have no terrestrial predators.[82]\\r\\nThe four species that inhabit sea ice are thought to make up 50% of the total biomass of the world's seals.[83] Crabeater seals have a population of around 15 million, making them one of the most numerous large animals on the planet.[84] The New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri), one of the rarest and most localised pinnipeds, breeds almost exclusively on the subantarctic Auckland Islands, although historically it had a wider range.[85] Out of all permanent mammalian residents, the Weddell seals live the furthest south.[86]\\r\\nThere are 10 cetacean species found in the Southern Ocean; six baleen whales, and four toothed whales. The largest of these, the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), grows to 24 metres (79?ft) long weighing 84 tonnes. Many of these species are migratory, and travel to tropical waters during the Antarctic winter.[87]\\r\\nFive species of krill, small free-swimming crustaceans, are found in the Southern Ocean.[88] The Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is one of the most abundant animal species on earth, with a biomass of around 500 million tonnes. Each individual is 6 centimetres (2.4?in) long and weighs over 1 gram (0.035?oz).[89] The swarms that form can stretch for kilometres, with up to 30,000 individuals per 1 cubic metre (35?cu?ft), turning the water red.[88] Swarms usually remain in deep water during the day, ascending during the night to feed on plankton. Many larger animals depend on krill for their own survival.[89] During the winter when food is scarce, adult Antarctic krill can revert to a smaller juvenile stage, using their own body as nutrition.[88]\\r\\nMany benthic crustaceans have a non-seasonal breeding cycle, and some raise their young in a brood pouch. Glyptonotus antarcticus is an unusually large benthic isopod, reaching 20 centimetres (8?in) in length weighing 70 grams (2.47?oz). Amphipods are abundant in soft sediments, eating a range of items, from algae to other animals.[70]\\r\\nSlow moving sea spiders are common, sometimes growing as large as a human hand. They feed on the corals, sponges, and bryozoans that litter the seabed.[70]\\r\\nMany aquatic molluscs are present in Antarctica. Bivalves such as Adamussium colbecki move around on the seafloor, while others such as Laternula elliptica live in burrows filtering the water above.[70] There are around 70 cephalopod species in the Southern Ocean,[90] the largest of which is the colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni), which at up to 14 metres (46?ft) is among the largest invertebrate in the world.[91] Squid makes up most of the diet of some animals, such as grey-headed albatrosses and sperm whales, and the warty squid (Moroteuthis ingens) is one of the subantarctic's most preyed upon species by vertebrates.[90]\\r\\nThe sea urchin genus Abatus burrow through the sediment eating the nutrients they find in it.[70] Two species of salps are common in Antarctic waters, Salpa thompsoni and Ihlea racovitzai. Salpa thompsoni is found in ice-free areas, whereas Ihlea racovitzai is found in the high latitude areas near ice. Due to their low nutritional value, they are normally only eaten by fish, with larger animals such as birds and marine mammals only eating them when other food is scarce.[92]\\r\\nAntarctic sponges are long lived, and sensitive to environmental changes due to the specificity of the symbiotic microbial communities within them. As a result, they function as indicators of environmental health.[93]\\r\\nIncreased solar ultraviolet radiation resulting from the Antarctic ozone hole has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) by as much as 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish.[94] Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality.\\r\\nAll international agreements regarding the world's oceans apply to the Southern Ocean. In addition, it is subject to these agreements specific to the region:\\r\\nMany nations prohibit the exploration for and the exploitation of mineral resources south of the fluctuating Antarctic Convergence,[97] which lies in the middle of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and serves as the dividing line between the very cold polar surface waters to the south and the warmer waters to the north. The Antarctic Treaty covers the portion of the globe south of sixty degrees south,[98] it prohibits new claims to Antarctica.[99]\\r\\nThe Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources applies to the area south of 60 South latitude as well as the areas further north up to the limit of the Antarctic Convergence.[100]\\r\\nBetween 1 July 1998 and 30 June 1999, fisheries landed 119,898 tonnes, of which 85% consisted of krill and 14% of Patagonian toothfish. International agreements came into force in late 1999 to reduce illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which in the 1998ÿ99 season landed five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery.\\r\\nMajor operational ports include: Rothera Station, Palmer Station, Villa Las Estrellas, Esperanza Base, Mawson Station, McMurdo Station, and offshore anchorages in Antarctica.\\r\\nFew ports or harbors exist on the southern (Antarctic) coast of the Southern Ocean, since ice conditions limit use of most shores to short periods in midsummer; even then some require icebreaker escort for access. Most Antarctic ports are operated by government research stations and, except in an emergency, remain closed to commercial or private vessels; vessels in any port south of 60 degrees south are subject to inspection by Antarctic Treaty observers.\\r\\nThe Southern Ocean's southernmost port operates at McMurdo Station at 7750S 16640E? / ?77.833S 166.667E? / -77.833; 166.667. Winter Quarters Bay forms a small harbor, on the southern tip of Ross Island where a floating ice pier makes port operations possible in summer. Operation Deep Freeze personnel constructed the first ice pier at McMurdo in 1973.[101]\\r\\nBased on the original 1928 IHO delineation of the Southern Ocean (and the 1937 delineation if the Great Australian Bight is considered integral), Australian ports and harbors between Cape Leeuwin and Cape Otway on the Australian mainland and along the west coast of Tasmania would also be identified as ports and harbors existing in the Southern Ocean. These would include the larger ports and harbors of Albany, Thevenard, Port Lincoln, Whyalla, Port Augusta, Port Adelaide, Portland, Warrnambool, and Macquarie Harbour.\\r\\nYacht races have been held in the Southern Ocean, such as the Volvo Ocean Race, Velux 5 Oceans Race, Vende Globe, Jules Verne Trophy and Global Challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 70S 150W? / ?70S 150W? / -70; -150","input":"When did the antarctic ocean become an ocean?"},{"output":"Real Madrid","context":"Association football is the most popular sport in Spain, followed by basketball and bullfighting. Football is a widespread passion among the people of Spain.[1] Football is the sport with the most registered players (a total of 942,674 of which 898,551 are men and 44,123 women), and most registered clubs (a total of 20,588) among all Spanish sport federations according to data issued by the sports administration of Spains government in 2016.[2]\\r\\nIn a survey of sports habits of the Spanish population made in 2010, football was the second most popular recreational sport practised by the population (17.9%). A total of 75.9% of people said they had ever bought tickets to attend a football match. In addition, a total of 67.3% of the people said that they saw all, almost all, many, or some of the football matches broadcast on television.[3] In another survey made in 2014, the practice of football decreased to 14% of the population, being overtaken by other sports, such as running, cycling and swimming for recreation. However, in this survey football was still the sport that interests the majority of Spains people (48%). A total of 67% of the population said they were fans or had sympathy for a particular club. In addition, 74.9% said they watched, whenever possible, the matches broadcast on television regarding their favorite teams; and 42.4% had, flags, badges or objects of their favorite teams.[4] Data of this survey confirmed the widespread impression that most of Spains people are supporters of Real Madrid (37.9%) or FC Barcelona (25.4%), and the other teams have fewer supporters nationwide, as Atltico de Madrid (16.1%), Valencia CF (3.5%), Athletic Bilbao (3.3.) or Sevilla FC (3.2%).[4]\\r\\nA relationship between football, politics, identity and attitudes towards regionalism in Spain has also been reported.[1][5][6][7][8]\\r\\nThe Royal Spanish Football Federation (Spanish: Real Federaci܇n Espa?ola de F~tbol) is the national governing body, and it organises two Cup competitions (the Copa del Rey, and the Supercopa de Espa?a), and the Spain national football team. The Liga de F~tbol Profesional (LFP) (English: Professional Football League), integrated by a total of 42 football clubs, forms part of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) but has autonomy in its organisation and functioning. It is responsible for the organisation of state football leagues, in coordination with RFEF.[9]\\r\\nThe Spanish national football team have won the FIFA World Cup once, and has also been successful in the UEFA European Championship and the Olympic tournament. The biggest success achieved by the Spain national football team was the historic treble winning three tournaments in a row: UEFA European Championship in 2008, FIFA World Cup in 2010, and UEFA European Championship in 2012.[10][11][12][13] The men's national teams of Spain, in all categories, have won a total of 26 titles in FIFA, UEFA, and Olympic tournaments.[14][15]\\r\\nThe First Division of the Liga de F~tbol Profesional, commonly known in the English-speaking world as La Liga, is one of the strongest football leagues in both Europe and the world.[16][17][18] At club level, the Spanish football clubs have won a total of 66 international tournaments. [19][20][21][22] They are the most successful in different current European competitions, such as UEFA Champions League,[23] UEFA Super Cup (shared),[24] and UEFA Europa League;[25] and they also were the most successful in the extinct Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.[22]\\r\\nThe characteristic football style of play developed by FC Barcelona, and later by the Spanish national football team is Tiki-taka. This football style is characterised by possessing the ball for large portions of the game, moving the ball quickly from one player to the next, with short and quick passes, keeping the ball away from your opponent, and then to deliver that killer pass to score goal.[26][27]\\r\\nProfessional football in Spain is a sociocultural event that make a significant contribution to the Spanish economy in terms of both demand and supply. In economic terms, during 2013 professional football generated more than ?7.6?billion including direct, indirect and induced effects, representing 0.75% of Spanish GPD.[28] Moreover, as a result of financial crisis in the last years, many Spanish football clubs in the top two divisions have been facing serious economic troubles due to pay the bank debts. In addition, the European Union authorities have warned to Spanish authorities in order to halt public funding of debt-ridden clubs.[29]\\r\\nSpain national futsal team is one of the strongest teams in the world, being six times champion in the UEFA Futsal Championship, and two times champion in the FIFA Futsal World Championship.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nModern football was introduced to Spain in the late 19th century by a combination of mostly British immigrant workers, visiting sailors and Spanish students coming from Britain.[30][31][32]\\r\\nThe oldest football clubs in Spain are Recreativo de Huelva and Sevilla FC.[33][34][35][36] Although Gimnstic de Tarragona was formed in 1886, the club did not form an actual football team until 1914. The first official football game played in Spain took place in Seville on 8 March 1890 at the Tablada Hippodrome. Sevilla FC played against Recreativo de Huelva. With the exception of two Spanish players on the Huelva team and another two players on the Seville team, all the players on both sides were British. Sevilla FC won 2ÿ0.[31]\\r\\nIn the Basque Country during the early 1890s, British shipyard workers and miners formed the Bilbao Football Club and Basque students returning from Britain founded the Athletic Club in 1898.[31][32] This early British influence was reflected in the use of English names such as Recreation Club, Athletic Club and Football Club.[32]\\r\\nIn Catalonia, which had the most developed industry in Spain, there was an important British colony. The first games played by Britishmen and Catalan people who had studied in the United Kingdom were documented in 1882 in Barcelona.[31] However, the first official and registered football club was Palam܇s FC (Costa Brava, North of Catalonia) in 1898.[31] The Swiss Hans Gamper founded FC Barcelona on 29 November 1899.[31] Other clubs were founded in 1900, such as Sant Andreu, Hispania FC and the Sociedad Espa?ola de Football (one year later the founders changed the name to Real Club Deportivo Espa?ol).[31] The Catalan Football Federation (Catalan: Federaci܇ Catalana de Futbol), responsible for administering football in Catalonia, was the first football association founded in Spain. It was formed on 11 November 1900 as the Football Association of Catalonia (Catalan: Football Associaci܇ de Catalunya).[31] The Catalan Football Federation organised the Catalan football championship (Catalan: Campionat de Catalunya) that was the first football competition in Spain.[31]\\r\\nIn Madrid, the first games were promoted by Instituci܇n Libre de Ense?anza (ILE) (English: Free Educational Institution), an educational and cultural centre. The first club of Madrid was Football Club Sky, founded in 1897, but the club separated into two new clubs in 1890. Then, several clubs also emerged in Madrid, most notably Madrid Football Club, founded in 1902 by Catalan brothers Juan and Carlos Padr܇s.[31]\\r\\nThe Copa del Rey (English: King's Cup) competition was founded in 1903, one year after a previous football tournament named Coronation Cup. It was Spain's football national Championship from 1903 until the establishment of the League Championship in 1928.[37]\\r\\nThe Spanish Federation of Football Clubs was formed in 1909, but there were discrepancies between the member clubs years later, and some of the clubs formed other association called Royal Spanish Union of Clubs of Football.[38] Finally, the two associations reached an agreement and the Royal Spanish Football Federation was founded in 1913, which allowed the Spanish football to enter in FIFA.[39] In these years, Athletic was the most dominant club in the country, and the first idols in Spain began to appear, like Pichichi and Paulino Alcntara.[39][40][41]\\r\\nThe Spain national team was created in 1920 on the occasion of the dispute of the Olympic Games in Antwerp.[32][41] The importance of the success of the Spain national team in the Olympic games, which won the silver medal, was huge in the development of football as mass social event in Spain.[41] The interest on football grew, more people attended to the stadiums, more informations about football appeared in the newspapers, and football was used as element of national prestige and political propaganda.[42]\\r\\nAfter the Olympic triumph, football was more popular among Spanish fans, the attendances to the stadiums increased, and the pressure of professionalism grew.[43] Spanish football turned professional in 1925.[44] An agreement between several clubs was made on 23 November 1928 which officially established Spain's national football division, and the birth of the Spanish League. The first league championship began in 1929.[32][45]\\r\\nThe Spanish Civil War (1936ÿ1939) brought disruption to the national competitions. Although the Spanish League was suspended, the Catalan and Valencian clubs continued contesting in the Mediterranean League in early 1937. Barcelona later toured Mexico and the United States, raising support for the Spanish Republic.[32]\\r\\nThe Spanish League and the Cup were restored in the 1939ÿ40 season after Civil War had ended. Francisco Francos regime, a fascist political system, began to use football as a propaganda tool for the new regime.[46] In 1941, as part of his policy of eradicating regional identities, the Franco's regime banned the use of non-Castilian names. As a result, many clubs that had chosen English prefixes previously, such as Athletic or Football club, had to amend their initial names, for other Castilian (as Atltico, or Club de F~tbol). The Catalan Championship was banned and the Catalan shield taken from FC Barcelona's badge. Spanish football began to rebuild slowly after the War, but Spain's isolated international position meant they did not properly re-enter International football until 1950.[32] Later, Franco's regime was able to use the football, based on the European triumphs of Real Madrid in the 1950s for political purposes. In this manner, Real Madrid was used as a Spanish brand of success to promote Spains image abroad, as well as the pride of being Spanish in the country itself.[7][47]\\r\\nSpain was selected as host of the 1982 FIFA World Cup.\\r\\nUntil the 1984ÿ85 season, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) was responsible for organizing the league tournament. Since then, the competition was organized by the Liga de F~tbol Profesional (LFP)(English: Professional Football League), an independent body which was formed at the initiative of the clubs themselves after disagreements with the RFEF regarding the management professionalization and economic division of the League benefits.\\r\\nSince the entry into force of Spanish Law 10/1990, almost all of the clubs competing professionally in Spain are actually companies under the legal status of sports companies, whose ownership is in the hands of its shareholders. Only three professional clubs (Athletic Club, Barcelona and Real Madrid) kept its original structure, such as sports clubs directly controlled by their members.\\r\\nAfter the appearance of private television in Spain, football clubs hugely increased its income thanks to the lucrative contracts to broadcast matches on television. This allowed them to hire many of the best players in the world, but most of the clubs also increased vastly their spending. In the last years La Liga is living in a big financial turmoil. Although the two big powerful clubs, Real Madrid and Barcelona, are at the top in Forbes' football rich list, the rest of Spanish clubs are weighed down by a colossal debt around ?4.1?billion. For this reason, most of the clubs had to cut their budgets drastically.[48]\\r\\nWithin Spain, regional teams, most notably the football team of Catalonia, the football team of Basque Country, and even the football team of Galicia, began to compete against each other from 1915 onwards. Despite not being officially recognised by FIFA, these regional teams still occasionally play friendly games with some national team players playing for both teams. Some autonomous governments and social sectors in the historical communities (especially in Catalonia and Basque Country) prefer to call their regional teams as national team, while claiming to participate in international tournaments.[49]\\r\\nThe Spain national team, commonly referred to as La selecci܇n (English: The selection) or La Roja (English: The Red one), made their international debut at the 1920 Olympic Games in Belgium and came away with the silver medal.[32][41] Since then the Spanish national team has participated in a total of fourteen out twenty FIFA World Cup and nine out fourteen UEFA European Championship. Historically, the Spanish national team did not achieve important results, in terms of trophies or develop an attractive playing style. Surprisingly, this fact contrasted with the huge success obtained by the main Spanish football clubs at the European level. Nevertheless, the triumphs of Spanish national team in 2008 and 2012 European Championship, and in 2010 FIFA World Cup, with an attractive playing style, marked a point of inflection that divided the history of Spanish national football team in two parts.\\r\\nThe Spanish national football team has been the winner of FIFA Team of Year in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, as well as the winner of Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year in 2011.\\r\\nThe Spanish national football team have won four trophies in FIFA and UEFA tournaments: one FIFA World Cup in 2010, and three UEFA European Championship in 1964, 2008 and 2012. In addition, it was runner-up in the UEFA European Championship in 1984 and in the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2013.\\r\\nThe Spain national under-23 team won the gold medal in 1992 Olympic tournament and the silver medal in 2000.\\r\\nThe Spain national football team won the gold medal at the Mediterranean Games in 2005 and 2007, the silver medal in 1955, and the bronze medal in 1963 and 1967.\\r\\nIn addition, the honours list includes numerous titles at junior level teams:\\r\\nUEFA European Under-21 Championship in 1986, 1998, 2011, and 2013.\\r\\nFIFA U-20 World Cup in 1999.\\r\\nUEFA European Under-19 Championship (formerly Under-18) in 1995, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2011 2012 and 2015.\\r\\nUEFA European Under-17 Championship (formerly Under-16) in 1986, 1988, 1991, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2007 and 2008.\\r\\n1999 Meridian Cup.\\r\\nSpain have won the Maurice Burlaz Trophy, the prize awarded to the national association that has achieved the best results in UEFA's men's youth competitions (UEFA European Under-19 Championship and UEFA European Under-17 championship) over the previous two seasons, in 1994, 1996, 1998, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2011.[50]\\r\\nA short list of some of the top Spanish football players (grouped by playing positions and era) which have ever played for the Spanish national team include:\\r\\nGoalkeepers: Ricardo Zamora (1920s/1930s), Antoni Ramallets (1940s/1960s), Jos ngel Iribar (1960s/1980s), Luis Arconada (1970s/1980s), Andoni Zubizarreta (1970s/1990s), Iker Casillas (1990s/2010s), Vctor Valds (2000s/2010s), David de Gea (2010s)\\r\\nDefenders: Jacinto Quincoces (1920s/1930s), Joan Segarra (1950s/1960s), Jes~s Garay (1950s/1960s), Jos Santamara (1950s/1960s), Feliciano Rivilla (1960s), Jos Antonio Camacho (1970s/1980s), Antonio Maceda (1980s), Rafael Gordillo (1970s/1990s), Miguel ngel Nadal (1990s/2000s), Fernando Hierro (1980s/2000s), Abelardo Fernndez (1990s/2000s), Carles Puyol (1990s/2010s), Sergio Ramos (2000s/2010s), Gerard Piqu (2000s/2010s), Jordi Alba (2010s)\\r\\nMidfielders: Josep Samitier (1920s/1930s), Martn Marculeta (1920s/1930s), Leonardo Cilaurren (1920s/1930s), Jos Luis Panizo (1940s/1950s), Antonio Puchades (1940s/1950s), Alfredo Di Stfano (1950s/1960s), Luis del Sol (1960s/1970s), Luis Surez (1960s/1970s), Luis Aragons (1960s/1970s), Jes~s Mara Pereda (1960s), Pirri (1960s/1970s), Jes~s Mara Zamora (1970s/1980s), Mchel (1980s/1990s), Jos Luis Prez Caminero (1990s), Luis Enrique (1990s/2000s), Pep Guardiola (1990s/2000s), Julen Guerrero (1990s), Gaizka Mendieta (1990s/2000s), Xavi (1990s/2010s), Xabi Alonso (2000s/2010s), Andrs Iniesta (2000s/2010s), Santi Cazorla (2000s/2010s), David Silva (2000s/2010s), Cesc Fbregas (2000s/2010s), Juan Mata (2000s/2010s), Sergio Busquets (2000s/2010s)\\r\\nForwards: Pichichi (1910s/20s), Paulino Alcntara (1910s/1920s), Luis Regueiro (1920s/1930s), Isidro Lngara (1930s), Csar (1940s/1950s), Telmo Zarra (1940s/1950s), Agustn Ganza (1940s/1950s), Estanislau Basora (1940s/1950s), Lszl܇ Kubala (1950s/1960s), Ferenc Pusks (1960s), Francisco Gento (1950s/1960s), Amancio Amaro (1960s/1970s), Santillana (1970s/1980s), Juanito (1970s/1980s, Quini (1970s/1980s), Roberto L܇pez Ufarte (1970s/1980s), Emilio Butrague?o (1980s/1990s), Julio Salinas (1980s/1990s), Ra~l (1990s/2000s), Fernando Morientes (1990s/2000s), David Villa (2000s/2010s), Fernando Torres (2000s/2010s)\\r\\nCurrently, the three most important competitions between clubs in Spain are La Liga (English: League), the Copa del Rey (English: King's Cup) and the Supercopa de Espa?a (English: Spanish Supercup). Other extinct competitions were the League Cup, the Eva Duarte Cup and the President's Cup of the Spanish Football Federation. Up to a total of fifteen clubs have been winners of some of the official competitions in Spain at the highest level, and FC Barcelona is the most awarded club with seventy-two national titles,\\r\\nThe Spanish football league system consists of several leagues bound together hierarchically by promotion and relegation. In addition, Spanish Royal Federation Cup is a football competition for teams from the Segunda Divisi܇n B, the Tercera Divisi܇n and sometimes from the Preferente Regional who have failed to qualify or have been eliminated in the first round of the Copa del Rey.\\r\\nIn April 1927, lvaro Trejo, a director at Arenas Club de Getxo, first proposed the idea of a national league in Spain. After much debate about the size of the league and who would take part, the RFEF eventually agreed on the ten teams who would form the first Primera Divisi܇n in 1928. FC Barcelona, Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad, Arenas Club de Getxo and Real Uni܇n were all selected as previous winners of the Copa del Rey. Athletic Madrid, RCD Espa?ol and CE Europa qualified as Copa del Rey runners-up and Racing de Santander qualified through a knock-out competition against Sevilla FC. Barcelona was the first winner of the competition. Only three of the founding clubs, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao, have never been relegated from the Primera Division; six other clubs have never been below the top two tiers: Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Sporting de Gij܇n, Valencia, Espanyol and Atltico Madrid.\\r\\nHistorically, some of the best football players in the world have played in the Spanish football league, including Ricardo Zamora, Josep Samitier, Alfredo Di Stfano, Ladislav Kubala, Ferenc Pusks, Raymond Kopa, Hctor Rial, Telmo Zarra, Francisco Gento, Luis Surez, Johan Cruyff, Diego Maradona, Bernd Schuster, Andoni Zubizarreta, Michael Laudrup, Hristo Stoichkov, Romrio, Zinedine Zidane, Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Ra~l, Ronaldinho, Carles Puyol, Xavi, Andrs Iniesta, Iker Casillas, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Lionel Messi, among others.\\r\\nLa Liga de F~tbol Profesional (LFP) is the association responsible for administering the two professional football leagues in Spain. Professional Spanish football is divided into the Primera Divisi܇n (First Division) and Segunda Divisi܇n (Second Division). The First Division is also known as Liga Santander, for sponsorship reasons, while the Second Division is officially called Liga 1|2|3. The First Division consists of 20 professional teams and the Second Division has 22. There are also lower Spanish national football divisions. Every year, the three lowest ranked teams in the First Division pass to the Second Division and the top three ranked teams in the Second Division pass to the First Division.\\r\\nLa Liga is one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the world. [51] The average stadium attendance was 21,000 in the 2014ÿ15 season, with a range of average attendance from 4,780 people in the stadium with the lowest average attendance to 77,632 people in the stadium with highest average attendance.[52]\\r\\nIn La Liga's 89-year history (with the exeception of the three seasons that the league was suspended due to the civil war), Barcelona and Real Madrid have won 55 titles between them. Barcelona and Real Madrid are two fierce rivals clubs, and the matches between both two clubs are named as El Clsico.[8] Those football matches are one of the most viewed sports events in the world.\\r\\nAlthough a total of 62 teams have competed in La Liga since its inception, only nine clubs have won the title: Real Madrid (33), Barcelona (25), Atltico Madrid (10), Athletic Bilbao (8), Valencia (6), Real Sociedad (2), Sevilla (1), Deportivo de La Coru?a (1), and Real Betis (1).\\r\\nIn 1902, Carlos Padr܇s, later president of Madrid FC (later to be Real Madrid), suggested a football competition to celebrate the coronation of Alfonso XIII. Four other teams entered the Copa del Ayuntamiento de Madrid, which would later develop into the Copa del Rey (English: \\"King's Cup\\"). These included Barcelona, Club Espa?ol de F~tbol, Club Bizcaya and New Foot-Ball de Madrid. The competition featured the first recorded game between Barcelona and Madrid FC, with the former emerging 3ÿ1 winners. Club Bizcaya, which consisted of players from both Basque teams, eventually beat Barcelona in the final. Alfonso XIII subsequently became the patron of many Spanish football clubs, granting them permission to use \\"Real\\" (Spanish for \\"royal\\") in their names. Among the many clubs to add the prefix to their name was Madrid FC, which subsequently became Real Madrid.\\r\\nFourteen clubs have won the title: Barcelona (30), Athletic Bilbao (23), Real Madrid (19), Atltico Madrid (10), Valencia (7), Real Zaragoza (6), Sevilla (5), Espanyol (4), Real Union (4), Real Betis (2), Deportivo de La Coru?a (2), Real Sociedad (2), Arenas Club de Getxo (1) and Mallorca (1).\\r\\nThe Spanish Super Cup (Spanish: Supercopa de Espa?a) is a championship organized by Royal Spanish Football Federation and contested by the winners of La Liga and Copa del Rey.

Real Madrid is also the most successful club in the Intercontinental Cup (three titles, shared record with A.C. Milan, Pe?arol, Boca Juniors, Nacional) and FIFA Club World Cup (three titles, shared record with Barcelona).\\r\\nBarcelona is the most successful club in the FIFA Club World Cup (three titles, shared record with Real Madrid), and it is also the most successful club in the UEFA Super Cup (five titles, shared record with Milan). In addition, Barcelona became the first football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year (2009) completing the sextuple, and the first European club in history to achieve the continental treble twice (2009 and 2015).\\r\\nSevilla is the most successful club in the UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League, with five titles.\\r\\nIn total, the Spanish football clubs have won 73 international titles as of 2018.

In addition, Spanish clubs have also won the Intercontinental Cup 4 times, and the FIFA Club World Cup 6 times.\\r\\nWomen's football is a minor sport in Spain.[54][55] Unlike the men's football, women's football is an amateur sport in Spain. Currently there are two national competitions, the League and the Copa de la Reina (English: Queen's Cup), in the semi-professional clubs involved structure.\\r\\nThe first teams and the first informal women's football competitions in Spain emerged in the 1970s, although they were not officially recognized by the Royal Spanish Football Federation until 1980, with the founding of the National Women's Football Committee. The first official national competition was the Championships of Spain (Copa de la Reina), established in 1983. The women's national league began to dispute the 1988-89 season.\\r\\nThe Spain women's national football team has been qualified only once in the FIFA Women's World Cup, and twice in the UEFA Women's Championship. Its youth division have had success in recent times. The Spain women's national under-19 football team won the UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship in 2004.

In the United States, national security and immigration functions are performed by the Department of Homeland Security primarily and the Department of Justice secondarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department of the Interior has often been humorously called \\"The Department of Everything Else\\" because of its broad range of responsibilities.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nA department for domestic concern was first considered by the 1st United States Congress in 1789, but those duties were placed in the Department of State. The idea of a separate domestic department continued to percolate for a half-century and was supported by Presidents from James Madison to James Polk. The 1846ÿ48 MexicanÿAmerican War gave the proposal new steam as the responsibilities of the federal government grew. Polk's Secretary of the Treasury, Robert J. Walker, became a vocal champion of creating the new department.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1849, Walker stated in his annual report that several federal offices were placed in departments with which they had little to do. He noted that the General Land Office had little to do with the Treasury and also highlighted the Indian Affairs office, part of the Department of War, and the Patent Office, part of the Department of State. Walker argued that these and other bureaus should be brought together in a new Department of the Interior.[citation needed] A bill authorizing its creation of the Department passed the House of Representatives on February 15, 1849, and spent just over two weeks in the Senate. The Department was established on March 3, 1849 (9?Stat.?395), the eve of President Zachary Taylor's inauguration, when the Senate voted 31 to 25 to create the Department. Its passage was delayed by Democrats in Congress who were reluctant to create more patronage posts for the incoming Whig administration to fill. The first Secretary of the Interior was Thomas Ewing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the domestic concerns the Department originally dealt with were gradually transferred to other Departments. Other agencies became separate Departments, such as the Bureau of Agriculture, which later became the Department of Agriculture. However, land and natural resource management, American Indian affairs, wildlife conservation, and territorial affairs remain the responsibilities of the Department of the Interior.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of mid-2004, the Department managed 507 million acres (2,050,000?km2) of surface land, or about one-fifth of the land in the United States. It manages 476 dams and 348 reservoirs through the Bureau of Reclamation, 410 national parks, monuments, seashore sites, etc. through the National Park Service, and 544 national wildlife refuges through the Fish and Wildlife Service. Energy projects on federally managed lands and offshore areas supply about 28% of the nation's energy production.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the Interior Department, the Bureau of Indian Affairs handles some federal relations with Native Americans, while others are handled by the Office of Special Trustee. The current acting Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs is Lawrence S. Roberts, an enrolled member of the Oneida Tribe in Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department has been the subject of disputes over proper accounting for Native American Trusts set up to track the income and distribution of monies that are generated by the Trust and specific Native American lands, which the government leases for fees to companies that extract oil, timber, minerals, and other resources. Several cases have sought an accounting of such funds from departments within the Interior and Treasury (such as the Minerals Management Service), in what has been a 15-year-old lawsuit. Some Native American nations have also sued the government over water-rights issues and their treaties with the US.  In 2010 Congress passed the Claims Settlement Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-291), which provided $3.4 billion for the settlement of the Cobell v. Salazar class-action trust case and four Native American water rights cases.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe $3.4 billion will be placed in a still-to-be-selected bank and $1.4 billion will go to individuals, mostly in the form of checks ranging from $500 to $1,500. A small group, such as members of the Osage tribe who benefit from huge Oklahoma oil revenues, will get far more, based on a formula incorporating their 10 highest years of income between 1985 and 2009. As important, $2 billion will be used to buy trust land from Native American owners at fair market prices, with the government finally returning the land to tribes. Nobody can be forced to sell.[8]\\r\\nSecretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall was implicated in the Teapot Dome scandal of 1921. He was convicted of bribery in 1929, and served one year in prison, for his part in the controversy. A major factor in the scandal was a transfer of certain oil leases from the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy to that of the Department of the Interior, at Fall's behest.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecretary of the Interior James G. Wattalready facing criticism related to his alleged hostility to environmentalism and his support of the development and use of federal lands by foresting, ranching, and other commercial interests, and for banning The Beach Boys from playing a 1983 Independence Day concert on the National Mall out of concerns of attracting \\"an undesirable element\\"resigned abruptly after a September 21, 1983, speech in which he said about his staff: \\"I have a black, a woman, two Jews and a cripple. And we have talent.\\"[9] Within weeks of making this statement, Watt submitted his resignation letter.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Administration of President George W. Bush, the Interior Department's maintenance backlog climbed from $5 billion to $8.7 billion, despite Bush's campaign pledges to eliminate it completely. Of the agency under Bush's leadership, Interior Department Inspector General Earl Devaney has cited a \\"culture of fear\\" and of \\"ethical failure.\\" Devaney has also said, \\"Simply stated, short of a crime, anything goes at the highest levels of the Department of Interior.\\"[11]","input":"When was the department of the interior created?"},{"output":"Friday, July 22, 1983","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A-Team is an American action-adventure television series that ran on NBC from 1983 to 1987 about former members of a fictitious United States Army Special Forces unit.  The members, after being court-martialed \\"for a crime they didn't commit\\", escaped from military prison and, while still on the run, worked as soldiers of fortune. The series was created by Stephen J. Cannell and Frank Lupo. A feature film based on the series was released by 20th Century Fox in 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A-Team was created by writers and producers Stephen J. Cannell and Frank Lupo at the behest of Brandon Tartikoff, NBC's Entertainment president. Cannell was fired from ABC in the early 1980s, after failing to produce a hit show for the network, and was hired by NBC; his first project was The A-Team. Brandon Tartikoff pitched the series to Cannell as a combination of The Dirty Dozen, Mission Impossible, The Magnificent Seven, Mad Max and Hill Street Blues, with \\"Mr. T driving the car\\".[1][2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A-Team was not generally expected to become a hit, although Stephen J. Cannell has said that George Peppard suggested it would be a huge hit \\"before we ever turned on a camera\\".[5] The show became very popular; the first regular episode, which aired after Super Bowl XVII on January 30, 1983, reached 26.4% of the television audience, placing fourth in the top 10 Nielsen-rated shows.[6]  The A-Team was portrayed as acting on the side of good and helping the oppressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show remains prominent in popular culture for its cartoonish violence (in which people were seldom seriously hurt), formulaic episodes, its characters' ability to form weaponry and vehicles out of old parts, and its distinctive theme tune. The show boosted the career of Mr. T, who portrayed the character of B. A. Baracus, around whom the show was initially conceived.[7][8] Some of the show's catchphrases, such as \\"I love it when a plan comes together\\",[9] \\"Hannibal's on the jazz\\", and \\"I ain't gettin' on no plane!\\" have also made their way onto T-shirts and other merchandise.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show's name comes from the \\"A-Teams\\", the nickname coined for U.S. Special Forces' Operational Detachments Alpha (ODA) during the Vietnam War,[10] although this connection was never mentioned on-screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2003 Yahoo! survey of 1,000 television viewers, The A-Team was voted the \\"oldie\\" television show viewers would most like to see revived, beating out such popular television series from the 1980s as The Dukes of Hazzard and Knight Rider.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n- John Ashley's opening narration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A-Team is a naturally episodic show, with few overarching stories, except the characters' continuing motivation to clear their names, with few references to events in past episodes and a recognizable and steady episode structure. In describing the ratings drop that occurred during the show's fourth season, reviewer Gold Burt points to this structure as being a leading cause for the decreased popularity \\"because the same basic plot had been used over and over again for the past four seasons with the same predictable outcome\\".[12] Similarly, reporter Adrian Lee called the plots \\"stunningly simple\\" in a 2006 article for The Express (UK newspaper), citing such recurring elements \\"as BA's fear of flying, and outlandish finales when the team fashioned weapons from household items\\".[13]  The show became emblematic of this kind of \\"fit-for-TV warfare\\" due to its depiction of high-octane combat scenes, with lethal weapons, wherein the participants (with the notable exception of General Fulbright) are never killed and rarely seriously injured (see also On-screen violence section).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the television ratings of The A-Team fell dramatically during the fourth season, the format was changed for the show's final season in 1986ÿ87 in a bid to win back viewers. After years on the run from the authorities, the A-Team is finally apprehended by the military. General Hunt Stockwell, a mysterious CIA operative played by Robert Vaughn, propositions them to work for him, whereupon he will arrange for their pardons upon successful completion of several suicide missions. In order to do so, the A-Team must first escape from their captivity. With the help of a new character, Frankie \\"Dishpan Man\\" Santana, Stockwell fakes their deaths before a military firing squad. The new status of the A-Team, no longer working for themselves, remained for the duration of the fifth season while Eddie Velez and Robert Vaughn received star billing along with the principal cast. The missions that the team had to perform in season five were somewhat reminiscent of Mission: Impossible, and based more around political espionage than beating local thugs, also usually taking place in foreign countries, including successfully overthrowing an island dictator, the rescue of a scientist from East Germany, and recovering top secret Star Wars defense information from Soviet hands. These changes proved unsuccessful with viewers, however, and ratings continued to decline. Only 13 episodes aired in the fifth season.  In what was supposed to be the final episode, \\"The Grey Team\\" (although \\"Without Reservations\\" was broadcast on NBC as the last first-run episode in March 1987), Hannibal, after being misled by Stockwell one time too many, tells him that the team will no longer work for him. At the end, the team discusses what they were going to do if they get their pardon, and it is implied that they would continue doing what they were doing as the A-Team.  The character of Howling Mad Murdock can be seen in the final scene wearing a T-shirt that says, \\"Fini\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Vietnam War, the A-Team were members of the 5th Special Forces Group (see the episode \\"West Coast Turnaround\\"). In the episode \\"Bad Time on the Border\\", Colonel John \\"Hannibal\\" Smith, portrayed by George Peppard, indicated that the A-Team were \\"ex-Green Berets\\". During the Vietnam War, the A-Team's commanding officer, Colonel Morrison, gave them orders to rob the Bank of Hanoi to help bring the war to an end. They succeeded in their mission, but on their return to base four days after the end of the war, they discovered that Morrison had been killed by the Viet Cong, and that his headquarters had been burned to the ground. This meant that the proof that the A-Team members were acting under orders had been destroyed. They were arrested, and imprisoned at Fort Bragg, from which they quickly escaped before standing trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of the A-Team is directly linked to the Vietnam War, during which the team formed. The show's introduction in the first four seasons mentions this, accompanied by images of soldiers coming out of a helicopter in an area resembling a forest or jungle. Besides this, The A-Team would occasionally feature an episode in which the team came across an old ally or enemy from those war days. For example, the first season's final episode \\"A Nice Place To Visit\\" revolved around the team traveling to a small town to honor a fallen comrade and end up avenging his death, and in season two's \\"Recipe For Heavy Bread\\", a chance encounter leads the team to meet both the POW cook who helped them during the war, and the American officer who sold his unit out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn article in the New Statesman (UK) published shortly after the premiere of The A-Team in the United Kingdom, also pointed out The A-Team's connection to the Vietnam War, characterizing it as the representation of the idealization of the Vietnam War, and an example of the war slowly becoming accepted and assimilated into American culture.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the team's primary antagonists, Col. Roderick Decker (Lance LeGault), had his past linked back to the Vietnam War, in which he and Hannibal had come to fisticuffs in \\"the DOOM Club\\" (Da Nang Open Officers' Mess).[15] At other times, members of the team would refer back to a certain tactic used during the War, which would be relevant to the team's present predicament. Often, Hannibal would refer to such a tactic, after which the other members of the team would complain about its failure during the War. This was also used to refer to some of Face's past accomplishments in scamming items for the team, such as in the first-season episode \\"Holiday In The Hills\\", in which Murdock fondly remembers Face being able to secure a '53 Cadillac while in the Vietnam jungle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team's ties to the Vietnam War were referred to again in the fourth-season finale, \\"The Sound of Thunder\\", in which the team is introduced to Tia (Tia Carrere), a war orphan and daughter of fourth season antagonist General Fulbright. Returning to Vietnam, Fulbright is shot in the back and gives his last words as he dies. The 2006 documentary Bring Back The A-Team joked that the scene lasted seven and a half minutes,[16] but his death actually took a little over a minute. His murderer, a Vietnamese colonel, is killed in retaliation. Tia then returns with the team to the United States (see also: casting). This episode is notable for having one of the show's few truly serious dramatic moments, with each team member privately reminiscing on their war experiences, intercut with news footage from the war with Barry McGuire's Eve of Destruction playing in the background.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show's ties to the Vietnam War are fully dealt with in the opening arc of the fifth season, dubbed \\"The Court-Martial (Part 1ÿ3)\\", in which the team is finally court-martialed for the robbery of the bank of Hanoi. The character of Roderick Decker makes a return on the witness stand, and various newly introduced characters from the A-Team's past also make appearances. The team, after a string of setbacks, decides to plead guilty to the crime and they are sentenced to be executed. They escape this fate and come to work for a General Hunt Stockwell, leading into the remainder of the fifth season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show ran for five seasons on the NBC television network, from January 23, 1983 to December 30, 1986 (with one additional, previously unbroadcast episode shown on March 8, 1987), for a total of 98 episodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A-Team revolves around the four members of a former commando outfit, now mercenaries. Their leader is Lieutenant Colonel/Colonel John \\"Hannibal\\" Smith (George Peppard), whose plans tend to be unorthodox but effective. Lieutenant Templeton Peck (Dirk Benedict; Tim Dunigan appeared as Templeton Peck in the pilot), usually called \\"Face\\" or \\"Faceman\\", is a smooth-talking con man who serves as the team's appropriator of vehicles and other useful items, as well as the team's second-in-command. The team's pilot is Captain H.M. \\"Howling Mad\\" Murdock (Dwight Schultz), who has been declared insane and lives in a Veterans' Administration mental institution for the show's first four seasons. Finally, there is the team's strong man, mechanic and Sergeant First Class Bosco \\"B.A.\\", or \\"Bad Attitude\\", Baracus (Mr. T).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team belonged to the 5th Special Forces as seen in the left side shoulder patch on Hannibal's uniform in the episode A Nice Place to Visit.  A patch on Hannibal's uniform on the right shoulder in the episode \\"A Nice Place To Visit\\" indicates he belonged to the 101st Airborne during a prior combat assignment, but that patch was replaced by the 1st Air Cavalry Division patch in the episode \\"Trial by Fire\\". The patch worn on the left sleeve according to uniform wear in the Army is the current assignment of the person wearing it and in the episode A Nice Place to Visit shows that the team was assigned to the Special Forces with a tab Airborne over the shoulder patch. Also their berets in that episode are green and have the tab of the 5th Special Forces in Vietnam on them. In the episode \\"West Coast Turnaround\\", Hannibal stated they were with the 5th Special Forces Group. Then, in episode \\"Bad Time on the Border\\", Hannibal refers to his friends as \\"ex-Green Berets\\". Though the name they have adopted comes from the \\"A-Teams\\", the nickname coined for Special Forces Operational Detachments Alpha, these detachments usually consisted of twelve members; whether the four were considered a \\"detachment\\" of their own or had once had eight compatriots who were killed in action was never revealed. In the episode A Nice Place to Visit Ray Brenner is stated to have been a Major and part of Hannibal's team in Vietnam.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor its first season and the first half of the second season, the team was assisted by reporter Amy Amanda Allen (Melinda Culea). In the second half of the second season, Allen was replaced by fellow reporter Tawnia Baker (Marla Heasley). The character of Tia (Tia Carrere), a Vietnam war orphan now living in the United States, was meant to join the Team in the fifth season,[17] but she was replaced by Frankie Santana (Eddie Velez), who served as the team's special effects expert. Velez was added to the opening credits of the fifth season after its second episode.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring their adventures, the A-Team was constantly met by opposition from the Military Police. In the show's first season, the MPs were led by Colonel Francis Lynch (William Lucking), but he was replaced for the second, third, and earlier fourth season by Colonel Roderick Decker (Lance LeGault) and his aide Captain Crane (Carl Franklin). Lynch returned for one episode in the show's third season (\\"Showdown!\\") but was not seen after. Decker was also briefly replaced by a Colonel Briggs (Charles Napier) in the third season for one episode (\\"Fire\\") when LeGault was unavailable, but returned shortly after. For the latter portion of the show's fourth season, the team was hunted by General Harlan \\"Bull\\" Fulbright (Jack Ging), who would later hire the A-Team to find Tia in the season four finale, during which Fulbright was killed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fifth season introduced General Hunt Stockwell (Robert Vaughn) who, while serving as the team's primary antagonist, was also the team's boss and joined them on several missions. He was often assisted by Carla (Judith Ledford, sometimes credited as Judy Ledford).\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn \\"Hannibal\\" Smith is a master of disguise. His most used disguise (onscreen only on the pilot episode) is Mr. Lee, the dry cleaner. This is one of the final parts of the client screening process, as he tells the client where to go in order to make full contact with the A-Team. He dresses most often in a white safari jacket and black leather gloves. He also is constantly seen smoking a cigar. Hannibal carries either a Browning Hi-Power, Colt M1911A1 or a Smith & Wesson Model 39 as a sidearm, most often \\"Mexican carried\\" although he uses a holster when on missions. His catchphrase is \\"I love it when a plan comes together\\". Often said, usually by B.A., to be \\"on the jazz\\" when in the fury of completing a mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nTempleton \\"Faceman\\" Peck is a master of the persuasive arts. The team's scrounger, he can get virtually anything he sets his mind to, usually exploiting women with sympathy-appeal and flirtation. However, he is not without integrity, as stated by Murdock in the episode \\"Family Reunion\\": \\"He would rip the shirt off his back for you, and then scam one for himself.\\" Faceman is also the A-Team's accountant. He dresses suavely, often appearing in suits. Faceman carries a Colt Lawman Mk III revolver for protection, and drives a custom white 1984 Corvette with red trim.\\r\\n\\r\\nBosco \\"B.A.\\" (Bad Attitude) Baracus is the muscle for the A-Team, able to perform exceptional feats of strength. He is also the team's mechanic. Baracus affects a dislike for Murdock, calling him a \\"crazy fool\\", but his true feelings of friendship are revealed when he prevents Murdock from drowning in his desire to live like a fish. Baracus also has a deep fear of flying, and the others usually have to trick and/or knock him out in order to get him on an aircraft. It is very rare that Baracus is awake while flying, and even rarer for him actually to consent to it. When he does, however, he then goes into a catatonic state. Baracus generally wears overalls and leopard or tiger print shirts in the early seasons, then later wears a green jumpsuit in the later seasons. He is almost always seen with about 50 pounds of gold necklaces, rings on every finger, and also wears a weightlifting belt. Baracus' hair is always styled in a mohawk-like cut. He drives a customized black GMC van that acts as the team's usual mode of transport.\\r\\n\\r\\nH.M. \\"Howling Mad\\" Murdock is the A-Team's pilot, and can fly any kind of aircraft with considerable skill. However, due to a helicopter crash in Vietnam, Murdock apparently went insane. He lives in a Veterans' Hospital in the mental wing. Whenever the rest of the team requires a pilot, they have to break him out of the hospital, generally using Faceman to do so. In Seasons 1ÿ4, Murdock has a different pet, imaginary friend, or persona in each episode. Whenever one of his pets or imaginary friends is killed by an enemy, Murdock snaps and takes revenge (but never kills). Many times, when Baracus is mad at Murdock for being crazy, Hannibal will side with Murdock in a sympathetic way. Once he is discharged from the hospital in Season 5, Murdock has a different job each episode.  Murdock usually wears a leather flight jacket, a baseball cap, and basketball sneakers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the part of Face was written by Frank Lupo and Stephen J. Cannell with Dirk Benedict in mind, NBC insisted that the part should be played by another actor, instead.  Therefore, in the pilot, Face was portrayed by Tim Dunigan, who was later replaced by Dirk Benedict, with the comment that Dunigan was \\"too tall and too young\\".[18] According to Dunigan: \\"I look even younger on camera than I am. So it was difficult to accept me as a veteran of the Vietnam War, which ended when I was a sophomore in high school.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrere was intended to join the principal cast of the show in its fifth season after appearing in the season four finale,[17] providing a tie to the team's inception during the war. Unfortunately for this plan, Carrere was under contract to General Hospital, which prevented her from joining The A-Team. Her character was abruptly dropped as a result.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Mr. T's account in Bring Back... The A-Team in 2006, the role of B. A. Baracus was written specifically for him. This is corroborated by Stephen J. Cannell's own account of the initial concept proposed by Tartikoff.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Coburn, who co-starred in The Magnificent Seven, was considered for the role of Hannibal in The A-Team, while George Peppard (Hannibal) was the original consideration for the role of Vin (played by Steve McQueen instead) in The Magnificent Seven.[16] Robert Vaughn, of course, actually appeared in the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Dirk Benedict, Robert Vaughn was actually added to the cast in season 5 because of his friendship with the notoriously prickly George Peppard. It was hoped that Vaughn would help ease worsening tensions between Peppard and Mr. T. In a later interview, Vaughn recounted how T's verbosity and loud personality would get on everyone's nerves, including his, even though he had been hired specifically because of his easy going and calming personality.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable guest stars included:\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the show's first three seasons, The A-Team managed to pull in 17% to 20% of the American households on average. The first regular episode (\\"Children of Jamestown\\"), reached 26.4% of the television watching audience, placing fourth in the top 10 rated shows, according to the Nielsen ratings.[6]  By March, The A-Team, now on its regular Tuesday timeslot, dropped to the eight spot, but rated a 20.5%.[20]  During the sweeps week in May of that year, The A-Team dropped again but remained steady at 18.5%,[21] and rose to 18.8% during the second week of May sweeps.[22]  These were the highest ratings NBC had achieved in five years.[23]  During the second season, the ratings continued to soar, reaching third place in the twenty-highest rated programs, behind Dallas and Simon & Simon, in January (mid-season),[24] while during the third season, it was beaten out only by four other NBC shows, including The Cosby Show.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth season saw The A-Team experience a dramatic fall in ratings, as it started to lose its position while television viewership increased. As such, the ratings, while stable, were relatively less. The season premiere ranked a 17.4% (a 26% audience share on that timeslot) on the Nielsen Rating scale,[25] but after ratings quickly declined.  In October, The A-Team had fallen to the 19th and by Super Bowl Night had fallen still to 29th the night on which the show had originally scored its first hit three years before.[26] For the remainder of its fourth season The A-Team managed to hang around the 20th spot, far from original top 10 position it had enjoyed during its first three seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter four years on Tuesday, NBC decided to move The A-Team to a new timeslot on Friday for what would be its final season. Ratings continued to drop, and after seven episodes, The A-Team fell out of the top 50 altogether with a 13.3 Nielsen Rating.[27] In November 1986, NBC cancelled the series, declining to order the last nine episodes of what would have been a 22-episode season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series has achieved cult status through heavy syndication in the U.S. and internationally. It has also remained popular overseas, such as in the United Kingdom, where the show has been on-air almost continuously in some form since it was first shown in July 1983. It is airing on satellite and cable channel Esquire Network. The series was to begin airing over NBC-TV's OTA digital subchannel network, Cozi TV, in January 2016.[29]  Forces TV started showing the series every weekday since October 17, 2016.  The series has been airing in Spanish on Telemundo-TV's OTA digital subchannel network, TeleXitos since December 2014.  The series is currently available through Starz, ELREY, and COZY TV.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A-Team has been broadcast all over the world; international response has been varied. In 1984, the main cast members of The A-Team, George Peppard, Mr. T, Dirk Benedict and Dwight Schultz were invited to the Netherlands. George Peppard was the first to receive the invitation and thus thought the invitation applied only to him. When the other cast members were also invited, Peppard declined, leaving only Mr. T, Benedict and Schultz to visit the Netherlands.[30] The immense turn-out for the stars was unforeseen, and they were forced to leave early as a security measure. A video was released with the present actors in which Dwight Schultz apologized and thanked everyone that had attended.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia The A-Team was broadcast on Channel Ten. From 2010 7mate has been showing reruns of show. The show was broadcast in New Zealand on TV2. In Brazil, the series was broadcast on SBT from 1984 to 1989, later moving to Rede Globo in the early 1990s. In the UK, the program was shown on ITV, starting on Friday, July 22, 1983; when it returned for its second run (resuming mid-second season) it moved to Saturday evenings. The series continued to be repeated on ITV until 1994. The series was later repeated on UK Gold from 1997 through 2007 at various times. It was also repeated on Bravo from 1997 to 1999.  It returned to the channel in 2008 until the channels closure in 2011. In 2017 the digital channel Spike began showing the series from the beginning. Channel 5 also repeated it in 2017. Although ratings soared during its early seasons, many television critics described the show largely as cartoonish and thereby wrote the series off. Most reviews focused on acting and the formulaic nature of the episodes, most prominently the absence of actual killing in a show about Vietnam War veterans.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary Harron, New Statesman[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe violence presented in The A-Team is highly sanitized. People do not bleed or bruise when hit (though they might develop a limp or require a sling), nor do the members of the A-Team kill people. The results of violence were only ever presented when it was required for the script. In almost every car crash there is a short take showing the occupants of the vehicle climbing out of the mangled or burning wreck, even in helicopter crashes. However, more of these types of takes were dropped near the end of the fourth season.  According to Stephen J. Cannell, this part of the show did become a running joke for the writing staff and they would at times test the limits of realism on purpose.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show has been described as cartoonish and likened to Tom and Jerry.  Dean P. of the Courier-Mail described the violence in the show as \\"hypocritical\\" and that \\"the morality of giving the impression that a hail of bullets does no-one any harm is ignored.  After all, Tom and Jerry survived all sorts of mayhem for years with no ill-effects.\\"[34] Television reviewer Ric Meyers joked that the A-Team used \\"antineutron bulletsthey destroy property for miles around, but never harm a human being\\".[35]  According to certain estimates, an episode of the A-Team held up to 46 violent acts. Stephen J. Cannell, co-creator of the show responds: \\"They were determined to make a point, and we were too big a target to resist. Cartoon violence is a scapegoat issue.\\"[2] Originally, The A-Team's status as a hit show remained strong, but it ultimately lost out to more family-oriented shows such as The Cosby Show, Who's the Boss? and Growing Pains.[2]  John J. O'Connor of The New York Times wrote in a 1986 article that \\"...a substantial number of viewers, if the ratings in recent months are to be believed, are clearly fed up with mindless violence of the car-chasing, fist-slugging variety\\".[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring its tenure, the show was occasionally criticized for being sexist.[16] These critiques were based on the notion that most female roles on the show were either a lead-in to the episode's plot, the recipient of Face's affections, or both. The only two regular female members of the cast, Melinda Culea (season 1 and the first half of season 2) and Marla Heasley (the latter half of season 2) did not have long tenures with the show. Both Culea and Heasley had been brought in by the network and producers to stem these critiques, hoping that a female character would properly balance the otherwise all-male cast.[37] Culea was fired during the second season because of creative differences between her and the show's writers; she wanted more lines and more action scenes.[38] Culea's character of Amy Allen suddenly disappeared between two episodes, and was only briefly referred to once in the episode \\"In Plane Sight\\", and a couple of times in \\"The Battle of Bel Air\\" in which she was cited to have taken a correspondence job overseas (in Jakarta, Indonesia). The latter episode also introduced Heasley's character, Tawnia Baker. The new character was also an assisting reporter character, but with a more fragile and seductive quality to her. Ultimately, she was written out of the show at the start of the third season when the network determined that a female cast member was not necessary. Tawnia left the team on-screen, choosing to marry and move out of Los Angeles.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Marla Heasley recounts in Bring Back... The A-Team (May 18, 2006), although sexism was not prevalent on the set per se, there was a sense that a female character was not necessary on the show. On her first day on set George Peppard took her aside and told her \\"We don't want you on the show. None of the guys want you here. The only reason you're here is because the network and the producers want you. For some reason they think they need a girl.\\"  The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again, saying: \\"I'm sorry that this is your last day, but remember what I said the very first day, that we didn't want a girl, has nothing to do with you. You were very professional, but no reason to have a girl.\\"  In Bring Back... the A-Team, Dirk Benedict also remarked that: \\"It was a guy's show. It was male driven. It was written by guys. It was directed by guys. It was acted by guys. It's about what guys do. We talked the way guys talked. We were the boss. We were the God. We smoked when we wanted. We shot guns when we wanted. We kissed the girls and made them cry... when we wanted. It was the last truly masculine show.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1983 GMC Vandura van used by the A-Team, with its characteristic red stripe, black and red turbine mag wheels, and rooftop spoiler,[39] has become an enduring pop culture icon. The customized 1994 Chevrolet G20 used on the A-Team movie was also on display at the 2010 New York International Auto Show.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of devices were seen in the back of the van in different episodes, including a mini printing press (\\"Pros and Cons\\"), an audio surveillance recording device (\\"A Small and Deadly War\\"), Hannibal's disguise kits in various episodes, and a gun storage locker.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly examples of the van had a red GMC logo on the front grille, and an additional GMC logo on the rear left door. Early in the second season, these logos were blacked out, although GMC continued to supply vans and receive a credit on the closing credits of each episode.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe van was commonly said to be all-black,[citation needed] but the section above the red stripe was metallic gray. The angle of the rear spoiler can also be seen to vary on different examples of the van within the series. Additionally, some versions of the van have a sunroof, whereas others, typically those used for stunts (and including the one displayed in the aforementioned Cars of the Stars Motor Museum) do not. This led to continuity errors in some episodes, such as in the third season's \\"The Bells of St. Mary's\\", in a scene where Face (his double) jumps from a building onto the roof of the van with no sunroof. Moments later, in an interior studio shot, Face climbs in through the sunroof. Also, in many stunts where the van would surely be totaled, other makes have been used, such as a black Ford Econoline with red hubcaps painted to simulate the original red turbine mag wheels.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany GMC/Chevrolet Vandura vans, and many of the very similar Bedford CF vans, were styled after the A-Team's van by fans of the show.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe huge success of the series saw a vast array of merchandise, including toys and snacks released both in America and internationally. There were several sets trading cards and stickers, action figures of the characters were produced by Galoob as well as vehicles, including B.A.'s van and Face's Corvette (available in several different sizes), as well as items such as helicopters, trucks and jeeps to fit in with the line, from model car manufacturer Ertl. Some of the other array of items available included jigsaw puzzles, View-Master reels containing 21 3-D pictures (over three reels) of the second seasonA-Team story \\"When You Comin' Back, Range Rider?\\", was produced by View-Master International (available both as a pack of reels, and also as a \\"gift set\\" with 3-D viewer), an electric race car track with A-Team vehicle covers instead of normal cars, and a TYCO produced train set with various accessories and pieces themed for the A-Team look. The set includes a Baldwin shark nose engine painted up like the Van and a matching Caboose. \\r\\nFollowing the original cancellation of the series, further merchandise has appeared as the series has achieved cult status, including an A-Team van by \\"Hot Wheels\\". In 2016 Lego released a pack that includes a B.A. Baracus minifigure and constructible van; the pack will unlock additional A-Team themed content in the video game Lego Dimensions, including all four team members as playable characters.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarvel Comics produced a three-issue A-Team comic book series, which was later reprinted as a trade paperback. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, an A-Team comic strip appeared for several years in the 1980s as part of the children's television magazine and comic Look-In, to tie in with the British run of the series. It was preceded, though, by a short run in the final year (1984) of TV Comic, drawn by Jim Eldridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral novels were based on the series, the first six published in America by Dell and in Britain by Target Books; the last four were only published in Britain. The first six are credited to Charles Heath. The books are generally found in paperback form, although hardback copies (with different cover artwork) were also released. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom from 1985 to 1988, four Annuals were produced, each consisting of text and comic strip stories, puzzles, and photos of the show's stars, with a further one produced by Marvel Comics consisting of several reprinted comic strips, released in 1989/1990. \\r\\n\\r\\nA Panini set of stickers, which adapted six TV episodes (from the first and earlier second season) using shots from the episodes,  could be stick into an accompanying book, with text under each inserted sticker to narrate the story.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original main theme composed by Mike Post and Pete Carpenter[42] (in a performance credited to Post) was released on the vinyl LP Mike Post?ÿ Television Theme Songs (Elektra Records E1-60028Y, 1982) and again on the Mike Post?ÿ Mike Post LP (RCA Records AFL1-5183, 1984), both long out-of-print; however, this was not the same version of the theme as heard on-screen. The theme, as heard on seasons two through four (including the opening narration and sound effects), was also released on TVT's Television's Greatest Hits: 70s and 80s.  A 7\\" single of the song credited to Post was released on RCA in 1984.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French version of the song had lyrics, which mirrored the spoken description of the show in the English opening credits.[44] The theme has been ranked among the best TV themes ever written, with TV weatherman Al Roker sharing that opinion, and using the song to \\"get jazzed up\\" in the morning.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough no original music other than the theme has been released, in 1984 EMI issued an album of re-recorded material from the series conducted by Daniel Caine (reissued by Silva Screen on compact disc in 1999, SILVAD 3509).\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring its time, The A-Team was nominated for three Emmy Awards: In 1983 (Outstanding Film Sound Mixing for a Series) for the pilot episode, in 1984 (Outstanding Film Sound Mixing for a Series) for the episode \\"When You Comin' Back, Range Rider?\\" and in 1987 (Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series) for the episode \\"Firing Line\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show featured professional wrestlers such as Hulk Hogan, Professor Toru Tanaka, Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat, The Dynamite Kid, Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan, Davey Boy Smith (The British Bulldog), Big John Studd and Greg \\"The Hammer\\" Valentine, in most cases playing themselves. In the episode \\"Body Slam\\", which featured Hogan, wrestling interviewer and announcer \\"Mean\\" Gene Okerlund also appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the music video for John Cena's \\"Bad, Bad Man\\" (on Cena's You Can't See Me album) featured the Chain Gang as a three-man A-TeamCena as Hannibal, plus Cena's cousin Tha Trademarc as Howling Mad and Bumpy Knuckles as B.A.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early episodes the team used Colt AR-15 SP1 semi-automatic rifles (with automatic sound effects, simulating the M16), while in later seasons they used the Ruger Mini-14, and on rare occasions, the selective fire AC-556K variant of the Mini-14. Hannibal is also seen using an M60 machine gun (which Hannibal called \\"Baby\\") in some episodes as well as a Micro-Uzi.  MAC-11s with parts added to simulate the Uzi appear in at least two early episodes. Hannibal's sidearms are either a nickel-plated Smith & Wesson Model 59, or a stainless steel Smith & Wesson Model 639. Unusually in the episode \\"Black Day At Bad Rock\\" he is seen carrying a Browning Hi-Power. Faceman's usual sidearm is a Colt Lawman III, thou he does use Smith & Wesson revolvers in latter seasons. Many antagonists and members of the team are seen using 1911s as well. Starting from Season 4, the then-exotic Steyr AUG bullpup rifle also became prominent in the series. \\"So many different firearms were used in the 1980s hit 'The A-Team' that its impossible to list them all. For five seasons, the wrongly accused foursome used rifles, handguns, submachine guns and shotguns to bring justice for the little guy while trying to stay out of jail. And the best part had to be that regardless of the number of explosions or rounds fired, nobody ever got seriously hurt except for the occasional flesh wound of a team member.\\"[45] As a result, the American Rifleman declared The A-Team the Number One Show on Television to regularly feature firearms.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nUniversal Studios Home Entertainment has released all five seasons of The A-Team on DVD in Region 1, 2, and 4. In Region 2, a complete series set entitled The A-Team--The Ultimate Collection was released on October 8, 2007.[46] A complete series set was released in Region 1 on June 8, 2010.[47] The set includes 25 discs packaged in a replica of the A-Team's signature black van from the show. The complete series set was released in Region 4 on November 3, 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll 5 seasons were re-released in Region 2 with new packaging on June 21, 2010. The series has been remastered and was released on Blu-ray disc in the United Kingdom on October 17, 2016.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 18, 2006, Channel 4 in the UK attempted to reunite the surviving cast members of The A-Team for the show Bring Back... in an episode titled \\"Bring Back...The A-Team\\".[49] Justin Lee Collins presented the challenge, securing interviews and appearances from Dirk Benedict, Dwight Schultz, Marla Heasley, Jack Ging, series co-creator Stephen Cannell, and Mr. T.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollins eventually managed to bring together Benedict, Schultz, Heasley, Ging and Cannell, along with William Lucking, Lance LeGault, and George Peppard's son, Christian. Mr. T was unable to make the meeting, which took place in the Friar's Club in Beverly Hills, but he did manage to appear on the show for a brief talk with Collins.\\r\\n\\r\\nA feature film based on The A-Team was released on June 11, 2010, and was produced by 20th Century Fox.[50] Both Dirk Benedict (Face) and Dwight Schultz (Murdock) made brief cameo appearances in the film (as a prisoner using a sunbed and a psychiatrist overseeing Murdock's shock therapy, respectively); because of timing issues, these scenes were moved to the end of the credits. They were later reinserted for the extended-cut of the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2015, Fox announced that they were developing a reboot A-Team series with Chris Morgan as executive producer with Cannell's daughter, Tawnia McKiernan, and Albert Kim writing. The team is to be made up of both male and female characters.[51]","input":"When did the a team first air in uk?"},{"output":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2","context":"Harry Potter is a British-American film series based on the Harry Potter novels by author J. K. Rowling. The series is distributed by Warner Bros. and consists of eight fantasy films, beginning with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) and culminating with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2 (2011).[2][3] A spin-off prequel series will consist of five films, starting with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016). The Fantastic Beasts films mark the beginning of a shared media franchise known as J. K. Rowling's Wizarding World.[4]\\r\\nThe series was mainly produced by David Heyman, and stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson as the three leading characters: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. Four directors worked on the series: Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuar܇n, Mike Newell, and David Yates.[5] The screenplays were written by Steve Kloves, with the exception of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007), which was written by Michael Goldenberg. Production took over ten years to complete, with the main story arc following Harry Potter's quest to overcome his arch-enemy Lord Voldemort.[6]\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final novel in the series, was adapted into two feature-length parts.[7] Part 1 was released in November 2010, and Part 2 was released in July 2011.[8][9]\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) is the only film in the series not among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time, with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2, the highest-grossing film in the series and one of 30 films to gross over $1 billion, ranking at number eight.[10] Without inflation adjustment, it is the second highest-grossing film series with $7.7 billion in worldwide receipts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in 1997, film producer David Heyman's London offices received a copy of the first book in what would become Rowling's series of seven Harry Potter novels. The book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was relegated to a low-priority bookshelf, where it was discovered by a secretary who read it and gave it to Heyman with a positive review. Consequently, Heyman, who had originally disliked \\"the rubbish title\\", read the book himself. Highly impressed by Rowling's work, he began the process that led to one of the most successful cinematic franchises of all time.[11]\\r\\nHeyman's enthusiasm led to Rowling's 1999 sale of the film rights for the first four Harry Potter books to Warner Bros. for a reported S1 million (US$2,000,000).[12] A demand Rowling made was that the principal cast be kept strictly British, allowing nevertheless for the inclusion of many Irish actors, such as Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where characters from the book are specified as such.[13] Rowling was hesitant to sell the rights because she \\"didn't want to give them control over the rest of the story\\" by selling the rights to the characters, which would have enabled Warner Bros. to make non-author-written sequels.[14]\\r\\nAlthough Steven Spielberg initially negotiated to direct the first film, he declined the offer.[15] Spielberg wanted the adaptation to be an animated film, with American actor Haley Joel Osment providing Harry Potter's voice.[16] Spielberg contended that, in his opinion, there was every expectation of profit in making the film. He claims that making money would have been like \\"shooting ducks in a barrel. It's just a slam dunk. It's just like withdrawing a billion dollars and putting it into your personal bank accounts. There's no challenge\\".[17] In the \\"Rubbish\\" Bin section of her website, Rowling maintains that she had no role in choosing directors for the films, writing \\"Anyone who thinks I could (or would) have 'veto-ed' him [Spielberg] needs their Quick-Quotes Quill serviced.\\"[18]\\r\\nAfter Spielberg left, conversations began with other directors, including Chris Columbus, Jonathan Demme, Terry Gilliam, Mike Newell, Alan Parker, Wolfgang Petersen, Rob Reiner, Tim Robbins, Brad Silberling, and Peter Weir.[19] Petersen and Reiner both pulled out of the running in March 2000.[20] It was then narrowed down to Columbus, Gilliam, Parker, and Silberling.[21] Rowling's first choice was Terry Gilliam.[22] However, on 28 March 2000 Columbus was appointed as director of the film, with Warner Bros. citing his work on other family films such as Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire as influences for their decision.[23]\\r\\nHarry Potter is the kind of timeless literary achievement that comes around once in a lifetime. Since the books have generated such a passionate following across the world, it was important to us to find a director that has an affinity for both children and magic. I can't think of anyone more ideally suited for this job than Chris [Columbus].\\r\\nSteve Kloves was selected to write the screenplay for the first film. He described adapting the book as \\"tough\\" since it did not \\"lend itself to adaptation as well as the next two books\\". Kloves was sent a \\"raft\\" of synopses of books proposed as film adaptations, with Harry Potter being the only one that jumped out at him. He went out and bought the book, becoming an instant fan. When speaking to Warner Bros. he stated that the film had to be British and true to the characters.[24] David Heyman was confirmed to produce the film.[23] Rowling received a large amount of creative control for the film, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.[25]\\r\\nWarner Bros. had initially planned to release the first film over the 4 July 2001 weekend, making for such a short production window that several of the originally proposed directors had withdrawn themselves from contention. Eventually, due to time constraints, the date was put back to 16 November 2001.[26]\\r\\nIn 2000, after a seven-month search, lead actor Daniel Radcliffe was discovered by producer David Heyman and writer Steve Kloves seated just behind them in a theatre. In Heyman's own words, \\"There sitting behind me was this boy with these big blue eyes. It was Dan Radcliffe. I remember my first impressions: He was curious and funny and so energetic. There was real generosity too, and sweetness. But at the same time he was really voracious and with hunger for knowledge of whatever kind.\\"[11]\\r\\nRadcliffe had already established himself as an actor in the 1999 BBC television production of David Copperfield in which he played the title role's childhood years. Heyman persuaded Radcliffe's parents to allow him to audition for the part of Harry Potter, which involved Radcliffe being filmed.[11] (This screen test footage was released via the first set of Ultimate Editions in 2009.)[27] Rowling was enthusiastic after viewing Radcliffe's filmed test, saying she didn't think there was a better choice for the part of Harry Potter.[11][28]\\r\\nAlso in 2000, the then unknown British actors Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were selected from thousands of auditioning children to play the roles of Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, respectively. Their only previous acting experience was in school plays. Grint was eleven years old and Watson ten at the time they were cast.[29]\\r\\nLos Angeles Times writer Geoff Boucher, who conducted the above-mentioned interview with Heyman, added that the casting of the three major roles \\"is especially impressive in hindsight. The trio's selection was arguably one of the best show-business decisions over the past decade... they have shown admirable grace and steadiness in the face of teen superstardom.\\"[11][28]\\r\\nFilming of the series began at Leavesden Studios, Hertfordshire, England, in September 2000 and ended in December 2010, with post-production on the final film lasting until summer 2011.[6] Leavesden Studios was the main base for filming Harry Potter, and it opened to the public as a studio tour in 2012 (renamed as Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden).[30]\\r\\nDavid Heyman produced all the films in the series with his production company Heyday Films, while David Barron joined the series as an executive producer on Chamber of Secrets and Goblet of Fire. Barron was later appointed producer on the last four films. Chris Columbus was an executive producer on the first two films alongside Mark Radcliffe and Michael Barnathan, but he became a producer on the third film alongside Heyman and Radcliffe. Other executive producers include Tanya Seghatchian and Lionel Wigram. J. K. Rowling, author of the series, was asked to become a producer on Goblet of Fire but declined. She subsequently accepted the role on the two-part Deathly Hallows.[31]\\r\\nHeyday Films and Columbus' company 1492 Pictures collaborated with Duncan Henderson Productions in 2001, Miracle Productions in 2002, and P of A Productions in 2004. Even though Prisoner of Azkaban was the final film produced by 1492 Pictures, Heyday Films continued with the franchise and collaborated with Patalex IV Productions in 2005. The sixth film in the series, Half-Blood Prince, was the most expensive film to produce as of 2009[update].\\r\\nWarner Bros. split the seventh and final novel in the series, Deathly Hallows, into two cinematic parts. The two parts were filmed back-to-back from early 2009 to summer 2010, with the completion of reshoots taking place on 21 December 2010; this marked the end of filming Harry Potter. Heyman stated that Deathly Hallows was \\"shot as one film\\" but released in two feature-length parts.[32]\\r\\nTim Burke, the visual effects supervisor of the series, said of the production on Harry Potter, \\"It was this huge family; I think there were over 700 people working at Leavesden, an industry in itself.\\" David Heyman said, \\"When the first film opened, no way did I think we'd make eight films. That didn't seem feasible until after we'd done the fourth.\\" Nisha Parti, the production consultant on the first film, said that Heyman \\"made the first film very much the way he felt the studio Warner Bros. wanted to make it.\\" After the film's success, Heyman was given \\"more freedom\\".[33]\\r\\nOne of the aims of the filmmakers from the beginning of production was to develop the maturity of the films. Chris Columbus stated, \\"We realised that these movies would get progressively darker. Again, we didn't know how dark but we realised that as the kids get older, the movies get a little edgier and darker.\\"[34] This transpired with the succeeding three directors who would work on the series in the following years, with the films beginning to deal with issues such as death, betrayal, prejudice, and political corruption as the series developed narratively and thematically.[5][35]\\r\\nAfter Chris Columbus had finished working on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, he was hired to direct the second film, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. The production started within a week after the release of the first film. Columbus was set to direct all entries in the series,[36] but he did not want to return for the third film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, claiming he was \\"burned out\\".[37] He moved to the position of producer, while Alfonso Cuar܇n was approached for the role of director. He was initially nervous about directing the instalment since he had not read any of the books or seen the films. After reading the series, he changed his mind and signed on to direct since he had immediately connected to the story.[38]\\r\\nBecause Cuar܇n decided not to direct the fourth instalment, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a new director had to be selected.[39] Mike Newell was chosen to direct the film, but he declined to direct the next film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which was given to David Yates, who also directed Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, becoming the only director to helm more than one film since Chris Columbus.\\r\\nChris Columbus said his vision of the first two films was of a \\"golden storybook, an old-fashioned look\\", while Alfonso Cuar܇n changed the visual tone of the series, desaturated the colour palette, and expanded the landscape around Hogwarts.[34][39] Mike Newell decided to direct the fourth film as a \\"paranoid thriller\\", while David Yates wanted to \\"bring a sense of jeopardy and character to the world\\".[40][41] Cuar܇n, Newell, and Yates have said that their challenge was striking a balance between making the films according to their individual vision, while working within a cinematic world already established by Columbus.[39][40][41]\\r\\nDavid Heyman commented on the \\"generosity of the directors\\" by revealing that \\"Chris spent time with Alfonso, Alfonso spent time with Mike and Mike spent time with David, showing him an early cut of the film, talking through what it means to be a director and how they went about [making the films].\\"[42]\\r\\nDavid Heyman also said, \\"I suppose Chris Columbus was the most conservative choice from the studio's point of view. But he expressed real passion.\\"[33] Producer Tanya Seghatchian said they were \\"more adventurous\\" in choosing a director for the third film and went straight to Alfonso Cuar܇n.[33] Mike Newell became the first British director of the series when he was chosen for the fourth film; Newell was considered to direct the first film before he dropped out.[33] David Yates directed the final films after David Heyman thought him capable of handling the edgy, emotional, and political material of the later novels.[43]\\r\\nAll the directors have been supportive of each other. Chris Columbus praised the character development in the films, while Alfonso Cuar܇n admired the \\"quiet poetry\\" of David Yates' films.[34][39] Mike Newell noted that each director had a different heroism, and David Yates views the first four films \\"respectfully and enjoy[s] them.\\"[40][41] Daniel Radcliffe said Yates \\"took the charm of the films that Chris made and the visual flair of everything that Alfonso did and the thoroughly British, bombastic nature of the film directed by Mike Newell\\" and added \\"his own sense\\" of realism.[44]\\r\\nSteve Kloves wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film, which was penned by Michael Goldenberg. Kloves had direct assistance from J.K. Rowling, though she allowed him what he described as \\"tremendous elbow room\\". Rowling asked Kloves to remain faithful to the spirit of the books; thus, the plot and tone of each film and its corresponding book are virtually the same, albeit with some changes and omissions for purposes of cinematic style, time, and budget constraints. Michael Goldenberg also received input from Rowling during his adaptation of the fifth novel; Goldenberg was originally considered to adapt the first novel before the studio chose Kloves.[45]\\r\\nIn a 2010 interview, David Heyman briefly explained the book-to-film transition. He commented on Rowling's involvement in the series, stating that she understood that \\"books and films are different\\" and was \\"the best support\\" a producer could have. Rowling had overall approval on the scripts, which were viewed and discussed by the director and the producers. Heyman also said that Kloves was the \\"key voice\\" in the process of adapting the novels and that certain aspects from the books needed to have been excluded from the scripts due to the filmmakers' decision to keep the main focus on Harry's journey as a character, which would ultimately give the films a defined structure. Heyman mentioned that some fans \\"don't necessarily understand the adaptation process\\" and that the filmmakers would have loved to \\"have everything\\" from the books in the films but noted that it was not possible since they had \\"neither time nor cinematic structure\\" to do so. He finished by saying that adapting a novel to the screen is \\"a really considered process.\\"[46]\\r\\nBecause the films were being made as the novels were being published, the filmmakers had no idea of the story's outcome until the release of the final novel in 2007. Kloves spoke of his relationship with Rowling when adapting the novels by saying, \\"The thing is about Jo, which is remarkable for someone who had no experience with the filmmaking process, was her intuition. We had a conversation the very first day I met her where she said, 'I know the movies can't be the books... because I know what's coming and it's impossible to fully dramatise on screen what I'm going to write. But I just ask you to be true to the characters; that's all I care about.'\\"[47] Kloves also said, \\"I don't know what compelled me to say this [to Rowling], but I said, 'I've just got to warn you my favourite character is not Harry. My favourite character is Hermione.' And I think for some weird reason, from that moment on, she sort of trusted me.\\"[47]\\r\\nAside from the three lead actors, other notable cast members include Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, and Dame Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall. Richard Harris, who played the role of Professor Albus Dumbledore, died on 25 October 2002 causing the role to be re-cast for the third instalment, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. David Heyman and director Alfonso Cuar܇n chose Michael Gambon to portray the character of Dumbledore, which he did for all succeeding films. Notable recurring cast members include Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, Warwick Davis as Filius Flitwick, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody, Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley, Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley, Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew, David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Emma Thompson as Sybill Trelawney, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, and Julie Walters as Molly Weasley.\\r\\nThe series has seen many returning crew members from various departments, including Tim Burke, visual effects supervisor; Peter Doyle, digital film colourist; Nick Dudman, make-up and creature effects designer; David Holmes, stunt double; Amanda Knight, make-up artist; Stephenie McMillan, set designer; Greg Powell, stunt coordinator; Jany Temime, costume designer; and Fiona Weir, casting director.\\r\\nThe production designer for all eight films is Stuart Craig. Assisted by Stephenie McMillan, Craig has created iconic sets pieces including the Ministry of Magic, the Chamber of Secrets, Malfoy Manor, and the layout for the CGI Horcrux Cave. Because the novels were being published as the films were being made, Craig was required to rebuild some sets for future films and alter the design of Hogwarts.[50]\\r\\nHe said, \\"In the early days, every time you saw the exterior of Hogwarts, it was a physical miniature,\\" which was made by craftsmen and occupied a large sound stage.[52][53] \\"We ended up with a profile of how Hogwarts looked, a skyline that actually I didn't design, and it wasn't always satisfactory, and as all the novels got written and movies got made there were new requirements [for buildings]. The [Astronomy Tower] definitely wasn't there originally, and so we were able to add that substantial piece. And in the last film, we needed an arena for the battle for Hogwarts ÿ the big courtyard outside doubled in size, and if you look at the first movie it wasn't there at all. There were quite some liberties taken with the continuity of Hogwarts.\\"[54] In the last film, Craig used a digital model instead of a miniature to \\"embrace the latest technology\\".[53]\\r\\nOn the method of creating the sets, Craig said he often started by sketching ideas onto a blank sheet of paper.[55] Stephanie McMillan also said that \\"each film always had plenty of new challenges,\\" citing the changes in visual style between directors and cinematographers as an example, along with the developing story in the novels. Due to J.K. Rowling's descriptions of various settings in the novels, Craig noted his \\"responsibility was to place it together\\".[56]\\r\\nCraig commented on his experience working in the studio environment: \\"I'm the production designer, but on a big movie like Harry Potter I may be responsible for 30 to 35 people; from the supervising art director, and a team of art directors and assistants, to draughtsmen and junior draughtsmen, and then on to model makers, sculptors and scenic artists.\\" He said, \\"Ten years ago, all the Harry Potter drawings were done in pencil. I would take my roughs and plans and sections and give them to a professional architectural illustrator, who would create concept art using pencil and colour wash on watercolour paper.\\" He said the process changed slightly throughout the years due to, what he called, the \\"digital revolution\\" of making films.[53]\\r\\nWhen filming of the series was completed, some of Craig's sets had to be rebuilt or transported for them to be displayed at the Warner Bros. studio tour.[52]\\r\\nSix directors of photography worked on the series: John Seale on the first film, Roger Pratt on the second and fourth, Michael Seresin on the third, S?awomir Idziak on the fifth, Bruno Delbonnel on the sixth, and Eduardo Serra on the seventh and eighth. Delbonnel was considered to return for both parts of Deathly Hallows, but he declined, stating that he was \\"scared of repeating\\" himself.[57] Delbonnel's cinematography in Half-Blood Prince gained the series its only Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography. As the series progressed, each cinematographer faced the challenge of shooting and lighting older sets (which had been around since the first few films) in unique and different ways.[58] Chris Columbus said the series' vivid colouring decreased as each film was made.[34][59]\\r\\nMichael Seresin commented on the change of visual style from the first two films to Prisoner of Azkaban: \\"The lighting is moodier, with more shadowing and cross-lighting.\\" Seresin and Alfonso Cuar܇n moved away from the strongly coloured and brightly lit cinematography of the first two films, with dimmer lighting and a more muted colour palette being utilised for the succeeding five films.[60] After comparing a range of digital cameras with 35?mm film, Bruno Delbonnel decided to shoot the sixth movie, Half-Blood Prince, on film rather than the increasingly popular digital format. This decision was kept for the two-part Deathly Hallows with Eduardo Serra, who said that he preferred to work with film because it was \\"more technically accurate and dependable\\".[61]\\r\\nBecause the majority of Deathly Hallows takes place in various settings away from Hogwarts, David Yates wanted to \\"shake things up\\" by using different photographic techniques such as using hand-held cameras and very wide camera lenses.[62] Eduardo Serra said, \\"Sometimes we are combining elements shot by the main unit, a second unit, and the visual effects unit. You have to know what is being captured ÿ colours, contrast, et cetera ÿ with mathematical precision.\\" He noted that with Stuart Craig's \\"amazing sets and the story\\", the filmmakers could not \\"stray too far from the look of the previous Harry Potter films.\\"[61][63]\\r\\nAlong with continuous changes in cinematographers, there have been five film editors to work in post-production on the series: Richard Francis-Bruce edited the first instalment, Peter Honess the second, Steven Weisberg the third, Mick Audsley the fourth, and Mark Day films five through eight.\\r\\nThe Harry Potter series has had four composers. John Williams scored the first three films: Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, and Prisoner of Azkaban. However, the second entry was adapted and conducted by William Ross due to Williams's conflicting commitments. Williams also created Hedwig's Theme, which is used in every film in the series.\\r\\nAfter Williams left the series to pursue other projects, Patrick Doyle scored the fourth entry, Goblet of Fire, which was directed by Mike Newell, with whom Doyle had worked previously. In 2006, Nicholas Hooper started work on the score to Order of the Phoenix by reuniting with director David Yates. Hooper also composed the soundtrack to Half-Blood Prince but decided not to return for the final films.\\r\\nIn January 2010, Alexandre Desplat was confirmed to compose the score for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 1.[64] The film's orchestration started in the summer with Conrad Pope, the orchestrator on the first three Harry Potter films, collaborating with Desplat. Pope commented that the music \\"reminds one of the old days.\\"[65] Desplat returned to score Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2 in 2011.[66]\\r\\nDirector David Yates stated that he wanted John Williams to return to the series for the final installment, but their schedules did not align due to the urgent demand for a rough cut of the film.[67] The final recording sessions of Harry Potter took place on 27 May 2011 at Abbey Road Studios with the London Symphony Orchestra, orchestrator Conrad Pope, and composer Alexandre Desplat.[68]\\r\\nDoyle, Hooper, and Desplat introduced their own personal themes to their respective soundtracks, while keeping a few of John Williams's themes.\\r\\nThere have been many visual effects companies to work on the Harry Potter series. Some of these include Rising Sun Pictures, Double Negative, Cinesite, Framestore, and Industrial Light & Magic. The latter three have worked on all the films in the series, while Double Negative and Rising Sun Pictures began their commitments with Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire, respectively. Framestore contributed by developing many memorable creatures and sequences to the series.[69] Cinesite was involved in producing both miniature and digital effects for the films.[70] Producer David Barron said that \\"Harry Potter created the UK effects industry as we know it. On the first film, all the complicated visual effects were done on the [US] west coast. But on the second, we took a leap of faith and gave much of what would normally be given to Californian vendors to UK ones. They came up trumps.\\" Tim Burke, the visual effects supervisor, said many studios \\"are bringing their work to UK effects companies. Every facility is fully booked, and that wasn't the case before Harry Potter. That's really significant.\\"[33]\\r\\nOn 12 June 2010, filming of the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 1 and Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2 was completed with actor Warwick Davis stating on his Twitter account, \\"The end of an Era ÿ today is officially the last day of principal photography on 'Harry Potter' ÿ ever. I feel honoured to be here as the director shouts cut for the very last time. Farewell Harry & Hogwarts, it's been magic!\\".[71] However, reshoots of the epilogue scene were confirmed to begin in the winter of 2010. The filming was completed on 21 December 2010, marking the official closure of filming the Harry Potter franchise.[72] Exactly four years earlier on that day, author J. K. Rowling's official website revealed the title of the final novel in the series ÿ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[73]\\r\\nHarry Potter is an orphaned boy brought up by his unkind Muggle (non-magical) aunt and uncle. At the age of eleven, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid informs him that he is actually a wizard and that his parents were murdered by an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Voldemort also attempted to kill one-year-old Harry on the same night, but his killing curse mysteriously rebounded and reduced him to a weak and helpless form. Harry became extremely famous in the Wizarding World as a result. Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and learns about magic. During the year, Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger become entangled in the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone which is being kept within the school.\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione return to Hogwarts for their second year, which proves to be more challenging than the last. The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, leaving students and ghosts petrified by an unleashed monster. Harry must face up to claims that he is the heir of Salazar Slytherin (founder of the Chamber), learn that he can speak Parseltongue, and also discover the properties of a mysterious diary, only to find himself trapped within the Chamber of Secrets itself.\\r\\nHarry Potter's third year sees the boy wizard, along with his friends, attending Hogwarts School once again. Professor R. J. Lupin joins the staff as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, while convicted murderer Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban Prison. The Ministry of Magic entrusts the Dementors of Azkaban to guard Hogwarts from Black. Harry learns more about his past and his connection with the escaped prisoner.\\r\\nDuring Harry's fourth year, Hogwarts plays host to a legendary event: the Triwizard Tournament. Three European schools participate in the tournament, with three 'champions' representing each school in the deadly tasks. The Goblet of Fire chooses Fleur Delacour, Viktor Krum, and Cedric Diggory to compete against each other. However, curiously, Harry's name is also produced from the Goblet thus making him a fourth champion, which results in a terrifying encounter with a reborn Lord Voldemort.\\r\\nHarry's fifth year begins with him being attacked by Dementors in Little Whinging. Later, he finds out that the Ministry of Magic is in denial of Lord Voldemort's return. Harry is also beset by disturbing and realistic nightmares, while Professor Umbridge, a representative of Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Harry becomes aware that Voldemort is after a prophecy which reveals: \\"neither can live while the other survives\\". The rebellion involving the students of Hogwarts, secret organisation Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry of Magic, and the Death Eaters begins.\\r\\nIn Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters are increasing their terror upon the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore persuades his old friend Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as a professor as there is a vacancy to fill. There is a more important reason, however, for Slughorn's return. While in a Potions lesson, Harry takes possession of a strangely annotated school textbook, inscribed 'This is the property of the Half-Blood Prince'. Draco Malfoy struggles to carry out a deed presented to him by Voldemort. Meanwhile, Dumbledore and Harry secretly work together to discover the method on how to destroy the Dark Lord once and for all.\\r\\nAfter unexpected events at the end of the previous year, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are entrusted with a quest to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's secret to immortality ÿ the Horcruxes. It is supposed to be their final year at Hogwarts, but the collapse of the Ministry of Magic and Voldemort's rise to power prevents them from attending. The trio undergo a long journey with many obstacles in their path including Death Eaters, Snatchers, the mysterious Deathly Hallows, and Harry's connection with the Dark Lord's mind becoming ever stronger.\\r\\nAfter destroying one Horcrux and discovering the significance of the three Deathly Hallows, Harry, Ron and Hermione continue to seek the other Horcruxes in an attempt to destroy Voldemort, who has now obtained the powerful Elder Wand. The Dark Lord discovers Harry's hunt for Horcruxes and launches an attack on Hogwarts School, where the trio return for one last stand against the dark forces that threaten the Wizarding and Muggle worlds.\\r\\nThe rights for the first four novels in the series were sold to Warner Bros. for S1,000,000 by J.K. Rowling. After the release of the fourth book in July 2000, the first film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was released on 16 November 2001. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $90 million in the United States alone, which set a record opening worldwide. The succeeding three motion picture adaptations followed suit in financial success, while garnering positive reviews from fans and critics. The fifth film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, was released by Warner Bros. on 11 July 2007 in English-speaking countries, except for the UK and Ireland, which released the movie on 12 July.[74] The sixth, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was released on 15 July 2009 to critical acclaim and finished its theatrical run ranked as the number two grossing film of 2009 on the worldwide charts.\\r\\nThe final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was split into two cinematic parts: Part 1 was released on 19 November 2010, and Part 2, the conclusion to both the final film and the series, was released on 15 July 2011.[75] Part 1 was originally scheduled to be released in 3D and 2D,[76] but due to a delay in the 3D conversion process, Warner Bros. released the film only in 2D and IMAX cinemas. However, Part 2 was released in 2D and 3D cinemas as originally planned.[77]\\r\\nThe television broadcast rights for the series in the United States are currently held by DisneyÿABC Domestic Television, which typically airs the films on the Freeform network. Disney's contract is expected to end in June 2018, after which, NBCUniversal will take control of the rights, after their deal with Warner Bros. was made in August 2016.[78] The film series has accrued nearly 1.3 billion viewings since their television debutthe highest-watched franchise in television broadcast history.[79]\\r\\nAll the films have been a success financially and critically, making the franchise one of the major Hollywood \\"tent-poles\\" akin to James Bond, Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean. The series is noted by audiences for growing visually darker and more mature as each film was released.[34][80][81][82][83] However, opinions of the films generally divide book fans, with some preferring the more faithful approach of the first two films and others preferring the more stylised character-driven approach of the later films.\\r\\nSome also feel the series has a \\"disjointed\\" feel due to the changes in directors, as well as Michael Gambon's interpretation of Albus Dumbledore differing from that of Richard Harris. Author J. K. Rowling has been constantly supportive of the films,[84][85][86] and evaluated Deathly Hallows as her favourite one in the series. She wrote on her website of the changes in the book-to-film transition, \\"It is simply impossible to incorporate every one of my storylines into a film that has to be kept under four hours long. Obviously films have restrictions ÿ novels do not have constraints of time and budget; I can create dazzling effects relying on nothing but the interaction of my own and my readers' imaginations\\".[87]\\r\\nAt the 64th British Academy Film Awards in February 2011, J. K. Rowling, David Heyman, David Barron, David Yates, Alfonso Cuar܇n, Mike Newell, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson collected the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema for the series.[105][106]\\r\\nIn addition, the American Film Institute recognised the entire series with a Special Award at the American Film Institute Awards in 2011. Special awards \\"are given to outstanding achievements in the moving image that do not fit into AFI's criteria for the other honorees.\\" [107] In its press release, the Institute referred to the films as \\"a landmark series; eight films that earned the trust of a generation who wished for the beloved books of J.K. Rowling to come to life on the silver screen. The collective wizardry of an epic ensemble gave us the gift of growing older with Harry, Ron and Hermione as the magic of Hogwarts sprung from the films and into the hearts and minds of Muggles around the world.\\" [107]\\r\\nHarry Potter was also recognised by the BAFTA Los Angeles Britannia Awards, with David Yates winning the Britannia Award for Artistic Excellence in Directing for his four Harry Potter films.[108][109]\\r\\nSix of the eight films were nominated for a total of 12 Academy Awards.\\r\\nSome critics, fans, and general audiences have expressed disappointment that the Harry Potter series did not win any Oscars for its achievements. However, others have pointed out that certain films in the series had uneven reviews, in contrast to the three films of The Lord of the Rings, for example, which were all critically acclaimed. This has been partially attributed to the Harry Potter franchise going through several directors with their own styles in contrast to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which was filmed in one massive undertaking by the same director, writer, and producer.[110][111]\\r\\nAlthough not successful at the Oscars, the Harry Potter series has gained success in many other award ceremonies, including the annual Saturn Awards and Art Directors Guild Awards. The series has also gained a total of 24 nominations at the British Academy Film Awards presented at the annual BAFTAs, winning several, and 5 nominations at the Grammy Awards.\\r\\nPhilosopher's Stone achieved seven BAFTA Award nominations, including Best British Film and Best Supporting Actor for Robbie Coltrane.[112] The film was also nominated for eight Saturn Awards and won for its costumes design.[113] It was also nominated at the Art Directors Guild Awards for its production design[114] and received the Broadcast Film Critics Award for Best Live Action Family Film along with gaining two other nominations.[115]\\r\\nChamber of Secrets won the award for Best Live Action Family Film in the Phoenix Film Critics Society. It was nominated for seven Saturn Awards, including Best Director and Best Fantasy Film. The film was nominated for four BAFTA Awards and a Grammy Award for John Williams's score. Prisoner of Azkaban won an Audience Award, as well as Best Feature Film, at the BAFTA Awards. The film also won a BMI Film Music award along with being nominated at the Grammy Awards, Visual Effect Society Awards, and the Amanda Awards. Goblet of Fire won a BAFTA award for Best Production Design as well as being nominated at the Saturn Awards, Critic's Choice Awards, and the Visual Effects Society Awards.\\r\\nOrder of the Phoenix picked up three awards at the inaugural ITV National Movie Awards.[116] At the Empire Awards, David Yates won Best Director.[117] Composer Nicholas Hooper received a nomination for a World Soundtrack Discovery Award.[118] The film was nominated at the BAFTA Awards, but did not win for Best Production Design or Best Special Visual Effects.[119] Half-Blood Prince was nominated for BAFTA Awards in Production Design and Visual Effects,[120] and it was in the longlists for several other categories, including Best Supporting Actor for Alan Rickman.[121] Amongst other nominations and wins, the film also achieved Best Family Movie at the National Movie Awards as well as Best Live Action Family Film at the Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards, along with being nominated for Best Motion Picture at the Satellite Awards.\\r\\nDeathly Hallows ÿ Part 1 gained two nominations at the BAFTA Awards for Best Make-Up and Hair and Best Visual Effects, along with receiving nominations for the same categories at the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards. Eduardo Serra's cinematography and Stuart Craig's production design were also nominated in various award ceremonies, and David Yates attained his second win at the Empire Awards, this time for Best Fantasy Film. He also obtained another Best Director nomination at the annual Saturn Awards, which also saw the film gain a Best Fantasy Film nomination.[122][123] Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2 was released to critical acclaim, gaining a mix of audience awards. Part 2 of Deathly Hallows was also recognised at the Saturn Awards as well as the BAFTA Awards, where the film achieved a win for Best Special Visual Effects.[124]\\r\\nAs of 2017[update], the Harry Potter film series is the 2nd highest-grossing film franchise of all time, with the eight films released grossing over $7.7?billion worldwide. Without adjusting for inflation, this is higher than the first 22 James Bond films and the six films in the Star Wars franchise.[125] Chris Columbus's Philosopher's Stone became the highest-grossing Harry Potter film worldwide upon completing its theatrical run in 2002, but it was eventually topped by David Yates's Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2, while Alfonso Cuar܇n's Prisoner of Azkaban grossed the least.[126][127][128][129]\\r\\nSix films in the Harry Potter franchise  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Parts 1 & 2  have to date grossed around $216 million in IMAX theaters worldwide.[130]\\r\\nThe Harry Potter films and their success have been retrospectively considered to have had a significant impact on the film industry. They are cited as having helped redefine the Hollywood blockbuster in the 21st century by initiating a shift toward established media franchises forming the basis of successful films. In the wake of the final film's release, Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote that the films \\"inspired every major studio to try to capture [its] alchemic formula, spawning a range of copycats and wannabes\\" and \\"also have shown Hollywood how to make a glossy blockbuster with an eye toward keeping costs down.\\"[151] A 2009 article from The Economist argued that the films were \\"in the vanguard\\" of adaptations of established properties being the modern film franchise model, citing The Lord of the Rings, Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Trilogy as examples of successful film series that followed Harry Potter's suit.[150] Furthermore, the practice of splitting the finale of a film series into two back-to-back films began with the success of Deathly Hallows, and it would soon be replicated by The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and The Battle of the Five Armies, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn ÿ Parts 1 and 2, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay ÿ Parts 1 and 2, and Avengers: Infinity War and its untitled sequel.[152]\\r\\nThe films are also widely credited with singlehandedly signalling the popularity of films based on children's and young adult literature in the 2000s and 2010s, correlating with the book series' own literary influence. Costance Grady and Aja Romano, commenting on the whole Harry Potter franchise's legacy for Vox in light of its 20th anniversary, wrote that youth-targeted literature has since become \\"a go-to well of ideas for Hollywood,\\" pointing to the successes of The Twilight Saga, The Hunger Games and The Divergent Series.[153]","input":"What is the last harry potter movie called?"},{"output":"Fantastic Four #52 (cover-dated July 1966)","context":"Black Panther is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Jack Kirby, first appearing in Fantastic Four #52 (cover-dated July 1966) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Black Panther's real name is T'Challa, king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the heart shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced technology to combat his enemies.\\r\\nBlack Panther is the first superhero of African descent in mainstream American comics, having debuted years before early African American superheroes such as Marvel Comics' the Falcon (1969), Luke Cage (1972) and Blade (1973), or DC Comics' John Stewart in the role of Green Lantern (1971). In one comic book storyline, the Black Panther mantle is handled by Kasper Cole, a multiracial New York City police officer. Beginning as an impersonator, Cole would later take on the moniker of White Tiger and become an ally to T'Challa. The role of Black Panther and leadership of Wakanda is also given to T'Challa's sister Shuri for a time when he is left recovering from critical injuries.\\r\\nBlack Panther has made numerous appearances in various television shows, animated films and video games. The character is portrayed in live action by Chadwick Boseman in the 2016 film Captain America: Civil War, and the 2018 films Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\\r\\nIn 2011, Black Panther was ranked 51st overall on IGN's \\"Top 100 Comic Books Heroes\\" list.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Black Panther's name predates the October 1966 founding of the Black Panther Party, though not the black panther logo of the party's predecessor, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO), nor the segregated World War II Black Panthers Tank Battalion.[2][3] Stan Lee, co-creator of the comic, denied that the comic was named after any of the political uses of the term \\"black panther\\", including the LCFO, citing \\"a strange coincidence\\".[4] He is the first black superhero in American mainstream comic books; very few black heroes were created before him, and none with actual superpowers. These included the characters in the single-issue, low-distribution All-Negro Comics #1 (1947); Waku, Prince of the Bantu, who starred in his own feature in the omnibus title Jungle Tales, from Marvel's 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics; and the Dell Comics Western character Lobo, the first black person to star in his own comic book. Previous non-caricatured black supporting characters in comics include U.S. Army infantry private Gabriel Jones of Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos.\\r\\nIn a guest appearance in Fantastic Four #119 (Feb. 1972), the Black Panther briefly tried using the name Black Leopard to avoid connotations with the Party, but the new name did not last.[5] The character's name was changed back to Black Panther in Avengers #105, with T'Challa explaining that renaming himself made as much sense as altering the Scarlet Witch's name, and he is not a stereotype.[6]\\r\\nCo-creator Stan Lee recounted that the name was inspired by a pulp adventure hero who has a black panther as a helper.[7] Jack Kirby's original concept art for Black Panther used the concept name Coal Tiger.[8]\\r\\nFollowing his debut in Fantastic Four #52ÿ53 (JulyÿAug. 1966) and subsequent guest appearance in Fantastic Four Annual #5 (1967) and with Captain America in Tales of Suspense #97ÿ100 (Jan.ÿ April 1968), the Black Panther journeyed from the fictional African nation of Wakanda to New York City to join the titular American superhero team in The Avengers #52 (May 1968), appearing in that comic for the next few years. During his time with the Avengers, he made solo guest-appearances in three issues of Daredevil, and fought Doctor Doom in Astonishing Tales #6ÿ7 (June & Aug. 1971), in that supervillain's short-lived starring feature.\\r\\nHe received his first starring feature with Jungle Action #5 (July 1973), a reprint of the Panther-centric story in The Avengers #62 (March 1969). A new series began running the following issue, written by Don McGregor, with art by pencilers Rich Buckler, Gil Kane, and Billy Graham, and which gave inkers Klaus Janson and Bob McLeod some of their first professional exposure. The critically acclaimed[9] series ran in Jungle Action #6ÿ24 (Sept. 1973 ÿ Nov. 1976).[10]\\r\\nOne now-common format McGregor pioneered was that of the self-contained, multi-issue story arc.[11] The first, \\"Panther's Rage\\", ran through the first 13 issues. Critic Jason Sacks has called the arc \\"Marvel's first graphic novel\\":\\r\\n[T]here were real character arcs in Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four [comics] over time. But ... \\"Panther's Rage\\" is the first comic that was created from start to finish as a complete novel. Running in two years' issues of Jungle Action (#s 6 through 18), \\"Panther's Rage\\" is a 200-page novel that journeys to the heart of the African nation of Wakanda, a nation ravaged by a revolution against its king, T'Challa, the Black Panther.[11]\\r\\nThe second and final arc, \\"Panther vs. the Klan\\", ran as mostly 17-page stories in Jungle Action #19ÿ24 (Jan.ÿNov. 1976), except for issue #23, a reprint of Daredevil #69 (Oct. 1970), in which the Black Panther guest-starred.[10] The subject matter of the Ku Klux Klan was considered controversial in the Marvel offices at the time, creating difficulties for the creative team.[12]\\r\\nAfrican-American writer-editor Dwayne McDuffie said of the Jungle Action \\"Black Panther\\" feature:\\r\\nThis overlooked and underrated classic is arguably the most tightly written multi-part superhero epic ever. If you can get your hands on it ... sit down and read the whole thing. It's damn-near flawless, every issue, every scene, a functional, necessary part of the whole. Okay, now go back and read any individual issue. You'll find seamlessly integrated words and pictures; clearly introduced characters and situations; a concise (sometimes even transparent) recap; beautifully developed character relationships; at least one cool new villain; a stunning action set piece to test our hero's skills and resolve; and a story that is always moving forward towards a definite and satisfying conclusion. That's what we should all be delivering, every single month. Don [McGregor] and company did it in only 17 story pages per issue.[9]\\r\\nThough popular with college students, the overall sales of Jungle Action were low,[13] and Marvel relaunched the Black Panther in a self-titled series, bringing in the character's co-creator Jack Kirbynewly returned to Marvel after having decamped to rival DC Comics for a timeas writer, penciler, and editor. However, Kirby wanted to work on new characters and was unhappy at being assigned a series starring a character he had already worked with extensively.[14] He left the series after only 12 issues and was replaced by Ed Hannigan (writer), Jerry Bingham (penciler), and Roger Stern (editor). Black Panther ran 15 issues (Jan. 1977 ÿ May 1979).[15] Due to the series's cancellation, the contents of what would have been Black Panther #16ÿ18 were published in Marvel Premiere #51ÿ53.\\r\\nA four-issue miniseries, Black Panther vol. 2,[16] (JulyÿOct. 1988) was written by Peter B. Gillis and penciled by Denys Cowan.[17] McGregor revisited his Panther saga with Gene Colan in \\"Panther's Quest\\", published as 25 eight-page installments within the bi-weekly anthology series Marvel Comics Presents (issues #13ÿ37, Feb.ÿDec. 1989).[18] He later teamed with artist Dwayne Turner in the square-bound miniseries Black Panther: Panther's Prey (Sept. 1990 ÿ March 1991).[19] McGregor conceived a fifth arc in his Black Panther saga, titled \\"Panther's Vows\\", but it failed to get off the ground.[13]\\r\\nWriter Christopher Priest's and penciller Mark Texeira's 1998 series The Black Panther vol. 3 used Erik Killmonger, Venomm, and other characters introduced in \\"Panther's Rage\\", together with new characters such as State Department attorney Everett Ross; the Black Panther's adopted brother, Hunter; and the Panther's protg, Queen Divine Justice. The Priest-Texeira series was under the Marvel Knights imprint in its first year. Priest said the creation of character Ross contributed heavily to his decision to write the series. \\"I realized I could use Ross to bridge the gap between the African culture that the Black Panther mythos is steeped in and the predominantly white readership that Marvel sells to,\\" adding that in his opinion, the Black Panther had been misused in the years after his creation.[20]\\r\\nThe last 13 issues (#50ÿ62) saw the main character replaced by a multiracial New York City police officer named Kasper Cole, with T'Challa relegated to a supporting character. This Black Panther, who became the White Tiger, was placed in the series The Crew, running concurrently with the final few Black Panther issues. The Crew was canceled with issue #7.\\r\\nIn 2005, Marvel began publishing Black Panther vol. 4,[21] which ran 41 issues (April 2005 ÿ Nov. 2008).[22] It was initially written by filmmaker Reginald Hudlin (through issue #38) and penciled by John Romita, Jr. (through #6). Hudlin said he wanted to add \\"street cred\\" to the title, although he noted that the book was not necessarily or primarily geared toward an African-American readership.[23] As influences for his characterization of the character, Hudlin has cited comic character Batman, film director Spike Lee, and music artist Sean Combs.[23] Other influences include historical figures such as 14th-century Mali Empire sultan Mansa Musa and 20th-century Jamaican activist Marcus Garvey, as well as Biblical figures such as Ham and Canaan.[24]\\r\\nBlack Panther vol. 5[25] launched in February 2009, with Hudlin, again scripting, introducing a successor Black Panther, T'Challa's sister Shuri.[26][27][28] Hudlin co-wrote issue #7 with Jonathan Maberry, who then became the new writer,[29] joined by artist Will Conrad.[30] The Panther was also a featured player, with members of the Fantastic Four and the X-Men, in the Doctor Doom-based, six-issue miniseries Doomwar (AprilÿSept. 2010).[31]\\r\\nT'Challa then accepted an invitation from Matt Murdock, the superhero Daredevil, to become the new protector of New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. He became the lead character in Daredevil beginning with issue #513 (Feb. 2011), when that series was retitled Black Panther: The Man Without Fear.[32] Under writer David Liss and artist Francesco Francavilla, he took on the identity of Mr. Okonkwo, an immigrant from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and becomes the owner of a small diner in order to be close to the people.[33]\\r\\nA new Black Panther series written by Ta-Nehisi Coates and drawn by Brian Stelfreeze was launched in 2016 and continues to be published with Coates as the head writer.[34][35][36]\\r\\nIn 2017, the afrofuturist writer Nnedi Okorafor wrote the series Black Panther: Long Live the King.[37]\\r\\nThe Black Panther is the ceremonial title given to the chief of the Panther Tribe of the advanced African nation of Wakanda. In addition to ruling the country, he is also chief of its various tribes (collectively referred to as the Wakandas). The Panther habit is a symbol of office (head of state) and is used even during diplomatic missions. The Panther is a hereditary title, but one must still earn it.\\r\\nIn the distant past, a meteorite made of the (fictional) vibration-absorbing mineral vibranium crashed in Wakanda, and was unearthed. Reasoning that outsiders would exploit Wakanda for this valuable resource, the ruler, King T'Chaka, like his father and other Panthers before him, concealed his country from the outside world. T'Chaka's first wife N'Yami died while in labor with T'Challa, and his second wife Ramonda was taken prisoner by Anton Pretorius during a visit to her homeland of South Africa, so for most of his childhood T'Challa was raised by his father alone.[38] T'Chaka was murdered by the adventurer Ulysses Klaw in an attempt to seize the vibranium mound. With his people still in danger, a young T'Challa used Klaw's sound weapon on Klaw and his men, shattering Klaw's right hand and forcing him to flee.[39]\\r\\nT'Challa was next in line to be the king of Wakanda and Black Panther, but until he was ready to become the leader of the nation, his uncle S'yan (T'Chaka's younger brother) successfully passed the trials to become the Black Panther. While on his Wakandan walkabout rite of passage, T'Challa met and fell in love with apparent orphaned teen Ororo Munroe, who would grow up to become the X-Men member Storm.[40] The two broke off their relationship due to his desire to avenge his father's death and to become the type of man who could suitably lead Wakanda, but they would see each other over the years when they could.\\r\\nT'Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the various champions of the Wakandan tribes. One of his first acts was to disband and exile the Hatut Zerazethe Wakandan secret policeand its leader, his adopted brother Hunter the White Wolf.[41] He sold off small portions of vibranium to scientific institutions around the world, amassing a fortune which he used to arm himself with advanced technology.[39] Later, to keep peace, he picked dora milaje (\\"adored ones\\") from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives-in-training. He then studied abroad for a time before returning to his kingship.\\r\\nIn his first published appearance, the now-adult T'Challa invites the American superhero team the Fantastic Four to Wakanda, then attacks and attempts to neutralize them individually in order to test himself to see if he is ready to battle Klaw, who had replaced his shattered right hand with a sonic weapon.[42][43] For their part, the Four manage to rally and stymie T'Challa in a team counter-attack, enabling the impressed King to stand down and explain himself to the team's satisfaction. After the ruler makes proper amends to the Four, they befriend and help T'Challa, and he in turn aids them against the supervillain the Psycho-Man.[44] T'Challa later joins the Avengers,[45] beginning a long association with that superhero team. He first battles the Man-Ape while with the group,[46] and then meets the American singer Monica Lynne,[47] with whom he becomes romantically involved. He helps the Avengers defeat the second Sons of the Serpent, and then reveals his true identity on American television.[48] He encounters Daredevil, and reveals to him that he had deduced Daredevil's true identity.[49]\\r\\nAfter receiving numerous urgent official letters requesting him to return to his increasingly troubled homeland,[50] the Panther eventually leaves his active Avengers membership to return to a Wakanda on the brink of civil war, bringing Lynne with him. After defeating would-be usurper Erik Killmonger and his minions,[51] the Panther ventures to the American South to battle the Ku Klux Klan.[52] He later gains possession of the mystical time-shifting artifacts known as King Solomon's Frogs.[53] These produce an alternate version of T'Challa from a future 10 years hence, a merry, telepathic Panther with a terminal brain aneurysm, whom T'Challa places in cryogenic stasis.\\r\\nLater, while searching for and finding his stepmother Ramonda, the Panther contends with South African authorities during Apartheid.[54] T'Challa eventually proposes and becomes engaged to Monica Lynne,[55] though the couple never marry.\\r\\nYears later, the Panther accepts a Washington, D.C. envoy, Everett K. Ross, and faces multiple threats to Wakanda's sovereignty. Ross assists him in many of these threats. In gratitude, the Panther often risks much for Ross in return. The first threat he and Ross encounter is \\"Xcon\\", an alliance of rogue intelligence agents backing a coup led by the Reverend Achebe.[56] Afterward, Killmonger resurfaces with a plot to destroy Wakanda's economy. This forces T'Challa to nationalize foreign companies.[57] Killmonger then defeats him in ritual combat, thus inheriting the role of Black Panther,[58] but falls into a coma upon eating the heart-shaped herbpoisonous to anyone outside the royal bloodline, which had a hereditary immunity to its toxic effects.[59] T'Challa preserves his rival's life rather than allowing him to die.\\r\\nLater, T'Challa finds he has a brain aneurysm like his alternate future self, and succumbs to instability and hallucinations. After his mental state almost causes tribal warfare, the Panther hands power to his council[60] and hides in New York City. There he mentors police officer Kasper Cole (who had adopted an abandoned Panther costume), an experience that gives T'Challa the strength to face his illness, reclaim his position, and return to active membership in the Avengers, whom he helps secure special United Nations status.\\r\\nT'Challa recounts the story of his ascension as the Black Panther in the fourth volume of his eponymous comic book series. He defeated his uncle during the Black Panther celebration,[61] and during his walkabout when he met and fell in love with a street urchin named Ororo in Cairo, Egypt.[62] Unbeknownst to him the US government is planning a coup in order to get access to the vibranium. They allow Klaw to recruit a team of villains in order to support his totalitarian neighbor, Niganda. Klaw recruits Rhino, Black Knight, Batroc the Leaper, and Radioactive Man to lead the invasion. The US government then deploys an army of Deathloks to \\"support\\" T'Challa and justify an invasion, but T'Challa kills Klaw and Storm wipes out the Deathlok army in a hurricane.[63]\\r\\nT'Challa then helps his old flame Ororo Munroe reunite with her surviving family members in Africa and the U.S.[64] He shortly afterward proposes,[volume?&?issue?needed] and the two are married in a large Wakandan ceremony attended by many superheroes.[65] One of the couple's first tasks is to embark on a diplomatic tour, in which they visit the Inhumans, Doctor Doom, the President of the United States, and Namor, with only the last one ending well.[66] After the death of Bill Foster, the Black Panther and Storm side with Captain America's anti-registration forces.[67] During the end battle between both sides, the Wakandan embassy in Manhattan is heavily damaged, though no Wakandans are hurt.[68] After the confrontation, the Panther and Storm briefly fill in for vacationing Fantastic Four members Reed and Sue Richards before returning to Wakanda.[69]\\r\\nUpon returning to Wakanda alone, leaving Storm in New York to aid the X-Men, Black Panther faces Erik Killmonger, defeating him with assistance from Monica Rambeau (a.k.a. Pulsar).[70] Afterward, Wakanda fends off the alien shapeshifters the Skrulls, who had infiltrated as part of their \\"Secret Invasion\\" plan to conquer Earth.[71] Prince Namor attempts to recruit T'Challa for the Cabal, a secret council of supervillains. Attacked by the forces of fellow Cabal member Doctor Doom, T'Challa is left comatose.[72] His sister Shuri is trained as the next Panther, with the mantle passing onto her officially after T'Challa awakens from his coma and attempts to recover from his injuries.[73]\\r\\nIn the aftermath, T'Challa loses all of his enhanced attributes given to him by being the panther totem. As a result, he works with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to accumulate a replacement.[74] He has since made a pact with another unknown Panther deity, returning his attributes to an even higher level as well as placing incantations on his body, making himself highly resistant to most magic and mystic assaults. This has all been done in preparation for the imminent battle with Doctor Doom,[75] which culminated in T'Challa rendering all of the processed vibranium inert to give his people a chance to rebuild without their dependence on the element.[76]\\r\\nAfter the events of \\"Shadowland\\", Matt Murdock (the superhero Daredevil) asks T'Challa to replace him as guardian of Hell's Kitchen, which gives T'Challa a chance to discover himself. With the help of Foggy Nelson, T'Challa assumes the identity of Mr. Okonkwo, an immigrant from the Congo and manager of a diner called Devil's Kitchen, so that he can blend in and learn about the denizens as an ordinary man. He gets on well with two of the Kitchen's staff: Sofija, a migrant from Serbia who was formerly involved in violent Serbian nationalism, and the busboy, Brian. He also gets to know some of the neighbors from his apartment block: Mr. Nantakarn and his son Alec, as well as Iris, a social worker assigned to handle cases of child abuse.[77]\\r\\nT'Challa finds himself up against an ambitious new crime lord, Vlad Dinu, who styles himself \\"The Impaler\\". He also seeks an understanding with the police through Detective Alex Kurtz. During an attempt by Vlad to terminate the Panther, Brian from the Devil's Kitchen is seriously injured by an energy blast from Vlad, and is reported dead. The conflict between Vlad and the Panther becomes more personal, especially after Vlad discovers the Panther over his wife Angela dead from a gunshot wound.[77]\\r\\nT'Challa learns that Iris was the serial shooter who killed abusers of childrenGabe was abused secretly by Angela. Brian was kidnapped by his doctor, Dr. Holman, at the behest of Nicolae who wanted to use someone who received a dose of Vlad's power. After being subjected to torturous experiments, Brian lost the ability to think for himself but was rescued by Gabe who also stole the serum produced from the experiment meant to endow the recipient with Vlad's powers. The Panther obtains evidence of Vlad Dinu's crimes as well as clues to Iris as the serial shooter, and turns the evidence over to Kurtz. Vlad kills his own son Nicolae before being subdued by the Panther. Gabe is arrested for attempting to take Iris' life. Before being taken away, Gabe reveals to the Panther Brian's fate. Though aware of the Panther's identity as Mr. Okonkwo, both Iris and Sofija promise to keep silent.[77]\\r\\nShortly after Daredevil returns to Hell's Kitchen, T'Challa returns to Wakanda, serving as a second to his sister, Shuri. In preparation for an upcoming attack on Wakanda as part of the Avengers vs. X-Men storyline, the Panther God returns T'Challa's abilities.[78] Empowered by the Phoenix, Namor destroys Wakanda with a massive tidal wave.[79] Returning to help, Storm is stunned when the Panther informs her that their marriage has been annulled.[80]\\r\\nAfter witnessing an alternate Earth over Wakanda being destroyed by the Black Swan, T'Challa reforms the Illuminatiwith Beast replacing the now-deceased Charles Xavierto confront the threat of the Incursions, parallel universes colliding with each other to the destruction of both. Although able to avert one Incursion with the Infinity Gauntlet, the subsequent destruction of the Infinity Gems forces the group to decide to resort to more questionable measures to protect Earth from future Incursions, wiping Captain America's mind so that he will not remember these events, allowing them to do \\"what needs to be done\\".[81] Although equipped with planet-destroying weapons to protect Earth, the Illuminati mostly become disgusted with the wholesale slaughter, until Namor breaks off from the group to form a new Cabal of villains to do what the heroes will not. Despite Namor's Cabal achieving legitimacy as Earth's protectors, Namor grew weary of the wholesale slaughter they carried out in the name of preserving their universe. Although he collaborated with the Illuminati in a plan to destroy the Cabal by trapping them on the next Earth to be destroyed, Black Panther and Black Bolt left him behind to die with the Cabal, disgusted at his earlier actions,[82] although Namor and the Cabal escape to the Ultimate universe when the other Earth has a simultaneous Incursion.[83]\\r\\nWhen the final Incursion occurs during the Secret Wars storyline, resulting in all realities collapsing into one Earth, Black Panther is one of the few heroes to survive the Incursion in a specially-designed \\"life pod\\"other survivors including Mister Fantastic, Star-Lord, Spider-Man, the new Thor, Captain Marvel and a Phoenix-enhanced Cyclopsalthough they are only released into the new world after an eight-year stasis. Retrieved by Doctor Strange, they learn that Strange has assumed a role of \\"sheriff\\" to Doctor Doom, who has appointed himself the god of the new \\"Battleworld\\" created from the multiple realities.[84] Although Doom effortlessly kills Cyclops, Strange protects the other heroes by dispersing them across Battleworld,[85] with T'Challa and Namor eventually discovering a new version of the Infinity Gauntlet that Strange collected, ensuring that the Gems he found would work in the location where Doom built his main fortress.[86] Recruiting the residents of the deadlands as an army, T'Challa marches on Doom at the same time as multiple other areas rebel against him through the encouragement of the heroes,[87] but admits when Doom confronts him that he was only intended as a distraction while Reed targets Doom's power source. As Reed takes Doom's power and sets out to rebuild the multiverse, T'Challa uses the Time Gem to take himself back to Wakanda before the Incursions, proclaiming to his people that they will lead the way to the stars and explore new ideas.[88]\\r\\nAs part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel, Black Panther is a member of the Ultimates.[89]\\r\\nDuring the Civil War II storyline, Black Panther represents Wakanda on the Alpha Flight Space Program's Board of Governors.[90] He sides with Captain Marvel on needing help from an Inhuman who can predict the possible future named Ulysses Kain.[volume?&?issue?needed] Black Panther and Shuri take part in the fight against the Leviathon Tide.[91]\\r\\nDuring Hydra's reign over the world led by Arnim Zola, Baron Zemo and Steve Rogers, Panther is captured for opposing this regime, and brought into a containing room. Once Panther and Zemo are alone, Winter Soldier rescues Panther. Panther entrusts the unconscious Zemo to Winter Soldier, while trailing Rogers and Zola into the secret lab. Panther finds out that Zola infused a brainwashed Captain America with a Cosmic Cube using a stolen Stark tech modified by Zola himself, and warns his allies to retreat from a Cosmic Cube-powered Steve Rogers, but is too late.[92] Even though one of the heroes knows they cannot defeat a Cosmic Cube-powered Supreme Hydra Rogers, Winter Soldier, Captain America (Sam Wilson) and Ant-Man (Scott Lang) trick Rogers by surrendering the last fragment of the cube to him. Winter Soldier and Ant-Man steal the cube from Rogers before he uses its full potential, and bring back Kobik and the real Steve Rogers.[93][94] After the defeat of Supreme Hydra Steve Rogers, Black Panther establishes his quest to go across the universe with his people, and found an Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda on Planet Bast, located in the Benhazin Star System.[95]\\r\\nThe title \\"Black Panther\\" is a rank of office, chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan. As chieftain, the Panther is entitled to eat a special heart-shaped herb which, in addition to his mystical, shamanistic connection with the Wakandan Panther God Bast, grants him superhumanly acute senses, enhanced strength, speed, agility, stamina, durability, healing, and reflexes.[96][97]\\r\\nHe has since lost this connection and forged a new one with another unknown Panther deity, granting him augmented physical attributes as well as a resistance to magic.[75] His senses are so powerful that he can pick up a prey's scent and memorize tens of thousands of individual ones. Following his war with Doom, T'Challa loses his enhanced abilities only to once again establish a connection with the Panther God.[78] In addition to the resurgence of his now superhuman abilities, he is anointed \\"King of the Dead\\", granting him the power and knowledge of all the past Black Panthers as well as the ability to control the Undead.[98] After Battleworld and the resurgence of the Multiverse T'challa eventually showcased new powers in regards to his King of the Dead status, for not only could he reanimate the dead but summon departed spirits into the physical world with tangible form as well. Using these spiritual energies also enables him to conjure a mythical mystical spear of glowing blue energy to his hand.[99]\\r\\nT'Challa worked with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to endow T'Challa with immunity to mystical attacks and detection in order to defeat Dr. Doom. When T'Challa's alchemical upgrade was tested by means of Wakanda's most powerful acolytes attacking T'Challa in unison, each mystical attack was absorbed and only served to strengthen T'Challa. During these preparations, T'Challa invented a potent mystical-scientific hybrid art called \\"shadow physics\\" and was able to use it to craft shadow weapons and to track vibranium on a quantum level.[75]\\r\\nAs king of Wakanda, the Panther has access to a vast collection of magical artifacts, advanced Wakandan technological and military hardware, and the support of his nation's wide array of scientists, warriors, and mystics. The Wakandan military has been described as one of the most powerful on Earth. His attire is the sacred vibranium costume of the Wakandan Panther Cult.\\r\\nHe is a skilled hunter, tracker, strategist, politician, inventor, and scientist. He has a PhD in physics from Oxford University. He is proficient in physics and advanced technology, and is also an inventor. T'Challa has been granted the strength and knowledge of every past Black Panther.[78]\\r\\nT'Challa is rigorously trained in acrobatics and hand-to-hand combat. He is skilled in various forms of unarmed combat, with a unique hybrid fighting style that incorporates acrobatics and aspects of animal mimicry.[100]\\r\\nThe chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan is one of the wealthiest people in the world, although financial estimates are difficult given Wakanda's isolation from the world's economy and the uncertain value of Wakanda's vast vibranium reserves and extremely advanced technologies.[101]\\r\\nIn Black Panther volume 3, writer Christopher Priest expanded the Panther's day-to-day arsenal to include equipment such as an \\"energy dagger\\", a vibranium-weave suit, and a portable supercomputer, the \\"Kimoyo card\\".[102] In Black Panther volume 4, writer Reginald Hudlin introduced such specialized equipment as \\"thrice-blessed armor\\" and \\"light armor\\" for specific tasks,[103] and for a short while outfitted him with the Ebony Blade of the Black Knight.[104]\\r\\nThe mantle of the Black Panther is passed down from generation to generation among the rulers of Wakanda[105] although it must still be deserved through a severe selection involving the best warriors of the nation.\\r\\nBashenga appeared for the first time in Black Panther Vol. 1 #7 (January 1978) by Jack Kirby (scripts and drawings). Wise warrior at the head of the Panther Tribe, according to legends, during the tumult where the vibranium meteorite fell on the soil of the village, then composed of various warring clans, he gathered all the aforementioned under his guide to defeating the inhabitants transformed by the impact into fierce \\"demonic spirits\\", a company which has unified the nation by founding Wakanda and becoming its first ruler[106] and the first to obtain the title of \\"Black Panther\\" as it tells of his \\"spiritual connection\\" with the Goddess Pantera Bast that led to the foundation of the Cult of the Panther.[105]\\r\\nChanda appeared for the first time in Fantastic Four Unlimited Vol. 1 #1 (March 1993) by Roy Thomas (scripts) and Herb Trimpe (drawings). Black Panther and ruler of Wakanda during the Second World War, Chanda is the husband of Nanali and father of T'Chaka and S'Yan; distinguished by an excessively good and compassionate nature, he welcomed the Nazi colonel Fritz Klaue after he crashed into his reign due to a plane crash. Over time, the two make a kind of friendship and Klaue develops a strong obsession with the culture of Wakanda coming to try to convince them to make their religion deist rather than spiritist, which causes a strong friction between him and Chanda culminating in the death of Nanali by the Nazi and in its subsequent expulsion from the country.[107]\\r\\nIn several subsequent stories, T'Chaka's father (and husband of Nanali) is called Azzuri the Wise and is presented in a completely different way from Chanda,[108][109] leaving the doubt if it is only a sort of nickname or another character.\\r\\nT'Chaka appeared for the first time in Fantastic Four Vol. 1 #53 (August 1966) by Stan Lee (scripts) and Jack Kirby (drawings). The eldest son of King Azzuri and Queen Nanali, T'Chaka inherits the throne and the title of the Black Panther on his father's death by being helped in his monarch duties by his younger brother and trusted adviser S'Yan.[110] After having married a woman named N'Yami, believing she can not have children, she adopts a child with her, Hunter, however, she later becomes pregnant and dies giving birth to her first child, T'Challa; from the relationship with a woman of another tribe T'Chaka then has a second son, Jakarra, and finally remarries with Ramonda, a woman who grows her children as her own and from whom she has her only daughter, Shuri,[110] but which subsequently disappears into nothingness, leading him to believe that he has abandoned it.[38] To protect the kingdom, T'Chaka instituted a policy of strong isolationism,[111] but in the course of his life he often collaborated with agents of the US government.[109][112] He is killed by Ulysses Klaw after having surprised him to illegally extract vibranium in his kingdom.[113]\\r\\nS'Yan The Fast, appeared for the first time in Black Panther Vol. 4 #2 (May, 2005) by Reginald Hudlin (scripts) and John Romita Jr. (drawings). The second son of King Azzuri and Queen Nanali, S'Yan is T'Chaka's younger and trusted advisor, after whose death, although he has no desire to reign, he agrees to ascend the throne until his nephew became an adult.[110] Ironically, S'Yan, who has never wanted to be king, becomes one of the most beloved monarchs in the history of Wakanda but, nevertheless, when T'Challa returns home and obtains the title of Black Panther, he becomes a he leaves with joy, returning to play the role of real advisor.[110] He died during the war with Latveria to defend Ramonda from the soldiers of Doctor Doom.\\r\\nWhen T'Challa ends up in a coma because of Doctor Doom,[114] Shuri becomes his substitute as Black Panther and queen of Wakanda which, after the rise of her half-brother to \\"king of the dead\\", creates for the first time in history two avatars of the Panther Goddess.\\r\\nBlack Panther was ranked the 79th greatest comic book character by Wizard magazine.[115] IGN ranked the character the 51st greatest comic book hero, stating that the Black Panther could be called Marvel's Batman,[116] and tenth in their list of \\"The Top 50 Avengers\\".[117] In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked the Black Panther as #33 on their list of the \\"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\\".[118]\\r\\nJournalist Joe Gross praised Christopher Priest for his characterization of the Black Panther, stating, that the writer \\"turned an underused icon into the locus of a complicated high adventure by taking the Black Panther to his logical conclusion. T'Challa (the title character) is the enigmatic ruler of a technologically advanced, slightly xenophobic African nation, so he acts like it\\". Gross applauded the title's \\"endless wit, sharp characterization, narrative sophistication and explosive splash panels\\".[119]\\r\\nComics reviewer and journalist Mike Sangiacomo, however, criticized the narrative structure. \\"Christopher Priest's fractured writing is getting on my nerves. Like the Spider-Man comics, I want to like Black Panther, but Priest's deliberately jumbled approach to writing is simply silly. I know it's a style, but does he have to do it every issue?\\"[120]\\r\\nReporter Bill Radford cited similar concerns when the title had just launched. \\"I appreciate the notion of seeing the Black Panther through the eyes of an Everyman, but the Panther is almost relegated to secondary status in his own book. And Ross' narration jumps around in time so much that I feel like his boss, who, in trying to get Ross to tell her what has happened, complains: 'This is like watching \\"Pulp Fiction\\" in rewind. My head is exploding.'\\"[121]\\r\\nPublishers Weekly gave a negative review to the first arc, \\"Who Is the Black Panther?\\", a modern retelling of the character's origin, saying, \\"Hudlin's take is caught between a rock and a hard place. His over-the-top narrative is not likely to appeal to fans of the most recent version of the character, but it's too mired in obscure Marvel continuity to attract the more general reader. The plot manages to be convoluted without ever becoming absorbing\\".[122]\\r\\nJournalist Shawn Jeffords, citing the lack of appearances of the title character in the first issue, called the new series a \\"fairly unimpressive launch\\". Jeffords also said general-audience unfamiliarity was a hindrance. \\"He's never been a marquee character and to make him one will be tough\\".[123]\\r\\nT'Challa is Coal Tiger, Sersi kills the Avengers and Coal Tiger is the only survivor.[124]\\r\\nIn the Age of Ultron story, Black Panther contacts the Fantastic Four and informs them that Ultron has invaded Earth with an army of Ultron Sentinels.[125] Black Panther was later seen with Red Hulk and Taskmaster in Chicago spying on some Ultron Sentinels. When Taskmaster takes out a Sentinel that was sneaking up on him, alerting the other Sentinels, Red Hulk holds off the Sentinels while Black Panther and Taskmaster flee. During the mayhem, Black Panther falls several stories and breaks his neck, killing him instantly.[126]\\r\\nBronze Tiger is the ruler of Wakanda and is named B'Nchalla; an amalgamation of the Bronze Tiger (DC) and the Black Panther (Marvel).\\r\\nIn Avengers Forever, Captain America and Goliath visit an alternate future timeline where Martian invaders have ravaged the Earth. An aged Black Panther leads this reality's version of the Avengers, who consist of Jocasta, Living Lightning, Killraven, Crimson Dynamo and Thundra.[127]\\r\\nIn an alternate reality where the Civil War between Iron Man and Captain America never ended, Black Panther was killed alongside Maria Hill after activating Prison 42's self-destruct mechanism.[128] He is succeeded by his son, Azari, who takes on the Black Panther name.[129] It is later revealed that the Black Panther who destroyed Prison 42 was actually Queen Veranke of the shape-shifting alien Skrull race, who had stolen T'Challa's identity in order to manipulate and prolong the Civil War to suit her own needs.[130]\\r\\nT'Challa is Chieftain Justice, a Captain Britain Corps member, in Excalibur #44 (1991).[131]\\r\\nIn the alternate universe of Earth X, T'Challa has been affected by the mutative event that drives the plot. Like most of humanity, he is mutated; in this case to become a humanoid black panther. He is entrusted with the Cosmic Cube by Captain America, who knows that T'Challa would be the only one to resist using it and to never give it back if asked. In fact, Captain America does ask for it back and T'Challa is forced to refuse.[132]\\r\\nAn alternate version of Black Panther, called simply \\"Panther\\", is drafted onto the interdimensional superhero team the Exiles.[133] The Panther is the son of T'Challa and Storm and named T'Chaka, after his grandfather. Originating from Earth-1119, he was ambushed by Klaw while examining some ruins. Caught in Klaw's blast, the Panther was plucked out of time and placed on the team.[133] Unlike the stoic 616-Black Panther, The Panther is a wisecracking flirt.[133] After his assumed death on Earth-1119, his sister took up the mantle of Black Panther.[134]\\r\\nThe Black Panther appears in issues #1 and #6ÿ7 of Marvel Comics/Fox Kids comic book series based on the TV show The Avengers: United They Stand.\\r\\nT'Challa appears in Marvel Mangaverse Volume 2 as a man with a pet panther. When summoning the spirits, T'Challa and his panther combine to become the Black Panther. He also became The Falcon. This Black Panther was romantically attracted to Tigra. T'Challa's sister, T'Chana, reveals herself to be this universe's Doctor Doom.[135]\\r\\nIn the Marvel 2099 continuity, a greatly weakened Wakanda is soon to be governed by its princess, Okusana. Fearing that she is not ready, she requests Doom's help in resurrecting Thandaza, her grandfather and a former Black Panther. Doom (who claims to have agreed to the proposal out of respect for T'Challa) and the Wakandan scientists revive Thandaza in a cyberbetic body made from vibranium, but the plan goes awry when Mkhalali, the current Panther Guard, opens fire on Thandaza, believing his resurrection to be an abomination. The attack throws off the calibrations and leaves Thandaza in a maddened state and constant pain, causing him to go on a bloody rampage. Doom is ultimately forced to kill Thandaza, who thanks him for ending his suffering.[136]\\r\\nBlack Panther was featured in the Marvel Knights 2099 one shots, which were not tied to the main 2099 continuity. A new Black Panther, K'Shamba, rose to fight and thwart the mounting invasions by the successor of Doom. While the victory over the new Doom appeared triumphant, the new Wakandan king was ultimately revealed to be a puppet of Doom.[137]\\r\\nBlack Panther is, for the most part, one of the few uninfected superheroes in the alternate-universe series Marvel Zombies, where he is kept as a food supply for the Zombie Giant-Man, who keeps the Panther imprisoned and cuts off various limbs so that he can maintain his intelligence via a ready access to fresh meat without infecting Panther with the zombie \\"virus\\".[138] Despite having lost half of his right arm and his left foot, the Panther escapeswith the severed head of zombified superheroine the Wasp in tow[139]and joins forces with the mutant group the Acolytes.[140] While with the Acolytes, T'Challa briefly talks with his Earth-616 counterpart, where he expresses surprise at his marriage to Storm but offers him all the information he can provide about the zombie plague.[141] Decades later, T'Challa has married one of the Acolytes, Lisa Hendricks, and they have a son, with Forge having provided T'Challa with artificial limbs to compensate for his injuries.[142] Facing retirement, the Panther is stabbed and critically wounded by an agent of an Acolyte splinter group, and the Wasp now a willing ally after having lost her zombie hunger zombifies the Panther in order to grant him continued existence. With the Wasp's help, he survives to the post-hunger stage himself and continues to lead his people, despite his status.[143] Further internal betrayal lead the Black Panther and many of his allies to be tossed through the dimensions.[144] He ends up involved with another Earth that is threatened by the zombie virus. His attempts to save this new planet fail and he is destroyed, leaving only one hand displayed as a trophy by his enemies.[145]\\r\\nIn the MC2 universe, Black Panther has a son named T'Chaka II, who joined the A-Next as the Coal Tiger.[146]\\r\\nIn the Mutant X reality, Black Panther had the appearance of a humanoid black panther. He is among the second wave of heroes who died fighting the Beyonder.[147]\\r\\nIn the alternate-reality Ultimate Marvel imprint, the Black Panther is T'Challa Udaku, a young man who is experimented on in the Weapon X program before being liberated by Nick Fury.[148]\\r\\nT'Challa, the younger son of King T'Chaka of Wakanda, is severely injured during the \\"Trial of the Panther\\" from which the protector of the nation is selected. His older brother M'Baku finds T'Challa bloodied, mute, and near death but derisively calls him a fool for attempting the trial. Later, M'Baku adds that he, not T'Challa, should have taken the trial. Angry that his father has decided to share Wakanda's technology in exchange for America's help in saving T'Challa's life, M'Baku leaves the kingdom.\\r\\nTo save T'Challa, T'Chaka turns him over to the Weapon X program. Over a year later, a healthy T'Challa, in his full Black Panther garb, has enhanced speed, strength, night vision, and healing ability. Additionally, he can summon short, cat-like Adamantium claws from his knuckles by balling his hands into fists. T'Chaka becomes outraged upon learning that S.H.I.E.L.D. (who had shut down Weapon X and freed T'Challa) now considers his son an asset of the U.S. and S.H.I.E.L.D. He subsequently sends M'Baku a letter, claiming that M'Baku, not T'Challa, is the titular \\"favorite son\\", and he implores M'Baku to return.\\r\\nFury has Captain America train and mentor the Panther, who reveals his damaged throat. Captain America, sympathizing for the Panther's plight, encourages Fury to place the Panther in the superhero team the Ultimates. This turns out to be a ruse in which Captain America impersonates the Panther, allowing T'Challa to escape and return home to Wakanda.[149]\\r\\nCaptain America later impersonates Black Panther during an Ultimates confrontation with the Juggernaut.[150]\\r\\nAfter Ultimatum, Black Panther joins the New Ultimates.[151]\\r\\nChadwick Boseman portrays T'Challa within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, first appearing in Captain America: Civil War (2016).[165][166] In the film, he is shown displaying enhanced speed, agility, strength, and durability, which he gains from ingesting the heart-shaped herb, as in the comics.[167] His suit has retractable claws and is made of a vibranium weave, which can deflect heavy machine gun fire. As of the 2018 film Black Panther, he wears a new variant of the suit that can absorb kinetic energy (represented as purple highlights) and release it as a purple shockwave after enough has been amassed. It can also fold into a silver necklace.\\r\\nIn 2016, Disney XD launched on its YouTube channel the motion comic \\"Black Panther in ...

The British were among the most important colonizers of the Americas, and their American empire came to rival the Spanish American colonies in military and economic might.\\r\\nThree types of colonies existed in the British Empire in America during the height of its power in the 18th Century. These were charter colonies, proprietary colonies and royal colonies. A group of 13 British American colonies collectively broke from the British Empire in the 1770s through a successful revolution, establishing the modern United States. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars (1803ÿ15), British territories in the Americas were slowly granted more responsible government. In 1838 the Durham Report recommended full responsible government for Canada, but this was not fully implemented for another decade. Eventually, with the Confederation of Canada, the Canadian colonies were granted significant autonomy and became a self-governing Dominion in 1867. Other colonies in the Americas followed at a much slower pace. In this way, two countries in North America, ten in the Caribbean, and one in South America have received their independence from the United Kingdom. All of these, except the United States, are members of the Commonwealth of Nations and nine are Commonwealth realms. The eight current British overseas territories in the Americas have varying degrees of self-government.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of English colonies were established under a system of Proprietary Governors, who were appointed under mercantile charters to English joint stock companies to found and run settlements.\\r\\nIn 1664, England took over the Dutch colony of New Netherland (including its capital of New Amsterdam) which England renamed the Province of New York. With New Netherland, the English also came to control the former New Sweden (in what is now Delaware), which the Dutch had conquered earlier. This later became part of Pennsylvania after that was established in 1680.\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Scotland tried unsuccessfully to establish a colony at Darin, and the Scottish colonization of Nova Scotia (New Scotland) lasted from 1629 to 1632. Thousands of Scotsmen also participated in English colonization before the two countries were united in 1707.\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Great Britain acquired the French colony of Acadia in 1713 and then Canada and the Spanish colony of Florida in 1763. After being renamed the Province of Quebec, the former French Canada was divided into two Provinces, the Canadas, consisting of the old settled country of Lower Canada (today Quebec) and the newly settled Upper Canada (today Ontario).\\r\\nIn the north, the Hudson's Bay Company actively traded for fur with the indigenous peoples, and had competed with French, Aboriginal, and Mtis fur traders. The company came to control the entire drainage basin of Hudson Bay, called Rupert's Land. The small part of the Hudson Bay drainage south of the 49th parallel went to the United States in the Anglo-American Convention of 1818.\\r\\nThirteen of Great Britain's colonies rebelled in the American Revolutionary War, beginning in 1775, primarily over representation, local laws and tax issues, and established the United States of America, which was recognised internationally with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 3 September 1783.\\r\\nGreat Britain also colonised the west coast of North America, indirectly via the Hudson's Bay Company licenses west of the Rocky Mountains: the Columbia District and New Caledonia fur district. Most of these were jointly claimed as the Oregon Country by the United States from 1818 until the 49th parallel was established as the international boundary west of the Rockies by the Oregon Treaty of 1846. The Colony of Vancouver Island, founded in 1849, and the Colony of British Columbia, founded in 1858, were combined in 1866 under the name Colony of British Columbia, and joined the Confederation in 1871. British Columbia was expanded with the inclusion of the Stikine Territory in 1863; and upon joining Confederation the Peace River Block, formerly part of Rupert's Land, was added.\\r\\nIn 1867, the colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the Province of Canada (the southern portion of modern-day Ontario and Quebec) combined to form a self-governing dominion, named Canada, within the British Empire (the term \\"kingdom\\" was avoided so as to not provoke the United States). Quebec (including what is now the southern portion of Ontario) and Nova Scotia (including what is now New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island) had been ceded to Britain by the French. The colonies of Prince Edward Island and British Columbia joined over the next six years, and Newfoundland joined in 1949. Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory were ceded to Canada in 1870. This area now consists of the provinces of Manitoba (admitted after negotiation between Canada and a Mtis provisional government in 1870), Saskatchewan, and Alberta (both created in 1905), as well as the Northwest Territories, the Yukon Territory (created 1898, following the start of the Klondike Gold Rush), and Nunavut (created in 1999).\\r\\nIn order of settlement or founding:","input":"What was the first british colony in america?"},{"output":"seven","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nPakistan officially joined the United Nations (UN) on 30 September 1947 just over a month after its independence from the British Empire.

In doing so, it will also take into account other factors.\\"At the time, Jammu and Kasmir had 4 million inhabitants, majority, Muslim, with the Maharaja being Hindu. In September 1947, he started a campaign to drive many Muslims out of Kasmir. over 200,00 fled and finally the Muslims rose in rebellion. The Maharaja initially fought back but appealed for assistance to the Governor-General Louis Mountbatten, who agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India. Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession on 26 October 1947, which was accepted by the Governor General of India the next day. Once the Instrument of Accession was signed, Indian soldiers entered Kashmir with orders to evict the rebels. India took the matter to the United Nations.[2] The UN resolution asked Pakistan to pull its Army out from Kashmir but allowed India to leave only the minimum number of troops needed to keep civil order so that a referendum can be held under UN observation. After the required withdrawal did not occur for several years Jammu & Kashmir National Conference which was the largest political party in the state recommended convening the constituent assembly in a resolution passed on 27 October 1950.[7] On 1 May 1951 Karan Singh then Head of state of Jammu and Kashmir issued a proclamation directing the formation of this assembly. The assembly was to be constituted of elected representatives of the people of the state. For purposes of this election the state was divided into constituencies containing population of 40,000 or as near thereto as possible and each electing one member.[8] The United Nations Security Council stated in its resolution 91 dated 30 March 1951 that it would not consider elections held only in Indian administered Kashmir to be a substitute for a free and impartial plebiscite including the people of the entire state Jammu and Kashmir.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the 1951 elections were said to be totally rigged.[3][4]Polls were conducted in Indian administered Kashmir in AugustÿSeptember 1951. There were no women registered as voters in 1951 Jammu and Kashmir elections. But there was one woman who contested who lost her deposit.[9] Jammu & Kashmir National Conference won 75 seats under the leadership of Sheikh Abdullah.[10][11] On 31 October 1951 he addressed the assembly for the first time and called on it to frame the states constitution and to give a 'reasoned conclusion regarding accession'. On 15 February 1954 the assembly members who were present cast a unanimous vote ratifying the state's accession to India.[13][14] Constitution was drafted which came into force on 26 January 1957. Part II, section (3) of the constitution states 'The State of Jammu and Kashmir is and shall be an integral part of the Union of India'.In 1956 the Constituent Assembly finalised its constitution, which declared the whole of the former Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir to be 'an integral part of the Union of India'. Elections were held the next year for a Legislative Assembly. This section cannot be legally amended as per provisions of Part XII of the constitution. The United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) was deployed to supervise the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. UNMOGIP's functions were to investigate complaints of ceasefire violations and submit findings to each party and to the U.N. Secretary-General.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN continues to remain a keen observer of the Kashmir conflict between Pakistan and India, centring on the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir.

It is primarily developed by Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), and published by Rockstar Games. The name of the series references the term used in the US for motor vehicle theft.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost games in the series are set in fictional locales modelled on cities, usually either Liberty City, Vice City or San Andreas, which are stand-ins for New York City, Miami and the state of California, respectively. The first game encompassed three fictional cities, while subsequent titles tend to emphasise a single setting. Gameplay focuses on an open world where the player can choose missions to progress an overall story, as well as engaging in side activities, all consisting of action-adventure, driving, third-person shooting, occasional role-playing, stealth and racing elements. The series focuses around many different protagonists who attempt to rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld, although their motives for doing so vary in each game. The series also has elements of the earlier beat 'em up games from the 16-bit era. The antagonists are commonly characters who have betrayed the protagonist or his organisation, or characters who have the most impact impeding the protagonist's progress. Film and music veterans have voiced characters, including Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, Debbie Harry, Phil Collins, Axl Rose and Peter Fonda.[3] With its British origin, the series contains satire and humour.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish video game developer DMA Design began the series in 1997. As of  2014[update], it has eleven stand-alone games and four expansion packs. The third chronological title, Grand Theft Auto III, is considered a landmark title, as it brought the series to a 3D setting and more immersive experience. Subsequent titles would follow and build upon the concept established in Grand Theft Auto III, and receive significant acclaim. They subsequently influenced many other open world action games, and led to the label Grand Theft Auto clone on similar games.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series has been critically acclaimed and commercially successful, having shipped more than 250 million units,[5] making it the fourth-highest selling video game franchise of all time, behind Nintendo's Mario and Pokmon franchises,[6] and Tetris.[7] In 2006, Grand Theft Auto was featured in a list of British design icons in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum.[8] In 2013, The Telegraph ranked Grand Theft Auto among Britain's most successful exports.[4] However, the series has also been controversial for its adult nature and violent themes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Theft Auto series is split into separate fictional universes, named after the primary level of graphics capability used in each era.[9] The original Grand Theft Auto, its expansions and its sequel are considered the \\"2D universe\\". Grand Theft Auto III and its sequels are considered the \\"3D universe\\". Grand Theft Auto IV, its expansions and Grand Theft Auto V are considered the \\"HD universe\\". Each universe is considered separate with only brands, place names and background characters shared between them.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto, the first game in the series, was released for Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS in October 1997, ported to the PlayStation in 1998 and the Game Boy Color in 1999. Grand Theft Auto 2 was released in 1999 for Microsoft Windows, later receiving ports on the PlayStation, Dreamcast and Game Boy Color.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe PlayStation 2 also featured three instalments of the main series, all of which have been re-released on several platforms; a deal between Take-Two Interactive and Sony Computer Entertainment resulted in their timed exclusivity on the PlayStation 2, before receiving ports to Microsoft Windows and the Xbox.[13] The 2001 title Grand Theft Auto III moved away from the two-dimension (2D) graphics used in the first two games to three-dimension (3D) computer graphics[14] Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was published in 2002, and was the first to feature a speaking protagonist, voiced by Ray Liotta.[15] Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, released in 2004, introduced various new elements, including character customisation and a large map encompassing three cities and surrounding rural area.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo main instalments were published for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The 2008 title Grand Theft Auto IV focused on realism and detail, removing various customisation features, while adding an online multiplayer mode.[17] Grand Theft Auto V, published in 2013, featured three playable protagonists.[18] It was released to massive financial success, breaking multiple records.[19] It was later re-released with various enhancements, in 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and in 2015 for Microsoft Windows.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto has spawned numerous additional games and expansion packs. In 1999, the original game received two expansion packs: Grand Theft Auto: London 1969 and Grand Theft Auto: London 1961.[12] Grand Theft Auto Advance, released in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance, featured a top-down perspective. Three games were released for the PlayStation Portable. The 2005 game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories is a prequel to Grand Theft Auto III, while the 2006 game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories is a prequel to Vice City; both games were later ported to the PlayStation 2. In 2009, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars was released for the Nintendo DS, and later ported to the PlayStation Portable.[21] In 2009, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony were released for the Xbox 360 as expansion packs to Grand Theft Auto IV; a \\"strategic alliance\\" between Rockstar and Microsoft resulted in the timed exclusivity. They were later released on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows as part of a compilation, titled Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous titles in the series have received ports to mobile devices. Chinatown Wars was released for iOS in 2010 and for Android and Fire OS in 2014.[23] For their tenth anniversaries, Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City were both re-released for iOS and Android in 2011 and 2012, respectively.[24][25] In 2013, San Andreas was ported to iOS, Android & Windows Phone and RT?;[26] the mobile port was later re-released for Xbox 360 in 2014, the year of the game's tenth anniversary,[27] and the following year for PlayStation 3.[28] In 2015 Liberty City Stories was ported to iOS, Android & Fire OS.[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto Double Pack was released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It includes Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City.[31] Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy is a compilation of III, Vice City, and San Andreas. The compilation was first released in 2005 for the Xbox.[32] Later it was released for the PlayStation 2, Windows, Mac OS X, and PlayStation 4.[33][34][35][36] The Trilogy also served as the revised package for San Andreas, which had to be pulled from shelves due to the controversial Hot Coffee mod.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City is a standalone compilation of the episodes for Grand Theft Auto IV.  It contains both The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony on one disc. It was released on 29 October 2009 for the Xbox 360 and on 13 April 2010 for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3. Microsoft added Episodes from Liberty City to its backwards compatibility list for Xbox One platforms in February 2017.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series has been expanded into various other formats. Jacked: The Outlaw Story of Grand Theft Auto, a book written by David Kushner chronicling the development of the series, was published in 2012.[39] In March 2015, BBC Two announced The Gamechangers, a 90-minute docudrama based on the creation of Grand Theft Auto,[40] Directed by Owen Harris and written by James Wood, the drama stars Daniel Radcliffe as Rockstar president Sam Houser and Bill Paxton as disbarred attorney Jack Thompson.[41] In May 2015, Rockstar filed a lawsuit against the BBC for trademark infringement, stating that they had no involvement with the development of the film and had unsuccessfully tried to contact the BBC to resolve the matter.[42] It first aired on 15 September 2015 on BBC Two.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, McFarland & Company published The Meaning and Culture of Grand Theft Auto.[44] Compiled by Nate Garrelts, the 264-page book is a collection of essays regarding the Grand Theft Auto series, to help audiences better understand the games and to make a point about due diligence of game criticism. The book is divided into two parts: the first part discusses the controversies surrounding the series, while the second half takes a theoretical look at the games absent of the controversy.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nA planned film adaptation of the series is unable to proceed because of a lawsuit by Roger Corman, who produced Grand Theft Auto. In 2017, Corman said, \\"I actually sued the video game manufacturer who flat-out stole the idea. We settled out of court and they gave me some money. I retain the right to remake it, but the way it was actually written in the contract is a little bit cloudy. My lawyers are actually studying that contract to make certain that I have a clear title to remake my picture, and I will remake Grand Theft Auto.\\"[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach game in this series allows the player to take on the role of a criminal in the big city, typically an individual who plans to rise through the ranks of organised crime through the course of the game. The player is given various missions by kingpins and major idols in the city underworld which must be completed to progress through the storyline. Assassinations and other violent crimes are featured regularly. Occasionally taxi driving, firefighting, street racing, bus driving, or learning to fly helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are also involved in the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn later titles, notably those released after Grand Theft Auto 2, the player is given a more developed storyline in which they are forced to overcome an unfortunate event (e.g., being betrayed and left for dead), which serves as motivation for the character to advance up the criminal ladder and ultimately leads to the triumph of the character by the end of the storyline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Theft Auto series belongs to a genre of free-roaming role-playing video games called open world games, and grants a large amount of freedom to the player. Traditional action games are structured as a single track series of levels with linear gameplay, but in Grand Theft Auto the player can determine the missions that they want to undertake, and their relationship with various characters are changed based on these choices. Influenced by the earlier game Turbo Esprit,[47][48] the cities of the games can be roamed freely at any point in the game, and are examples of open world video game environments which offer accessible buildings with minor missions in addition to the main storyline. There are exceptions: missions follow a linear, overarching plot. These missions are required to complete in order to unlock new areas in the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto III and subsequent games have more voice acting and radio stations, which simulate driving to music with disc jockeys, radio personalities, commercials, talk radio, pop music, and American culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of vehicles in an explorable urban environment provides a basic simulation of a working city, complete with pedestrians who generally obey traffic signals. Further details are used to flesh out an open-ended atmosphere that has been used in several other games, such as The Simpsons: Hit & Run, which has less emphasis on crime or violence, and Lego City Undercover, which reverses the roles of police officer and criminal, although the player goes undercover in gangs for a portion of the game.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCriminal activities in Grand Theft Auto games do not go unnoticed by the police. As the player engages in these in-game illegal activities, they may gain a \\"wanted level\\", represented by a maximum of five or six stars. A small crime, such as running over a non-player character, may create a one star wanted level situation, while shooting an officer may earn more stars. As the number of stars increase, the amount and strength of the response will increase; a single star might have a few police cars chase after the player, while at 5 or 6 stars, tanks and attack helicopters will chase down the player. Many in-game missions will automatically give the player a wanted level after completing a certain event which they must then get rid of before the mission is complete. Often, trying to keep away from the police while wanted will cause the player to gain even higher wanted levels. The player can remove their character's wanted level by avoiding detection or spending in-game money at specific locations to elude the police (such as a mod shop to repaint their car). Alternatively, if the player-character dies, they will respawn at a hospital and the wanted level will be removed, though the player may lose money, guns, and other benefits they had before being chased. The \\"wanted level\\" gameplay concept has become common in other GTA Clones and similar open world games.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Theft Auto series is set in a fictional version of the world, in a number of different time periods. The original Grand Theft Auto introduced three main cities: Liberty City, based upon New York City, Vice City, based upon Miami, and San Andreas, based upon mostly parts of California. In the first Grand Theft Auto game, San Andreas was based on San Francisco and parts of Las Vegas. Expansion packs later set the game in London.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second entry in the franchise, Grand Theft Auto 2, set the game in the future in a locale named \\"Anywhere City\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequent games in the series have re-imagined and expanded upon the original locales. Grand Theft Auto III is set in a different rendition of Liberty City only loosely based on New York City.[49] A revised Vice City and San Andreas are depicted in Vice City and San Andreas, respectively, the latter of which takes the form of an entire state, instead of a single city. The state of San Andreas is based on the states of California and Nevada, and consists of three major cities: Los Santos (Los Angeles), San Fierro (San Francisco), and Las Venturas (Las Vegas). Surrounding towns and areas of desert, water, woodland, and countryside lie between the three cities. The GTA III rendition of Liberty City is also briefly featured during one mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiberty City Stories and Vice City Stories, originally released for PlayStation Portable handheld console and later re-issued for other consoles, are set in the previous depictions of their respective eponymous cities, but in different decades. The maps for the two cities remain the same, with some differences in terms of buildings and geography to reflect the different time periods.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto IV and its subsequent expansion packs The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony are set in a third revision of Liberty City, set in 2008, which is a closer analogue to New York City and its boroughs than the GTA III version.[50] Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is also set in this version of Liberty City, although the Alderney portion of the map is not present.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto V, released in 2013, is set in a revised depiction of southern San Andreas that only features Los Santos (Los Angeles) to the south and the rural Blaine County to the north.[52] It includes revised landmarks such as the \\"Vinewood\\" sign (instead of Hollywood), Rockford Hills (instead of Beverly Hills), Del Perro Pier (instead of Santa Monica Pier), Los Santos International Airport (LSX) (instead of LAX), Los Santos Golf Club (instead of Los Angeles Country Club.), and Galileo Observatory (instead of Griffith Observatory). The game also features the town of Ludendorff in the fictional state of North Yankton. Los Angeles was extensively researched for Grand Theft Auto V. The team organised field research trips with tour guides and architectural historians and captured around 250,000 photos and hours of video footage during these visits.[53] Since the release of the game, hundreds of in-game buildings have been identified as being based on real-world landmarks.[54] The New Yorker's Sam Sweet notes that, with sales of game reaching thirteen million copies, \\"there will be more people living in the imaginary state of Los Santos than in the real city on which it was modelled.\\"[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn both Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Grand Theft Auto V, Los Santos and the state of San Andreas are depicted as being on an island an undetermined distance from the US mainland. In both games it is possible to circumnavigate the state by boat. Similarly, the versions of Liberty City and Alderney in Grand Theft Auto IV and expansion packs are also completely located on islands, as is Vice City. The GTA III rendition of Liberty City however, while mostly island, is connected to mainland on its Northwest corner (a region the player cannot navigate).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly the expansion packs for the original Grand Theft Auto, London 1969 and London 1961, set in London, have featured a location outside the United States and used a real-life location.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series has included a wide variety of voice actors. The original Grand Theft Auto, its mission packs and its sequel, as well as Grand Theft Auto Advance and Chinatown Wars did not feature any voice credited to specific roles.[56][57] The first game in the series to do so was Grand Theft Auto III which, despite a limited budget and the series' low profile at the time,[58] featured several notable actors from film and television. These included Frank Vincent, Michael Madsen and Kyle MacLachlan, who all had prominent roles. At the time it was rare for a video game to use such high-profile actors, and Grand Theft Auto III is considered a pioneer in doing so.[59]  The next game, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, featured more film actors, including Ray Liotta as the player character.  Although the following title, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, also featured many notable film actorssuch as Samuel L. Jackson, Peter Fonda and James Woodsit had been decided that the use of such actors should be reduced, particularly for leading roles. As a result, many of the prominent roles in San Andreas were voiced by lower profile actors or rappers.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Liberty City Stories through to Grand Theft Auto V, the series has continued using lesser known actors to voice main characters, but still uses celebrities and real-life radio personalities to voice the DJs of the many radio stations featured in each game. Some games also feature celebrities portraying themselves, such as Lazlow Jones, Phil Collins,[60] Ricky Gervais[61] and Katt Williams.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to The Guinness World Records 2008 and 2009 Gamer's Edition, it is the most controversial video game series in history, with over 4,000 articles published about it, which include accusations of glamorising violence, corrupting gamers, and connection to real life crimes.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game was controversial from the very first incarnation of the series.[63] Grand Theft Auto was condemned in Britain, Germany, and France due to its \\"extreme violence\\",[64] and Brazil banned it outright.[64] Publicist Max Clifford planted sensational stories in tabloids in order to help sell the first game.[63][65][66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe controversies flared up again with Grand Theft Auto III, since the 3D graphics made the violence more realistic, and players could pay for the services of prostitutes to restore their health, and if they wished, kill them to get some of their money back.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also criticism from the focus on illegal activities in comparison with traditional \\"heroic\\" roles that other games offer. The main character can commit a wide variety of crimes and violent acts while dealing with only temporary consequences, including the killing of policemen and military personnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sixth game in the series, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, also came under criticism. One mission in particular, in which the player must instigate a gang war between Haitian and Cuban gangs, has been controversial. Haitian and Cuban anti-defamation groups criticised the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nJean-Robert Lafortune of the Haitian American Grassroots Coalition is quoted as saying that \\"The game shouldn't be designed to destroy human life, it shouldn't be designed to destroy an ethnic group,\\" for this and similar scenarios, including lines in the game's script such as \\"kill the Haitian dickheads\\" said by character \\"Diaz\\" during an altercation between the player and a Haitian gang. After the threat of a lawsuit by the Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition, Rockstar removed the word \\"Haitians\\" from this phrase in the game's subtitles.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nSan Andreas was criticised initially due to its \\"gangster\\" elements, which include drugs, prostitution, and murder. Later it received additional criticism after the discovery of an interactive sex minigame, nicknamed Hot Coffee; initially cut from the game, it remained in the game code, and was discovered in both the console and Windows versions of the game. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, modders managed to find the unused code in the game and released unofficial patches for the Windows and Xbox (with a modchip) versions as well as a PlayStation 2 version through the use of an Action Replay code enabling the player to engage in these sexual mini-games (dubbed \\"Hot Coffee\\" in reference to a euphemism for sex used in the game). These mini-games were left partially intact in the game's code. This prompted application of an AO (Adults Only) ESRB rating to the version of the game containing the leftover code. Take-Two Interactive was forced to re-release the game in order to restore the M (Mature) rating. A class action lawsuit against Take-Two was also filed as a result of the \\"Hot Coffee\\" code.[68][69]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the controversies involved with this game was Mothers Against Drunk Driving's (MADD) criticism of the ability to drink and drive as a new feature. MADD had even requested ESRB to change the rating of the game from \\"M\\" for ages seventeen and up to \\"AO\\", for adults only, because they felt it was inappropriate for children, even at the age of seventeen, to experience drunk driving in such a manner.[70] In the final game, drunk driving is a playable event, but it is a crime that automatically generates a wanted rating and main playable character Niko Bellic loudly (and drunkenly) proclaims that it is a \\"bad idea\\" and that he \\"should know better\\".[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotably, it is impossible to drive while drunk in the GTA IV expansions, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony. These were released after the criticism. It is, however, possible to drive drunk again in the successor, Grand Theft Auto V.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lost and Damned expansion pack for Grand Theft Auto IV was condemned by US parents group Common Sense Media who issued a public warning against the pack's content due to a full-frontal nudity scene during one of the cutscenes. They claimed the game was \\"more controversial than its predecessors\\" because it featured \\"full frontal male nudity\\".[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nDan Houser, on the making of Chinatown Wars for the Nintendo DS[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has been some controversy over a drug dealing minigame[75] along with comments that some Nintendo games are being aimed at children (despite the fact that the game was rated Mature). The drug dealing mini-game allows players to peddle six types of drugs around the city, but the profit the player makes depends on market conditions, which will be based on the area in which they deal, and the level of regular service this area receives from them.[76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nA segment in the latest instalment caused controversy for scenes containing player initiated torture. The mission \\"By the Book\\" features graphic depictions of kneecapping, electrocution, dental extraction and waterboarding, and the player is required to perform the acts in order to progress in the game.[78][79][80]\\r\\n\\r\\nUK-based charity Freedom from Torture publicly condemned the use of torture scenes in Grand Theft Auto V. The organisation, who works to rehabilitate survivors of torture, joined other human rights charities who were outraged at a torture scene in the game in which the players have to pull teeth and electrocute an unarmed man in order to extract information. The charity's CEO Keith Best stated: Rockstar North has crossed a line by effectively forcing people to take on the role of a torturer and perform a series of unspeakable acts if they want to achieve success in the game.\\"[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game has also been accused of sexism. The Los Angeles Times considered the game's  satirical portrayals of women uncreative, and added that violent and sexist themes hurt the game experience.[81] Edge noted that while \\"every female in the game exists solely to be sneered, leered or laughed at\\", it treated its all-male lead characters in a similar vein through their stereotyped tendencies towards violence.[82] Sam Houser, Rockstar Games co-founder, felt that the development team sometimes overlooked their portrayal of women in Grand Theft Auto games, but that the weight towards male characters \\"fit with the story we wanted to tell\\".[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral celebrities have sued Rockstar Games and/or Take-Two Interactive for purportedly violating their intellectual property or personality rights, including hip-hop artist Daz Dillinger,[84] Karen Gravano of Mob Wives,[85]  and actress Lindsay Lohan.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer lawyer Jack Thompson has been involved in a number of attempts to get families of murder victims to hold the Grand Theft Auto series accountable for the death of their loved ones. Due to his conduct in this and related cases, Thompson was disbarred in 2008[87] and was fined more than $100,000 by the Florida Bar Association.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 20 October 2003, the families of Aaron Hamel and Kimberly Bede, two young people shot by teens William and Josh Buckner (who in statements to investigators claimed their actions were inspired by Grand Theft Auto III) filed a US$246 million lawsuit against publishers Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive Software, retailer Walmart, and PlayStation 2 manufacturer Sony Computer Entertainment America.[89][90] Rockstar and its parent company, Take-Two, filed for dismissal of the lawsuit, stating in US District Court on 29 October 2003 that the \\"ideas and concepts as well as the 'purported psychological effects' on the Buckners are protected by the First Amendment's free-speech clause\\". The lawyer of the victims, Jack Thompson, denied that, but failed in his attempt to move the lawsuit into a state court and under Tennessee's consumer protection act.[91] Two days later, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, and the case was closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2005, a lawsuit was brought upon the makers and distributors of the Grand Theft Auto series claiming the games caused a teenager to shoot and kill three members of the Alabama police force. The shooting took place in June 2003 when Devin Moore, 17 years old at the time, was taken in for questioning by police in Fayette, Alabama regarding a stolen vehicle. Moore then grabbed a pistol from one of the police officers and shot and killed him along with another officer and dispatcher before fleeing in a police car.[92][93] One of Moore's attorneys, Jack Thompson, claimed it was Grand Theft Auto's graphic naturewith his constant playing timethat caused Moore to commit the murders, and Moore's family agrees. Damages were being sought from branches of GameStop and Wal-Mart in Jasper, Alabama, the stores from which Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, respectively, were purchased and also from the games' publisher Take-Two Interactive, and the PlayStation 2 manufacturer Sony Computer Entertainment. On 29 March 2006 the case was dismissed and permission to appeal was denied.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2005, Jack Thompson appeared via satellite on the Glenn Beck program on CNN's Headline News. Thompson mentioned Devin Moore and said regarding Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City \\"There's no doubt in my mind [...] that but for Devin Moore's training on this cop killing simulator, he would not have been able to kill three cops in Fayette, Alabama who are now dead and in the ground. We are suing Take-Two, Sony, Wal-Mart, and GameStop for having trained Devin Moore to kill. He had no history of violence. No criminal record.\\"[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2006, Thompson brought another lawsuit, claiming that Cody Posey played the game obsessively before murdering his father Delbert Paul Posey, stepmother Tryone Schmid, and stepsister Marilea Schmid on a ranch in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The suit was filed on behalf of the victims' families.[96] The suit alleged that were it not for his obsessive playing of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, the murders would not have taken place.[97] Named in the suit were Cody Posey, Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, and Sony. The suit asked for US$600 million in damages.[98] During the criminal trial, Posey's defence team argued he was abused by his father, and tormented by his stepmother.[99] Posey was also taking Zoloft at the time of the killings.[100] The lawsuit was dismissed in December 2007.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nEver since the release of Grand Theft Auto III in 2001, the Grand Theft Auto series has been a major success, both critically and financially. It has generated perfect or near perfect reviews and scores on almost all of the games; by September 2013, the series sold over 150 million copies worldwide,[166] and as of August 2015, Grand Theft Auto shipped over 220 million units worldwide.[6] The Times Online reported that Grand Theft Auto IV recorded 609,000 copies in the UK on its first day of release.[167] In its first week, Grand Theft Auto IV sold approximately 6 million copies worldwide and grossed over $500 million.[168]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, Grand Theft Auto was voted one of Britain's top 10 designs in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum. The game appeared in a list of British design icons which included Concorde, Jaguar E-Type, Aston Martin DB5, Mini, World Wide Web, Tomb Raider, K2 telephone box, London tube map, AEC Routemaster bus and the Supermarine Spitfire.[8][169]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series has broken several records, resulting in Guinness World Records awarding the series 10 world records in the Gamer's Edition 2008. These records include Most Guest Stars in a Video Game Series, Largest Voice Cast in a Video Game (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas), Largest In-Game Soundtrack (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas) as well as Most Successful Entertainment Launch of All Time (Grand Theft Auto V). Guinness World Records also ranked Grand Theft Auto in third place on their list of top 50 console games of all time based on initial impact and lasting legacy.[170] Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is listed as the most successful game on the PlayStation 2 according to The Guinness World Records 2009 Gamer's Edition.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto III, San Andreas and Vice City currently lie at the 2nd, 5th and 6th highest rated PlayStation 2 games on Metacritic, respectively,[171] while Chinatown Wars is rated the best game on the Nintendo DS[172] and the second best on the PlayStation Portable,[173] and Grand Theft Auto IV is currently rated the second best game ever, with a score of 98, only trailing behind The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Also, Vice City, Grand Theft Auto III, San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto IV and Grand Theft Auto V lie at 11th, 24th, 27th, 93rd and 2nd best PC games of all time, on Metacritic.[174][175] Along with this, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony are currently placed 35th and 59th in the top Xbox 360 games.[176]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe release of Grand Theft Auto III is treated as a major event in the history of video games, much like the release of Doom nearly a decade earlier.[188]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring interviews to mark the 10th anniversary of the release of Grand Theft Auto III, producer of the Street Fighter series, Yoshinori Ono, said \\"It would be no exaggeration to say that Grand Theft Auto III changed the industry, and we can basically separate the time before and after its emergence as distinct eras.\\" In the same article Bethesda studios director, Todd Howard, said \\"The mark of a truly great game is how many people try to recapture or emulate it and fail. There's a long line behind this one.\\"[189]\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequent games that follow this formula of driving and shooting have been called \\"Grand Theft Auto clones\\". Some reviewers even extended this label to the Driver series, even though this series began years before the release of Grand Theft Auto III.[190]\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto clones are a type of 3D action-adventure game,[191][192][193][194][195] where players are given the ability to drive any vehicle or fire any weapon as they explore an open world.[196] These games often incorporate violent and criminal themes. Notable games that are comparable to Grand Theft Auto are Saints Row,[197] Scarface: The World Is Yours,[198] True Crime: Streets of LA,[199][200] Watch Dogs,[201] Sleeping Dogs,[202] Just Cause,[203] Mafia[204] and The Godfather.[205]","input":"Who created the famous grand theft auto game series?"},{"output":"the highest point in Jacksonville is only 40 feet (12.2 meters) above sea level","context":"","input":"How high above sea level is jacksonville fl?"},{"output":"mammals","context":"","input":"What class of vertebrates do seals belong to?"},{"output":"is a medical institution located in Bangalore, India","context":"The National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS; (Hindi: ?????????? ?????? ????????? ??? ???????? ??????? ???????) is a medical institution located in Bangalore, India.

The city is a center for the music,[8] healthcare, publishing, private prison,[9] banking and transportation industries, and is home to numerous colleges and universities.\\r\\nSince 1963, Nashville has had a consolidated city-county government, which includes six smaller municipalities in a two-tier system. The city is governed by a mayor, a vice-mayor, and a 40-member Metropolitan Council; 35 of the members are elected from single-member districts, while the other five are elected at-large. Reflecting the city's position in state government, Nashville is home to the Tennessee Supreme Court's courthouse for Middle Tennessee.\\r\\nAccording to 2017 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, the total consolidated city-county population stood at 691,243.[3] The \\"balance\\" population, which excludes semi-independent municipalities within Davidson County, was 667,560 (2017).[5] The 2017 population of the entire 13-county Nashville metropolitan area was 1,903,045, making it the largest metropolitan statistical area in Tennessee.[4] The 2015 population of the Nashville-DavidsonÿMurfreesboroÿColumbia combined statistical area, a larger trade area, was 2,027,489.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe town of Nashville was founded by James Robertson, John Donelson, and a party of Overmountain Men in 1779, near the original Cumberland settlement of Fort Nashborough. It was named for Francis Nash, the American Revolutionary War hero. Nashville quickly grew because of its strategic location, accessibility as a port on the Cumberland River, a tributary of the Ohio River; and its later status as a major railroad center. By 1800, the city had 345 residents, including 136 African American slaves and 14 free blacks.[11] In 1806, Nashville was incorporated as a city and became the county seat of Davidson County, Tennessee. In 1843, the city was named the permanent capital of the state of Tennessee.\\r\\nThe city government of Nashville owned 24 slaves by 1831, and 60 prior to the war. They were \\"put to work to build the first successful water system and maintain the streets.\\"[12]\\r\\nBy 1860, when the first rumblings of secession began to be heard across the South, antebellum Nashville was a prosperous city. The city's significance as a shipping port made it a desirable prize as a means of controlling important river and railroad transportation routes. In February 1862, Nashville became the first state capital to fall to Union troops. The state was occupied by Union troops for the duration of the war. The Battle of Nashville (December 15ÿ16, 1864) was a significant Union victory and perhaps the most decisive tactical victory gained by either side in the war; it was also the war's final major military action. Afterward, the Confederates conducted a war of attrition, making guerrilla raids and engaging in small skirmishes, with the Confederate forces in the Deep South almost constantly in retreat.\\r\\nWithin a few years after the Civil War, the Nashville chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded by Confederate veteran John W. Morton.[13]\\r\\nMeanwhile, the city had reclaimed its important shipping and trading position and developed a solid manufacturing base. The postÿCivil War years of the late 19th century brought new prosperity to Nashville and Davidson County. These healthy economic times left the city with a legacy of grand classical-style buildings, including the Parthenon in Centennial Park, near downtown.[14]\\r\\nOn April 30, 1892, Ephraim Grizzard, an African-American man, was lynched in front of a white mob of 10,000 in Nashville.[15] It was described by journalist Ida B. Wells as \\"A naked, bloody example of the blood-thirstiness of the nineteenth century civilization of the Athens of the South.\\"[16] From 1877 to 1950, a total of six lynchings of blacks were conducted in Davidson County, most in Nashville near the turn of the century.[17]\\r\\nCirca 1950 the state legislature approved a new city charter that provided for the election of city council members from single-member districts, rather than at-large voting. This change was supported because at-large voting diluted the minority population's political power in the city. They could seldom gain a majority of the population to support a candidate of their choice.[citation needed]\\r\\nApportionment under the single-member districts meant that some districts had black majorities. In 1951, after passage of the new charter, African-American attorneys Z. Alexander Looby and Robert E. Lillard were elected to the city council.[18]\\r\\nRapid suburbanization occurred during the years immediately after World War II, as new housing was being built outside city limits. This resulted in a demand for many new schools and other support facilities, which the county found difficult to provide. At the same time, suburbanization led to a declining tax base in the city, although many suburban residents used unique city amenities and services supported only by city taxpayers. After years of discussion, a referendum was held in 1958 on the issue of consolidating city and county government. It failed to gain approval although it was supported by elected leaders of both jurisdictions: County Judge Beverly Briley of Davidson and Mayor Ben West of Nashville.[19]\\r\\nFollowing the referendum's failure, Nashville annexed some 42 square miles of suburban jurisdictions to expand its tax base. This increased uncertainty among residents, and created resentment among many suburban communities. Under the second charter for metropolitan government, which was approved in 1962, two levels of service provision were proposed: the General Services District and the Urban Services District, to provide for a differential in tax levels. Residents of the Urban Services District had a full range of city services. The areas that made up the General Services District, however, had a lower tax rate until full services were provided.[19] This helped reconcile aspects of services and taxation among the differing jurisdictions within the large metro region.\\r\\nOn April 19, 1960, the house of Z. Alexander Looby, an African-American attorney and council member, was bombed by segregationists.[20] Protesters marched to the city hall the next day. Mayor Ben West said he supported the desegregation of lunch counters, which civil rights activists had called for.[21]\\r\\nIn 1963, Nashville consolidated its government with Davidson County, forming a metropolitan government. The membership on the Metro Council, the legislative body, was increased from 21 to 40 seats. Of these, five members are elected at-large and 35 are elected from single-member districts, each to serve a term of four years.[19]\\r\\nOn April 8, 1967, a riot broke out on the college campuses of Fisk University and Tennessee State University after Stokely Carmichael spoke at Vanderbilt University.[22] Although it was viewed as a \\"race riot\\", it had classist characteristics.[22]\\r\\nIn 1979, the Ku Klux Klan burnt crosses outside two African-American sites in Nashville, including the city headquarters of the NAACP.[23]\\r\\nSince the 1970s, the city and county have undergone tremendous growth, particularly during the economic boom of the 1990s under the leadership of then-Mayor and later-Tennessee Governor, Phil Bredesen. Making urban renewal a priority, Bredesen fostered the construction or renovation of several city landmarks, including the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, the downtown Nashville Public Library, the Bridgestone Arena, and Nissan Stadium.[citation needed]\\r\\nNissan Stadium (formerly Adelphia Coliseum and LP Field) was built after the National Football League's (NFL) Houston Oilers agreed to move to the city in 1995. The NFL team debuted in Nashville in 1998 at Vanderbilt Stadium, and Nissan Stadium opened in the summer of 1999. The Oilers changed their name to the Tennessee Titans and finished the season with the Music City Miracle and a close Super Bowl game. The St. Louis Rams won in the last play of the game.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1997, Nashville was awarded a National Hockey League expansion team; this was named the Nashville Predators. Since the 2003ÿ04 season, the Predators have made the playoffs in all but three seasons. In 2017, they made the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history, but ultimately fell to the Pittsburgh Penguins, 4 games to 2, in the best-of-seven series.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe city bounced back after the Great Recession. In March 2012, a Gallup poll ranked Nashville in the top five regions for job growth.[24] In 2013, Nashville was described as \\"Nowville\\" and \\"It City\\" by GQ, Forbes, and The New York Times.[25][26][27]\\r\\nNashville elected its first female mayor, Megan Barry, on September 25, 2015.[28] As a council member, Barry had officiated at the city's first same-sex wedding on June 26, 2015.[29] In 2017, Nashville's economy was deemed the third fastest-growing in the nation,[30] and the city was named the \\"hottest housing market in the US\\" by Freddie Mac realtors.[31]\\r\\nOn March 6, 2018, Mayor Barry resigned before the end of her term, triggering the need for a special election. Following a ruling by the Tennessee Supreme Court, the Davidson County Election Commission set the special election for May 24, 2018, to meet the requirement of 75 to 80 days from the date of resignation.[32]\\r\\nNashville lies on the Cumberland River in the northwestern portion of the Nashville Basin. Nashville's elevation ranges from its lowest point, 385 feet (117?m) above sea level at the Cumberland River,[33] to its highest point, 1,163 feet (354?m) above sea level in the Radnor Lake State Natural Area.[34][35]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 527.9 square miles (1,367?km2), of which 504.0 square miles (1,305?km2) of it is land and 23.9 square miles (62?km2) of it (4.53%) is water.\\r\\nNashville has a humid subtropical climate (K?ppen Cfa),[36] with hot, humid summers and generally cool to mild winters typical of the Upper South.[37][38][39] Monthly averages range from 37.7?F (3.2?C) in January to 79.4?F (26.3?C) in July, with a diurnal temperature variation of 18.2 to 23.0?F (10.1 to 12.8?C).\\r\\nSnowfall occurs during the winter months, but it is usually not heavy. Average annual snowfall is about 6.3 inches (16?cm), falling mostly in January and February and occasionally in March and December.[40] The largest snow event since 2003 was on January 22, 2016, when Nashville received 8 inches (20?cm) of snow in a single storm; the largest overall was 17 inches (43?cm), received on March 17, 1892, during the St. Patrick's Day Snowstorm.[41]\\r\\nRainfall is typically greater in November and December, and spring, while August to October are the driest months on average. Spring and fall are prone to severe thunderstorms, which occasionally bring tornadoeswith recent major events on April 16, 1998; April 7, 2006; February 5, 2008; April 10, 2009; and May 1ÿ2, 2010. Relative humidity in Nashville averages 83% in the mornings and 60% in the afternoons,[42] which is considered moderate for the Southeastern United States.[43] In recent decades, due to urban development, Nashville has developed an urban heat island (UHI); especially on cool, clear nights, temperatures are up to 10?F (5.6?C) warmer in the heart of the city than in rural outlying areas. The Nashville region lies within USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 7a.[44]\\r\\nNashville's long springs and autumns combined with a diverse array of trees and grasses can often make it uncomfortable for allergy sufferers.[45] In 2008, Nashville was ranked as the 18th-worst spring allergy city in the U.S. by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.[46]\\r\\nThe coldest temperature ever recorded in Nashville was ?17?F (?27?C) on January 21, 1985, and the highest was 109?F (43?C) on June 29, 2012.[47]\\r\\nNashville's downtown area features a diverse assortment of entertainment, dining, cultural and architectural attractions. The Broadway and 2nd Avenue areas feature entertainment venues, night clubs and an assortment of restaurants. North of Broadway lie Nashville's central business district, Legislative Plaza, Capitol Hill and the Tennessee Bicentennial Mall. Cultural and architectural attractions can be found throughout the city.\\r\\nThree major interstate highways (I-40, I-65 and I-24) converge near the core area of downtown, and many regional cities are within a day's driving distance.\\r\\nNashville's first skyscraper, the Life & Casualty Tower, was completed in 1957 and launched the construction of other high rises in downtown Nashville. After the construction of the AT&T Building (commonly referred to by locals as the \\"Batman Building\\") in 1994, the downtown area saw little construction until the mid-2000s. The Pinnacle, a high rise office building, opened in 2010, the first Nashville skyscraper completed in more than 15 years.[51] Ten more skyscrapers have since been constructed or are under construction.\\r\\nMany civic and infrastructure projects are being planned, in progress, or recently completed. A new MTA bus hub was recently completed in downtown Nashville, as was the Music City Star pilot project. Several public parks have been constructed, such as the Public Square. Riverfront Park is scheduled to be extensively updated. The Music City Center opened in May 2013. It is a 1,200,000 square foot (110,000 m2) convention center with 370,000 square feet (34,000 m2) of exhibit space.\\r\\nThe data below is for all of Metropolitan Nashville-Davidson County, including other incorporated cities within the consolidated city-county (such as Belle Meade and Berry Hill).

The city's largest immigrant groups include Mexicans, Kurds,[65] Vietnamese, Laotians, Arabs, and Somalis. There are also smaller communities of Pashtuns from Afghanistan and Pakistan concentrated primarily in Antioch.[66] Nashville has the largest Kurdish community in the United States, numbering approximately 11,000.[67] In 2009, about 60,000 Bhutanese refugees were being admitted to the U.S., and some were expected to resettle in Nashville.[68] During the Iraqi election of 2005, Nashville was one of the few international locations where Iraqi expatriates could vote.[69] The American Jewish community in Nashville dates back over 150 years, and numbered about 8,000 in 2015, plus 2,000 Jewish college students.[70]\\r\\nAs of 2017[update], Nashville has the largest metropolitan area in the state of Tennessee, spanning 13 counties and an estimated population of 1,903,045.[4] The Nashville metropolitan statistical area encompasses 13 of 41 Middle Tennessee counties: Cannon, Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Hickman, Macon, Robertson, Rutherford, Smith, Sumner, Trousdale, Williamson, and Wilson.[71] The 2017 population of the Nashville-DavidsonÿMurfreesboroÿColumbia combined statistical area was estimated at 2,027,489.[10]\\r\\nAs the \\"home of country music\\", Nashville has become a major music recording and production center. The Big Four record labels, as well as numerous independent labels, have offices in Nashville, mostly in the Music Row area.[72] Nashville has been the headquarters of guitar company Gibson since 1984. Since the 1960s, Nashville has been the second-largest music production center (after New York) in the United States.[73] As of 2006, Nashville's music industry is estimated to have a total economic impact of $6.4?billion per year and to contribute 19,000 jobs to the Nashville area.[74]\\r\\nIn recent times Nashville has been described as a \\"southern boomtown\\" by numerous publications,[75][76] with it having the third fastest growing economy in the United States as of 2017.[77] It has been stated by the US Census bureau that Nashville \\"adds an average of 100 people a day to its net population increase\\".[78] The Nashville region was also stated to be the \\"Number One\\" Metro Area for Professional and Business Service Jobs in America,[79] as well as having the \\"hottest Housing market in America\\" as stated by Zillow.[80]\\r\\nAlthough Nashville is renowned as a music recording center and tourist destination, its largest industry is health care. Nashville is home to more than 300 health care companies, including Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), the world's largest private operator of hospitals.[81][82] As of 2012[update], it is estimated the health care industry contributes US$30 billion per year and 200,000 jobs to the Nashville-area economy.[83]\\r\\nCoreCivic, formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America and one of the largest private corrections company in the United States, was founded in Nashville in 1983.[84][85] Vanderbilt University was one of its investors prior to the company's initial public offering.[86] The City of Nashville's pension fund includes \\"a $921,000 stake\\" in the company as of 2017.[9] The Nashville Scene notes that, \\"A drop in CoreCivic stock value, however minor, would have a direct impact on the pension fund that represents nearly 25,000 current and former Metro employees.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe automotive industry is also becoming important for the Middle Tennessee region. Nissan North America moved its corporate headquarters in 2006 from Gardena, California (Los Angeles County) to Franklin, southwest of Nashville. Nissan also has its largest North American manufacturing plant in Smyrna, Tennessee. Largely as a result of the increased development of Nissan and other Japanese economic interests in the region, Japan moved its former New Orleans consulate-general to Nashville's Palmer Plaza.\\r\\nBridgestone has a strong presence with their North American headquarters located in Nashville, with manufacturing plants and a distribution center in nearby counties.\\r\\nOther major industries in Nashville include insurance, finance, and publishing (especially religious publishing). The city hosts headquarters operations for several Protestant denominations, including the United Methodist Church, Southern Baptist Convention, National Baptist Convention USA, and the National Association of Free Will Baptists.\\r\\nNashville is also known for some of their famously popular Southern confections, including Goo Goo Clusters (which have been made in Nashville since 1912).[87]\\r\\nFortune 500 companies with offices within Nashville include Bridgestone, Community Health Systems, Dell,[88] Dollar General, Hospital Corporation of America, Nissan North America, Philips,[89] Tractor Supply Company, and UBS. Of these, Community Health Systems, Dollar General, Hospital Corporation of America, and Tractor Supply Company are headquartered in the city.\\r\\nIn 2013, the city ranked No. 5 on Forbes' list of the Best Places for Business and Careers.[90] In 2015, Forbes put Nashville as the 4th Best City for White Collar Jobs.[91]\\r\\nIn 2015, Business Facilities' 11th Annual Rankings report named Nashville the number one city for Economic Growth Potential.[92]\\r\\nReal estate is becoming a driver for the city's economy. Based on a survey of nearly 1,500 real estate industry professionals conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Land Institute, Nashville ranked 7th nationally in terms of attractiveness to real estate investors for 2016.[93] As of October?2015[update], according to city figures, there is more than $2 billion in real estate projects underway or projected to start in 2016. Due to high yields available to investors, Nashville has been attracting a lot of capital from out-of-state. A key factor that has been attributed to the increase in investment is the adjustment to the city's zoning code. Developers can easily include a combination of residential, office, retail and entertainment space into their projects. Additionally, the city has invested heavily into public parks. Centennial Park is undergoing extensive renovations. The change in the zoning code and the investment in public space is consistent with the millennial generation's preference for walkable urban neighborhoods.[94]\\r\\nAccording to the city's 2016 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:[95]\\r\\nMuch of the city's cultural life has revolved around its large university community. Particularly significant in this respect were two groups of critics and writers who were associated with Vanderbilt University in the early 20th century: the Fugitives and the Agrarians.\\r\\nPopular destinations include Fort Nashborough and Fort Negley, the former being a reconstruction of the original settlement, the latter being a semi-restored Civil War battle fort; the Tennessee State Museum; and The Parthenon, a full-scale replica of the original Parthenon in Athens. The Tennessee State Capitol is one of the oldest working state capitol buildings in the nation. The Hermitage, the former home of President Andrew Jackson, is one of the largest presidential homes open to the public, and is also one of the most visited.[96][97]\\r\\nSome of the more popular types of local cuisine include hot chicken, hot fish, barbecue, and meat and three. Thanks in part to Nashville's foodie culture, the city was ranked as the 13th \\"snobbiest\\" city in America according to Travel + Leisure magazine.[98]\\r\\nNashville has a vibrant music and entertainment scene spanning a variety of genres. The Tennessee Performing Arts Center is the major performing arts center of the city. It is the home of the Nashville Repertory Theatre, the Nashville Opera, the Music City Drum and Bugle Corps, and the Nashville Ballet. In September 2006, the Schermerhorn Symphony Center opened as the home of the Nashville Symphony.\\r\\nAs the city's name itself is a metonym for the country music industry, many popular tourist attractions involve country music, including the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, Belcourt Theatre, and Ryman Auditorium. The Ryman was home to the Grand Ole Opry until 1974 when the show moved to the Grand Ole Opry House, 9 miles (14?km) east of downtown. The Opry plays there several times a week, except for an annual winter run at the Ryman.\\r\\nA multitude of music clubs and honky-tonk bars can be found in downtown Nashville, particularly the area encompassing Lower Broadway, Second Avenue, and Printer's Alley, which is often referred to as \\"the District\\".[99][100]\\r\\nEach June, the CMA Music Festival (formerly known as Fan Fair) brings thousands of country fans to the city. The Tennessee State Fair is also held annually in September.\\r\\nNashville was once home of television shows such as Hee Haw and Pop! Goes the Country, as well as The Nashville Network and later, RFD-TV. Country Music Television and Great American Country currently operate from Nashville. The city was also home to the Opryland USA theme park, which operated from 1972 to 1997 before being closed by its owners (Gaylord Entertainment Company) and soon after demolished to make room for the Opry Mills mega-shopping mall.\\r\\nThe Contemporary Christian music industry is based along Nashville's Music Row, with a great influence in neighboring Williamson County. The Christian record companies include EMI Christian Music Group, Provident Label Group and Word Records.\\r\\nMusic Row houses many gospel music and Contemporary Christian music companies centered around 16th and 17th Avenues South. On River Road, off Charlotte Pike in West Nashville, the CabaRay opened its doors on January 18, 2018. The performing venue of Ray Stevens it offers a Vegas style dinner and a show atmosphere. There is also a piano bar and a gift shop.[101]\\r\\nAlthough Nashville was never known as a major jazz town, it did have many great jazz bands, including The Nashville Jazz Machine led by Dave Converse and its current version, the Nashville Jazz Orchestra, led by Jim Williamson, as well as The Establishment, led by Billy Adair. The Francis Craig Orchestra entertained Nashvillians from 1929 to 1945 from the Oak Bar and Grille Room in the Hermitage Hotel. Craig's orchestra was also the first to broadcast over local radio station WSM-AM and enjoyed phenomenal success with a 12-year show on the NBC Radio Network. In the late 1930s, he introduced a newcomer, Dinah Shore, a local graduate of Hume Fogg High School and Vanderbilt University.\\r\\nRadio station WMOT-FM in nearby Murfreesboro, which formerly programmed jazz almost exclusively and still does so on the weekends, aided significantly in the recent revival of the city's jazz scene, as has the non-profit Nashville Jazz Workshop, which holds concerts and classes in a renovated building in the north Nashville neighborhood of Germantown. Fisk University also maintains a jazz station, WFSK.\\r\\nNashville has an active theatre scene and is home to several professional and community theatre companies. Nashville Children's Theatre, Nashville Repertory Theatre, the Nashville Shakespeare Festival, the Dance Theatre of Tennessee and the Tennessee Women's Theater Project are among the most prominent professional companies. One community theatre, Circle Players, has been in operation for over 60 years.\\r\\nPerhaps the biggest factor in drawing visitors to Nashville is its association with country music. Many visitors to Nashville attend live performances of the Grand Ole Opry, the world's longest-running live radio show. The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum is another major attraction relating to the popularity of country music. The Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center, the Opry Mills regional shopping mall and the General Jackson showboat, are all located in what is known as Music Valley.\\r\\nCivil War history is important to the city's tourism industry. Sites pertaining to the Battle of Nashville and the nearby Battle of Franklin and Battle of Stones River can be seen, along with several well-preserved antebellum plantation houses such as Belle Meade Plantation, Carnton plantation in Franklin, and Belmont Mansion.[102]\\r\\nNashville has many arts centers and museums, including the Frist Center for the Visual Arts, Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art, the Tennessee State Museum, the Johnny Cash Museum, Fisk University's Van Vechten and Aaron Douglas Galleries, Vanderbilt University's Fine Art Gallery and Sarratt Gallery, and the full-scale replica of the Parthenon.\\r\\nNashville is a colorful, well-known city in several different arenas. As such, it has earned various sobriquets, including:\\r\\nNashville has additionally earned the moniker \\"The Hot Chicken Capital\\",[125] becoming known for the local specialty cuisine hot chicken.[126][127] The Music City Hot Chicken Festival is hosted annually in Nashville and several restaurants make this spicy version of southern fried chicken.[128]\\r\\nNashville is home to five professional sports franchises.

The city is also home to two minor league teams: the Nashville Sounds of Minor League Baseball's Pacific Coast League and Nashville SC of the United Soccer League.\\r\\nThe Tennessee Titans moved to Nashville in 1998. Previously known as the Houston Oilers that began play in 1960 in Houston, Texas, the Oilers relocated to Tennessee in 1997. They played at the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis for one season, then moved to Nashville in 1998 and played in Vanderbilt Stadium for one season. During those two years, the team was known as the Tennessee Oilers, but changed its name to Titans in 1999. The team now plays at Nissan Stadium in Nashville, which opened in 1999. Since moving to Nashville, the Titans have won three division championships (2000, 2002, and 2008) and one conference championship (1999). They competed in 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV, losing to the St. Louis Rams, 23ÿ16.[129] The city previously hosted the 1939 Nashville Rebels of the American Football League and two Arena Football League teams named the Nashville Kats (1997ÿ2001 and 2005ÿ2007).\\r\\nThe Nashville Predators joined the National Hockey League as an expansion team in the 1998ÿ99 season. The team plays its home games at Bridgestone Arena. The Predators have won one division championship (2017ÿ18) and one conference championship (2016ÿ17).[130]\\r\\nThe Nashville Sounds were established in 1978 as expansion franchise of the Double-A Southern League. The Sounds won the league championship in 1979 and 1982. In 1985, the Double-A Sounds were replaced by a Triple-A team of the American Association. After the American Association dissolved in 1997, the Sounds joined the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1998 and won the league championship in 2005. The Sounds left their original ballpark, Herschel Greer Stadium, in 2015 for First Tennessee Park, a new ballpark built on the former site of Sulphur Dell ballpark.

These parks are used for activities such as fishing, water skiing, sailing and boating. The Harbor Island Yacht Club makes its headquarters on Old Hickory Lake, and Percy Priest Lake is home to the Vanderbilt Sailing Club and Nashville Shores.\\r\\nOther parks in Nashville include Centennial Park, Shelby Park, Cumberland Park, and Radnor Lake State Natural Area.\\r\\nOn August 27, 2013, Nashville mayor Karl Dean revealed plans for two new riverfront parks on the east and west banks of the Cumberland River downtown. Construction on the east bank park began in the fall of 2013, and the projected completion date for the west bank park is 2015. Among many exciting benefits of this Cumberland River re-development project is the construction of a highly anticipated outdoor amphitheater. Located on the west bank, this music venue will be surrounded by a new 12-acre (4.9?ha) park and will replace the previous thermal plant site. It will include room for 6,500 spectators with 2,500 removable seats and additional seating on an overlooking grassy knoll. In addition, the 4.5-acre (1.8?ha) east bank park will include a river landing, providing people access to the river. In regard to the parks' benefits for Nashvillian civilians, Mayor Dean remarked that \\"if done right, the thermal site can be an iconic park that generations of Nashvillians will be proud of and which they can enjoy\\".[136]\\r\\nThe city of Nashville and Davidson County merged in 1963 as a way for Nashville to combat the problems of urban sprawl. The combined entity is officially known as \\"the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County\\", and is popularly known as \\"Metro Nashville\\" or simply \\"Metro\\". It offers services such as police, fire, electricity, water and sewage treatment. When the Metro government was formed in 1963, the government was split into two service districtsthe \\"urban services district\\" and the \\"general services district.\\" The urban services district encompasses the 1963 boundaries of the former City of Nashville, approximately 72 square miles (190?km2),[137] and the general services district includes the remainder of Davidson County. There are six smaller municipalities within the consolidated city-county: Belle Meade, Berry Hill, Forest Hills, Oak Hill, Goodlettsville (partially), and Ridgetop (partially). These municipalities use a two-tier system of government, with the smaller municipality typically providing police services and the Metro Nashville government providing most other services. Previously, the city of Lakewood also had a separate charter. However, Lakewood residents voted in 2010 and 2011 to dissolve its city charter and join the metropolitan government, with both votes passing.[138]\\r\\nNashville is governed by a mayor, vice-mayor, and 40-member Metropolitan Council. It uses the strong-mayor form of the mayorÿcouncil system.[139] The current mayor of Nashville is David Briley.[1] The Metropolitan Council is the legislative body of government for Nashville and Davidson County. There are five council members who are elected at large and 35 council members that represent individual districts. The Metro Council has regular meetings that are presided over by the vice-mayor, who is currently Sheri Weiner. The Metro Council meets on the first and third Tuesday of each month at 6:00?pm, according to the Metropolitan Charter.\\r\\nNashville is home to the Tennessee Supreme Court's courthouse for Middle Tennessee and the Estes Kefauver Federal Building and United States Courthouse, home of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.\\r\\nNashville has been a Democratic stronghold since at least the end of Reconstruction, and has remained staunchly Democratic even as the state as a whole has trended strongly Republican. Pockets of Republican influence exist in the wealthier portions of the city, but they are usually no match for the overwhelming Democratic trend in the rest of the city. The issue of school busing roiled politics for years but subsided after the 1990s.[140] While local elections are officially nonpartisan, nearly all of the city's elected officials are publicly known as Democrats. The city is split between 10 state house districts, all but one of which are held by Democrats (Republican Speaker of the House Beth Harwell holds the only Republican house seat). Three state senate districts and part of a fourth are within the county; two are held by Democrats and two by Republicans.[141]\\r\\nIn the state legislature, Nashville politicians serve as leaders of both the Senate and House Democratic Caucuses. Representative Mike Stewart serves as Chairman of the House Caucus. Senator Jeff Yarbro serves as Chairman of the Senate Caucus.\\r\\nDemocrats are no less dominant at the federal level. Democratic presidential candidates have only failed to carry Davidson County five times since reconstruction; in 1928, 1968, 1972, 1984 and 1988.[142] In most years, Democrats have carried Nashville at the presidential level with relatively little difficulty, even in years when they lose Tennessee as a whole. This has been especially true in recent elections. In the 2000 presidential election, Tennessean Democrat Al Gore carried Nashville with over 59% of the vote even as he narrowly lost his home state. In the 2004 election, Democrat John Kerry carried Nashville with 55% of the vote even as George W. Bush won the state by 14 points. In 2008, Barack Obama carried Nashville with 60% of the vote even as Republican John McCain won Tennessee by 15 points.\\r\\nDespite its large size, Nashville has been in a single congressional district for most of the time since Reconstruction; it is currently the 5th District, represented by Democrat Jim Cooper. A Republican has not represented a significant portion of Nashville since 1874. Republicans made a few spirited challenges in the mid-1960s and early 1970s. The Republicans almost won it in 1968; only a strong showing by a candidate from Wallace's American Independent Party kept the seat in Democratic hands. However, they have not made a serious bid for the district since 1972, when the Republican candidate gained only 38% of the vote even as Nixon carried the district in the presidential election by a large margin. The district's best-known congressman was probably Jo Byrns, who represented the district from 1909 to 1936 and was Speaker of the House for much of Franklin Roosevelt's first term as President. Another nationally prominent congressman from Nashville was Percy Priest, who represented the district from 1941 to 1956 and was House Majority Whip from 1949 to 1953. Former mayors Richard Fulton and Bill Boner also sat in the U.S. House before assuming the Metro mayoral office.\\r\\nFrom 2003 to 2013, a sliver of southwestern Nashville was located in the 7th District, represented by Republican Marsha Blackburn. This area was roughly coextensive with the portion of Nashville she'd represented in the state senate from 1998 to 2002. However, the 5th regained all of Nashville after the 2010 census.\\r\\nThe city is served by Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools.\\r\\nNashville is often labeled the \\"Athens of the South\\" due to the many colleges and universities in the city and the metropolitan area.[117] The colleges and universities in Nashville include:\\r\\nWithin 30 miles (48?km) of Nashville in Murfreesboro is Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), a full-sized public university with Tennessee's second largest undergraduate population. Enrollment in post-secondary education in Nashville is around 43,000. Within the Nashville Metropolitan Statistical Areawhich includes MTSU, Cumberland University (Lebanon), Volunteer State Community College (Gallatin), Daymar College, and O'More College of Design (Franklin)total enrollment exceeds 74,000. Within a 40 miles (64?km) radius are Austin Peay State University (Clarksville) and Columbia State Community College (Columbia), enrolling an additional 13,600.\\r\\nNashville is home to four historically black institutions of higher education: Fisk University, Tennessee State University, Meharry Medical College, and American Baptist College.[144]\\r\\nThe daily newspaper in Nashville is The Tennessean, which until 1998 competed with the Nashville Banner, another daily paper that was housed in the same building under a joint-operating agreement. The Tennessean is the city's most widely circulated newspaper. Online news service NashvillePost.com competes with the printed dailies to break local and state news. Several weekly papers are also published in Nashville, including The Nashville Pride, Nashville Business Journal, Nashville Scene and The Tennessee Tribune. Historically, The Tennessean was associated with a broadly liberal editorial policy, while The Banner carried staunchly conservative views in its editorial pages; The Banner's heritage had been carried on, to an extent, by The City Paper which folded in August 2013 after having been founded in October 2000. The Nashville Scene is the area's alternative weekly broadsheet. The Nashville Pride is aimed towards community development and serves Nashville's entrepreneurial population. Nashville Post is an online news source covering business, politics and sports.\\r\\nNashville is home to eleven broadcast television stations, although most households are served by direct cable network connections. Comcast Cable has a monopoly on terrestrial cable service in Davidson County (but not throughout the entire media market).

Nashville is ranked as the 44th largest radio market in the United States. WSM-FM is owned by Cumulus Media and is 95.5 FM. WSM-AM, owned by Gaylord Entertainment Company, can be heard nationally on 650 AM or online at WSM Online from its studios located inside the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center. WSM is famous for carrying live broadcasts of the Grand Ole Opry, through which it helped spread the popularity of country music in America, and continues to broadcast country music throughout its broadcast day. WLAC, whose over-the-air signal is heard at 1510 AM, is a iHeartMedia-owned talk station which was originally sponsored by the Life and Casualty Insurance Company of Tennessee, and its competitor WWTN is owned by Cumulus.\\r\\nSeveral major motion pictures have been filmed in Nashville, including The Green Mile, The Last Castle, Gummo, The Thing Called Love, Two Weeks, Coal Miner's Daughter, Nashville,[147] and Country Strong, as well as the ABC television series Nashville.\\r\\nAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey, 78.1% of working Nashville residents commuted by driving alone, 9.8% carpooled, 2% used public transportation, and 2.2% walked. About 1.1% used all other forms of transportation, including taxicab, motorcycle, and bicycle. About 6.7% of working Nashville residents worked at home.[148] In 2015, 7.9% of city of Nashville households were without a car; this figure decreased to 5.9% in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Nashville averaged 1.72 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8 per household.[149]\\r\\nNashville is centrally located at the crossroads of three Interstate Highways: I-40, I-24, and I-65. Interstate 440 is a bypass route connecting I-40, I-65, and I-24 south of downtown Nashville. Briley Parkway connects the north side of the city and its interstates. Interstate 840 provides a southern Bypass for the city, and a Bypass for I-40 for the city and its suburbs.

Nine conservative active Republican members of the House began planning a new Congressional caucus separate from the Republican Study Committee and apart from the House Republican Conference. The group ultimately became the nine founding members and the first board of directors for the new caucus consisting of Republican Representatives Scott Garrett of New Jersey, Jim Jordan of Ohio, John Fleming of Louisiana, Matt Salmon of Arizona, Justin Amash of Michigan, Ra~l Labrador of Idaho, Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, Ron DeSantis of Florida and Mark Meadows of North Carolina.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group debated a name for their new caucus eventually settling on \\"House Freedom Caucus\\" (HFC) because, according to founding member Mick Mulvaney, \\"it was so generic and universally awful that we had no reason to be against it.\\" The group of nine founding members in Hershey set as a criterion for new members that they had to be willing to vote against Speaker of the United States House of Representatives John Boehner on legislation that the group opposed.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the crisis over the funding of the Department of Homeland Security in early 2015, the Caucus offered four plans for resolution, but all were rejected by the Republican leadership.

These members later created and became members of the Freedom Caucus when it was created in 2015.[18][23][24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Boehner resigned as speaker, Kevin McCarthy, the House Majority Leader, was initially the lead contender to succeed him, but the Freedom Caucus withheld its support.[26] However, McCarthy withdrew from the race on September 28, 2015, after appearing to suggest that the Benghazi investigation's purpose had been to lower the approval ratings of Hillary Clinton.[27][28] On the same day as McCarthy's withdrawal, Reid Ribble resigned from the Freedom Caucus saying he had joined to promote certain policies and could not support the role that it was playing in the leadership race.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 20, 2015, Paul Ryan announced that his bid for the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives was contingent on an official endorsement by the Freedom Caucus.[30] While the group could not reach the 80% approval that was needed to give an official endorsement, on October 21, 2015, it announced that it had reached a supermajority support for Ryan.[31] On October 29, 2015, Ryan succeeded John Boehner as the Speaker of the House.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 30, 2017, Vanity Fair published an interview with former Speaker Boehner, who said of the Freedom Caucus: \\"They cant tell you what theyre for.

It is the most populous municipality in the county with a population of 164,603 at the 2010 census due to its rapid growth during the 2000s. It is located 125 miles southeast of Orlando, and 114 miles northwest of Miami.[7][8]In 2017, the United States Census Bureau estimated the city's population at 189,344.[9] The Port St. Lucie Metropolitan Area includes the counties of St. Lucie County & Martin County and as of 2016 had an estimated population of 465,208[10]. Overall Port St. Lucie is the largest City of the Treasure Coast as of 2017 estimates. \\r\\n\\r\\nPort St. Lucie was a largely uninhabited tract of land south of White City in the 1950s, composed of a fishing camp, a few farms and businesses near U.S. 1. In 1958, with a budget of $5, the General Development Corporation (GDC) purchased the River Park development and 40,000 acres (160?km2) along the North Fork of the St. Lucie River.[11] In 1959, the GDC opened its first bridge over the St. Lucie River, allowing for direct automobile access to Port St. Lucie.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy February 25, 1961 there were 250 homes in the new city. GDC requested the state legislature to incorporate 70 miles (110?km), along with the River Park settlement, into the City of Port St. Lucie. River Park did not incorporate into the city at the request of its residents. Port St. Lucie became a city on April 27, 1961 with the passage of House Bill No. 953, proposed by State Representative Rupert Smith and approved by Florida Governor C. Farris Bryant.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1990s, Core Communities (CC), acquired and began planning what would become St. Lucie West. Originally, St. Lucie West was to have contained about 14,000 homes over a 20-year period on 7 square miles (18?km2). But after realizing the community's strategic position, they began developing it into more than just a residential area. CC began building business sectors and places of entertainment and leisure. That resulted in 7,000 jobs being brought to the small town, helping it into its boom during most of the early 2000s.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, CC started development of its newest community, Tradition. The community, which sits west of the Interstate 95 intersection of Gatlin Blvd., was a large cattle ranch before CC began to develop it. There they built around 13,000,000 square feet (1,200,000?m2) of commercial area, and room for over 18,000 residences. According to CC's website, Tradition is the largest fully entitled residential development area from the tip of Interstate 95 to the CanadaÿU.S. border. It is modeled after a 1950s-era town. According to its website, Tradition Square, the town center of the community, holds festivities year-round. It was also chosen as the site of HGTV's Green Home 2009, and one of America's best 100 communities.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, the housing market began to collapse and unemployment started to rise. As of February 2009, unemployment was at 10? percent and in 2008, nearly 11,000 homes went into foreclosure. This prompted the county government to consider declaring itself a disaster area. Doing so would have given county administrators access to $17 million in county emergency reserve funds. That money, combined with a transportation fund and other accounts, would give St. Lucie $20 ÿ $30 million to spend on building projects: research parks, highways and other infrastructure improvements.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, Tradition and Core Communities welcomed the Florida Center of Innovation, a research laboratory and campus, which has a building in Tradition for two biotech and life science companies, the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies and the Vaccine & Gene Therapy Institute. This campus alone is projected to bring more than 30,000 jobs to the city of Port St. Lucie.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, the City Electric Supply, a family-owned electrical wholesale business, created plans with the Port St. Lucie City Council to construct a $38,000,000, 400,000 square foot manufacturing and distribution center located in the Tradition Commerce Park.[15] Construction of the City Electric Supply Manufacturing & Distribution facility began in 2018.

The Olympic Games (Ancient Greek: ??ϫ Olympia[1][2][3][4][5][6] \\"the Olympics\\"; also ??? Olympias[7][4][5][6] \\"the Olympiad\\") were a series of athletic competitions among representatives of city-states and one of the Panhellenic Games of ancient Greece. They were held in honor of Zeus, and the Greeks gave them a mythological origin. The first Olympics is traditionally dated to 776 BC.[8] They continued to be celebrated when Greece came under Roman rule, until the emperor Theodosius I suppressed them in AD?393 as part of the campaign to impose Christianity as the State religion of Rome. The games were held every four years, or olympiad, which became a unit of time in historical chronologies.\\r\\nDuring the celebration of the games, an Olympic Truce was enacted so that athletes could travel from their cities to the games in safety. The prizes for the victors were olive leaf wreaths or crowns. The games became a political tool used by city-states to assert dominance over their rivals. Politicians would announce political alliances at the games, and in times of war, priests would offer sacrifices to the gods for victory. The games were also used to help spread Hellenistic culture throughout the Mediterranean. The Olympics also featured religious celebrations. The statue of Zeus at Olympia was counted as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Sculptors and poets would congregate each olympiad to display their works of art to would-be patrons.\\r\\nThe ancient Olympics had fewer events than the modern games, and only freeborn Greek men were allowed to participate,[9] although there were victorious women chariot owners. As long as they met the entrance criteria, athletes from any Greek city-state and kingdom were allowed to participate, although the Hellanodikai, the officials in charge, allowed king Alexander I of Macedon to participate in the games only after he had proven his Greek ancestry.[10][11] The games were always held at Olympia rather than moving between different locations as is the practice with the modern Olympic Games.[12] Victors at the Olympics were honored, and their feats chronicled for future generations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the Greeks, it was important to root the Olympic Games in mythology.[13] During the time of the ancient games their origins were attributed to the gods, and competing legends persisted as to who actually was responsible for the genesis of the games.[14] These origin traditions have become nearly impossible to untangle, yet a chronology and patterns have arisen that help people understand the story behind the games.[15]\\r\\nThe earliest myths regarding the origin of the games are recounted by the Greek historian, Pausanias. According to the story, the dactyl Heracles (not to be confused with the son of Zeus and the Roman god Hercules) and four of his brothers, Paeonaeus, Epimedes, Iasius and Idas, raced at Olympia to entertain the newborn Zeus. He crowned the victor with an olive tree wreath (which thus became a peace symbol), which also explains the four year interval, bringing the games around every fifth year (counting inclusively).[16][17] The other Olympian gods (so named because they lived permanently on Mount Olympus) would also engage in wrestling, jumping and running contests.[18]\\r\\nAnother myth of the origin of the games is the story of Pelops, a local Olympian hero. The story of Pelops begins with Oenomaus, the king of Pisa, Greece, who had a beautiful daughter named Hippodamia. According to an oracle, the king would be killed by her husband. Therefore, he decreed that any young man who wanted to marry his daughter was required to drive away with her in his chariot, and Oenomaus would follow in another chariot, and spear the suitor if he caught up with them. Now, the king's chariot horses were a present from the god Poseidon and were therefore supernaturally fast. Pelops was a very handsome young man and the king's daughter fell in love with him. Before the race, she persuaded her father's charioteer Myrtilus to replace the bronze axle pins of the king's chariot with wax ones. Naturally, during the race, the wax melted and the king fell from his chariot and was killed. At the same time, the king's palace was struck by lightning and reduced to ashes, save for one wooden pillar that was revered in the Altis for centuries, and stood near what was to be the site of the temple of Zeus. Pelops was proclaimed the winner and married Hippodamia. After his victory, Pelops organized chariot races as thanksgiving to the gods and as funeral games in honor of King Oenomaus, in order to be purified of his death. It was from this funeral race held at Olympia that the beginnings of the Olympic Games were inspired. Pelops became a great king, a local hero, and he gave his name to the Peloponnese.\\r\\nOne other myth, this one occurring after the aforementioned myth, is attributed to Pindar. He claims the festival at Olympia involved Heracles, the son of Zeus. The story goes that after completing his labors, Heracles established an athletic festival to honor his father.\\r\\nThe games of previous millennia were discontinued and then revived by Lycurgus of Sparta, Iphitos of Elis, and Cleisthenes of Pisa at the behest of the Oracle of Delphi who claimed that the people had strayed from the gods, which had caused a plague and constant war. Restoration of the games would end the plague, usher in a time of peace, and signal a return to a more traditional lifestyle.[19] The patterns that emerge from these myths are that the Greeks believed the games had their roots in religion, that athletic competition was tied to worship of the gods, and the revival of the ancient games was intended to bring peace, harmony and a return to the origins of Greek life.[20]\\r\\nSince these myths were documented by historians like Pausanias, who lived during the reign of Marcus Aurelius in the AD?160, it is likely that these stories are more fable than fact. It was often supposed that the origins of many aspects of the Olympics date to funeral games of the Mycenean period and later.[21] Alternatively, the games were thought to derive from some kind of vegetation magic or from initiation ceremonies. The most recent theory traces the origins of the games to large game hunting and related animal ceremonialism.[22]\\r\\nThe Olympic games were held to be one of the two central rituals in ancient Greece, the other being the much older religious festival, the Eleusinian Mysteries.[23]\\r\\nThe games started in Olympia, Greece, in a sanctuary site for the Greek deities near the towns of Elis and Pisa (both in Elis on the peninsula of Peloponnesos). The first games began as an annual foot race of young women in competition for the position of the priestess for the goddess, Hera,[24] and a second race was instituted for a consort for the priestess who would participate in the religious traditions at the temple.[25]\\r\\nThe Heraean Games, the first recorded competition for women in the Olympic Stadium, were held as early as the sixth century BC. It originally consisted of foot races only, as did the competition for males. Some texts, including Pausanias's Description of Greece, c.?AD?175, state that Hippodameia gathered a group known as the \\"Sixteen Women\\" and made them administrators of the Heraea Games, out of gratitude for her marriage to Pelops. Other texts related to the Elis and Pisa conflict indicate that the \\"Sixteen Women\\" were peacemakers from Pisa and Elis and, because of their political competence, became administrators of the Heraea. Being the consort of Hera in Classical Greek mythology, Zeus was the father of the deities in the pantheon of that era. The Sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia housed a 13-metre-high (43?ft) statue in ivory and gold of Zeus that had been sculpted by Phidias circa 445?BC. This statue was one of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World. By the time of the Classical Greek culture, in the fifth and fourth centuries BC, the games were restricted to male participants.\\r\\nThe historian Ephorus, who lived in the fourth century BC, is one potential candidate for establishing the use of Olympiads to count years, although credit for codifying this particular epoch usually falls to Hippias of Elis, to Eratosthenes, or even to Timaeus, whom Eratosthenes may have imitated.[26][27][28] The Olympic Games were held at four-year intervals, and later, the ancient historians' method of counting the years even referred to these games, using the term Olympiad for the period between two games. Previously, the local dating systems of the Greek states were used (they continued to be used by everyone except the historians), which led to confusion when trying to determine dates. For example, Diodorus states that there was a solar eclipse in the third year of the 113th Olympiad, which must be the eclipse of 316?BC. This gives a date of (mid-summer) 765?BC for the first year of the first Olympiad.[29] Nevertheless, there is disagreement among scholars as to when the games began.[30]\\r\\nThe only competition held then was, according to the later Greek traveller Pausanias who wrote in AD?175, the stadion race, a race over about 190 metres (620 feet), measured after the feet of Hercules. The word stadium is derived from this foot race.\\r\\nThe Greek tradition of athletic nudity (gymnos)[31] was introduced in 720?BC, either by the Spartans or by the Megarian Orsippus, and this was adopted early in the Olympics as well.\\r\\nSeveral groups fought over control of the sanctuary at Olympia, and hence the games, for prestige and political advantage. Pausanias later writes that in 668?BC, Pheidon of Argos was commissioned by the town of Pisa to capture the sanctuary from the town of Elis, which he did and then personally controlled the games for that year. The next year, Elis regained control.\\r\\nThe Olympic Games were part of the Panhellenic Games, four separate games held at two- or four-year intervals, but arranged so that there was at least one set of games every year. The Olympic Games were more important and more prestigious than the Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian Games.\\r\\nThe games were in decline for many years but continued past AD?385, by which time flooding and earthquakes had damaged the buildings and invasions by barbarians had reached Olympia.[32] In 394 Theodosius I banned all pagan festivals, but archeological evidence indicates that some games were still held.[33]\\r\\nThe ancient Olympics were as much a religious festival as an athletic event. The games were held in honor of the Greek god Zeus, and on the middle day of the games, 100 oxen would be sacrificed to him.[12] Over time Olympia, the site of the games, became a central spot for the worship of the head of the Greek pantheon and a temple, built by the Greek architect Libon, was erected on the mountaintop. The temple was one of the largest Doric temples in Greece.[12] The sculptor Pheidias created a statue of the god made of gold and ivory. It stood 42 feet (13?m) tall. It was placed on a throne in the temple. The statue became one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.[12] As the historian Strabo put it,\\r\\n... the glory of the temple persisted?... on account both of the festal assembly and of the Olympian Games, in which the prize was a crown and which were regarded as sacred, the greatest games in the world. The temple was adorned by its numerous offerings, which were dedicated there from all parts of Greece.[12]\\r\\nArtistic expression was a major part of the games. Sculptors, poets, painters and other artisans would come to the games to display their works in what became an artistic competition. Sculptors created works like Myron's Diskobolos or Discus Thrower. Their aim was to highlight natural human movement and the shape of muscles and the body. Poets would be commissioned to write poems in praise of the Olympic victors. Such victory songs or epinicians, were passed on from generation to generation and many of them have lasted far longer than any other honor made for the same purpose.[34] Pierre de Coubertin, one of the founders of the modern Olympic Games, wanted to fully imitate the ancient Olympics in every way. Included in his vision was an artistic competition modeled on the ancient Olympics and held every four years, during the celebration of the Olympic Games.[35] His desire came to fruition at the Olympics held in Athens in 1896.[36]\\r\\nPower in ancient Greece became centered around the city-state in the 8th?century BC.[37] The city-state was a population center organized into a self-contained political entity.[38] These city-states often lived in close proximity to each other, which created competition for limited resources. Though conflict between the city-states was ubiquitous, it was also in their self-interest to engage in trade, military alliances and cultural interaction.[39] The city-states had a dichotomous relationship with each other: on one hand, they relied on their neighbors for political and military alliances, while on the other they competed fiercely with those same neighbors for vital resources.[40] The Olympic Games were established in this political context and served as a venue for representatives of the city-states to peacefully compete against each other.[41]\\r\\nIn the first 200 years of the games' existence, they only had regional religious importance. Only Greeks in proximity to the mountain competed in these early games. This is evidenced by the dominance of Peloponnesian athletes in the victors' rolls.[42] The spread of Greek colonies in the 5th and 6th centuries BC is repeatedly linked to successful Olympic athletes. For example, Pausanias recounts that Cyrene was founded c. 630?BC by settlers from Thera with Spartan support. The support Sparta gave was primarily the loan of three-time Olympic champion Chionis. The appeal of settling with an Olympic champion helped to populate the colonies and maintain cultural and political ties with the city-states near Olympia. Thus, Hellenic culture and the games spread while the primacy of Olympia persisted.[43]\\r\\nThe games faced a serious challenge during the Peloponnesian War, which primarily pitted Athens against Sparta, but, in reality, touched nearly every Hellenic city-state.[44] The Olympics were used during this time to announce alliances and offer sacrifices to the gods for victory.[12][45]\\r\\nDuring the Olympic Games, a truce, or ekecheiria was observed. Three runners, known as spondophoroi, were sent from Elis to the participant cities at each set of games to announce the beginning of the truce.[46] During this period, armies were forbidden from entering Olympia and legal disputes and the use of the death penalty were forbidden. The truce was primarily designed to allow athletes and visitors to travel safely to the games and was, for the most part, observed.[46] Thucydides wrote of a situation when the Spartans were forbidden from attending the games, and the violators of the truce were fined 2,000 minae for assaulting the city of Lepreum during the period of the ekecheiria. The Spartans disputed the fine and claimed that the truce had not yet taken hold.[45][47]\\r\\nWhile a martial truce was observed by all participating city-states, no such reprieve from conflict existed in the political arena. The Olympic Games evolved the most influential athletic and cultural stage in ancient Greece, and arguably in the ancient world.[48] As such the games became a vehicle for city-states to promote themselves. The result was political intrigue and controversy. For example, Pausanias, a Greek historian, explains the situation of the athlete Sotades,\\r\\nSotades at the ninety-ninth Festival was victorious in the long race and proclaimed a Cretan, as in fact he was. But at the next Festival he made himself an Ephesian, being bribed to do so by the Ephesian people. For this act he was banished by the Cretans.[12]\\r\\nApparently starting with just a single foot race, the program gradually increased to twenty-three contests, although no more than twenty featured at any one Olympiad.[49] Participation in most events was limited to male athletes except for women who were allowed to take part by entering horses in the equestrian events. Youth events are recorded as starting in 632 BC. Our knowledge of how the events were performed primarily derives from the paintings of athletes found on many vases, particularly those of the Archaic and Classical periods.[50]\\r\\nThe only event recorded at the first thirteen games was the stade, a straight-line sprint of just over 192 metres.[51] The diaulos (lit. \\"double pipe\\"), or two-stade race, is recorded as being introduced at the 14th Olympiad in 724 BC. It is thought that competitors ran in lanes marked out with lime or gypsum for the length of a stade then turned around separate posts (kampteres), before returning to the start line.[52] Xenophanes wrote that \\"Victory by speed of foot is honored above all.\\"\\r\\nA third foot race, the dolichos (\\"long race\\"), was introduced in the next Olympiad. Accounts of the race's distance differ, it seems to have been from twenty to twenty-four laps of the track, around 7.5?km to 9?km, although it may have been lengths rather than laps and thus half as far.[53][54]\\r\\nThe last running event added to the Olympic program was the hoplitodromos, or \\"Hoplite race\\", introduced in 520 BC and traditionally run as the last race of the games. Competitors ran either a single or double diaulos (approximately 400 or 800 metres) in full military armour.[55] The hoplitodromos was based on a war tactic of soldiers running in full armor to surprise the enemy.\\r\\nWrestling (pale) is recorded as being introduced at the 18th Olympiad. Three throws were necessary for a win. A throw was counted if the body, hip, back or shoulder (and possibly knee) touched the ground. If both competitors fell nothing was counted. Unlike its modern counterpart Greco-Roman wrestling, it is likely that tripping was allowed.[56]\\r\\nBoxing (pygmachia) was first listed in 688 BC,[57] the boys event sixty years later. The laws of boxing were ascribed to the first Olympic champion Onomastus of Smyrna.[58] It appears body-blows were either not permitted or not practised.[59][60] The Spartans, who claimed to have invented boxing, quickly abandoned it and did not take part in boxing competitions.[58] At first the boxers wore himantes (sing. himas), long leather strips which were wrapped around their hands.[57]\\r\\nThe pankration was introduced in the 33rd Olympiad (648 BC).[61] Boys' pankration became an Olympic event in 200 BC, in the 145th Olympiad.[62] As well as techniques from boxing and wrestling, athletes used kicks,[63] locks, and chokes on the ground. Although the only prohibitions were against biting and gouging, the pankration was regarded as less dangerous than boxing.[64]\\r\\nIt was one of the most popular events: Pindar wrote eight odes praising victors of the pankration.[65] A famous event in the sport was the posthumous victory of Arrhichion of Phigaleia who \\"expired at the very moment when his opponent acknowledged himself beaten.\\"[66][67]\\r\\nThe pentathlon was a competition made up of five events: running, long jump, discus throw, javelin throw and wrestling.[68] The pentathlon is said to have first appeared at the 18th Olympiad in 708 BC.[69] The competition was held on a single day,[70] but it is not known how the victor was decided,[71][72] or in what order the events occurred,[73] except that it finished with the wrestling.[74]\\r\\nHorse racing and chariot racing were the most prestigious competitions in the games, due to only the wealthy being able to afford the maintenance and transportation of horses. These races consisted of different events: the four-horse chariot race, the two-horse chariot race, and the horse with rider race, the rider being hand picked by the owner. The four-horse chariot race was the first equestrian event to feature in the Olympics, being introduced in 680 BC. It consisted of two horses that were harnessed under a Yoke in the middle, and two outer horses that were attached with a rope.[75] The two-horse chariot was introduced in 408 BC.[76] The horse with rider competition on the other hand, was introduced in 648 BC. In this race, Greeks didn't use saddles or stirrups, so they required good grip and balance.[77]\\r\\nIn AD?67, the Roman Emperor Nero competed in the chariot race at Olympia. He was thrown from his chariot and was thus unable to finish the race. Nevertheless, he was declared the winner on the basis that he would have won if he had finished the race.[78]\\r\\nAthletic festivals under the name of \\"Olympic games\\", named in imitation of the original festival at Olympia, were established over time in various places all over the Greek world. Some of these are only known to us by inscriptions and coins; but others, as the Olympic festival at Antioch, obtained great celebrity. After these Olympic festivals had been established in several places, the great Olympic festival itself was sometimes designated in inscriptions by the addition of Pisa.[87]","input":"What was the first olympic sport in ancient greece?"},{"output":"an artificial light source","context":"A grow light or plant light is an artificial light source, generally an electric light, designed to stimulate plant growth by emitting an electromagnetic spectrum appropriate for photosynthesis. Grow lights are used in applications where there is either no naturally occurring light, or where supplemental light is required. For example, in the winter months when the available hours of daylight may be insufficient for the desired plant growth, lights are used to extend the time the plants receive light. If plants do not receive enough light, they will grow long and spindly.\\r\\nGrow lights either attempt to provide a light spectrum similar to that of the sun, or to provide a spectrum that is more tailored to the needs of the plants being cultivated. Outdoor conditions are mimicked with varying colour, temperatures and spectral outputs from the grow light, as well as varying the lumen output (intensity) of the lamps. Depending on the type of plant being cultivated, the stage of cultivation (e.g. the germination/vegetative phase or the flowering/fruiting phase), and the photoperiod required by the plants, specific ranges of spectrum, luminous efficacy and colour temperature are desirable for use with specific plants and time periods.\\r\\nRussian botanist Andrei Famintsyn was the first to use artificial light for plant growing and research (1868).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGrow lights are used for horticulture, indoor gardening, plant propagation and food production, including indoor hydroponics and aquatic plants. Although most grow lights are used on an industrial level, they can also be used in households.\\r\\nAccording to the inverse-square law, the intensity of light radiating from a point source (in this case a bulb) that reaches a surface is inversely proportional to the square of the surface's distance from the source (if an object is twice as far away, it receives only a quarter the light) which is a serious hurdle for indoor growers, and many techniques are employed to use light as efficiently as possible. Reflectors are thus often used in the lights to maximize light efficiency. Plants or lights are moved as close together as possible so that they receive equal lighting and that all light coming from the lights falls on the plants rather than on the surrounding area.\\r\\nA range of bulb types can be used as grow lights, such as incandescents, fluorescent lights, high-intensity discharge lamps (HID), and light-emitting diodes (LED). Today, the most widely used lights for professional use are HIDs and fluorescents. Indoor flower and vegetable growers typically use high-pressure sodium (HPS/SON) and metal halide (MH) HID lights, but fluorescents and LEDs are replacing metal halides due to their efficiency and economy.[1]\\r\\nMetal halide lights are regularly used for the vegetative phase of plant growth, as they emit larger amounts of blue and ultraviolet radiation.[2][3] With the introduction of ceramic metal halide lighting and full-spectrum metal halide lighting, they are increasingly being utilized as an exclusive source of light for both vegetative and reproductive growth stages. Blue spectrum light may trigger a greater vegetative response in plants.[4][5][6]\\r\\nHigh-pressure sodium lights are also used as a single source of light throughout the vegetative and reproductive stages. As well, they may be used as an amendment to full-spectrum lighting during the reproductive stage. Red spectrum light may trigger a greater flowering response in plants.[7] If high-pressure sodium lights are used for the vegetative phase, plants grow slightly more quickly, but will have longer internodes, and may be longer overall.\\r\\nIn recent years LED technology has been introduced into the grow light market. By designing an indoor grow light using diodes, specific wavelengths of light can be produced. NASA has tested LED grow lights for their high efficiency in growing food in space for extraterrestrial colonization. Findings showed that plants are affected by light in the red, green and blue parts of the visible light spectrum.[8][9]\\r\\nWhile fluorescent lighting used to be the most common type of indoor grow light, HID lights are now the most popular.[10] High intensity discharge lamps have a high lumen-per-watt efficiency.[11] There are several different types of HID lights including mercury vapor, metal halide, high pressure sodium and conversion bulbs. Metal halide and HPS lamps produce a color spectrum that is somewhat comparable to the sun and can be used to grow plants. Mercury vapor lamps were the first type of HIDs and were widely used for street lighting, but when it comes to indoor gardening they produce a relatively poor spectrum for plant growth so they have been mostly replaced by other types of HIDs for growing plants.[11]\\r\\nAll HID grow lights require a ballast to operate, and each ballast has a particular wattage. Popular HID wattages include 150W, 250W, 400W, 600W and 1000W. Of all the sizes, 600W HID lights are the most electrically efficient as far as light produced, followed by 1000W. A 600W HPS produces 7% more light (watt-for-watt) than a 1000W HPS.[11]\\r\\nAlthough all HID lamps work on the same principle, the different types of bulbs have different starting and voltage requirements, as well as different operating characteristics and physical shape. Because of this a bulb won't work properly unless it's using a matching ballast, even if the bulb will physically screw in. In addition to producing lower levels of light, mismatched bulbs and ballasts will stop working early, or may even burn out immediately.[11]\\r\\nMetal halide bulbs are a type of HID light that emit light in the blue and violet parts of the light spectrum, which is similar to the light that is available outdoors during spring.[12] Because their light mimics the color spectrum of the sun, some growers find that plants look more pleasing under a metal halide than other types of HID lights such as the HPS which distort the color of plants. Therefore, it's more common for a metal halide to be used when the plants are on display in the home (for example with ornamental plants) and natural color is preferred.[13] Metal halide bulbs need to be replaced about once a year, compared to HPS lights which last twice as long.[13]\\r\\nMetal halide lamps are widely used in the horticultural industry and are well-suited to supporting plants in earlier developmental stages by promoting stronger roots, better resistance against disease and more compact growth.[12] The blue spectrum of light encourages compact, leafy growth and may be better suited to growing vegetative plants with lots of foliage.[13]\\r\\nA metal halide bulb produces 60-125 lumens/watt, depending on the wattage of the bulb.[14]\\r\\nThey are now being made for digital ballasts in a pulse start version, which have higher electrical efficiency (up to 110 lumens per watt) and faster warmup.[15] One common example of a pulse start metal halide is the ceramic metal halide (CMH). Pulse start metal halide bulbs can come in any desired spectrum from cool white (7000 K) to warm white (3000 K) and even ultraviolet-heavy (10,000 K).[citation needed]\\r\\nCeramic metal halide (CMH) lamps are a relatively new type of HID lighting, and the technology is referred to by a few names when it comes to grow lights, including ceramic discharge metal halide (CDM),[16] ceramic arc metal halide.\\r\\nCeramic metal halide lights are started with a pulse-starter, just like other \\"pulse-start\\" metal halides.[16] The discharge of a ceramic metal halide bulb is contained in a type of ceramic material known as polycrystalline alumina (PCA), which is similar to the material used for an HPS. PCA reduces sodium loss, which in turn reduces color shift and variation compared to standard MH bulbs.[15] Horticultural CDM offerings from companies such as Philips have proven to be effective sources of growth light for medium-wattage applications.[17]\\r\\nCombination HPS/MH lights combine a metal halide and a high-pressure sodium in the same bulb, providing both red and blue spectrums in a single HID lamp. The combination of blue metal halide light and red high-pressure sodium light is an attempt to provide a very wide spectrum within a single lamp. This allows for a single bulb solution throughout the entire life cycle of the plant, from vegetative growth through flowering. There are potential tradeoffs for the convenience of a single bulb in terms of yield. There are however some qualitative benefits that come for the wider light spectrum.\\r\\nHigh-pressure sodium lights are a more efficient type of HID lighting than metal halides. HPS bulbs emit light in the yellow/red visible light as well as small portions of all other visible light. Since HPS grow lights deliver more energy in the red part of the light spectrum, they may promote blooming and fruiting.[10] They are used as a supplement to natural daylight in greenhouse lighting and full-spectrum lighting(metal halide) or, as a standalone source of light for indoors/grow chambers.\\r\\nHPS grow lights are sold in the following sizes: 150W, 250W, 400W, 600W and 1000W.[10] Of all the sizes, 600W HID lights are the most electrically efficient as far as light produced, followed by 1000W. A 600W HPS produces 7% more light (watt-for-watt) than a 1000W HPS.[11]\\r\\nAn HPS bulb produces 60-140 lumens/watt, depending on the wattage of the bulb.[18]\\r\\nPlants grown under HPS lights tend to elongate from the lack of blue/ultraviolet radiation. Modern horticultural HPS lamps have a much better adjusted spectrum for plant growth. The majority of HPS lamps while providing good growth, offer poor CRI rendering. As a result, the yellowish light of an HPS can make monitoring plant health indoors more difficult. CRI isn't an issue when HPS lamps are used as supplemental lighting in greenhouses which make use of natural daylight (which offsets the yellow light of the HPS).\\r\\nHigh-pressure sodium lights have a long usable bulb life, and six times more light output per watt of energy consumed than a standard incandescent grow light. Due to their high efficiency and the fact that plants grown in greenhouses get all the blue light they need naturally, these lights are the preferred supplemental greenhouse lights. But, in the higher latitudes, there are periods of the year where sunlight is scarce, and additional sources of light are indicated for proper growth. HPS lights may cause distinctive infrared and optical signatures, which can attract insects or other species of pests; these may in turn threaten the plants being grown. High-pressure sodium lights emit a lot of heat, which can cause leggier growth, although this can be controlled by using special air-cooled bulb reflectors or enclosures.\\r\\nConversion bulbs are manufactured so they work with either a MH or HPS ballast. A grower can run an HPS conversion bulb on a MH ballast, or a MH conversion bulb on a HPS ballast. The difference between the ballasts is an HPS ballast has an igniter which ignites the sodium in an HPS bulb, while a MH ballast does not. Because of this, all electrical ballasts can fire MH bulbs, but only a Switchable or HPS ballast can fire an HPS bulb without a conversion bulb.[19] Usually a metal halide conversion bulb will be used in an HPS ballast since the MH conversion bulbs are more common.\\r\\nA switchable ballast is an HID ballast can be used with either a metal halide or an HPS bulb of equivalent wattage. So a 600W Switchable ballast would work with either a 600W MH or HPS.[10] Growers use these fixtures for propagating and vegetatively growing plants under the metal halide, then switching to a high-pressure sodium bulb for the fruiting or flowering stage of plant growth. To change between the lights, only the bulb needs changing and a switch needs to be set to the appropriate setting.\\r\\nLED grow lights are composed of light-emitting diodes, usually in a casing with a heat sink and built-in fans. LED grow lights do not usually require a separate ballast and can be plugged directly into a standard electrical socket.\\r\\nLED grow lights vary in color depending on the intended use. It is known from the study of photomorphogenesis that green, red, far-red and blue light spectra have an effect on root formation, plant growth, and flowering, but there are not enough scientific studies or field-tested trials using LED grow lights to recommended specific color ratios for optimal plant growth under LED grow lights.[20] It has been shown that many plants will grow normally if given both red and blue light.[21][22][23] However, many studies indicate that red and blue light only provides the most cost efficient method of growth, plant growth is still better under light supplemented with green.[24][25][26]\\r\\nWhite LED grow lights provide a full spectrum of light designed to mimic natural light, providing plants a balanced spectrum of red, blue and green. The spectrum used varies, however, white LED grow lights are designed to emit similar amounts of red and blue light with the added green light to appear white. White LED grow lights are often used for supplemental lighting in home and office spaces.\\r\\nA large number of plant species have been assessed in greenhouse trials to make sure plants have higher quality in biomass and biochemical ingredients even higher or comparable with field conditions. Plant performance of mint, basil, lentil, lettuce, cabbage, parsley, carrot were measured by assessing health and vigor of plants and success in promoting growth. Promoting in profuse flowering of select ornamentals including primula, marigold, stock were also noticed.[27]\\r\\nIn tests conducted by Philips Lighting on LED grow lights to find an optimal light recipe for growing various vegetables in greenhouses, they found that the following aspects of light affects both plant growth (photosynthesis) and plant development (morphology): light intensity, total light over time, light at which moment of the day, light/dark period per day, light quality (spectrum), light direction and light distribution over the plants. However it's noted that in tests between tomatoes, mini cucumbers and bell peppers, the optimal light recipe was not the same for all plants, and varied depending on both the crop and the region, so currently they must optimize LED lighting in greenhouses based on trial and error. They've shown that LED light affects disease resistance, taste and nutritional levels, but as of 2014 they haven't found a practical way to use that information.[28]\\r\\nThe diodes used in initial LED grow light designs were usually 1/3 watt to 1 watt in power. However, higher wattage diodes such as 3 watt and 5 watt diodes are now commonly used in LED grow lights. for highly compacted areas, COB chips between 10 watts and 100 watts can be used. Because of heat dissipation, these chips are often less efficient.\\r\\nLED grow lights should be kept at least 12 inches (30?cm) away from plants to prevent leaf burn.[13]\\r\\nLED grow lights are priced much higher, watt-for-watt, than other grow lights but are designed to be energy efficient and long lasting. LED's usually last for 50,000 - 90,000 hours until LM-70 is reached.\\r\\nFluorescent lights come in many form factors, including long, thin bulbs as well as smaller spiral shaped bulbs (compact fluorescent lights). Fluorescent lights are available in color temperatures ranging from 2700?K to 10,000?K. The luminous efficacy ranges from 30 lm/W to 90 lm/W. The two main types of fluorescent lights used for growing plants are the tube-style lights and compact fluorescent lights.\\r\\nFluorescent grow lights are not as intense as HID lights and are usually used for growing vegetables and herbs indoors, or for starting seedlings to get a jump start on spring plantings. A ballast is needed to run these types of fluorescent lights.[18]\\r\\nStandard fluorescent lighting comes in multiple form factors, including the T5, T8 and T12. The brightest version is the T5. The T8 and T12 are less powerful and are more suited to plants with lower light needs. High-output fluorescent lights produce twice as much light as standard fluorescent lights. A high-output fluorescent fixture has a very thin profile, making it useful in vertically limited areas.\\r\\nFluorescents have an average usable life span of up to 20,000 hours. A fluorescent grow light produces 33-100 lumens/watt, depending on the form factor and wattage.[14]\\r\\nCompact Fluorescent lights (CFLs) are smaller versions of fluorescent lights that were originally designed as pre-heat lamps, but are now available in rapid-start form. CFLs have largely replaced incandescent light bulbs in households because they last longer and are much more electrically efficient.[18] In some cases, CFLs are also used as grow lights. Like standard fluorescent lights, they are useful for propagation and situations where relatively low light levels are needed.\\r\\nWhile standard CFLs in small sizes can be used to grow plants, there are also now CFL lamps made specifically for growing plants. Often these larger compact fluorescent bulbs are sold with specially designed reflectors that direct light to plants, much like HID lights. Common CFL grow lamp sizes include 125W, 200W, 250W and 300W.\\r\\nUnlike HID lights, CFLs fit in a standard mogul light socket and don't need a separate ballast.[10]\\r\\nCompact fluorescent bulbs are available in warm/red (2700?K), full spectrum or daylight (5000?K) and cool/blue (6500?K) versions. Warm red spectrum is recommended for flowering, and cool blue spectrum is recommended for vegetative growth.[10]\\r\\nUsable life span for compact fluorescent grow lights is about 10,000 hours.[18] A CFL produces 44-80 lumens/watt, depending on the wattage of the bulb.[14]\\r\\nExamples of lumens and lumens/watt for different size CFLs:\\r\\nDifferent grow lights produce different spectrums of light. Plant growth patterns can respond to the color spectrum of light, a process completely separate from photosynthesis known as photomorphogenesis.[29]\\r\\nNatural daylight has a high color temperature (approximately 5000-5800?K). Visible light color varies according to the weather and the angle of the Sun, and specific quantities of light (measured in lumens) stimulate photosynthesis. Distance from the sun has little effect on seasonal changes in the quality and quantity of light and the resulting plant behavior during those seasons. The axis of the Earth is not perpendicular to the plane of its orbit around the sun. During half of the year the north pole is tilted towards sun so the northern hemisphere gets nearly direct sunlight and the southern hemisphere gets oblique sunlight that must travel through more atmosphere before it reaches the Earth's surface. In the other half of the year, this is reversed. The color spectrum of light that the sun emits does not change, only the quantity (more during the summer and less in winter) and quality of overall light reaching the Earth's surface. Some supplemental LED grow lights in vertical greenhouses produce a combination of only red and blue wavelengths.[30] The color rendering index allows comparison of how closely the light matches the natural color of regular sunlight.\\r\\nThe ability of a plant to absorb light varies with species and environment, however, the general measurement for the light quality as it affects plants is the PAR value, or Photosynthetically Active Radiation.\\r\\nThere have been several experiments using LEDs to grow plants, and it has been shown that plants need both red and blue light for healthy growth. From experiments it has been consistently found that plants grown under only red (660?nm) LEDs grow poorly with leaf deformities, though adding a small amount of blue allows most plants to grow normally.[24]\\r\\nSeveral reports suggest that a minimum blue light requirement of 15-30 mol{m?2{s?1 is necessary for normal development in several plant species.[23][31][32]\\r\\nMany studies indicate that even with blue light added to red LEDs, plant growth is still better under white light, or light supplemented with green.[24][25][26] Neil C Yorio demonstrated that by adding 10% blue light (400 to 500?nm) to the red light (660?nm) in LEDs, certain plants like lettuce[21] and wheat[22] grow normally, producing the same dry weight as control plants grown under full spectrum light. However, other plants like radish and spinach grow poorly, and although they did better under 10% blue light than red-only light, they still produced significantly lower dry weights compared to control plants under a full spectrum light. Yorio speculates there may be additional spectra of light that some plants need for optimal growth.[21]\\r\\nGreg D. Goins examined the growth and seed yield of Arabidopsis plants grown from seed to seed under red LED lights with 0%, 1%, or 10% blue spectrum light. Arabidopsis plants grown under only red LEDS alone produced seeds, but had unhealthy leaves, and plants took twice as long to start flowering compared to the other plants in the experiment that had access to blue light. Plants grown with 10% blue light produced half the seeds of those grown under full spectrum, and those with 0% or 1% blue light produced one-tenth the seeds of the full spectrum plants. The seeds all germinated at a high rate under all light types tested.[23]\\r\\nHyeon-Hye Kim demonstrated that the addition of 24% green light (500-600?nm) to red and blue LEDs enhanced the growth of lettuce plants. These RGB treated plants not only produced higher dry and wet weight and greater leaf area than plants grown under just red and blue LEDs, they also produced more than control plants grown under cool white fluorescent lamps, which are the typical standard for full spectrum light in plant research.[25][26] She reported that the addition of green light also makes it easier to see if the plant is healthy since leaves appear green and normal. However, giving nearly all green light (86%) to lettuce produced lower yields than all the other groups.[25]\\r\\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASA) Biological Sciences research group has concluded that light sources consisting of more than 50% green cause reductions in plant growth, whereas combinations including up to 24% green enhance growth for some species.[33] Green light has been shown to affect plant processes via both cryptochrome-dependent and cryptochrome-independent means. Generally, the effects of green light are the opposite of those directed by red and blue wavebands, and it's speculated that green light works in orchestration with red and blue.[34]\\r\\nA plant's specific needs determine which lighting is most appropriate for optimum growth; artificial light must mimic the natural light to which the plant is best adapted. If a plant does not get enough light, it will not grow, regardless of other conditions. For example, vegetables grow best in full sunlight, and to flourish indoors they need equally high light levels, whereas foliage plants (e.g. Philodendron) grow in full shade and can grow normally with much lower light levels.\\r\\nGrow lights usage is dependent on the plant's phase of growth. Generally speaking, during the seedling/clone phase, plants should receive 16+ hours on, 8- hours off. The vegetative phase typically requires 18 hours on, and 6 hours off. During the final, flower stage of growth, keeping grow lights on for 12 hours on and 12 hours off is recommended.[35]\\r\\nIn addition, many plants also require both dark and light periods, an effect known as photoperiodism, to trigger flowering. Therefore, lights may be turned on or off at set times. The optimum photo/dark period ratio depends on the species and variety of plant, as some prefer long days and short nights and others prefer the opposite or intermediate \\"day lengths\\".\\r\\nMuch emphasis is placed on photoperiod when discussing plant development. However, it is the number of hours of darkness that affects a plants response to day length.[36] In general, a short-day is one in which the photoperiod is no more than 12 hours. A long-day is one in which the photoperiod is no less than 14 hours. Short-day plants are those that flower when the day length is less than a critical duration. Long-day plants are those that only flower when the photoperiod is greater than a critical duration. Day-neutral plants are those that flower regardless of photoperiod.[37]\\r\\nPlants that flower in response to photoperiod may have a facultative or obligate response. A facultative response means that a plant will eventually flower regardless of photoperiod, but will flower faster if grown under a particular photoperiod. An obligate response means that the plant will only flower if grown under a certain photoperiod.[38]\\r\\nLux and lumens are commonly used to measure light levels, but they are photometric units which measure the intensity of light as perceived by the human eye.\\r\\nThe spectral levels of light that can be used by plants for photosynthesis is similar to, but not the same as what's measured by lumens. Therefore, when it comes to measuring the amount of light available to plants for photosynthesis, biologists often measure the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) received by a plant.[39] PAR designates the spectral range of solar radiation from 400 to 700 nanometers, which generally corresponds to the spectral range that photosynthetic organisms are able to use in the process of photosynthesis.\\r\\nThe irradiance of PAR can be expressed in units of energy flux (W/m2), which is relevant in energy-balance considerations for photosynthetic organisms. However, photosynthesis is a quantum process and the chemical reactions of photosynthesis are more dependent on the number of photons than the amount of energy contained in the photons.[39] Therefore, plant biologists often quantify PAR using the number of photons in the 400-700?nm range received by a surface for a specified amount of time, or the Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD).[39] This is normally measured using mol m?2s?1.\\r\\nAccording to one manufacturer of grow lights, plants require at least light levels between 100 and 800 mol?m?2s?1.[40] For daylight-spectrum (5800 K) lamps, this would be equivalent to 5800 to 46,000 lm/m2.\\r\\nSee also","input":"What kind of light is a grow light?"},{"output":"Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG)","context":"Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) is a designation for United States military advisers sent to other countries to assist in the training of conventional armed forces and facilitate military aid. Although numerous MAAGs operated around the world throughout the 1940sÿ1970s, the most famous MAAGs were those active in Southeast Asia before and during the Vietnam War. Typically, the personnel of MAAGs were considered to be technical staff attached to, and enjoying the privileges of, the US diplomatic mission in a country.[1] Although the term is not as widespread as it once was, the functions performed by MAAGs continue to be performed by successor organizations attached to embassies, often called United States Military Groups (USMILGP or MILGRP). The term MAAG may still occasionally be used for such organizations helping promote military partnerships with several Latin American countries such as Peru and the Dominican Republic as well as in African countries such as Liberia.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1950, US President Harry Truman sent the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) to Vietnam to assist the French in the First Indochina War. The President claimed they were not sent as combat troops, but to supervise the use of $10 million worth of US military equipment to support the French in their effort to fight the Viet Minh forces. By 1953, aid increased dramatically to $350 million to replace old military equipment owned by the French.[2]\\r\\nThe French Army however, was reluctant to take U.S. advice, and would not allow the Vietnamese army to be trained to use the new equipment, because it went against French policy. They were supposed to not only defeat enemy forces but to solidify themselves as a colonial power, and they could not do this with a Vietnamese Army. French commanders were so reluctant to accept advice that would weaken their time-honored colonial role that they got in the way of the various attempts by the MAAG to observe where the equipment was being sent and how it was being used. Eventually the French decided to cooperate, but at that point it was too late.[2]\\r\\nIn 1954 the commanding general of French forces in Indochina, General Henri Navarre, allowed the United States to send liaison officers to Vietnamese forces. But it was too late, because of the siege and fall of Dien Bien Phu in the spring. As stated by the Geneva Accords, France was forced to surrender the northern half of Vietnam and to withdraw from South Vietnam by April 1956.[3]\\r\\nAt a conference in Washington, D.C. on February 12, 1955, between officials of the U.S. State Department and the French Minister of Overseas Affairs, it was agreed that all U.S. aid would be funneled directly to South Vietnam and that all major military responsibilities would be transferred from the French to the MAAG under the command of Lieutenant General John O'Daniel. A problem arose however, because the French Expeditionary Force had to depart from South Vietnam in April 1956 pursuant to the Accords. After the French defeat, it was renamed the MAAG Vietnam in 1955, as the United States became more deeply involved in what would come to be known as the Vietnam War.\\r\\nThe next few years saw the rise of a Communist insurgency in South Vietnam, and President Diem looked increasingly to US military assistance to strengthen his position, albeit with certain reservations. Attacks on US military advisers in Vietnam became more frequent. On October 22, 1957, MAAG Vietnam and USIS installations in Saigon were bombed, injuring US military advisers.[4] In the summer of 1959, Communist guerrillas staged an attack on a Vietnamese military base in Bien Hoa, killing and wounding several MAAG personnel.[5] During this time, American advisers were not put in high-ranking positions, and President Diem was reluctant to allow American advisers into Vietnamese tactical units. He was afraid that the United States would gain control or influence over his forces if Americans got into the ranks of the army. The first signs that his position was beginning to shift came in 1960, when the number of official US military advisers in the country was increased from 327 to 685 at the request of the South Vietnamese government.[5] By 1961, communist guerrillas were becoming stronger and more active. This increased enemy contacts in size and intensity throughout South Vietnam. At this point, Diem was under pressure from US authorities to liberalize his regime and implement reforms. Although key elements in the US administration were resisting his requests for increased military funding and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) troop ceilings, MAAG Vietnam played a significant role in advocating for a greater US presence in the country.[6] Throughout this period relations between the MAAG Vietnam and Diem were described as \\"excellent\\", even though the advisers were doubtful of his ability to hold off the insurgency.[7]\\r\\nNewly elected President John F. Kennedy agreed with MAAG Vietnam's calls for increases in ARVN troop levels and the U.S. military commitment in both equipment and men. In response, Kennedy provided $28.4 million in funding for ARVN, and overall military aid increased from $50 million per year to $144 million in 1961. In the first year of the Kennedy administration, MAAG Vietnam worked closely with administration officials, USOM, and the US Information Service to develop a counterinsurgency plan (CIP). The CIP's main initiatives included the strengthening of ARVN to combat the Communist insurgency, which had the corollary effect of strengthening Diem's political position.[8] At the same time President Diem agreed to the assignment of advisers to battalion level, significantly increasing the number of advisers; from 746 in 1961 to over 3,400 before MAAG Vietnam was placed under U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) and renamed the Field Advisory Element, Vietnam. At the peak of the war in 1968, 9,430 Army personnel acted as advisors down to the district and battalion level to train, advise and mentor the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps, Republic of Vietnam Navy and the Republic of Vietnam Air Force.\\r\\nMAAG Indochina had three commanders: BG Francis G. Brink, October 1950 ÿ August 1952; MG Thomas J. H. Trapnell, August 1952 ÿ April 1954; and LTG John W. O'Daniel, April 1954 ÿ November 1955. MAAG Vietnam was commanded by LTG Samuel T. Williams, November 1955 ÿ September 1960; LTG Lionel C. McGarr, September 1960 ÿ January 1962; and GEN Paul D. Harkins, January 1962 ÿ June 1964.\\r\\nAs part of the military outreach of the USA to friendly countries in Southeast Asia, a MAAG was established in Bangkok, Thailand in September 1950.\\r\\nIt was replaced by the Joint US Military Advisory Group Thailand (JUSMAGTHAI) in September 1953, which operates until today.[9][10]\\r\\nMAAG Laos was preceded by the Programs Evaluation Office, established on 15 December 1955. Due to the limitations emplaced by international treaty, the PEO was set up with civilian personnel instead of a MAAG with a military staff. When political changes superseded the treaty, MAAG Laos was established in 1961 to replace the Programs Evaluation Office in its support of the Royal Lao Army's fight against the communist Pathet Lao. On July 23, 1962, several interested countries agreed in Geneva to guarantee the neutrality and independence of Laos. As such, the US removed the MAAG, replacing it with a Requirements Office, which served as a convenient cover for the CIA activities.[11]\\r\\nOne of MAAG Laos' commanders was Reuben Tucker.\\r\\nMAAG Cambodia was established on June 4, 1955, pursuant to the United States-Royal Government of Cambodia agreement of May 16, 1955. This agreement included the introduction of high-ranking US military personnel to advise the Cambodian armed forces as non-combatants.[12] The advisory group was staffed mainly by army personnel, with smaller contingents of navy and air force personnel.\\r\\nAs Cambodia's leadership took an official policy of neutrality in the Cold War, MAAG Cambodia's involvement in the country was terminated on November 20, 1963, by General Order 6, MAAG Cambodia, following the Cambodian government's cancellation of all U.S. aid.[13]\\r\\nIn Taiwan, U.S. Military Advisory Group generally refers to the United States Armed Forces in the Republic of China (Taiwan) from April 1951 to December 1978. The commander of these forces was U.S. Major General William C. Chase until his retirement in 1955 at which time he was succeeded by U.S. Brigadier General Lester Bork[14] American military advisers were tasked with providing arms and military advice, assisting with Taiwanese military training, implementation of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, maintaining military contacts, and monitoring Republic of China forces. In 1957 there were 10,000 Americans in Taiwan, the great majority being CIA and military personnel and their families.[15]\\r\\nSince 1979, the site of MAAG headquarters in Taipei has been occupied by American Institute in Taiwan/Taipei branch, which is scheduled to move to a new office complex in 2015.\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from the United States Army Center of Military History website http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/FA54-73/ch2.htm.","input":"When were the first american advisors sent to vietnam?"},{"output":"28 May 1972","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward VIII (Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David; 23 June 1894 ÿ 28 May 1972) was King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Empire, and Emperor of India, from 20 January 1936 until his abdication on 11 December the same year, after which he became the Duke of Windsor.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward was the eldest son of King George V and Queen Mary. He was named Prince of Wales on his sixteenth birthday, nine weeks after his father succeeded as king. As a young man, he served in the British Army during the First World War and undertook several overseas tours on behalf of his father.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward became king on his father's death in early 1936. However, he showed impatience with court protocol, and caused concern among politicians by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions. Only months into his reign, he caused a constitutional crisis by proposing to Wallis Simpson, an American who had divorced her first husband and was seeking a divorce from her second. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective queen consort. Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as the titular head of the Church of England, which at the time disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive. Edward knew the British government, led by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would ruin his status as a politically neutral constitutional monarch. When it became apparent he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne, Edward abdicated. He was succeeded by his younger brother, George VI. With a reign of 326 days, Edward is one of the shortest-reigning monarchs in British history.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter his abdication, he was created Duke of Windsor. He married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937, after her second divorce became final. Later that year, the couple toured Germany. During the Second World War, he was at first stationed with the British Military Mission to France, but after private accusations he held Nazi sympathies he was appointed Governor of the Bahamas. After the war, Edward spent the rest of his life in retirement in France. Edward and Wallis remained married until his death in 1972.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward was born on 23 June 1894 at White Lodge, Richmond Park, on the outskirts of London during the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria.[1] He was the eldest son of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George V and Queen Mary). His father was the son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). His mother was the eldest daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Teck (Francis and Mary Adelaide). At the time of his birth, he was third in the line of succession to the throne, behind his grandfather and father.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was baptised Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David in the Green Drawing Room of White Lodge on 16 July 1894 by Edward White Benson, Archbishop of Canterbury.[N 1][2] The names were chosen in honour of Edward's late uncle, who was known to his family as \\"Eddy\\" or Edward, and his great-grandfather King Christian IX of Denmark. The name Albert was included at the behest of Queen Victoria for her late husband Albert, Prince Consort, and the last four names ÿ George, Andrew, Patrick and David ÿ came from the Patron Saints of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales.[3] He was always known to his family and close friends by his last given name, David.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs was common practice with upper-class children of the time, Edward and his younger siblings were brought up by nannies rather than directly by their parents. One of Edward's early nannies often abused him by pinching him before he was due to be presented to his parents. His subsequent crying and wailing would lead the Duke and Duchess to send him and the nanny away.[5] The nanny was discharged after her mistreatment of the children was discovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward's father, though a harsh disciplinarian,[6] was demonstrably affectionate,[7] and his mother displayed a frolicsome side with her children that belied her austere public image. She was amused by the children making tadpoles on toast for their French master,[8] and encouraged them to confide in her.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, Edward was tutored at home by Helen Bricka. When his parents travelled the British Empire for almost nine months following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, young Edward and his siblings stayed in Britain with their grandparents, Queen Alexandra and King Edward VII, who showered their grandchildren with affection. Upon his parents' return, Edward was placed under the care of two men, Frederick Finch and Henry Hansell, who virtually brought up Edward and his brothers and sister for their remaining nursery years.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward was kept under the strict tutorship of Hansell until almost thirteen years old. Private tutors taught him German and French.[11] Edward took the examination to enter the Royal Naval College, Osborne, and began there in 1907. Hansell had wanted Edward to enter school earlier, but the prince's father had disagreed.[12] Following two years at Osborne College, which he did not enjoy, Edward moved on to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. A course of two years, followed by entry into the Royal Navy, was planned. A bout of mumps may have made him infertile.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward automatically became Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay on 6 May 1910 when his father ascended the throne as George V on the death of Edward VII. He was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester a month later on 23 June 1910, his 16th birthday.[14] Preparations for his future as king began in earnest. He was withdrawn from his naval course before his formal graduation, served as midshipman for three months aboard the battleship Hindustan, then immediately entered Magdalen College, Oxford, for which, in the opinion of his biographers, he was underprepared intellectually. A keen horseman, he learned how to play polo with the university club.[15] He left Oxford after eight terms, without any academic qualifications.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward was officially invested as Prince of Wales in a special ceremony at Caernarfon Castle on 13 July 1911.[17] The investiture took place in Wales, at the instigation of the Welsh politician David Lloyd George, Constable of the Castle and Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Liberal government.[18] Lloyd George invented a rather fanciful ceremony in the style of a Welsh pageant, and coached Edward to speak a few words in Welsh.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the First World War broke out in 1914, Edward had reached the minimum age for active service and was keen to participate.[20] He had joined the Grenadier Guards in June 1914, and although Edward was willing to serve on the front lines, Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener refused to allow it, citing the immense harm that would occur if the heir to the throne were captured by the enemy.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite this, Edward witnessed trench warfare first-hand and visited the front line as often as he could, for which he was awarded the Military Cross in 1916. His role in the war, although limited, made him popular among veterans of the conflict.[22] Edward undertook his first military flight in 1918, and later gained a pilot's licence.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward's youngest brother, Prince John, died at the age of 13 on 18 January 1919 after a severe seizure.[24] John suffered from epilepsy, and Edward, who was 11 years older than his brother and had hardly known him, saw his death as \\"little more than a regrettable nuisance\\".[25] He wrote to his mistress of the time that \\"[he had] told [her] all about that little brother, and how he was an epileptic. [John]'s been practically shut up for the last two years anyhow, so no one has ever seen him except the family, and then only once or twice a year. This poor boy had become more of an animal than anything else.\\" He also wrote an insensitive letter to his mother, Queen Mary, which has since been lost.[26] She did not reply, but he felt compelled to write her an apology, in which he stated: \\"I feel such a cold hearted and unsympathetic swine for writing all that I did?... No one can realize more than you how little poor Johnnie meant to me who hardly knew him?... I feel so much for you, darling Mama, who was his mother.\\"[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the 1920s, Edward, as Prince of Wales, represented his father, King George V, at home and abroad on many occasions. His rank, travels, good looks, and unmarried status gained him much public attention, and at the height of his popularity, he was the most photographed celebrity of his time.[27] He took a particular interest in science and in 1926 was president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science when his alma mater, Oxford University, hosted the society's annual general meeting.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe also visited the poverty-stricken areas of Britain,[29] and undertook 16 tours to various parts of the Empire between 1919 and 1935. On a tour of Canada in 1919, he acquired the Bedingfield ranch, near Pekisko, Alberta,[30] and in 1924, he donated the Prince of Wales Trophy to the National Hockey League.[31] In 1929 Sir Alexander Leith, a leading Conservative in the north of England, persuaded him to make a three-day visit to the County Durham and Northumberland coal-fields, where at the time there was much unemployment.[32] From January to April 1931, the Prince of Wales and his brother Prince George travelled 18,000 miles on a tour of South America, steaming out on the ocean liner Oropesa ,[33] and returning via Paris and an Imperial Airways flight from ParisÿLe Bourget Airport that landed specially in Windsor Great Park.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough widely travelled, Edward was racially prejudiced against foreigners and many of the Empire's subjects, believing that whites were inherently superior.[36] In 1920, on a visit to Australia, he wrote of Indigenous Australians: \\"they are the most revolting form of living creatures I've ever seen?!! They are the lowest known form of human beings & are the nearest thing to monkeys.\\"[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1919 the Prince agreed to be President of the organising committee for the proposed British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Park, north-west London. The Prince wished the Exhibition to include \\"a great national sports ground\\", and so played a part in the creation of Wembley Stadium.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1917, during the First World War, he began a love affair with Parisian courtesan Marguerite Alibert (later Fahmy), who kept a collection of his indiscreet letters after he broke off the affair in 1918 to begin one with an English married woman, Freda Dudley Ward, a textile heiress.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward's womanising and reckless behaviour during the 1920s and 1930s worried Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, King George V, and those close to the prince. Alan Lascelles, the prince's private secretary for eight years during this period, believed that \\"for some hereditary or physiological reason his normal mental development stopped dead when he reached adolescence\\".[39] George V was disappointed by his son's failure to settle down in life, disgusted by his affairs with married women, and was reluctant to see him inherit the Crown. \\"After I am dead,\\" George said, \\"the boy will ruin himself in twelve months.\\"[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond-in-line to the throne was the prince's younger brother Albert (\\"Bertie\\"). Albert and his wife, Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother), had two children, including Princess Elizabeth (\\"Lilibet\\"), the future Queen Elizabeth II. George V favoured Albert and his granddaughter Elizabeth and told a courtier, \\"I pray to God that my eldest son will never marry and have children, and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne.\\"[41] In 1929, Time magazine reported that the Prince of Wales teased his sister-in-law, by calling her \\"Queen Elizabeth\\". The magazine asked if \\"she did not sometimes wonder how much truth there is in the story that he once said he would renounce his rights upon the death of George V ÿ which would make her nickname come true\\".[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1930, George V gave the prince the lease of Fort Belvedere in Windsor Great Park.[43] There, he continued his relationships with a series of married women, including Freda Dudley Ward and Lady Furness, the American wife of a British peer, who introduced the prince to her friend and fellow American Wallis Simpson. Simpson had divorced her first husband, U.S. naval officer Win Spencer, in 1927. Her second husband, Ernest Simpson, was a British-American businessman. Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales, it is generally accepted, became lovers, while Lady Furness travelled abroad, although the prince adamantly insisted to his father that he was not having an affair with her and that it was not appropriate to describe her as his mistress.[44] Edward's relationship with Simpson, however, further weakened his poor relationship with his father. Although King George V and Queen Mary met Simpson at Buckingham Palace in 1935,[45] they later refused to receive her.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward's affair with an American divorce led to such grave concern that the couple were followed by members of the Metropolitan Police Special Branch, who examined in secret the nature of their relationship. An undated report detailed a visit by the couple to an antique shop, where the proprietor later noted \\"that the lady seemed to have POW [Prince of Wales] completely under her thumb.\\"[47] The prospect of having an American divorce with a questionable past having such sway over the heir apparent led to anxiety among government and establishment figures.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nKing George V died on 20 January 1936, and Edward ascended the throne as King Edward VIII. The next day, accompanied by Simpson, he broke with custom by watching the proclamation of his own accession from a window of St James's Palace.[49] He became the first monarch of the British Empire to fly in an aircraft when he flew from Sandringham to London for his Accession Council.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward caused unease in government circles with actions that were interpreted as interference in political matters. His comment during a tour of depressed villages in South Wales that \\"something must be done\\"[11] for the unemployed coal miners was seen as an attempt to guide government policy, though it has never been clear what sort of remedy he had in mind. Government ministers were reluctant to send confidential documents and state papers to Fort Belvedere, because it was clear that Edward was paying little attention to them, and it was feared that Simpson and other house guests might read them, improperly or inadvertently disclosing information that could be detrimental to the national interest.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward's unorthodox approach to his role also extended to the coinage that bore his image. He broke with the tradition that the profile portrait of each successive monarch faced in the direction opposite to that of his or her predecessor. Edward insisted that he face left (as his father had done),[51] to show the parting in his hair.[52] Only a handful of test coins were struck before the abdication, and all are very rare.[53] When George VI succeeded to the throne he also faced left to maintain the tradition by suggesting that, had any further coins been minted featuring Edward's portrait, they would have shown him facing right.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 16 July 1936, an Irish fraudster called Jerome Bannigan, alias George Andrew McMahon, produced a loaded revolver as Edward rode on horseback at Constitution Hill, near Buckingham Palace. Police spotted the gun and pounced on him; he was quickly arrested. At Bannigan's trial, he alleged that \\"a foreign power\\" had approached him to kill Edward, that he had informed MI5 of the plan, and that he was merely seeing the plan through to help MI5 catch the real culprits. The court rejected the claims and sent him to jail for a year for \\"intent to alarm\\".[55] It is now thought that Bannigan had indeed been in contact with MI5, but the veracity of the remainder of his claims remains open.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August and September, Edward and Simpson cruised the Eastern Mediterranean on the steam yacht Nahlin. By October it was becoming clear that the new king planned to marry Simpson, especially when divorce proceedings between the Simpsons were brought at Ipswich Assizes.[57] Preparations for all contingencies were made, including the prospect of the coronation of King Edward and Queen Wallis. Because of the religious implications of any marriage, plans were made to hold a secular coronation ceremony, not in the traditional religious location of Westminster Abbey, but in the Banqueting House in Whitehall.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough gossip about his affair was widespread in the United States, the British media kept voluntarily silent, and the public knew nothing until early December.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 16 November 1936, Edward invited British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to Buckingham Palace and expressed his desire to marry Wallis Simpson when she became free to remarry. Baldwin informed him that his subjects would deem the marriage morally unacceptable, largely because remarriage after divorce was opposed by the Church of England, and the people would not tolerate Simpson as queen.[60] As king, Edward was the titular head of the Church of England, and the clergy expected him to support the Church's teachings.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward proposed an alternative solution of a morganatic marriage, in which he would remain king but Simpson would not become queen. She would enjoy some lesser title instead, and any children they might have would not inherit the throne. This too was rejected by the British Cabinet[61] as well as other Dominion governments,[62] whose views were sought pursuant to the Statute of Westminster 1931, which provided in part that \\"any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\\"[63] The Prime Ministers of Australia (Joseph Lyons), Canada (Mackenzie King) and South Africa (J. B. M. Hertzog) made clear their opposition to the king marrying a divorce;[64] their Irish counterpart (amon de Valera) expressed indifference and detachment, while the Prime Minister of New Zealand (Michael Joseph Savage), having never heard of Simpson before, vacillated in disbelief.[65] Faced with this opposition, Edward at first responded that there were \\"not many people in Australia\\" and their opinion did not matter.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward informed Baldwin that he would abdicate if he could not marry Simpson. Baldwin then presented Edward with three choices: give up the idea of marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate.[67] It was clear that Edward was not prepared to give up Simpson, and he knew that if he married against the advice of his ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis.[68] He chose to abdicate.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward duly signed the instruments[N 2] of abdication at Fort Belvedere on 10 December 1936 in the presence of his younger brothers: Prince Albert, Duke of York, next in line for the throne; Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; and Prince George, Duke of Kent.[70] The next day, the last act of his reign was the royal assent to His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936. As required by the Statute of Westminster, all the Dominions consented to the abdication.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the night of 11 December 1936, Edward, now reverted to the title and style of a prince, explained his decision to abdicate in a worldwide radio broadcast. He famously said, \\"I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.\\"[72] Edward departed Britain for Austria the following day; he was unable to join Simpson until her divorce became absolute, several months later.[73] His brother, the Duke of York, succeeded to the throne as George VI. George VI's elder daughter, Princess Elizabeth, became heir presumptive.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 December 1936, at the accession meeting of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, George VI announced he was to make his brother the \\"Duke of Windsor\\" with the style of Royal Highness.[74] He wanted this to be the first act of his reign, although the formal documents were not signed until 8 March the following year. During the interim, Edward was universally known as the Duke of Windsor. George VI's decision to create Edward a royal duke ensured that he could neither stand for election to the House of Commons nor speak on political subjects in the House of Lords.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nLetters Patent dated 27 May 1937 re-conferred the \\"title, style, or attribute of Royal Highness\\" upon the Duke of Windsor, but specifically stated that \\"his wife and descendants, if any, shall not hold said title or attribute\\". Some British ministers advised that the reconfirmation was unnecessary since Edward had retained the style automatically, and further that Simpson would automatically obtain the rank of wife of a prince with the style Her Royal Highness; others maintained that he had lost all royal rank and should no longer carry any royal title or style as an abdicated king, and be referred to simply as \\"Mr Edward Windsor\\". On 14 April 1937, Attorney General Sir Donald Somervell submitted to Home Secretary Sir John Simon a memorandum summarising the views of Lord Advocate T. M. Cooper, Parliamentary Counsel Sir Granville Ram, and himself:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duke of Windsor married Simpson, who had changed her name by deed poll to Wallis Warfield, in a private ceremony on 3 June 1937, at Chateau de Cand, near Tours, France. When the Church of England refused to sanction the union, a County Durham clergyman, the Reverend Robert Anderson Jardine (Vicar of St Paul's, Darlington), offered to perform the ceremony, and the Duke accepted. The new king, George VI, forbade members of the royal family to attend,[77] to the lasting resentment of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Edward had particularly wanted his brothers the Dukes of Gloucester and Kent and his second cousin Louis Mountbatten to attend the ceremony.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe denial of the style Royal Highness to the Duchess of Windsor caused further conflict, as did the financial settlement. The Government declined to include the Duke or Duchess on the Civil List, and the Duke's allowance was paid personally by George VI. The Duke compromised his position with his brother by concealing the extent of his financial worth when they informally agreed on the amount of the allowance. Edward's wealth had accumulated from the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall paid to him as Prince of Wales and ordinarily at the disposal of an incoming king. George VI also paid Edward for Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle, which were Edward's personal property, inherited from his father, George V, and thus did not automatically pass to George VI on his accession.[79] In the early days of George VI's reign the Duke telephoned daily, importuning for money and urging that the Duchess be granted the style of Royal Highness, until the harassed king ordered that the calls not be put through.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nRelations between the Duke of Windsor and the rest of the royal family were strained for decades. The Duke had assumed that he would settle in Britain after a year or two of exile in France. King George VI (with the support of Queen Mary and his wife Queen Elizabeth) threatened to cut off Edward's allowance if he returned to Britain without an invitation.[79] Edward became embittered against his mother, Queen Mary, writing to her in 1939: \\"[your last letter][N 3] destroy[ed] the last vestige of feeling I had left for you?... [and has] made further normal correspondence between us impossible.\\"[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1937, the Duke and Duchess visited Nazi Germany, against the advice of the British government, and met Adolf Hitler at his Berghof retreat in Bavaria. The visit was much publicised by the German media. During the visit the Duke gave full Nazi salutes.[82] In Germany, \\"they were treated like royalty?... members of the aristocracy would bow and curtsy towards her, and she was treated with all the dignity and status that the duke always wanted,\\" according to royal biographer Andrew Morton.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former Austrian ambassador, Count Albert von Mensdorff-Pouilly-Dietrichstein, who was also a second cousin once removed and friend of George V, believed that Edward favoured German fascism as a bulwark against communism, and even that he initially favoured an alliance with Germany.[84] According to the Duke of Windsor, the experience of \\"the unending scenes of horror\\"[85] during the First World War led him to support appeasement. Hitler considered Edward to be friendly towards Germany and thought that Anglo-German relations could have been improved through Edward if it were not for the abdication. Albert Speer quoted Hitler directly: \\"I am certain through him permanent friendly relations could have been achieved. If he had stayed, everything would have been different. His abdication was a severe loss for us.\\"[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duke and Duchess settled in France. In May 1939, the Duke was commissioned by NBC to give a radio broadcast[87] (his first since abdicating) during a visit to the battlefields of Verdun. In it he appealed for peace, saying \\"I am deeply conscious of the presence of the great company of the dead, and I am convinced that could they make their voices heard they would be with me in what I am about to say. I speak simply as a soldier of the Last War whose most earnest prayer it is that such cruel and destructive madness shall never again overtake mankind. There is no land whose people want war.\\" The broadcast was heard across the world by millions.[88][89] It was widely seen as supporting appeasement,[90] and the BBC refused to broadcast it.[87] It was broadcast outside the United States on shortwave radio[91] and was reported in full by British broadsheet newspapers.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the Duke and Duchess were brought back to Britain by Louis Mountbatten on board HMS Kelly, and Edward, although an honorary field marshal, was made a major-general attached to the British Military Mission in France.[11] In February 1940, the German ambassador in The Hague, Count Julius von Zech-Burkersroda, claimed that the Duke had leaked the Allied war plans for the defence of Belgium,[93] which the Duke later denied.[94] When Germany invaded the north of France in May 1940, the Windsors fled south, first to Biarritz, then in June to Spain. In July the pair moved to Portugal, where they lived at first in the home of Ricardo Esprito Santo, a Portuguese banker with both British and German contacts.[95] Under the code name Operation Willi, Nazi agents, principally Walter Schellenberg, plotted unsuccessfully to persuade the Duke to leave Portugal and return to Spain, kidnapping him if necessary.[96] Lord Caldecote wrote a warning to Winston Churchill: \\"[the Duke] is well-known to be pro-Nazi and he may become a centre of intrigue.\\"[97] Churchill threatened the Duke with a court-martial if he did not return to British soil.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 1940, Edward was appointed Governor of the Bahamas. The Duke and Duchess left Lisbon on 1 August aboard the American Export Lines steamship Excalibur, which was specially diverted from its usual direct course to New York City so that they could be dropped off at Bermuda on the 9th.[99] They left Bermuda for Nassau on the Canadian steamship Lady Somers on 15 August, arriving two days later.[100] The Duke did not enjoy being governor and referred to the islands as \\"a third-class British colony\\".[101] The British Foreign Office strenuously objected when the Duke and Duchess planned to cruise aboard a yacht belonging to a Swedish magnate, Axel Wenner-Gren, whom British and American intelligence wrongly believed to be a close friend of Luftwaffe commander Hermann G?ring.[102] The Duke was praised for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands, although he was as contemptuous of the Bahamians as he was of most non-white peoples of the Empire. He said of tienne Dupuch, the editor of the Nassau Daily Tribune: \\"It must be remembered that Dupuch is more than half Negro, and due to the peculiar mentality of this Race, they seem unable to rise to prominence without losing their equilibrium.\\"[103] He was praised, even by Dupuch, for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in Nassau in 1942, even though he blamed the trouble on \\"mischief makers ÿ communists\\" and \\"men of Central European Jewish descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draft\\".[104] He resigned from the post on 16 March 1945.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany historians have suggested that Hitler was prepared to reinstate Edward as king in the hope of establishing a fascist Britain.[105] It is widely believed that the Duke and Duchess sympathised with fascism before and during the Second World War, and were moved to the Bahamas to minimise their opportunities to act on those feelings. In 1940 he said: \\"In the past 10 years Germany has totally reorganised the order of its society?... Countries which were unwilling to accept such a reorganisation of society and its concomitant sacrifices should direct their policies accordingly.\\"[106] During the occupation of France, the Duke asked the German forces to place guards at his Paris and Riviera homes; they did so.[107] In December 1940, the Duke gave Fulton Oursler of Liberty magazine an interview at Government House in Nassau. The interview was published on 22 March 1941 and in it the Duke was reported to have said that \\"Hitler was the right and logical leader of the German people\\" and that the time was coming for President Franklin D. Roosevelt to mediate a peace settlement. Oursler conveyed the content of the interview to the President in a private meeting at the White House on 23 December 1940.[108] The Duke protested that he had been misquoted and misinterpreted.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Allies became sufficiently disturbed by German plots revolving around the Duke that President Roosevelt ordered covert surveillance of the Duke and Duchess when they visited Palm Beach, Florida, in April 1941. Duke Carl Alexander of Wrttemberg (then a monk in an American monastery) had told the Federal Bureau of Investigation that the Duchess had slept with the German ambassador in London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, in 1936, had remained in constant contact with him, and had continued to leak secrets.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthor Charles Higham claimed that Anthony Blunt, an MI5 agent and Soviet spy, acting on orders from the British royal family, made a successful secret trip to Schloss Friedrichshof in Germany towards the end of the war to retrieve sensitive letters between the Duke of Windsor and Adolf Hitler and other leading Nazis.[111] What is certain is that George VI sent the Royal Librarian, Owen Morshead, accompanied by Blunt, then working part-time in the Royal Library as well as for British intelligence, to Friedrichshof in March 1945 to secure papers relating to the German Empress Victoria, the eldest child of Queen Victoria. Looters had stolen part of the castle's archive, including surviving letters between daughter and mother, as well as other valuables, some of which were recovered in Chicago after the war. The papers rescued by Morshead and Blunt, and those returned by the American authorities from Chicago, were deposited in the Royal Archives.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the war, the Duke admitted in his memoirs that he admired the Germans, but he denied being pro-Nazi. Of Hitler he wrote: \\"[the] Fhrer struck me as a somewhat ridiculous figure, with his theatrical posturings and his bombastic pretensions.\\"[113] In the 1950s, journalist Frank Giles heard the Duke blame British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden for helping to \\"precipitate the war through his treatment of Mussolini?... that's what [Eden] did, he helped to bring on the war?... and of course Roosevelt and the Jews\\".[114] During the 1960s the Duke said privately to a friend, Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross, \\"I never thought Hitler was such a bad chap.\\"[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the war, the couple returned to France and spent the remainder of their lives essentially in retirement as the Duke never occupied another official role after his wartime governorship of the Bahamas. Correspondence between the Duke and Kenneth de Courcy, dated between 1946 and 1949, emerged in a US library in 2009. The letters suggest a plot where the Duke would return to England and place himself in a position for a possible regency. The health of George VI was failing and de Courcy was concerned about the influence of the Mountbatten family over the young Princess Elizabeth. De Courcy suggested the Duke buy a working agricultural estate within an easy drive of London in order to gain favour with the British public and make himself available should the King become incapacitated. The Duke, however, hesitated and the King recovered from his surgery.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duke's allowance was supplemented by government favours and illegal currency trading.[11][117][118] The City of Paris provided the Duke with a house at 4 route du Champ d'Entra?nement, on the Neuilly-sur-Seine side of the Bois de Boulogne, for a nominal rent.[119] The French government exempted him from paying income tax,[117][120] and the couple were able to buy goods duty-free through the British embassy and the military commissary.[120] In 1951, the Duke produced a ghost-written memoir, A King's Story, in which he expressed disagreement with liberal politics.[18] The royalties from the book added to their income.[117] Nine years later, he penned a relatively unknown book, A Family Album, chiefly about the fashion and habits of the royal family throughout his life, from the time of Queen Victoria to that of his grandfather and father, and his own tastes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duke and Duchess effectively took on the role of celebrities and were regarded as part of caf society in the 1950s and 1960s. They hosted parties and shuttled between Paris and New York; Gore Vidal, who met the Windsors socially, reported on the vacuity of the Duke's conversation.[121] The couple doted on the pug dogs they kept.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 1953, instead of attending the coronation of his niece in London, the Duke and Duchess watched the ceremony on television in Paris. The Duke said that it was contrary to precedent for a Sovereign or former Sovereign to attend any coronation of another. The Duke was paid to write articles on the ceremony for the Sunday Express and Woman's Home Companion, as well as a short book, The Crown and the People, 1902ÿ1953.[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1955, they visited President Dwight D. Eisenhower at the White House. The couple appeared on Edward R. Murrow's television interview show Person to Person in 1956,[124] and a 50-minute BBC television interview in 1970. That year, they were invited as guests of honour to a dinner at the White House by President Richard Nixon.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe royal family never fully accepted the Duchess. Queen Mary refused to receive her formally. However, Edward sometimes met his mother and brother George VI, and attended George's funeral in 1952. Queen Mary remained angry with Edward and indignant over his marriage to Wallis: \\"To give up all this for that\\", she said.[126] In 1965, the Duke and Duchess returned to London. They were visited by Elizabeth II, his sister-in-law Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, and his sister Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood. A week later, the Princess Royal died, and they attended her memorial service. In 1967, they joined the royal family for the centenary of Queen Mary's birth. The last royal ceremony the Duke attended was the funeral of Princess Marina in 1968.[127] He declined an invitation from Elizabeth II to attend the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969, replying that Prince Charles would not want his \\"aged great-uncle\\" there.[128]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s, the Duke's health deteriorated. In December 1964, he was operated on by Michael E. DeBakey in Houston for an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta, and in February 1965 a detached retina in his left eye was treated by Sir Stewart Duke-Elder. In late 1971, the Duke, who was a smoker from an early age, was diagnosed with throat cancer and underwent cobalt therapy. On 18 May 1972, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Windsors while on a state visit to France; she spoke with the Duke for fifteen minutes but only the Duchess appeared with the royal party for a photocall as the Duke was too ill.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 28 May 1972, ten days after the Queen's visit, the Duke died at his home in Paris, less than a month before his 78th?birthday. His body was returned to Britain, lying in state at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. The funeral service was held in the chapel on 5 June in the presence of the Queen, the royal family, and the Duchess of Windsor who stayed at Buckingham Palace during her visit. He was buried in the Royal Burial Ground behind the Royal Mausoleum of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at Frogmore.[130] Until a 1965 agreement with Queen Elizabeth?II, the Duke and Duchess had planned for a burial in a cemetery plot they had purchased at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, where the Duchess's father was interred.[131] Frail, and suffering increasingly from dementia, the Duchess died 14?years later, and was buried alongside her husband.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the view of historians, such as Philip Williamson writing in 2007, the popular perception in the 21st century that the abdication was driven by politics rather than religious morality is false and arises because divorce has become much more common and socially acceptable. To modern sensibilities, the religious restrictions that prevented Edward from continuing as king while planning to marry Simpson \\"seem, wrongly, to provide insufficient explanation\\" for his abdication.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis full style as king was \\"Edward VIII, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland, and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon his accession, Edward became sovereign of the various orders of the British Commonwealth and Empire, including those he had been appointed to prior to becoming king. After his abdication, the King, Edward's brother, reinstated his pre-accession honours.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Prince of Wales, Edward's arms were the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, differenced with a label of three points argent, with an inescutcheon representing Wales surmounted by a coronet (identical to those of Charles, the current Prince of Wales). As Sovereign, he bore the royal arms undifferenced. After his abdication, he used the arms again differenced by a label of three points argent, but this time with the centre point bearing an imperial crown.[146]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoat of arms of Edward, Prince of Wales, (1911ÿ1936)\\r\\n\\r\\nCoat of arms of Edward VIII of the United Kingdom (1936)\\r\\n\\r\\nCoat of arms of Edward VIII of the United Kingdom (in Scotland) (1936)\\r\\n\\r\\nCoat of arms of Edward, Duke of Windsor (1937ÿ1972)","input":"When did the abdicated king of england die?"},{"output":"lyrics express a common state of mind","context":"Middle English Lyric is a genre of English Literature, popular in the 14th Century, is characterized by its brevity and emotional expression. Conventionally, the lyric expresses \\"a moment,\\" usually spoken or performed in the first person. Although some lyrics have narratives, the plots are usually simple to emphasize an occasional, common experience. Even though Lyrics appear individual and personal, they are not \\"original;\\" instead, lyrics express a common state of mind.  Those states of mind are wide in range.  Some deal with religious topics pertaining to Jesus or the Virgin Mary, focusing on Christ's sacrifice and salvation, or Mary's roles as a mother and intercessor.  Other religious topics focus on Adam and the Fall, or the necessity of faith.  Others are secular, focusing on ale, women, and the simple joys of life.  Some are sarcastic, take on satire, humorous, and sometimes even crude.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiddle English Lyrics are almost impossible to date accurately.  These lyrical traditions could have already been old when they were written down.  Since they are thought to have been passed down orally, dating it is complicated further, as we don't know for how long they had been orally in existence.  Scholars believe that the oldest lyric could have dated from as far back as the 12th century, and the newest dating from the 15th century.  Other scholars believe that the lyric could have originated from France, as some of the translations closely mirror the French versions.  They also draw this conclusion from the comical genres of the secular lyrics: those of good drink and good lovers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiddle English Lyrics were meant to be heard, not read. Keeping in mind an aural audience, the lyric is usually structured with poetic devices: an obvious rhyme scheme, internal rhyme, wordplay, allegory, refrain, and sometimes musical effects. The rhyme scheme primarily functions as a mnemonic device for the audience. The Refrain, however, has several critical functions. The Refrain gives the lyric unity and provides commentary (this is not unlike the bob and wheel found in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight). In addition to functioning thematically, the refrain encourages the audience to participate in singing the lyric. Finally, Musical Effects also encourage audience participation, and they take the form of rhythms and sounds (for example, onomatopoeia is not an uncommon trope employed).  We do not know if they were set to music, but it could be possible, as several include music for accompaniment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Middle English Lyrics are anonymous. Because the lyrics reflect on a sort of \\"community property\\" of ideas, the concept of copyrighting a lyric to a particular author is usually inappropriate. Additionally, identifying authors is very difficult. Most lyrics are often un-dateable, and they appear in collections with no apparent organic unity. It is most likely many lyrics that survive today were widely recited in various forms before being written down. Evidence for this appears in a variety of Middle English poetry, especially Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. Many of Chaucer's lines bear an uncanny resemblance to Middle English Lyrics.  Since these lyrics were written in a clear medieval Latin, scholars infer that these authors were likely clerics, familiar with other languages as well.  Since the topics of the lyrics are secular, it is possible that the clerics were not writing the lyrics, but simply writing them down.  It has also been inferred that the authors of these lyrics were primarily male.  Some lyrics are written in a female voice, but it would be unlikely since those lyrics are written in a harsh satire against women.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiddle English Lyrics were not meant to be read or written down. Consequently, the few that survive are probably a very small sample of lyrics. Surviving Lyrics appear in miscellanies, notably the Harley 2253 manuscript. The lyrics often appear with many other types of works, including writings in other languages.","input":"What is the most common theme in medieval lyrics?"},{"output":"antibiotics","context":"Bubonic plague is one of three types of plague caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis.[1] One to seven days after exposure to the bacteria, flu like symptoms develop.[1] These include fever, headaches, and vomiting.[1] Swollen and painful lymph nodes occur in the area closest to where the bacteria entered the skin.[2] Occasionally the swollen lymph nodes may break open.[1]\\r\\nThe three types of plague are the result of the route of infection: bubonic plague, septicemic plague, and pneumonic plague.[1] Bubonic plague is mainly spread by infected fleas from small animals.[1] It may also result from exposure to the body fluids from a dead plague infected animal.[5] In the bubonic form of plague, the bacteria enter through the skin through a flea bite and travel via the lymphatic vessels to a lymph node, causing it to swell.[1] Diagnosis is made by finding the bacteria in the blood, sputum, or fluid from lymph nodes.[1]\\r\\nPrevention is through public health measures such as not handling dead animals in areas where plague is common.[1] Vaccines have not been found to be very useful for plague prevention.[1] Several antibiotics are effective for treatment including streptomycin, gentamicin, and doxycycline.[3][4] Without treatment it results in the death of 30% to 90% of those infected.[1][3] Death, if it occurs, is typically within ten days.[6] With treatment the risk of death is around 10%.[3] Globally there are about 650 documented cases a year which result in ~120 deaths.[1] The disease is most common in Africa.[1]\\r\\nThe plague is believed to be the cause of the Black Death that swept through Asia, Europe, and Africa in the 14th century and killed an estimated 50 million people.[1] This was about 25% to 60% of the European population.[1][7] Because the plague killed so many of the working population, wages rose due to the demand for labor.[7] Some historians see this as a turning point in European economic development.[7] The term bubonic is derived from the Greek word ?, meaning \\"groin\\".[8] The term \\"buboes\\" is also used to refer to the swollen lymph nodes.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best-known symptom of bubonic plague is one or more infected, enlarged, and painful lymph nodes, known as buboes. After being transmitted via the bite of an infected flea, the Y. pestis bacteria become localized in an inflamed lymph node where they begin to colonize and reproduce. Buboes associated with the bubonic plague are commonly found in the armpits, upper femoral, groin and neck region. Acral gangrene (i.e., of the fingers, toes, lips and nose) is another common symptom.\\r\\nBecause of its bite-based mode of transmission, the bubonic plague is often the first of a progressive series of illnesses. Bubonic plague symptoms appear suddenly a few days after exposure to the bacterium. Symptoms include:\\r\\nOther symptoms include heavy breathing, continuous vomiting of blood (hematemesis), aching limbs, coughing, and extreme pain caused by the decay or decomposition of the skin while the person is still alive. Additional symptoms include extreme fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, lenticulae (black dots scattered throughout the body), delirium, and coma.\\r\\nBubonic plague is an infection of the lymphatic system, usually resulting from the bite of an infected flea, Xenopsylla cheopis (the rat flea). In very rare circumstances, as in the septicemic plague, the disease can be transmitted by direct contact with infected tissue or exposure to the cough of another human. The flea is parasitic on house and field rats, and seeks out other prey when its rodent hosts die. The bacteria remain harmless to the flea, allowing the new host to spread the bacteria. The bacteria form aggregates in the gut of infected fleas and this results in the flea regurgitating ingested blood, which is now infected, into the bite site of a rodent or human host. Once established, bacteria rapidly spread to the lymph nodes and multiply.\\r\\nY. pestis bacilli can resist phagocytosis and even reproduce inside phagocytes and kill them. As the disease progresses, the lymph nodes can haemorrhage and become swollen and necrotic. Bubonic plague can progress to lethal septicemic plague in some cases. The plague is also known to spread to the lungs and become the disease known as the pneumonic plague.\\r\\nLaboratory testing is required in order to diagnose and confirm plague. Ideally, confirmation is through the identification of Y. pestis culture from a patient sample. Confirmation of infection can be done by examining serum taken during the early and late stages of infection. To quickly screen for the Y. pestis antigen in patients, rapid dipstick tests have been developed for field use.[12]\\r\\n?Samples taken for testing include:[13]\\r\\nSeveral classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague. These include aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamicin, tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1ÿ15%, compared to a mortality of 40ÿ60% in untreated cases.[14]\\r\\nPeople potentially infected with the plague need immediate treatment and should be given antibiotics within 24 hours of the first symptoms to prevent death. Other treatments include oxygen, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support. People who have had contact with anyone infected by pneumonic plague are given prophylactic antibiotics.[15] Using the broad-based antibiotic streptomycin has proven to be dramatically successful against the bubonic plague within 12 hours of infection.[16]\\r\\nThe first recorded epidemic affected the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) and was named the Plague of Justinian after emperor Justinian I, who was infected but survived through extensive treatment.[17] [18] The pandemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated 25 million (6th century outbreak) to 50 million people (two centuries of recurrence).[19][20] The historian Procopius wrote, in Volume II of History of the Wars, of his personal encounter with the plague and the effect it had on the rising empire. In the spring of 542, the plague arrived in Constantinople, working its way from port city to port city and spreading around the Mediterranean Sea, later migrating inland eastward into Asia Minor and west into Greece and Italy. Because the infectious disease spread inland by the transferring of merchandise through Justinians efforts in acquiring luxurious goods of the time and exporting supplies, his capital became the leading exporter of the bubonic plague. Procopius, in his work Secret History, declared that Justinian was a demon of an emperor who either created the plague himself or was being punished for his sinfulness.[20]\\r\\nIn the Late Middle Ages (1340ÿ1400) Europe experienced the most deadly disease outbreak in history when the Black Death, the infamous pandemic of bubonic plague, hit in 1347, killing a third of the human population.[where?] Some historians believe that society subsequently became more violent as the mass mortality rate cheapened life and thus increased warfare, crime, popular revolt, waves of flagellants, and persecution.[21] The Black Death originated in Central Asia and spread from Italy and then throughout other European countries. Arab historians Ibn Al-Wardni and Almaqrizi believed the Black Death originated in Mongolia. Chinese records also showed a huge outbreak in Mongolia in the early 1330s.[22] Research published in 2002 suggests that it began in early 1346 in the steppe region, where a plague reservoir stretches from the northwestern shore of the Caspian Sea into southern Russia. The Mongols had cut off the trade route, the Silk Road, between China and Europe which halted the spread of the Black Death from eastern Russia to Western Europe. The epidemic began with an attack that Mongols launched on the Italian merchants' last trading station in the region, Caffa in the Crimea.[16] In late 1346, plague broke out among the besiegers and from them penetrated into the town. When spring arrived, the Italian merchants fled on their ships, unknowingly carrying the Black Death. Carried by the fleas on rats, the plague initially spread to humans near the Black Sea and then outwards to the rest of Europe as a result of people fleeing from one area to another.\\r\\nThe plague resurfaced for a third time in the mid-19th century. Like the two previous outbreaks, this one also originated in Eastern Asia, most likely in Yunnan Province of China, where there are several natural plague foci.[23] The initial outbreaks occurred in the second half of the eighteenth century.[24][25] The disease remained localized in Southwest China for several years before spreading. In the city of Canton, beginning in January 1894, the disease killed 80,000 people by June. Daily water-traffic with the nearby city of Hong Kong rapidly spread the plague there, killing over 2,400 within two months.[26]\\r\\nAlso known as the modern pandemic, the third pandemic spread the disease to port cities throughout the world in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century via shipping routes.[27] The plague inflicted people in Chinatown in San Francisco from 1900-1904,[28] and the people of Oakland and east bay again from 1907-1909.[29] The last major outbreak occurred in the United States occurred in Los Angeles in 1924,[30] though the disease is still present in wild rodents, and can be passed to humans that come in contact with them.[31] According to the World Health Organization, the pandemic was considered active until 1959, when worldwide casualties dropped to 200 per year. In 1994, a plague outbreak in five Indian states caused an estimated 700 infections (including 52 deaths) and triggered a large migration of Indians within India as they tried to avoid the plague.\\r\\nFor over a decade since 2001, Zambia, India, Malawi, Algeria, China, Peru, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the most plague cases with over 1,100 cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo alone. From 1,000 to 2,000 cases are conservatively reported per year to the WHO.[32] From 2012 and to 2017 and reflecting political unrest and poor hygienic conditions, Madagascar began to host regular epidemics.[32]\\r\\nBetween 1900 and 2015, the United States had 1,036 human plague cases with an average of 9 cases per year. In 2015, 16 people in the Western United States developed plague, including 2 cases in Yosemite National Park.[33] These US cases usually occur in rural northern New Mexico, northern Arizona, southern Colorado, California, southern Oregon, and far western Nevada.[34]\\r\\nIn November 2017, the Madagascar Ministry of Health reported an outbreak to WHO (World Health Organization) with more cases and deaths than any recent outbreak in the country. Unusually most of the cases were pneumonic rather than bubonic.[35]\\r\\nThe scale of death and social upheaval associated with plague outbreaks has made the topic prominent in a number of historical and fictional accounts since the disease was first recognized. The Black Death in particular is described and referenced in numerous contemporary sources, some of which, including works by Chaucer, Boccaccio, and Petrarch, are considered part of the Western canon. The Decameron, by Boccaccio, is notable for its use of a frame story involving individuals who have fled Florence for a secluded villa to escape the Black Death. First person, sometimes sensationalized or fictionalized, accounts of living through plague years have also been popular across centuries and cultures.\\r\\nLater works, such as Albert Camus's novel The Plague or Ingmar Bergman's film The Seventh Seal have used bubonic plague in settings, such quarantined cities in either medieval or modern times, as a backdrop to explore a variety of concepts. Common themes include the breakdown of society, institutions, and individuals during the plague, the cultural and psychological existential confrontation with mortality, and the allegorical use of the plague in reference to contemporary moral or spiritual questions.\\r\\nSome of the earliest instances of biological warfare were said to have been products of the plague, as armies of the 14th century were recorded catapulting diseased corpses over the walls of towns and villages to spread the pestilence.\\r\\nLater, plague was used during the Second Sino-Japanese War as a bacteriological weapon by the Imperial Japanese Army. These weapons were provided by Shir Ishii's units and used in experiments on humans before being used on the field. For example, in 1940, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service bombed Ningbo with fleas carrying the bubonic plague.[36] During the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials, the accused, such as Major General Kiyashi Kawashima, testified that, in 1941, 40 members of Unit 731 air-dropped plague-contaminated fleas on Changde. These operations caused epidemic plague outbreaks.[37]","input":"What is the cure to the bubonic plague?"},{"output":"5 seasons","context":"Hey Arnold! is an American animated television series created by Craig Bartlett that aired on Nickelodeon from October 7, 1996 to June 8, 2004.

Thunnini comprises fifteen species across five genera,[1] the sizes of which vary greatly, ranging from the bullet tuna (max. length: 50?cm (1.6?ft), weight: 1.8?kg (4?lb)) up to the Atlantic bluefin tuna (max. length: 4.6?m (15?ft), weight: 684?kg (1,508?lb)). The bluefin averages 2?m (6.6?ft), and is believed to live for up to 50 years. When canned and packaged for sale, the product is sometimes called tuna fish.\\r\\nTuna and mackerel sharks are the only species of fish that can maintain a body temperature higher than that of the surrounding water. An active and agile predator, the tuna has a sleek, streamlined body, and is among the fastest-swimming pelagic fish?ÿ the yellowfin tuna, for example, is capable of speeds of up to 75?km/h (47?mph).[2] Found in warm seas, it is extensively fished commercially, and is popular as a game fish. As a result of overfishing, stocks of some tuna species, such as the southern bluefin tuna, are close to extinction.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term tuna ultimately derives from Thunnus, the Middle Latin form of the Ancient Greek: Ĳ??, translit.?(thynnos), lit.?'tunny-fish'?ÿ which is in turn derived from Ĳ? (thyn), \\"rush, dart along\\".[4][5]\\r\\nHowever, the immediate source for the word tuna in English is American Spanish < Spanish at~n < Andalusian Arabic at-tn, assimilated from al-tn ????? [Modern Arabic ????]?: 'tuna fish' < Greco-Latin thunnus mentioned above.[6]\\r\\nThe Thunnini tribe is a monophyletic clade comprising fifteen species in five genera:\\r\\nThe cladogram is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxa, and is read left-to-right as if on a timeline. The following cladogram illustrates the relationship between the tunas and other tribes of the family Scombridae. For example, the cladogram illustrates that the skipjack tunas are more closely related to the true tunas than are the slender tunas (the most primitive of the tunas), and that the next nearest relatives of the tunas are the bonitos of the Sardini tribe.[1]\\r\\n?Butterfly kingfishes?(1 genus)\\r\\n?Mackerels?(2 genera)\\r\\n?Spanish mackerels?(3 genera)\\r\\n?Bonitos?(4 genera)\\r\\n?Allothunnus,?slender tunas\\r\\n?Auxis,?frigate tunas\\r\\n?Euthynnus,?little tunas\\r\\n?Katsuwonus,?skipjack tunas\\r\\n?bluefin group\\r\\n?yellowfin group\\r\\nThe \\"true\\" tunas are those that belong to the genus Thunnus. Until recently, it was thought that there were seven Thunnus species, and that Atlantic bluefin tuna and Pacific bluefin tuna were subspecies of a single species. In 1999, Collette established that based on both molecular and morphological considerations, they are in fact distinct species.[7][8]\\r\\nThe genus Thunnus is further classified into two subgenera: Thunnus (Thunnus) (the bluefin group), and Thunnus (Neothunnus) (the yellowfin group).\\r\\nThe Thunnini tribe also includes seven additional species of tuna across four genera. They are:\\r\\nThe tuna is a sleek and streamlined fish, adapted for speed. It has two closely spaced dorsal fins on its back; The first is \\"depressible\\"?ÿ it can be laid down, flush, in a groove that runs along its back. Seven to ten yellow finlets run from the dorsal fins to the tail, which is lunate?ÿ curved like a crescent moon?ÿ and tapered to pointy tips. The caudal peduncle, to which the tail is attached, is quite thin, with three stabilizing horizontal keels on each side. The tuna's dorsal side is generally a metallic dark blue, while the ventral side, or underside, is silvery or whitish, for camouflage.[38]\\r\\nThunnus are widely but sparsely distributed throughout the oceans of the world, generally in tropical and temperate waters at latitudes ranging between about 45 north and south of the equator.[39] All tunas are able to maintain the temperature of certain parts of their body above the temperature of ambient seawater. For example, bluefin can maintain a core body temperature of 25ÿ33?C (77ÿ91?F), in water as cold as 6?C (43?F). However, unlike \\"typical\\" endothermic creatures such as mammals and birds, tuna do not maintain temperature within a relatively narrow range.[40][41]\\r\\nTunas achieve endothermy by conserving the heat generated through normal metabolism. In all tunas, the heart operates at ambient temperature, as it receives cooled blood, and coronary circulation is directly from the gills.[42] The rete mirabile (\\"wonderful net\\"), the intertwining of veins and arteries in the body's periphery, allows nearly all of the metabolic heat from venous blood to be \\"re-claimed\\" and transferred to the arterial blood via a counter-current exchange system, thus mitigating the effects of surface cooling.[43] This allows the tuna to elevate the temperatures of the highly-aerobic tissues of the skeletal muscles, eyes and brain,[40][42] which supports faster swimming speeds and reduced energy expenditure, and which enables them to survive in cooler waters over a wider range of ocean environments than those of other fish.[41]\\r\\nAlso unlike most fish, which have white flesh, the muscle tissue of tuna ranges from pink to dark red. The red myotomal muscles derive their color from myoglobin, an oxygen-binding molecule, which tuna express in quantities far higher than most other fish. The oxygen-rich blood further enables energy delivery to their muscles.[40]\\r\\nFor powerful swimming animals like dolphins and tuna, cavitation may be detrimental, because it limits their maximum swimming speed.[44] Even if they have the power to swim faster, dolphins may have to restrict their speed, because collapsing cavitation bubbles on their tail are too painful. Cavitation also slows tuna, but for a different reason. Unlike dolphins, these fish do not feel the bubbles, because they have bony fins without nerve endings. Nevertheless, they cannot swim faster because the cavitation bubbles create a vapor film around their fins that limits their speed. Lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage.[44]\\r\\nTuna is an important commercial fish. The International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF) compiled a detailed scientific report on the state of global tuna stocks in 2009, which includes regular updates. According to the ISSF, the most important species for commercial and recreational tuna fisheries are yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), bigeye (T. obesus), bluefin (T. thynnus, T. orientalis, and T. macoyii), albacore (T. alalunga), and skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis).[39]\\r\\nBased on catches from 2007, the report states:\\r\\nBetween 1940 and the mid-1960s, the annual world catch of the five principal market species of tunas rose from about 300 thousand tons to about 1 million tons, most of it taken by hook and line. With the development of purse-seine nets, now the predominant gear, catches have risen to more than 4 million tons annually during the last few years. Of these catches, about 68 percent are from the Pacific Ocean, 22 percent from the Indian Ocean, and the remaining 10 percent from the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Skipjack makes up about 60 percent of the catch, followed by yellowfin (24 percent), bigeye (10 percent), albacore (5 percent), and bluefin the remainder. Purse-seines take about 62 percent of the world production, longline about 14 percent, pole and line about 11 percent, and a variety of other gears the remainder.[39]\\r\\nThe Australian government alleged in 2006 that Japan had illegally overfished southern bluefin by taking 12,000 to 20,000 tonnes per year instead of the agreed upon 6,000 tonnes; the value of such overfishing would be as much as US$2 billion.[45] Such overfishing has severely damaged bluefin stocks.[46] According to the WWF, \\"Japan's huge appetite for tuna will take the most sought-after stocks to the brink of commercial extinction unless fisheries agree on more rigid quotas\\".[47] Japan's Fisheries Research Agency counters that Australian and New Zealand tuna fishing companies under-report their total catches of southern bluefin tuna and ignore internationally mandated total allowable catch totals.[48]\\r\\nIn recent years, opening day fish auctions at Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market have seen record-setting prices for bluefin tuna, reflecting market demand. In each of 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, new record prices have been set for a single fish?ÿ the current record is 155.4 million japanese yen (US $1.76 million) for a 221?kg (487?lb) bluefin, or a unit price of JP?703,167/kg (US$3,603/lb). The opening auction price for 2014 plummeted to less than 5% of the previous year's price, which had drawn complaints for climbing \\"way out of line\\".[49] A summary of record-setting auctions are shown in the following table (highlighted values indicate new world records):\\r\\nIn November 2011, a different record was set when a fisherman in Massachusetts caught an 881-pound tuna. It was captured inadvertently using a dragnet. Due to the laws and restrictions on tuna fishing in the United States, federal authorities impounded the fish because it was not caught with a rod and reel. Because of the tuna's deteriorated condition as a result of the trawl net, the fish sold for just under $5,000.[54]\\r\\nTuna being weighed on Greek quay-side\\r\\nTuna at Tsukiji fish market, Tokyo\\r\\nTuna cut in half for processing at Tsukuji fish market\\r\\nBesides for edible purposes, many species of tuna are caught frequently as a game fish, often for recreation or for contests in which money is awarded depending on how heavy the fish weighs in at. Larger specimens are notorious for putting up a fight while hooked, and have been known to injure people who try to catch them, as well as damage their equipment.\\r\\nIn 2005, Nauru, defending its vote from Australian criticism at that year's meeting of the International Whaling Commission, argued that some whale species have the potential to devastate Nauru's tuna stocks, and that Nauru's food security and economy relies heavily on fishing.[56] Despite this, Nauru does not permit whaling in its own waters and does not allow other fishing vessels to take or intentionally interact with marine mammals in its Exclusive Economic Zone. In 2010 and 2011 Nauru supported Australian proposals[57] for a western Pacific-wide ban on tuna purse-seining in the vicinity of marine mammals? a measure which was agreed by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission at its eighth meeting in March 2012.\\r\\nDolphins swim beside several tuna species. These include yellowfin tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean, but not albacore. Tuna schools are believed to associate themselves with dolphins for protection against sharks, which are tuna predators.[58]\\r\\nCommercial fishing vessels used to exploit this association by searching for dolphin pods. Vessels would encircle the pod with nets to catch the tuna beneath,[59] however the nets were prone to entangling dolphins, injuring or killing them. Public outcry and new government regulations, which are now monitored by NOAA have led to more \\"dolphin friendly\\" methods, now generally involving lines rather than nets. However, there are neither universal independent inspection programs nor verification of \\"dolphin safeness\\", so these protections are not absolute. According to Consumers Union, the resulting lack of accountability means claims of tuna that is \\"dolphin safe\\" should be given little credence.\\r\\nFishery practices have changed to be dolphin friendly, which has caused greater bycatch including sharks, turtles and other oceanic fish. Fishermen no longer follow dolphins, but concentrate their fisheries around floating objects such as fish aggregation devices, also known as FADs, which attract large populations of other organisms. Measures taken thus far to satisfy the public demand to protect dolphins can be potentially damaging to other species as well.[60]\\r\\nIncreasing quantities of high-grade tuna are reared in net pens and fed bait fish. In Australia, former fishermen raise southern bluefin tuna, Thunnus maccoyii, and another bluefin species.[55] Farming its close relative, the Atlantic bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus, is beginning in the Mediterranean, North America and Japan. Hawai?i approved permits for the first U.S. offshore farming of bigeye tuna in water 1,300 feet (400?m) deep in 2009.[61]\\r\\nJapan is the biggest tuna consuming nation and is also the leader in tuna farming research.[62] Japan first successfully farm-hatched and raised bluefin tuna in 1979. In 2002, it succeeded in completing the reproduction cycle and in 2007, completed a third generation.[63][64][65] The farm breed is known as Kindai tuna. Kindai is the contraction of Kinki University in Japanese (Kinki daigaku).[66] In 2009, Clean Seas, an Australian company which has been receiving assistance from Kinki University[67][68][69] managed to breed Southern Bluefin Tuna in captivity and was awarded the second place in World's Best Invention of 2009 by Time magazine.[70][71]\\r\\nThe fresh or frozen flesh of tuna is widely regarded as a delicacy in most areas where it is shipped, being prepared in a variety of ways for the sake of achieving specific flavors or textures. When served as a steak, the meat of most species is known for its thickness and tough texture. Some species (such as the bluefin) are also known for the sheer amount of blood they expel while being gutted.[citation needed]\\r\\nCanned tuna was first produced in Australia in 1903, quickly becoming popular.[72] Tuna can be canned in edible oils, in brine, in water, and in various sauces. Tuna may be processed to be \\"chunked\\" or \\"flaked\\". When canned the product is often referred to as \\"tuna fish\\", a calque (loan translation) from the German Thunfisch. In the United States, 52% of canned tuna is used for sandwiches; 22% for salads; and 15% for casseroles and dried and pre-packaged meal kits such as General Mills's Tuna Helper line.[73]\\r\\nIn the United States, only Albacore can legally be sold in canned form as \\"white meat tuna\\";[74] in other countries, yellowfin is also acceptable. While in the early 1980s canned tuna in Australia was most likely Southern bluefin, as of 2003[update] it was usually yellowfin, skipjack, or tongol (labelled \\"northern bluefin\\").[72]\\r\\nAs tunas are often caught far from where they are processed, poor interim conservation can lead to spoilage. Tuna is typically gutted by hand, and later pre-cooked for prescribed times of 45 minutes to three hours. The fish are then cleaned and filleted, canned, and sealed, with the dark lateral blood meat often separately canned for pet food. The sealed can is then heated under pressure (called retort cooking) for 2 to 4 hours.[75] This process kills any bacteria, but retains the histamine that can produce rancid flavors. The international standard sets the maximum histamine level at 200 milligrams per kilogram. An Australian study of 53 varieties of unflavored canned tuna found none to exceed the safe histamine level, although some had \\"off\\" flavors.[72]\\r\\nAustralian standards once required cans of tuna to contain at least 51% tuna, but these regulations were dropped in 2003.[76][77] The remaining weight is usually oil or water. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates canned tuna (see part c).[78]\\r\\nTuna can be a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. It can contain 300 milligrams (0.011?oz) per serving.[79] However, the level of omega-3 oils found in canned tuna is highly variable, since some common manufacturing methods destroy much of the omega-3 oils in the fish.[80] Tuna is also a good source of protein.\\r\\nMercury content in tuna can vary widely. For instance, testing by Rutgers University reportedly found that a can of StarKist had 10 times more mercury than another can of similarly identified tuna. This has prompted a Rutgers University scientist whose staff conducted the mercury analysis to say, \\"That's one of the reasons pregnant women have to be really careful ... If you happen to get a couple or three cans in the high range at a critical period when you are pregnant, it would not be good.\\" Among those calling for improved warnings about mercury in tuna is the American Medical Association, which adopted a policy that physicians should help make their patients more aware of the potential risks.[81]\\r\\nA study published in 2008 found that mercury distribution in the meat of farmed tuna is inversely related to the lipid content, suggesting that higher lipid concentration within edible tissues of tuna raised in captivity might, other factors remaining equal, have a diluting effect on mercury content.[82] These findings suggest that choosing to consume a type of tuna that has a relatively higher natural fat content might help reduce the amount of mercury intake, compared to consuming tuna with a low fat content.\\r\\nDue to their high position in the food chain and the subsequent accumulation of heavy metals from their diet, mercury levels can be high in larger species such as bluefin and bigeye.\\r\\nIn 2009 a California appeals court upheld a ruling that canned tuna does not need warning labels as the methylmercury is naturally occurring.[83]\\r\\nIn March 2004, the United States FDA issued guidelines recommending that pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children limit their intake of tuna and other predatory fish.[84] The Environmental Protection Agency provides guidelines on how much canned tuna is safe to eat. Roughly speaking, the guidelines recommend one 6-ounce (170?g) can of light tuna per week for individuals weighing less than 110 pounds (50?kg), and two cans per week for those who weigh more.[85]\\r\\nIn 2007 it was reported that some canned light tuna such as yellowfin tuna[86] is significantly higher in mercury than skipjack, and caused Consumers Union and other activist groups to advise pregnant women to refrain from consuming canned tuna.[87]\\r\\nThe Eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis) has been available for decades as a low-mercury, less expensive canned tuna. However, of the five major species of canned tuna imported by the United States it is the least commercially attractive, primarily due to its dark color and more pronounced 'fishy' flavor. Its use has traditionally been restricted to institutional (non-retail) commerce.\\r\\nA January 2008 investigation conducted by The New York Times found potentially dangerous levels of mercury in certain varieties of sushi tuna, reporting levels \\"so high that the Food and Drug Administration could take legal action to remove the fish from the market.\\"[88]\\r\\nA book by Jane Hightower, Diagnosis Mercury: Money, Politics and Poison, published in 2008, discusses human exposure to mercury through eating large predatory fish such as large tuna.[89][90]\\r\\nThe main tuna fishery management bodies are the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.[91] The five gathered for the first time in Kobe, Japan in January 2007. Environmental organizations made submissions[92] on risks to fisheries and species. The meeting concluded with an action plan drafted by some 60 countries or areas. Concrete steps include issuing certificates of origin to prevent illegal fishing and greater transparency in the setting of regional fishing quotas. The delegates were scheduled to meet at another joint meeting in January or February 2009 in Europe.[93]\\r\\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International added the albacore, bigeye tuna, Pacific bluefin tuna, Atlantic bluefin tuna, southern bluefin tuna, and yellowfin tuna to its seafood red list, which are fish \\"commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\\"[94][95]\\r\\nBluefin tuna have been widely accepted as being severely overfished, with some stocks at risk of collapse.[96][97] According to the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (a global, nonprofit partnership between the tuna industry, scientists, and the World Wide Fund for Nature), Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna, Pacific Ocean (eastern and western) bigeye tuna, and North Atlantic albacore tuna are all overfished. In April 2009, no stock of skipjack tuna (which makes up roughly 60% of all tuna fished worldwide) was considered to be overfished.[98] However, the BBC documentary South Pacific, which first aired in May 2009, stated that, should fishing in the Pacific continue at its current rate, populations of all tuna species could collapse within five years.[99] It highlighted huge Japanese and European tuna fishing vessels, sent to the South Pacific international waters after overfishing their own fish stocks to the point of collapse.\\r\\nA 2010 tuna fishery assessment report, released in January 2012 by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, supported this finding, recommending that all tuna fishing should be reduced or limited to current levels and that limits on skipjack fishing be considered.[100]\\r\\nResearch[101] indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the tuna in the Indian Ocean, where rapid warming of the ocean has resulted in a reduction of marine phytoplankton. The bigeye tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.[101]","input":"How many different types of tuna are there?"},{"output":"during the Cold War","context":"The nuclear arms race was a competition for supremacy in nuclear warfare between the United States, the Soviet Union, and their respective allies during the Cold War. During this period, in addition to the American and Soviet nuclear stockpiles, other countries developed nuclear weapons, though none engaged in warhead production on nearly the same scale as the two superpowers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first nuclear weapon was created by the U.S. during the Second World War and was developed to be used against the Axis powers.[1] Scientists of the Soviet Union were aware of the potential of nuclear weapons and had also been conducting research on the field.[2]\\r\\nThe Soviet Union was not informed officially of the Manhattan Project until Stalin was briefed at the Potsdam Conference on July 24, 1945, by U.S. President Harry S. Truman,[3][4] eight days after the first successful test of a nuclear weapon. Despite their wartime military alliance, the United States and Britain had not trusted the Soviets enough to keep knowledge of the Manhattan Project safe from German spies: there were also concerns that, as an ally, the Soviet Union would request and expect to receive technical details of the new weapon.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen President Truman informed Stalin of the weapons, he was surprised at how calmly Stalin reacted to the news and thought that Stalin had not understood what he had been told. Other members of the United States and British delegations who closely observed the exchange formed the same conclusion.[5]\\r\\nIn fact Stalin had long been aware of the program,[6] despite the Manhattan Project having a secret classification so high that, even as Vice President, Truman did not know about it or the development of the weapons (Truman was not informed until shortly after he became president).[6] A ring of spies operating within the Manhattan Project, (including Klaus Fuchs[7] and Theodore Hall) had kept Stalin well informed of American progress.[8] They provided the Soviets with detailed designs of the implosion bomb and the hydrogen bomb.[citation needed] Fuchs' arrest in 1950 led to the arrests of many other Russian spies, including Harry Gold, David Greenglass, and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg.[9]\\r\\nIn August 1945, on Truman's orders, two atomic bombs were dropped on Japanese cities. The first bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and the second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki by the B-29 bombers named Enola Gay and Bockscar respectively.\\r\\nShortly after the end of the Second World War in 1945, the United Nations was founded. During the United Nation's first General Assembly in London in January 1946, they discussed the future of Nuclear Weapons and created the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. The goal of this assembly was to eliminate the use of all Nuclear weapons. The United States presented their solution, which was called the Baruch Plan.[10] This plan proposed that there should be an international authority that controls all dangerous atomic activities. The Soviet Union disagreed with this proposal and rejected it. The Soviets' proposal involved universal nuclear disarmament. Both the American and Soviet proposals were refused by the UN.\\r\\nIn the years immediately after the Second World War, the United States had a monopoly on specific knowledge of and raw materials for nuclear weaponry. American leaders hoped that their exclusive ownership of nuclear weapons would be enough to draw concessions from the Soviet Union but this proved ineffective.\\r\\nJust six months after the UN General Assembly, the United States conducted its first post-war nuclear tests. This was called Operation Crossroads.[11] The purpose of this operation was to test the effectiveness of nuclear explosions on ships. These tests were performed at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific on 95 ships, including German and Japanese ships that were captured during World War II. One plutonium implosion-type bomb was detonated over the fleet, while the other one was detonated underwater.\\r\\nBehind the scenes, the Soviet government was working on building its own atomic weapons. During the war, Soviet efforts had been limited by a lack of uranium but new supplies in Eastern Europe were found and provided a steady supply while the Soviets developed a domestic source. While American experts had predicted that the Soviet Union would not have nuclear weapons until the mid-1950s, the first Soviet bomb was detonated on August 29, 1949, shocking the entire world. The bomb, named \\"First Lightning\\" by the West, was more or less a copy of \\"Fat Man\\", one of the bombs the United States had dropped on Japan in 1945.\\r\\nBoth governments spent massive amounts to increase the quality and quantity of their nuclear arsenals. Both nations quickly began the development of a hydrogen bomb and the United States detonated the first hydrogen bomb on November 1, 1952, on Enewetak, an atoll in the Pacific Ocean.[12] Code-named \\"Ivy Mike\\", the project was led by Edward Teller, a Hungarian-American nuclear physicist. It created a cloud 100 miles wide and 25 miles high, killing all life on the surrounding islands.[13] Again, the Soviets surprised the world by exploding a deployable thermonuclear device in August 1953 although it was not a true multi-stage hydrogen bomb. However, it was small enough to be dropped from an airplane, making it ready for use. The development of these two Soviet bombs was greatly aided by the Russian spies Harry Gold and Klaus Fuchs.\\r\\nOn March 1, 1954, the U.S. conducted the Castle Bravo test, which tested another hydrogen bomb on Bikini Atoll.[14] Scientists significantly underestimated the size of the bomb, thinking it would yield 5 megatons. However, it yielded 14.8 megatons, which is the largest nuclear explosion tested by the U.S. The explosion was so large the nuclear fallout exposed residents up to 300 miles away to significant amounts of radiation. They were eventually evacuated, but most of them experienced radiation poisoning and resulted in one death from a crew member of a fishing boat 90 miles from the explosion.\\r\\nThe Soviet Union detonated its first \\"true\\" hydrogen bomb on November 22, 1955, which had a yield of 1.6 megatons. On October 30, 1961, the Soviets detonated a hydrogen bomb with a yield of approximately 58 megatons.[15]\\r\\nWith both sides in the \\"cold war\\" having nuclear capability, an arms race developed, with the Soviet union attempting first to catch up and then to surpass the Americans.[16]\\r\\nStrategic bombers were the primary delivery method at the beginning of the Cold War.\\r\\nMissiles had long been regarded the ideal platform for nuclear weapons, and were potentially a more effective delivery system than bombers. Starting in the 1950s, medium-range ballistic missiles and intermediate-range ballistic missiles (\\"IRBM\\"s) were developed for delivery of tactical nuclear weapons, and the technology developed to the progressively longer ranges, eventually becoming intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union showed the world that they had missiles able to reach any part of the world when they launched the Sputnik satellite into Earth orbit. The United States launched its first satellite Explorer 1 on January 31, 1958.\\r\\nMeanwhile, submarine-launched ballistic missiles were also developed. By the 1960s, the \\"triad\\" of nuclear weapon delivery was established, with each side deploying bombers, ICBMs, and SLBMs, in order to insure that even if a defense was found against one delivery method, the other methods would still be available.\\r\\nSome in the United States during the early 1960s pointed out that although all of the individual components of nuclear missiles had been tested separately (warheads, navigation systems, rockets), it was infeasible to test them all combined. Critics charged that it was not really known how a warhead would react to the gravity forces and temperature differences encountered in the upper atmosphere and outer space, and Kennedy was unwilling to run a test of an ICBM with a live warhead. The closest thing to an actual test was 1962's Operation Frigate Bird, in which the submarine USS?Ethan Allen?(SSBN-608) launched a Polaris A2 missile over 1,000 miles to the nuclear test site at Christmas Island. It was challenged by, among others, Curtis LeMay, who put missile accuracy into doubt to encourage the development of new bombers. Other critics pointed out that it was a single test which could be an anomaly; that it was a lower-altitude SLBM and therefore was subject to different conditions than an ICBM; and that significant modifications had been made to its warhead before testing.\\r\\nBy the 1950s both the United States and Soviet Union had enough nuclear power to obliterate[clarification needed] the other side. Both sides developed a capability to launch a devastating attack even after sustaining a full assault from the other side (especially by means of submarines), called a second strike.[19] This policy became known as Mutual Assured Destruction: both sides knew that any attack upon the other would be devastating to themselves, thus in theory restraining them from attacking the other.\\r\\nBoth Soviet and American experts hoped to use nuclear weapons for extracting concessions from the other, or from other powers such as China, but the risk connected with using these weapons was so grave that they refrained from what John Foster Dulles referred to as brinkmanship. While some, like General Douglas MacArthur, argued nuclear weapons should be used during the Korean War, both Truman and Eisenhower opposed the idea.[citation needed]\\r\\nBoth sides were unaware of the details of the capacity of the enemy's arsenal of nuclear weapons. The Americans suffered from a lack of confidence, and in the 1950s they believed in a non-existing bomber gap. Aerial photography later revealed that the Soviets had been playing a sort of Potemkin village game with their bombers in their military parades, flying them in large circles, making it appear they had far more than they truly did. The 1960 American presidential election saw accusations of a wholly spurious missile gap between the Soviets and the Americans. On the other side, the Soviet government exaggerated the power of Soviet weapons to the leadership and Nikita Khrushchev.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn addition to the United States and the Soviet Union, three other nations, the United Kingdom,[20] People's Republic of China,[21] and France[22] developed nuclear weapons during the early cold war years.\\r\\nIn 1952, the United Kingdom became the third nation to possess nuclear weapons when it detonated an atomic bomb in Operation Hurricane[23] on October 3, 1952, which had a yield of 25 kilotons. Despite major contributions to the Manhattan Project by both Canadian and British governments, the U.S. Congress passed the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, which prohibited multi-national cooperation on nuclear projects. The McMahon Act fueled resentment from British scientists and Winston Churchill, as they believed that there were agreements regarding post-war sharing of nuclear technology, and led to Britain developing its own nuclear weapons. Britain did not begin planning the development of their own nuclear weapon until January 1947. Because of Britains small size, they decided to test their bomb on the Monte Bello Islands, off the coast of Australia. Following this successful test, under the leadership of Churchill, Britain decided to develop and test a hydrogen bomb. The first successful hydrogen bomb test occurred on November 8, 1957, which had a yield of 1.8 megatons.[24] An amendment to the Atomic Energy Act in 1958 allowed nuclear cooperation once again, and British-U.S. nuclear programs resumed. During the Cold War, British nuclear deterrence came from submarines and nuclear-armed aircraft. The Resolution class ballistic missile submarines armed with the American-built Polaris missile provided the sea deterrent, while aircraft such as the Avro Vulcan, SEPECAT Jaguar, Panavia Tornado and several other Royal Air Force strike aircraft carrying WE.177 gravity bomb provided the air deterrent.\\r\\nFrance became the fourth nation to possess nuclear weapons on February 13, 1960, when the atomic bomb \\"Gerboise Bleue\\" was detonated in Algeria,[25] then still a French colony [Formally a part of the Metropolitan France.] France began making plans for a nuclear-weapons program shortly after the Second World War, but the program did not actually begin until the late 1950s. Eight years later, France conducted its first thermonuclear test above Fangatuafa Atoll. It had a yield of 2.6 megatons.[26] This bomb significantly contaminated the atoll with radiation for six years, making it off-limits to humans. During the Cold War, the French nuclear deterrent was centered around the Force de frappe, a nuclear triad consisting of Dassault Mirage IV bombers carrying such nuclear weapons as the AN-22 gravity bomb and the ASMP stand-off attack missile, Pluton and Hades ballistic missiles, and the Redoutable class submarine armed with strategic nuclear missiles.\\r\\nThe People's Republic of China became the fifth nuclear power on October 16, 1964 when it detonated a 25 kiloton uranium-235 bomb in a test codenamed 596[27] at Lop Nur. In the late 1950s, China began developing nuclear weapons with substantial Soviet assistance in exchange for uranium ore. However, the Sino-Soviet ideological split in the late 1950s developed problems between China and the Soviet Union. This caused the Soviets to cease helping China develop nuclear weapons. However, China continued developing nuclear weapons without Soviet support and made remarkable progress in the 1960s.[28] Due to Soviet/Chinese tensions, the Chinese might have used nuclear weapons against either the United States or the Soviet Union in the event of a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.[citation needed] During the Cold War, the Chinese nuclear deterrent consisted of gravity bombs carried aboard H-6 bomber aircraft, missile systems such as the DF-2, DF-3, and DF-4,[29] and in the later stages of the Cold War, the Type 092 ballistic missile submarine. On June 14, 1967, China detonated its first hydrogen bomb.\\r\\nOn January 1, 1959, the Cuban government fell to communist revolutionaries, propelling Fidel Castro into power. The Soviet Union supported and praised Castro and his resistance, and the new government was recognized by the Soviet government on January 10. When the United States began boycotting Cuban sugar, the Soviet Union began purchasing large quantities to support the Cuban economy in return for fuel and eventually placing nuclear ballistic missiles on Cuban soil. These missiles would be capable of reaching the United States very quickly. On October 14, 1962, an American spy plane discovered these nuclear missile sites under construction in Cuba.[30]\\r\\nPresident Kennedy immediately called a series of meetings for a small group of senior officials to debate the crisis. The group was split between a militaristic solution and a diplomatic one. President Kennedy ordered a naval blockage around Cuba and all military forces to DEFCON 3. As tensions increased, Kennedy eventually ordered U.S. military forces to DEFCON 2. This was the closest the world has been to a nuclear war. While the U.S. military had been ordered to DEFCON 2, reaching a nuclear war was still a ways off. The theory of mutually assured destruction seems to put the entry into nuclear war an unlikely possibility. While the public perceived the Cuban Missile Crisis as a time of near mass destruction, the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union were working behind the sight of the public eye in order to come to a peaceful conclusion. Premier Khrushchev writes to President Kennedy in a telegram on October 26, 1962 saying that, \\"Consequently, if there is no intention to tighten that knot and thereby to doom the world to the catastrophe of thermonuclear war, then let us not only relax the forces pulling on the ends of the rope, let us take measures to untie that knot.\\"[31] It is apparently clear that both men wanted to avoid nuclear war due to mutually assured destruction which leads to the question of just how close the world was from experiencing a nuclear war.\\r\\nEventually, on October 28, through much discussion between U.S and Soviet officials, Khrushchev announced that the Soviet Union would withdraw all missiles from Cuba. Shortly after, the U.S. withdrew all their nuclear missiles from Turkey in secret, which had threatened the Soviets. The U.S.'s withdrawal of their Jupiter Missiles from Turkey was kept private for decades after, causing the negotiations between the two nations to appear to the world as a major U.S. victory. This ultimately led to the downfall of Premier Khrushchev.\\r\\nBy the 1970s, with the cold war entering its 30th year with no direct conflict between the superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union entered a period of reduced conflict, in which the two powers engaged in trade and exchanges with each other. This period known as dtente. This period included negotiation of a number of arms control agreements, building with the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in the 1950s, but with significant new treaties negotiated in the 1970s. These treaties were only partially successful. Although both states continued to hold massive numbers of nuclear weapons and research more effective technology, the growth in number of warheads was first limited, and later, with the START I, reversed.\\r\\nIn 1958, both the U.S. and Soviet Union agreed to informally suspend nuclear testing. However, this agreement was ended when the Soviets resumed testing in 1961, followed by a series of nuclear tests conducted by the U.S. These events led to much political fallout, as well as the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Something had to be done to ease the great tensions between these two countries, so on October 10, 1963, the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT) was signed.[32] This was an agreement between the U.S., the Soviet Union, and the U.K., which significantly restricted nuclear testing. All atmospheric, underwater, and outer space nuclear testing were agreed to be halted, but testing was still allowed underground. An additional 113 countries have signed this treaty since 1963.\\r\\nSALT I and SALT II limited the size of the states' arsenals. Bans on nuclear testing, anti-ballistic missile systems, and weapons in space all attempted to limit the expansion of the arms race through the Partial Test Ban Treaty.\\r\\nIn November, 1969, Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) begun. This was primarily due to the economic impact that nuclear testing and production had on both U.S. and Soviet economies. The SALT I Treaty, which was signed in May, 1972, produced an agreement on two significant documents. These were the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty) and the Interim Agreement on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms.[33] The ABM treaty limited each country to two ABM sites, while the Interim Agreement froze each country's number of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) at current levels for five years. This treaty significantly reduced nuclear-related costs as well as the risk of nuclear war. However, SALT I failed to address how many nuclear warheads could be placed on one missile. A new technology, known as multiple-independently targetable re-entry vehicle (MIRV), allowed single missiles to hold and launch multiple nuclear missiles at targets while in mid-air. Over the next 10 years, the Soviet Union and U.S added 12,000 nuclear warheads to their already built arsenals.\\r\\nThroughout the 1970s, both the Soviet Union and United States replaced old missiles and warheads with newer, more powerful and effective ones. This continued to worsen Soviet-U.S relations. On June 18, 1979, the SALT II treaty was signed in Vienna. This treaty limited both sides' nuclear arsenals and technology. However, this treaty as well as the era of the dtente ended with the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in January, 1980.[34] The United States once again significantly increased military and nuclear spending, while the Soviets were unable to respond and continued to pursue the dtente.\\r\\nIn 1991, the START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) was negotiated between the U. S. and the Soviet Union, to reduce the number and limit the capabilities of limitation of strategic offensive arms. This was eventually succeeded by the START II, START III, and New START treaties.\\r\\nDespite dtente, both sides continued to develop and introduce more accurate weapons and weapons with more warheads (\\"MIRVs\\"). The presidency of Ronald Reagan proposed a missile defense programmed tagged the Strategic Defense Initiative, a space based anti-ballistic missile system derided as \\"Star Wars\\" by its critics; simultaneously, missile defense was also being researched in the Soviet Union. However, the SDI would require technology that had not yet been developed, or even researched. This system proposed both space- and earth-based laser battle stations. It would also need sensors on the ground, in the air, and in space with radar, optical, and infrared technology to detect incoming missiles.[35] Simultaneously, however, Reagan initiated negotiations with Mikhail Gorbachev ultimately resulting in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty on reducing nuclear stockpiles.\\r\\nDue to high costs and complex technology for its time, the scope of the SDI project was reduced from defense against a massive attack to a system for defending against limited attacks, transitioning into the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.\\r\\nDuring the mid-1980s, the U.S-Soviet relations significantly improved, Mikhail Gorbachev assumed control of the Soviet Union after the deaths of several former Soviet leaders, and announced a new era of perestroika and glasnost, meaning restructuring and openness respectively. Gorbachev proposed a 50% reduction of nuclear weapons for both the U.S and Soviet Union at the meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland in October 1986. However, the proposal was refused due to disagreements over Reagan's SDI. Instead, the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty was signed on December 8, 1987 in Washington, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons.[36]\\r\\nDue to the dramatic economic and social changes occurring within the Soviet Union, many of its constituent republics began to declare their independence. With the wave of revolutions sweeping across Eastern-Europe, the Soviet Union was unable to impose its will on its satellite states and so its sphere of influence slowly diminished. By December 16, 1991, all of the republics had declared independence from the Union. The Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev resigned as the country's President on December 25 and the Soviet Union was declared non-existent the following day.\\r\\nWith the end of the Cold War, the United States and Russia cut down on nuclear weapons spending.[citation needed] Fewer new systems were developed and both arsenals were reduced; although both countries maintain significant stocks of nuclear missiles. In the United States, stockpile stewardship programs have taken over the role of maintaining the aging arsenal.[37]\\r\\nAfter the Cold War ended, large inventories of nuclear weapons and facilities remained. Some are being recycled, dismantled, or recovered as valuable substances.[citation needed] As a result, a large amount of resources and money which was once spent on developing nuclear weapons in Soviet Union was then spent on repairing the environmental damage produced by the nuclear arms race, and almost all former production sites are now major cleanup sites.[citation needed] In the United States, the plutonium production facility at Hanford, Washington and the plutonium pit fabrication facility at Rocky Flats, Colorado are among the most polluted sites.[citation needed]\\r\\nMilitary policies and strategies have been modified to reflect the increasing intervals without major confrontation. In 1995, United States policy and strategy regarding nuclear proliferation was outlined in the document \\"Essentials of PostÿCold War Deterrence\\", produced by the Policy Subcommittee of the Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) of the United States Strategic Command.\\r\\nOn April 8, 2010, former U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed the New START Treaty, which called for a fifty percent reduction of strategic nuclear missile launchers and a curtailment of deployed nuclear warheads.[38] The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in December 2010 by a three-quarter majority.\\r\\nOn December 22, 2016, U.S. President Donald Trump proclaimed in a tweet that \\"the United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes,\\"[39] effectively challenging the world to re-engage in a race for nuclear dominance. The next day, Trump reiterated his position to Morning Joe host Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC, stating: \\"Let it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all.\\"[40]\\r\\nIn South Asia, India and Pakistan have also engaged in a technological nuclear arms race since the 1970s. The nuclear competition started in 1974 with India detonating the device, codename Smiling Buddha, at the Pokhran region of the Rajasthan state.[41] The Indian government termed this test as a \\"peaceful nuclear explosion\\", but according to independent sources, it was actually part of an accelerated covert nuclear program of India.[42]\\r\\nThis test generated great concern and doubts in Pakistan, with fear it would be at the mercy of its longÿtime arch rival. Pakistan had its own covert atomic bomb projects in 1972 which extended over many years since the first Indian weapon was detonated. After the 1974 test, Pakistan's atomic bomb program picked up a great speed and accelerated its atomic project to successfully build its own atomic weapons program. In the last few decades of the 20th century, India and Pakistan began to develop nuclear-capable rockets and nuclear military technologies. Finally, in 1998 India, under Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, test detonated 5 more nuclear weapons. While the international response to the detonation was muted,[citation needed] domestic pressure within Pakistan began to build steam and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ordered the test, detonated 6 nuclear war weapons (Chagai-I and Chagai-II) in a tit-for-tat fashion and to act as a deterrent.\\r\\nFrom the beginning of the Cold War, The United States, Russia, and other nations have all attempted to develop Anti-ballistic missiles. The United States developed the LIM-49 Nike Zeus in the 1950s in order to destroy incoming ICBMs.\\r\\nRussia has, too, developed ABM missiles in the form of the A-35 anti-ballistic missile system and the later A-135 anti-ballistic missile system. Chinese state media has also announced to have tested anti-ballistic missiles,[43] though specific information is not public.\\r\\nIndia has successfully developed its Ballistic Missile Shield in the programme Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme with the test fire of Prithvi Air Defense (PAD) and it has also developed a cruise missile defense Akash Air Defense (AAD)[44] to intercept low flying missiles making India one of the five countries with Missile Shield.

Saloons served customers such as fur trappers, cowboys, soldiers, lumberjacks, businessmen, lawmen, miners and gamblers. A saloon might also be known as a \\"watering trough, bughouse, shebang, cantina, grogshop, and gin mill\\". The first saloon was established at Brown's Hole, Wyoming, in 1822, to serve fur trappers.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the late 1850s the term saloon had begun to appear in directories and common usage as a term for an establishment that specialized in beer and liquor sales by the drink, with food and lodging as secondary concerns in some places.[2] By 1880, the growth of saloons was in full swing. In Leavenworth, Kansas, there were \\"about 150 saloons and four wholesale liquor houses\\".[3] Some saloons in the Old West were little more than gambling houses, brothels, and opium dens.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaloons in the U.S. began to have a close association with breweries in the early 1880s. With a growing overcapacity, breweries began to adopt the British tied-house system of control where they owned saloons outright. Brewers purchased hundreds of storefronts, especially on the highly desired corner locations, which they rented to prospective saloon keepers, along with furnishings and recreational equipment such as billiard tables and bowling alleys. Schlitz Brewing Company and a few others built elaborate saloons to attract customers and advertise their beers.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nLegislative factors also played a factor in the growth of brewery owned saloons. The Chicago City Council increased the saloon license from $50 to $500 between 1883 and 1885 to pay for an expanded police force made necessary by the barrooms. Relatively few independent proprietors could afford to pay such amounts.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoliticians also frequented local saloons because of the adaptable social nature of their business. In neighborhoods where literacy was low, the bar provided the principal place for the exchange of information about employment and housing. A savvy politician could turn his access to resources into votes. In factory districts, saloons became labor exchanges and union halls, as well as providing a place to cash paychecks.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 1893, the Anti-Saloon League began protesting against American saloons. In 1895 it became a national organization and quickly rose to become the most powerful prohibition lobby in America, pushing aside its older competitors the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the Prohibition Party. The League lobbied at all levels of government for legislation to prohibit the manufacture or import of spirits, beer and wine. Ministers had launched several efforts to close Arizona saloons after the 1906 creation of League chapters in Yuma, Tucson, and Phoenix. League members pressured local police to take licenses from establishments that violated closing hours or served women and minors, and they provided witnesses to testify about these violations. Its triumph was nationwide prohibition locked into the Constitution with passage of the 18th Amendment in 1920. It was decisively defeated when prohibition was repealed in 1933.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe traditional saloon was declining many years before Prohibition. The automobile took patronage away from the pedestrian institution. Nickelodeons also competed for the entertainment niche. An increasing numbers of employers demanded abstinence during the workday. City health departments also enacted regulations that eliminated many features of the free lunch table. Finally, World War I brought not only an attack on anything that seemed remotely German but also a temporary ban on brewing.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe free lunch was a sales enticement which offered a meal at no cost in order to attract customers and increase revenues from other offerings. It was a tradition once common in saloons in many places in the United States, with the phrase appearing in U.S. literature from about 1870 to the 1920s. These establishments included a \\"free\\" lunch, varying from rudimentary to quite elaborate, with the purchase of at least one drink. These free lunches were typically worth far more than the price of a single drink.[4] The saloon-keeper relied on the expectation that most customers would buy more than one drink, and that the practice would build patronage for other times of day.\\r\\n\\r\\nA saloon's appearance varied from when and where it grew. As towns grew, the saloons became more refined. The bartender prided himself on his appearance and his drink pouring abilities. Early saloons and those in remote locations were often crude affairs with minimal furniture and few decorations. A single wood-burning stove might warm such establishments during the winter months.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pair of \\"batwing\\" doors at the entrance was one of the more distinctive features of the typical saloon. The doors operated on double action hinges and extended from chest to knee level.[5] Further in the American West, some sold liquor from wagons, and saloons were often formed of materials at hand, including \\"sod houses. . . . a hull of an old sailing ship\\" or interiors \\"dug into the side of a hill\\". As the size of towns grew, many hotels included saloons, and some stand-alone saloons, such as the Barlow Trail Saloon in Damascus, Oregon, featured a railed porch.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaloons' appearance varied by ethnic group. The Irish preferred stand-up bars where whiskey was the drink of choice and women could obtain service only through the back door. German saloons were more brightly illuminated, more likely to serve restaurant food and beer at tables, and more oriented toward family patronage. Germans were often at odds with Temperance forces over Sunday operation and over the operation of beer gardens in outlying neighborhoods. Other ethnic groups added their own features and their unique cuisines on the sideboard, while a few groups, most notably Scandinavians, Jews, Greeks, and Italians, either preferred intimate social clubs or did little drinking in public.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy way of entertainment saloons offered dancing girls, some (or most) of whom occasionally or routinely doubled as prostitutes. Many saloons offered games of chance like Faro, poker, brag, three-card monte, and dice games. Other games were added as saloons continued to prosper and face increasing competition. These additional games included billiards, darts, and bowling. Some saloons even included piano players, can-can girls, and theatrical skits.  A current example of this type of entertainment is the Long Branch Variety Show that is presented in the recreated Long Branch Saloon in Dodge City, Kansas.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a town was first founded, the initial saloons were often nothing more than tents or shacks that served homemade whiskey that included such ingredients as \\"raw alcohol, burnt sugar and chewing tobacco\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nTo stretch their profits, saloon owners would cut good whiskey with turpentine, ammonia, gunpowder or cayenne. Their custom product was called by names like \\"Tanglefoot, Forty-Rod, Tarantula Juice, Taos Lightning, Red Eye, and Coffin Varnish.\\" Other offerings included Cactus Wine, made from a mix of tequila and peyote tea, and Mule Skinner, made with whiskey and blackberry liquor. A saloon might also be known as a \\"watering trough, bughouse, shebang, cantina, grogshop, and gin mill\\".[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs towns grew, saloons were often elaborately decorated, featured Bohemian stemware, and oil paintings were hung from the wall. The hard liquor was improved, often featuring whiskey imported from the Eastern United States and Europe. To avoid rotgut, patrons would request \\"fancy\\" mixed drinks. Some of the top ten drinks in 1881 included claret sangarees and champagne flips.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeer was often served at room temperature since refrigeration was mostly unavailable. Adolphus Busch introduced refrigeration and pasteurization of beer in 1880 with his Budweiser brand.[1] Some saloons kept the beer in kegs stored on racks inside the saloon.[7] Some saloons made their own beer. Sometimes the beer was also kept in chairs, as we can see in the movie 'Fort Apache'.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the more familiar saloons were First Chance Saloon in Miles City, Montana; the Bull's Head in Abilene, Kansas; the Arcade Saloon in Eldora, Colorado; the Holy Moses in Creede, Colorado; the Long Branch Saloon in Dodge City, Kansas; the Birdcage Theater in Tombstone, Arizona; the Bucket of Blood Saloon in Virginia City, Nevada; and the Jersey Lilly in Langtry, Texas. Many of these establishments remained open twenty-four hours a day, six days a week except Sundays and Christmas.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the anecdotes of the American West, several notable events took place in or outside saloons. One such incident occurred at the Bull's Head in Abilene, Kansas. When the tavern's owner, Phil Coe, outraged the townspeople by painting a bull, complete with an erect penis, or pizzle, on the outside wall of his tavern, Wild Bill Hickok, the marshal at the time, threatened to burn the saloon to the ground if the offending animal was not painted over. Instead, he hired some men to do the job, which angered Coe. The two became enemies and in a later altercation, Wild Bill Hickok killed Coe.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nWild Bill, also a professional lawman, gunfighter, and gambler, was later killed on August 2, 1876 by Jack McCall, who shot him in the back of the head, in Saloon No. 10, in Deadwood, South Dakota as Wild Bill was playing cards. His handaces and eights, according to traditionhas become known as the \\"dead man's hand\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer lawman, faro dealer, and gambler Wyatt Earp worked in or owned several saloons during his lifetime, outright or in partnership with others. He and two of his brothers arrived in Tombstone, Arizona on December 1, 1879 and during January 1881, Oriental Saloon owner Lou Rickabaugh gave Wyatt Earp a one-quarter interest in the faro concession at the Oriental Saloon in exchange for his services as a manager and enforcer.[9]:41 Wyatt invited his friend, lawman and gambler Bat Masterson, to Tombstone to help him run the faro tables in the Oriental Saloon. In 1884, after leaving Tombstone, Wyatt and his wife Josie, Warren, James and Bessie Earp went to Eagle City, Idaho, another boom town.[10] Wyatt was looking for gold in the Murray-Eagle mining district. They opened a saloon called The White Elephant in a circus tent.  An advertisement in a local newspaper suggested gentlemen \\"come and see the elephant\\".[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1885, Earp and Josie moved to San Diego where the railroad was about to arrive and a real estate boom was underway. They stayed for about four years. Earp speculated in San Diego's booming real estate market.[12] Between 1887 and around 1896 he bought three saloons and gambling halls, one on Fourth Street and the other two near Sixth and E, all in the \\"respectable\\" part of town.[12][13][14] They offered twenty-one games including faro, blackjack, poker, keno, and other Victorian games of chance like pedro and monte.[12]  At the height of the boom, he made up to $1,000 a night in profit.[15] Wyatt particularly favored and may have run the Oyster Bar located in the Louis Bank of Commerce on Fifth Avenue.[9]:71\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fall of 1897, Earp and Josie joined in the Alaska Gold Rush and headed for Nome, Alaska. He operated a canteen during the summer of 1899 and in September, Earp and partner Charles Ellsworth Hoxie built the Dexter Saloon in Nome, Alaska, the city's first two story wooden building and its  largest and most luxurious saloon. The building was used for a variety of purposes because it was so large: 70 by 30 feet (21.3?m G?9.1?m) with 12 feet (3.7?m) ceilings.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nWyatt and Josie returned to California in 1901 with an estimated $80,000. In February 1902, they arrived in Tonopah, Nevada, where gold had been discovered and a boom was under way.  He opened the Northern Saloon in Tonopah, Nevada and served as a deputy U.S. Marshal under Marshal J.F. Emmitt.[17]  His saloon, gambling and mining interests were profitable for a period.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Alpine Inn, formerly Rossotti's Saloon, in Portola Valley, California.

The conference name is also commonly used to refer to those eight schools as a group beyond the sports context.[2] The eight institutions are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University. The term Ivy League has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism.\\r\\nWhile the term was in use as early as 1933, it became official only after the formation of the NCAA Division?I athletic conference in 1954.[3] Seven of the eight schools were founded during the United States colonial period; Cornell was founded in 1865. Ivy League institutions account for seven of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution; the other two are Rutgers University and the College of William & Mary.\\r\\nIvy League schools are generally viewed as some of the most prestigious, and are ranked among the best universities worldwide by U.S. News & World Report.[4] All eight universities place in the top fifteen of the U.S. News & World Report 2017 nation university rankings, including the top four schools and five of the top eight.[5] U.S. News has named a member of the Ivy League as the best national university in each of the past seventeen years ending with the 2017 rankings: Princeton ten times, Harvard twice, and the two schools tied for first five times.\\r\\nUndergraduate enrollments range from about 4,000 to 14,000,[6] making them larger than those of a typical private liberal arts college and smaller than a typical public state university. Total enrollments, including graduate students, range from approximately 6,400 at Dartmouth to over 20,000 at Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, and Penn. Ivy League financial endowments range from Brown's $3.2 billion to Harvard's $36.4 billion,[7] the largest financial endowment of any academic institution in the world.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIvy League universities have some of the largest university financial endowments in the world, which allows the universities to provide many resources for their academic programs and research endeavors. As of 2014, Harvard University has an endowment of $36.4 billion.[9] Additionally, each university receives millions of dollars in research grants and other subsidies from federal and state governments.\\r\\nStudents have long revered the ivied walls of older colleges. \\"Planting the ivy\\" was a customary class day ceremony at many colleges in the 1800s. In 1893 an alumnus told The Harvard Crimson, \\"In 1850, class day was placed upon the University Calendar.... the custom of planting the ivy, while the ivy oration was delivered, arose about this time.\\"[30] At Penn, graduating seniors started the custom of planting ivy at a university building each spring in 1873 and that practice was formally designated as \\"Ivy Day\\" in 1874.[31] Ivy planting ceremonies are reported for Yale,[32] Simmons,[33] Bryn Mawr[34] and many others. Princeton's \\"Ivy Club\\" was founded in 1879.[35]\\r\\nThe first usage of Ivy in reference to a group of colleges is from sportswriter Stanley Woodward (1895ÿ1965).\\r\\nA proportion of our eastern ivy colleges are meeting little fellows another Saturday before plunging into the strife and the turmoil.\\r\\nThe first known instance of the term Ivy League being used appeared in The Christian Science Monitor on February 7, 1935.[3][37][38] Several sportswriters and other journalists used the term shortly later to refer to the older colleges, those along the northeastern seaboard of the United States, chiefly the nine institutions with origins dating from the colonial era, together with the United States Military Academy (West Point), the United States Naval Academy, and a few others. These schools were known for their long-standing traditions in intercollegiate athletics, often being the first schools to participate in such activities. However, at this time, none of these institutions made efforts to form an athletic league.\\r\\nA common folk etymology attributes the name to the Roman numeral for four (IV), asserting that there was such a sports league originally with four members. The Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins helped to perpetuate this belief. The supposed \\"IV League\\" was formed over a century ago and consisted of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and a fourth school that varies depending on who is telling the story.[39][40][41] However, it is clear that Harvard, Princeton, Yale and Columbia met on November 23, 1876 at the so-called Massasoit Convention to decide on uniform rules for the emerging game of American football, which rapidly spread.[42]\\r\\nSeven out of the eight Ivy League schools were founded before the American Revolution; Cornell was founded just after the American Civil War. These seven were the primary colleges in the Northern and Middle Colonies, and their early faculties and founding boards were largely, therefore, drawn from other Ivy League institutions. There were also some British graduates from the University of Cambridge, the University of Oxford, the University of St. Andrews, the University of Edinburgh, and elsewhere on their boards. Similarly, the founder of The College of William & Mary, in 1693, was a British graduate of the University of Edinburgh. Cornell provided Stanford University with its first president.\\r\\nThe influence of these institutions on the founding of other colleges and universities is notable. This included the Southern public college movement which blossomed in the decades surrounding the turn of the 19th century when Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia established what became the flagship universities for each of these states. In 1801, a majority of the first board of trustees for what became the University of South Carolina were Princeton alumni. They appointed Jonathan Maxcy, a Brown graduate, as the university's first president. Thomas Cooper, an Oxford alumnus and University of Pennsylvania faculty member, became the second president of the South Carolina college. The founders of the University of California came from Yale, hence the school colors of University of California are Yale Blue and California Gold.[43]\\r\\nSome of the Ivy League schools have identifiable Protestant roots, while others were founded as non-sectarian schools. Church of England King's College broke up during the Revolution and was reformed as public nonsectarian Columbia College. In the early nineteenth century, the specific purpose of training Calvinist ministers was handed off to theological seminaries, but a denominational tone and such relics as compulsory chapel often lasted well into the twentieth century. Penn and Brown were officially founded as nonsectarian schools. Brown's charter promised no religious tests and \\"full liberty of conscience\\", but placed control in the hands of a board of twenty-two Baptists, five Quakers, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians. Cornell has been strongly nonsectarian from its founding.\\r\\n\\"Ivy League\\" is sometimes used as a way of referring to an elite class, even though institutions such as Cornell University were among the first in the United States to reject racial and gender discrimination in their admissions policies. This dates back to at least 1935.[44] Novels[45] and memoirs[46] attest this sense, as a social elite; to some degree independent of the actual schools.\\r\\nAfter the Second World War, the present Ivy League institutions slowly widened their selection of their students. They had always had distinguished faculties; some of the first Americans with doctorates had taught for them; but they now decided that they could not both be world-class research institutions and be competitive in the highest ranks of American college sport; in addition, the schools experienced the scandals of any other big-time football programs, although more quietly.[47]\\r\\nThe first formal athletic league involving eventual Ivy League schools (or any US colleges, for that matter) was created in 1870 with the formation of the Rowing Association of American Colleges. The RAAC hosted a de facto national championship in rowing during the period 1870ÿ1894. In 1895, Cornell, Columbia, and Penn founded the Intercollegiate Rowing Association, which remains the oldest collegiate athletic organizing body in the US. To this day, the IRA Championship Regatta determines the national champion in rowing and all of the Ivies are regularly invited to compete.\\r\\nA basketball league was later created in 1902, when Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Yale and Princeton formed the Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League; they were later joined by Penn and Dartmouth.\\r\\nIn 1906, the organization that eventually became the National Collegiate Athletic Association was formed, primarily to formalize rules for the emerging sport of football. But of the 39 original member colleges in the NCAA, only two of them (Dartmouth and Penn) later became Ivies.\\r\\nIn February 1903, intercollegiate wrestling began when Yale accepted a challenge from Columbia, published in the Yale News. The dual meet took place prior to a basketball game hosted by Columbia and resulted in a tie. Two years later, Penn and Princeton also added wrestling teams, leading to the formation of the student-run Intercollegiate Wrestling Association, now the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association (EIWA), the first and oldest collegiate wrestling league in the US.[49]\\r\\nIn 1930, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Penn, Princeton and Yale formed the Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League; they were later joined by Harvard, Brown, Army and Navy.\\r\\nBefore the formal establishment of the Ivy League, there was an \\"unwritten and unspoken agreement among certain Eastern colleges on athletic relations\\". The earliest reference to the \\"Ivy colleges\\" came in 1933, when Stanley Woodward of the New York Herald Tribune used it to refer to the eight current members plus Army.[3] In 1935, the Associated Press reported on an example of collaboration between the schools:\\r\\nThe athletic authorities of the so-called \\"Ivy League\\" are considering drastic measures to curb the increasing tendency toward riotous attacks on goal posts and other encroachments by spectators on playing fields.\\r\\nDespite such collaboration, the universities did not seem to consider the formation of the league as imminent. Romeyn Berry, Cornell's manager of athletics, reported the situation in January 1936 as follows:\\r\\nI can say with certainty that in the last five yearsand markedly in the last three monthsthere has been a strong drift among the eight or ten universities of the East which see a good deal of one another in sport toward a closer bond of confidence and cooperation and toward the formation of a common front against the threat of a breakdown in the ideals of amateur sport in the interests of supposed expediency.\\r\\nPlease do not regard that statement as implying the organization of an Eastern conference or even a poetic \\"Ivy League\\". That sort of thing does not seem to be in the cards at the moment.[51]\\r\\nWithin a year of this statement and having held month-long discussions about the proposal, on December 3, 1936, the idea of \\"the formation of an Ivy League\\" gained enough traction among the undergraduate bodies of the universities that the Columbia Daily Spectator, The Cornell Daily Sun, The Dartmouth, The Harvard Crimson, The Daily Pennsylvanian, The Daily Princetonian and the Yale Daily News would simultaneously run an editorial entitled \\"Now Is the Time\\", encouraging the seven universities to form the league in an effort to preserve the ideals of athletics.[52] Part of the editorial read as follows:\\r\\nThe Ivy League exists already in the minds of a good many of those connected with football, and we fail to see why the seven schools concerned should be satisfied to let it exist as a purely nebulous entity where there are so many practical benefits which would be possible under definite organized association. The seven colleges involved fall naturally together by reason of their common interests and similar general standards and by dint of their established national reputation they are in a particularly advantageous position to assume leadership for the preservation of the ideals of intercollegiate athletics.[53]\\r\\nThe Ivies have been competing in sports as long as intercollegiate sports have existed in the United States. Rowing teams from Harvard and Yale met in the first sporting event held between students of two U.S. colleges on Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire, on August 3, 1852. Harvard's team, \\"The Oneida\\", won the race and was presented with trophy black walnut oars from then presidential nominee General Franklin Pierce. The proposal did not succeedon January 11, 1937, the athletic authorities at the schools rejected the \\"possibility of a heptagonal league in football such as these institutions maintain in basketball, baseball and track.\\" However, they noted that the league \\"has such promising possibilities that it may not be dismissed and must be the subject of further consideration.\\"[54]\\r\\nIn 1945 the presidents of the eight schools signed the first Ivy Group Agreement, which set academic, financial, and athletic standards for the football teams. The principles established reiterated those put forward in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Presidents' Agreement of 1916. The Ivy Group Agreement established the core tenet that an applicant's ability to play on a team would not influence admissions decisions:\\r\\nThe members of the Group reaffirm their prohibition of athletic scholarships. Athletes shall be admitted as students and awarded financial aid only on the basis of the same academic standards and economic need as are applied to all other students.[55]\\r\\nIn 1954, the presidents extended the Ivy Group Agreement to all intercollegiate sports, effective with the 1955ÿ56 basketball season. This is generally reckoned as the formal formation of the Ivy League. As part of the transition, Brown, the only Ivy that hadn't joined the EIBL, did so for the 1954ÿ55 season. A year later, the Ivy League absorbed the EIBL. The Ivy League claims the EIBL's history as its own. Through the EIBL, it is the oldest basketball conference in Division I.[56][57]\\r\\nAs late as the 1960s many of the Ivy League universities' undergraduate programs remained open only to men, with Cornell the only one to have been coeducational from its founding (1865) and Columbia being the last (1983) to become coeducational. Before they became coeducational, many of the Ivy schools maintained extensive social ties with nearby Seven Sisters women's colleges, including weekend visits, dances and parties inviting Ivy and Seven Sisters students to mingle. This was the case not only at Barnard College and Radcliffe College, which are adjacent to Columbia and Harvard, but at more distant institutions as well. The movie Animal House includes a satiric version of the formerly common visits by Dartmouth men to Massachusetts to meet Smith and Mount Holyoke women, a drive of more than two hours. As noted by Irene Harwarth, Mindi Maline, and Elizabeth DeBra, \\"The 'Seven Sisters' was the name given to Barnard, Smith, Mount Holyoke, Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, and Radcliffe, because of their parallel to the Ivy League mens colleges.\\"[58]\\r\\nIn 1982 the Ivy League considered adding two members, with Army, Navy, and Northwestern as the most likely candidates; if it had done so, the league could probably have avoided being moved into the recently created Division I-AA (now Division I FCS) for football.[59] In 1983, following the admission of women to Columbia College, Columbia University and Barnard College entered into an athletic consortium agreement by which students from both schools compete together on Columbia University women's athletic teams, which replaced the women's teams previously sponsored by Barnard.\\r\\nWhen Army and Navy departed the Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League in 1992, all intercollegiate competition involving the eight schools became united under the Ivy League banner.\\r\\nThe Ivy League schools are highly selective, with acceptance rates since 2000 ranging from 6 to 16 percent at each of the universities. Admitted students come from around the world, although students from New England and the Northeastern United States make up a significant proportion of students.[69][70][71]\\r\\nMembers of the League have been highly ranked by various university rankings.\\r\\nFurther, Ivy League members have produced many Nobel laureates, winners of the Nobel Prize and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. According to the Nobel Foundation's website, as of 2016 the number of prize-winners affiliated with each Ivy League university at the time of their awards is: Brown, 2; Columbia, 17; Cornell, 8; Dartmouth, 0; Harvard, 36; Penn, 4; Princeton, 14; and Yale, 8.[76] In addition, each university self-reports their number of affiliated Nobel laureates, but they use varying definitions for which Nobel winners they claim (for example, alumni, active faculty, former faculty, visiting faculty, adjunct faculty, etc.)\\r\\nCollaboration between the member schools is illustrated by the student-led Ivy Council that meets in the fall and spring of each year, with representatives from every Ivy League school. The governing body of the Ivy League is the Council of Ivy Group Presidents, composed of each university president. During meetings, the presidents often discuss common procedures and initiatives for the universities.\\r\\nDifferent fashion trends and styles have emerged from Ivy League campuses over time, and fashion trends such as Ivy League and Preppy are styles often associated with the Ivy League and its culture.\\r\\nIvy League style is a style of men's dress, popular during the late 1950s, believed to have originated on Ivy League campuses. The clothing stores J. Press and Brooks Brothers represent perhaps the quintessential Ivy League dress manner. The Ivy League style is said to be the predecessor to the preppy style of dress.\\r\\nPreppy fashion started around 1912 to the late 1940s and 1950s as the Ivy League style of dress.[77] J. Press represents the quintessential preppy clothing brand, stemming from the collegiate traditions that shaped the preppy subculture. In the mid-twentieth century J. Press and Brooks Brothers, both being pioneers in preppy fashion, had stores on Ivy League school campuses, including Harvard, Princeton, and Yale.\\r\\nSome typical preppy styles also reflect traditional upper class New England leisure activities, such as equestrian, sailing or yachting, hunting, fencing, rowing, lacrosse, tennis, golf, and rugby. Longtime New England outdoor outfitters, such as L.L. Bean,[78] became part of conventional preppy style. This can be seen in sport stripes and colours, equestrian clothing, plaid shirts, field jackets and nautical-themed accessories. Vacationing in Palm Beach, Florida, long popular with the East Coast upper class, led to the emergence of bright colour combinations in leisure wear seen in some brands such as Lilly Pulitzer.[78] By the 1980s, other brands such as Lacoste, Izod[79] and Dooney & Bourke became associated with preppy style.'\\r\\nToday, these styles continue to be popular on Ivy League campuses, throughout the U.S., and abroad, and are oftentimes labeled as \\"Classic American style\\" or \\"Traditional American style\\".[80][81]\\r\\nThe Ivy League is often associated with the upper class White Anglo-Saxon Protestant community of the Northeast, Old Money, or more generally, the American upper middle and upper classes.[82][83][84][85] Although most Ivy League students come from upper middle- and upper-class families, the student body has become increasingly more economically and ethnically diverse. The universities provide significant financial aid to help increase the enrollment of lower income and middle class students.[86] Several reports suggest, however, that the proportion of students from less-affluent families remains low.[87][88]\\r\\nPhrases such as \\"Ivy League snobbery\\"[89] are ubiquitous in nonfiction and fiction writing of the early and mid-twentieth century. A Louis Auchincloss character dreads \\"the aridity of snobbery which he knew infected the Ivy League colleges\\".[45] A business writer, warning in 2001 against discriminatory hiring, presented a cautionary example of an attitude to avoid (the bracketed phrase is his):\\r\\nWe Ivy Leaguers [read: mostly white and Anglo] know that an Ivy League degree is a mark of the kind of person who is likely to succeed in this organization.[90]\\r\\nThe phrase Ivy League historically has been perceived as connected not only with academic excellence, but also with social elitism. In 1936, sportswriter John Kieran noted that student editors at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell, Columbia, Dartmouth, and Penn were advocating the formation of an athletic association. In urging them to consider \\"Army and Navy and Georgetown and Fordham and Syracuse and Brown and Pitt\\" as candidates for membership, he exhorted:\\r\\nIt would be well for the proponents of the Ivy League to make it clear (to themselves especially) that the proposed group would be inclusive but not \\"exclusive\\" as this term is used with a slight up-tilting of the tip of the nose.[91]\\r\\nAspects of Ivy stereotyping were illustrated during the 1988 presidential election, when George H. W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis (graduate of Harvard Law School) for having \\"foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique.\\"[92] New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd asked \\"Wasn't this a case of the pot calling the kettle elite?\\" Bush explained, however, that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was \\"so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it.... Harvard boutique to me has the connotation of liberalism and elitism\\" and said Harvard in his remark was intended to represent \\"a philosophical enclave\\" and not a statement about class.[93] Columnist Russell Baker opined that \\"Voters inclined to loathe and fear elite Ivy League schools rarely make fine distinctions between Yale and Harvard. All they know is that both are full of rich, fancy, stuck-up and possibly dangerous intellectuals who never sit down to supper in their undershirt no matter how hot the weather gets.\\"[94] Still, the last five presidents have all attended Ivy League schools for at least part of their education George H. W. Bush (Yale undergrad), Bill Clinton (Yale Law School), George W. Bush (Yale undergrad, Harvard Business School), Barack Obama (Columbia undergrad, Harvard Law School), and Donald Trump (Penn undergrad).\\r\\nOf the forty-four men who have served as President of the United States, fifteen have graduated from an Ivy League university. Of them, eight have degrees from Harvard, five from Yale, three from Columbia, two from Princeton and one from Penn. Twelve presidents have earned Ivy undergraduate degrees. Three of these were transfer students: Donald Trump transferred from Fordham University, Barack Obama transferred from Occidental College and John F. Kennedy transferred from another Ivy, Princeton, where he had been class of 1939. John Adams was the first president to graduate from college, graduating from Harvard in 1755.\\r\\nStudents of the Ivy League largely hail from the Northeast, largely from the New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia areas. As all eight Ivy League universities are within the Northeast, it is no surprise that most graduates end up working and residing in the Northeast after graduation. An unscientific survey of Harvard seniors from the Class of 2013 found that 42% hailed from the Northeast and 55% overall were planning on working and residing in the Northeast.[99] Boston and New York City are traditionally where many Ivy League graduates end up living.[100][101][102][103]\\r\\nStudents of the Ivy League, both graduate and undergraduate, come primarily from upper middle and upper class families. In recent years, however, the universities have looked towards increasing socioeconomic and class diversity, by providing greater financial aid packages to applicants from lower, working, and middle class American families.[86][104]\\r\\nIn 2013, 46% of Harvard undergraduate students came from families in the top 3.8% of all American households (i.e., over $200,000 annual income).[104] In 2012, the bottom 25% of the American income distribution accounted for only 3ÿ4% of students at Brown, a figure that had remained unchanged since 1992.[105] In 2014, 69% of incoming freshmen students at Yale College came from families with annual incomes of over $120,000, putting most Yale College students in the upper middle and/or upper class. (The median household income in the U.S. in 2013 was $52,700.)[106]\\r\\nIn the 2011ÿ2012 academic year, students qualifying for Pell Grants (federally funded scholarships on the basis of need) comprised 20% at Harvard, 18% at Cornell, 17% at Penn, 16% at Columbia, 15% at Dartmouth and Brown, 14% at Yale, and 12% at Princeton. Nationally, 35% of American university students qualify for a Pell Grant.[107]\\r\\nIvy champions are recognized in sixteen men's and sixteen women's sports. In some sports, Ivy teams actually compete as members of another league, the Ivy championship being decided by isolating the members' records in play against each other; for example, the six league members who participate in ice hockey do so as members of ECAC Hockey, but an Ivy champion is extrapolated each year. The Ivy League was the last Division I basketball conference to institute a conference postseason tournament; the first tournaments for men and women will be held at the end of the 2016ÿ17 season. The tournaments will only award the Ivy League automatic bids for the NCAA Division?I Men's and Women's Basketball Tournaments; the official conference championships will continue to be awarded based solely on regular-season results.[108] Before the 2016ÿ17 season, the automatic bids were based solely on regular-season record, with a one-game playoff (or series of one-game playoffs if more than two teams were tied) held to determine the automatic bid.[109] The Ivy League is one of only two Division I conferences which award their official basketball championships solely on regular-season results; the other is the Southeastern Conference.[110][111] Since its inception, an Ivy League school has yet to win either the men's or women's Division I NCAA Basketball Tournament.\\r\\nOn average, each Ivy school has more than 35 varsity teams. All eight are in the top 20 for number of sports offered for both men and women among Division I schools. Unlike most Division I athletic conferences, the Ivy League prohibits the granting of athletic scholarships; all scholarships awarded are need-based (financial aid).[112] In addition, the Ivies have a rigid policy against redshirting, even for medical reasons; an athlete loses a year of eligibility for every year enrolled at an Ivy institution.[113] Ivy League teams' non-league games are often against the members of the Patriot League, which have similar academic standards and athletic scholarship policies (although unlike the Ivies, the Patriot League allows redshirting).\\r\\nIn the time before recruiting for college sports became dominated by those offering athletic scholarships and lowered academic standards for athletes, the Ivy League was successful in many sports relative to other universities in the country. In particular, Princeton won 26 recognized national championships in college football (last in 1935), and Yale won 18 (last in 1927).[114] Both of these totals are considerably higher than those of other historically strong programs such as Alabama, which has won 15, Notre Dame, which claims 11 but is credited by many sources with 13, and USC, which has won 11. Yale, whose coach Walter Camp was the \\"Father of American Football,\\" held on to its place as the all-time wins leader in college football throughout the entire 20th century, but was finally passed by Michigan on November 10, 2001. Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Penn each have over a dozen former scholar-athletes enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. Currently Dartmouth holds the record for most Ivy League football titles, with 18, followed closely by Harvard and Penn, each with 17 titles. In addition, the Ivy League has produced Super Bowl winners Kevin Boothe (Cornell), two-time Pro Bowler Zak DeOssie (Brown), Sean Morey (Brown), All-Pro selection Matt Birk (Harvard), Calvin Hill (Yale), Derrick Harmon (Cornell) and 1999 \\"Mr. Irrelevant\\" Jim Finn (Penn).\\r\\nBeginning with the 1982 football season, the Ivy League has competed in Division I-AA (renamed FCS in 2006).[115] The Ivy League teams are eligible for the FCS tournament held to determine the national champion, and the league champion is eligible for an automatic bid (and any other team may qualify for an at-large selection) from the NCAA. However, the Ivy League has not played any postseason games at all since 1956 due to the league's concerns about the extended December schedule's effects on academics. For this reason, any Ivy League team invited to the FCS playoffs turns down the bid. The Ivy League plays a strict 10-game schedule, compared to other FCS members' schedules of 11 (or, in some seasons, 12) regular season games, plus post-season, which was most recently expanded in 2013 to five rounds with 24 teams, with a bye week for the top eight teams. Football is the only sport in which the Ivy League declines to compete for a national title.\\r\\nIn addition to varsity football, Penn, Princeton and Cornell also field teams in the eight-team Collegiate Sprint Football League, in which all players must weigh 172 pounds or less. Penn and Princeton are the last remaining founding members of the league from its 1934 debut, and Cornell is the next-oldest, joining in 1937. Yale and Columbia previously fielded teams in the league but no longer do so.\\r\\nThe Ivy League is home to some of the oldest college rugby teams in the United States. Although these teams are not \\"varsity\\" sports, they compete annually in the Ivy Rugby Conference.\\r\\nThe table above includes the number of team championships won from the beginning of official Ivy League competition (1956ÿ57 academic year) through 2011ÿ12. Princeton and Harvard have on occasion won ten or more Ivy League titles in a year, an achievement accomplished six times by Harvard and 21 times by Princeton, including a conference-record 15 championships in 2010ÿ11. Only once has one of the other six schools earned more than eight titles in a single academic year (Cornell with nine in 2005ÿ06). In the 33 academic years beginning 1979ÿ80, Princeton has averaged 11 championships per year, one-third of the conference total of 33 sponsored sports.[117]\\r\\nIn the seven academic years beginning 2005ÿ06, Harvard has won Ivy titles in 22 different sports, two-thirds of the league total, and Princeton has won championships in 31 different sports, all except wrestling and men's tennis.[118]\\r\\nRivalries run deep in the Ivy League. For instance, Princeton and Penn are longstanding men's basketball rivals;[119] \\"Puck Frinceton\\", and \\"Pennetrate the Puss\\" T-shirts are worn by Quaker fans at games.[120] In only 11 instances in the history of Ivy League basketball, and in only seven seasons since Yale's 1962 title, has neither Penn nor Princeton won at least a share of the Ivy League title in basketball,[121] with Princeton champion or co-champion 26 times and Penn 25 times. Penn has won 21 outright, Princeton 19 outright. Princeton has been a co-champion 7 times, sharing 4 of those titles with Penn (these 4 seasons represent the only times Penn has been co-champion). Harvard won its first title of either variety in 2011, losing a dramatic play-off game to Princeton for the NCAA tournament bid, then rebounded to win outright championships in 2012, 2013, and 2014.\\r\\nRivalries exist between other Ivy league teams in other sports, including Cornell and Harvard in hockey, Harvard and Princeton in swimming, and Harvard and Penn in football (Penn and Harvard have won 28 Ivy League Football Championships since 1982, Penn-16; Harvard-12). During that time Penn has had 8 undefeated Ivy League Football Championships and Harvard has had 6 undefeated Ivy League Football Championships.[122] In men's lacrosse, Cornell and Princeton are perennial rivals, and they are the only two Ivy League teams to have won the NCAA tournament. In 2009, the Big Red and Tigers met for their 70th game in the NCAA tournament.[123] No team other than Harvard or Princeton has won the men's swimming conference title outright since 1972, although Yale, Columbia, and Cornell have shared the title with Harvard and Princeton during this time. Similarly, no program other than Princeton and Harvard has won the women's swimming championship since Brown's 1999 title. Princeton or Cornell has won every indoor and outdoor track and field championship, both men's and women's, every year since 2002ÿ03, with one exception (Columbia women won indoor championship in 2012). Harvard and Yale are football and crew rivals although the competition has become unbalanced; Harvard has won all but one of the last 15 football games and all but one of the last 13 crew races.\\r\\nThe Yale-Princeton series is the nation's second longest, exceeded only by \\"The Rivalry\\" between Lehigh and Lafayette, which began later in 1884 but included two or three games in each of 17 early seasons.[124] For the first three decades of the Yale-Princeton rivalry, the two played their season-ending game at a neutral site, usually New York City, and with one exception (1890: Harvard), the winner of the game also won at least a share of the national championship that year, covering the period 1869 through 1903.[125][126] This phenomenon of a finale contest at a neutral site for the national title created a social occasion for the society elite of the metropolitan area akin to a Super Bowl in the era prior to the establishment of the NFL in 1920.[127][128] These football games were also financially profitable for the two universities, so much that they began to play baseball games in New York City as well, drawing record crowds for that sport also, largely from the same social demographic.[129] In a period when the only professional sports were fledgling baseball leagues, these high profile early contests between Princeton and Yale played a role in popularizing spectator sports, demonstrating their financial potential and raising public awareness of Ivy universities at a time when few people attended college.\\r\\nThis list, which is current through July 1, 2015,[130] includes NCAA championships and women's AIAW championships (one each for Yale and Dartmouth). Excluded from this list are all other national championships earned outside the scope of NCAA competition, including football titles and retroactive Helms Foundation titles.\\r\\nThe term Ivy is often used to connote a positive comparison to or association with the Ivy League, often along academic lines. The term has been used to describe the Little Ivies, a grouping of small liberal arts colleges in the Northeastern United States.[133] Other uses include the Southern Ivies, Hidden Ivies, and the Public Ivies. The 2007 edition of Newsweek's How to Get Into College Now, the editors designated 25 schools as \\"New Ivies\\".[134]\\r\\nThe term Ivy Plus is sometimes used to refer to the Ancient Eight plus several other schools for purposes of alumni associations,[135][136] university affiliations,[136][137][138][139] or endowment comparisons.[140][141][142][143] In his book Untangling the Ivy League, Zawel writes, \\"The inclusion of nonÿIvy League schools under this term is commonplace for some schools and extremely rare for others. Among these other schools, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University are almost always included. The University of Chicago and Duke University are often included as well.\\"[136] In their 2015 book Acing Admissions, Mehta and Dixit write, \\"The [Ivy Plus schools] include, but are not limited to: Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Stanford University and Northwestern University. Besides selectivity, these Ivy Plus colleges are thought to share similar values around academic and professional excellence, intellectual curiosity, leadership and civil engagement.\\"[144]","input":"What ivy league schools are in new york?"},{"output":"November 2, 2017","context":"Kuch Rang Pyar Ke Aise Bhi (English: A few colors of love can be like this too) was an Indian romance television series, which originally aired on Sony TV[1] from February 29, 2016,[2][3] to November 2, 2017,[4] lasting two seasons.\\r\\nShaheer Sheikh, Erica Fernandes and Supriya Pilgaonkar play the lead roles.

Theres no question of ending the show.\\"[10]\\r\\nIn January 2017, after Dev and Sonakshi's separation in the show a 7-year leap was introduced.[11] Dev was shown as a person who cares only about himself and Sonakshi turned into a mature businesswoman and a single mother.[12] The show became the most popular feature show on Indian Television on the basis of The Times of India's conducted poll on twitter in late March 2017.[13]\\r\\nOn 31 August 2017, the channel announced that because of viewer demand the show would be brought back, with an estimated air date in mid-September 2017.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show is set in Delhi, and revolves around Mr. Devrath Dixit, a business tycoon and Dr. Sonakshi Bose, a nutritionist.\\r\\nDev is a successful business tycoon who lives with his mother Ishwari, whom he's devoted to and his three beloved sisters, Neha, Nikki and Riya, his uncle, aunt and their son Vicky.

Dev's aunt continues stoking fires and misrepresents how Dev helped Sona's brother with a huge loan leading to tensions between the Dixit and Bose families. A number of misunderstandings initially conducted by Radharani and Vicky leads Dev and Sonakshi to separate and she leaves Delhi.\\r\\nA seven-year leap is introduced in the story line. Sonakshi is now the mother of her and Dev's daughter, six-year old Suhana, and has become a successful businesswoman in her field.

It is Toyota's longest running series.[1]\\r\\nProduction of the first generation Land Cruiser began in 1951 (90 units) as Toyota's version of a Jeep-like vehicle.[2][3] The Land Cruiser has been produced in convertible, hardtop, station wagon and cab chassis versions. The Land Cruiser's reliability and longevity has led to huge popularity, especially in Australia where it is the best-selling body-on-frame, four-wheel drive vehicle.[4] Toyota also extensively tests the Land Cruiser in the Australian outback ÿ considered to be one of the toughest operating environments in both temperature and terrain.[5][6][7] In Japan, the Land Cruiser is exclusive to Toyota Japanese dealerships called Toyota Store.\\r\\nAs of 2016[update], the Land Cruiser J200 is available in most markets. Exceptions include Canada, Hong Kong, Malaysia (of whose markets have the Lexus LX available), North Korea, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and large parts of Europe. In Europe, the only countries that officially sell the Land Cruiser 200 are: Andorra, Gibraltar, Iceland, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Imperial Japanese Army occupied the Philippines in 1941 they found an old Bantam Mk II and promptly sent it to Japan. The Japanese military authorities ordered Toyota to produce a similar vehicle but to alter the appearance. The resulting Model AK prototype led to the Yon-Shiki Kogata Kamotsu-Sha (dւ ?[ ? type 4 compact cargo-truck).\\r\\nLater in 1941 the Japanese government instructed Toyota to produce a light truck for Japan's military. In 1942, Toyota developed the AK10 prototype by reverse-engineering a Bantam GP . The half-ton truck features an upright front grille, flat front wheel arches that angled down and back like the FJ40, headlights mounted above the wheel arches on either side of the radiator, and a folding windshield. The AK10 is powered by the 2259 cc, 4-cylinder Type C engine from the Toyota Model AE sedan coupled to a three-speed manual transmission and two-speed transfer gearbox. Unlike the U.S. Jeep, few AK10's were ever used and photographs of them in the battlefield are rare.\\r\\nThe postwar Toyota \\"Jeep\\" BJ is completely different from the AK10 and inherits no mechanical parts from it.\\r\\nThe Land Cruiser 55 was produced from 1967 to 1980. Toyota refers to the FJ55G and FJ55V as the first \\"real\\" station wagon in the Land Cruiser series, thus marking the beginning of the station wagon branch. It was the first Land Cruiser to have fully enclosed box frame members. Of all the Land Cruiser wagons sold in the U.S., including the FJ45, it is the only one to not have hatch and tailgate in the rear, but rather a tailgate only with an electrically operated window that can be retracted into the tailgate.[18]\\r\\nThe Land Cruiser 60 series was produced from 1980 through 1990 for most markets but the Cumana Plant in Venezuela continued until 1992 for their local market. It is a front engine, four door wagon which can seat five to eight[citation needed] people. Like all Land Cruiser generations, it is well known in the off-road world for its off-road abilities but was somewhat limited by its awkward departure angles.[citation needed] The 60 series was available in the following solid exterior colors: Alpine White, Brown, Desert Beige, Freeborn Red, Royal Blue; and in the following metallic exterior colors: Charcoal Gray, Cognac, Gray-Blue, Rootbeer, Sky Blue, Stardust Silver.\\r\\nThe Land Cruiser 80 series was unveiled in October 1989 at the Tokyo Motor Show and launched in early 1990. It had swing-out back doors, which were replaced by a winch door in 1994. The Land Cruiser was nicknamed the Burbuja (Bubble) in Colombia and Venezuela due to its roundness. The J80 was initially offered in two versions in these countries: the fully loaded VX and an entry level model that included a vinyl interior with optional air conditioning. In 1996, the entry model was upgraded to a medium equipped model named Autana, including cloth upholstery, standard air conditioning and power driver seat. The name is a reference to the Tepui mesa Autana, a spectacular plateau and cave system along the Guiana Shield craton. Land Cruiser sales reached 2 million vehicles.\\r\\nR means Right hand drive version, excluding Japanese domestic market.\\r\\nIn January 1998, the 100 series Land Cruiser was introduced to replace the 8-year-old 80 series. The 100 series was previewed in October 1997 as the \\"Grand Cruiser\\" at the 32nd Tokyo Motor Show. Development began in 1991 under program code 404T, with the final design being frozen in mid-1994.[21][22]\\r\\nThere are two distinct versions of the 100-series, the 100 and the 105. The two versions look very similar, but there are significant differences under the bodywork. Despite these differences and official model names, both the 100 and 105 are collectively known as the 100 series.\\r\\nThe 105 carried over the majority of its chassis and powertrain from the 80-series with coil suspended solid axles front and rear, and straight-6 petrol and diesel engines. These models were only sold in African, Australian, Russian, and South American markets.\\r\\nIn 1998, it introduced a suspension system combining Active Height Control (AHC) and Skyhook TEMS Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension on the Land Cruiser J100[23]\\r\\nIn 2002 Toyota introduced Night View, the first worldwide series production active automotive night vision system, on the Toyota Landcruiser Cygnus or Lexus LX470. This system uses the headlight projectors emitting near infrared light aimed like the car's highbeam headlights and a CCD camera then captures that reflected radiation, this signal is then processed by computer which produces a black-and-white image which is projected on the lower section of the windshield.[24] It was also the first Toyota with roll-over sensor and control logic[25]\\r\\nThe 100 models were fitted with a slightly wider chassis, independent front suspension (IFS) and two new engines. The change to IFS was a first for a Land Cruiser, and was made (in combination with rack-and-pinion steering) to improve on-road handling. However it also limited the vehicle's off-road capability and durability, hence the decision to offer the solid axle 105 models alongside the IFS 100 models in some markets. The table below identifies the range of 100 and 105 models and their worldwide availability.\\r\\nDespite the 100 and 105 bodies being very similar, there are some exterior visual indications between both models. The most obvious is the front end of the vehicle often appearing lower than the rear on the 100 models, due to the IFS. The other indicator is the design of the wheels. The 100 models have almost flat wheel designs, while the 105 models have dished wheels. This difference allows both versions to retain similar wheel tracks, despite the 100 having a relatively wider axle track to allow for the IFS system.\\r\\nThe introduction of a V8 engine was also a first for a Land Cruiser, and was specifically intended to improve sales in the North-American market, where it was the only engine available. In Australia, the 100 V8 was initially only available in the range-topping GXV model, while entry and mid-range models were the 105 powered by the 1FZ-FE I6 petrol, or 1HZ diesel engines. The new 1HD-FTE turbo-diesel 100 was added to the Australian range in October 2000 after being available in Europe and the UK since launch in 1998. The 4WD media in Australia were critical of Toyota's decision to offer the acclaimed 1HD-FTE engine only in combination with IFS. Australian 4WD Monthly magazine said \\"We will never forgive Toyota for going independent at the front with the mighty 4.2 turbo-diesel\\".\\r\\nThe 100 series formed the basis for the Lexus LX 470, which was also sold in Japan as the Toyota Cygnus.\\r\\nThe 100 series was called the Toyota Land Cruiser Amazon in the UK and Ireland from 1998 to 2007.\\r\\nIn 2000, Toyota celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Land Cruiser with commemorative models offered in several countries. Total global production to date was 3.72 million vehicles.\\r\\nThe 100 series remained in production until late 2007, with several minor facelifts such as headlights, taillights, front grille, rear spoiler and specification changes introduced over the years.\\r\\n*This engine not released in Australia until 2000.\\r\\nThe 100-series is generally considered a durable and reliable vehicle, however there have been three known issues identified, generally for vehicles operating in harsh conditions:\\r\\nIn 2002, a 5-year development plan on a successor to the 100-series platform commenced under Sadayoshi Koyari and Tetsuya Tada. By 2004, 10 years after the design selection of its predecessor in 1994, a final production design was settled on for the 2008 J200. Prototype related tests were conducted for over 2 years between 2004 and early 2007. The redesigned Toyota Land Cruiser was introduced in late 2007. Known as the 200 Series, it shares the Lexus LX 570's platform and overall design. The frame was new, derived from the second-generation Tundra[citation needed] but shortened and strengthened by 20 percent. Bigger brake rotors and calipers were added and the front suspension was made heavier duty than the Land Cruiser's first effort at IFS in the 100-series and this underbelly is also protected by skid plates. Also, the roof pillars were redesigned to better protect occupants in a rollover.\\r\\nThe 200 Series encountered some criticism due to its bland body restyling, with some[who?] claiming that Toyota has 'overdeveloped' the classic trademarked Land Cruiser identity in its efforts to fit the Land Cruiser into modern 21st century motoring and vehicle design. Nonetheless, the Land Cruiser remains the NATO vehicle of choice[citation needed] and remains a competent off-road vehicle.\\r\\nThe vehicle entered production in September 2007 and was available for sale from September or November, depending on country. It became available in Venezuela for sale early in November under the local nickname of \\"Roraima\\" (taken from Mount Roraima). Early reliability has proven to be excellent.\\r\\nThe 200 Series, offered numerous features and upgrades over its predecessor not limited to the cosmetic changes made to the body and interior, including:\\r\\nVarious driver assist technologies not offered on previous models, including:\\r\\nEngine and transmission improvements include:\\r\\nIn Japan, the Land Cruiser had a minor change in 2009 when it received the 4.6 L V8 1UR-FE engine and the gearbox was replaced with a 6-speed automatic.[34] Although the new 4608 cc 1UR-FE is smaller than the old 4663 cc 2UZ-FE engine, the power has been increased from 212 to 234?kW (288 to 318?PS; 284 to 314?hp), torque increased from 448 to 460?N?m (330 to 339?lb?ft) and fuel consumption improved from 6.6 to 7.1?km/L (19 to 20?mpg?imp; 16 to 17?mpg?US) (Japan 10{15 mode measurement).\\r\\nIn the Middle East, the Land Cruiser 200 series was introduced in late 2007 as a 2008 model, for 2008 to 2010 there was three engine choices, 179?kW (240?hp) 4.0L 1GR-FE petrol, 202?kW (271?hp) 2UZ-FE petrol and 162ÿ173?kW (217ÿ232?hp) 1VD-FTV 4.5?L turbo diesel.[35] Starting in 2011, the 270?kW (362?hp) 3UR-FE was offered along with the previous engines.[36] For 2012, the 1GR-FE gained dual VVT-i increased power to 202?kW (271?hp), the 4.7?L 2UZ-FE was dropped in favour of the new 227?kW (304?hp) 4.6?L 1UR-FE, and the 5.7?L and 4.5?L diesel were unchanged, although the latter was dropped in some markets.[37]\\r\\nIn North America, the Land Cruiser 200 series is offered with one trim level and engine, the 5.7?L 3UR-FE V8 petrol engine producing 284?kW (386?PS; 381?hp) and 544?N?m (401?lb?ft) of torque channeled through a six-speed automatic. Towing is rated at 3,700?kg (8,200?lb). Beige or black leather is standard along with a 14 speaker JBL sound system. The only wheel choice is 18?in (460?mm) allowing a lot of sidewall so the vehicle can be driven off-road without modification though a more aggressive tread pattern is advised for deep mud.\\r\\nFor the 2013 model year, Toyota added all previously optional safety and luxury options as standard. The Land Cruiser now gets pushbutton start, HID headlights with beam level adjustment, a power moonroof, automatic rain sensing windshield wipers, heated and ventilated (perforated leather) front and only heated rear seats, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, bluetooth, rearview camera with parking sensors, navigation system, HD radio and Entune. Another new feature is the Multi-terrain Select system which helps control wheelspin and brake lockup giving the selectable choices of: Rock, Rock & Dirt, Mogul, Loose Rock, and Mud & Sand and with an addition to the Multi-terrain Select system a feature known as adaptive Anti-lock Braking system which adapts to the condition of the road like mud or sand and efficiently uses the ABS to reduce braking distance on any type of terrain.[38]\\r\\nIn Oceania, the 200 Series is offered in four different levels of trim: GX, GXL, VX, and Sahara.\\r\\nIn August 2015, Toyota launched an updated, face lifted version of the J200 Land Cruiser in Japan, which was rolled out globally. The face lifted version includes a new 8-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission (ECT-i) for the 5.7 L 3UR-FE V8 petrol engine while other engine option's and transmission remains unchanged. There were also updates to the front fascia, grill, headlamps (with daylight running lamps), rear tail lamps and bumpers.\\r\\nToyota dropped the Land Cruiser 200 series from United Kingdom lineup with this face lift. Previous to the face lift, the UK market received the Land Cruiser with the 4.5 L 1VD-FTV V8 turbo diesel as the only engine option.\\r\\nIn China, the Land Cruiser 200 was produced from 2008 to 2016 by Sichuan FAW Toyota Motor. The 4.0?L 1GR-FE V6 and 4.7?L 2UZ-FE V8 were the available engine choices ÿ both paired to a 5 speed automatic gearbox. Trim levels were the 4.0 GX-R, 4.0 VX, 4.7 VX and 4.7 VX-R.[39]\\r\\nDue to its durability and reliability, the Land Cruiser, along with the smaller Toyota Hilux, has become popular among militant groups in war-torn regions.[52] U.S. counter-terror officials have inquired with Toyota how the extremist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has apparently acquired large numbers of Toyota Land Cruisers and Hiluxes. Mark Wallace, the CEO of the Counter Extremism Project said, \\"Regrettably, the Toyota Land Cruiser and Hilux have effectively become almost part of the ISIS brand.\\"[53]","input":"What is the longest running toyota car models?"},{"output":"March 4, 1789","context":"The First United States Congress, consisting of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, met from March 4, 1789, to March 4, 1791, during the first two years of George Washington's presidency, first at Federal Hall in New York City and later at Congress Hall in Philadelphia.

It is threatened by habitat destruction and has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2010.[1]\\r\\nIt is the world's longest venomous snake.[2] Adult king cobras are 3.18 to 4?m (10.4 to 13.1?ft) long. The longest known individual measured 5.85?m (19.2?ft).[3]\\r\\nDespite the word \\"cobra\\" in its common name, this species does not belong to genus Naja but is the sole member of its own. It preys chiefly on other snakes and occasionally on some other vertebrates, such as lizards and rodents. It is a dangerous snake that has a fearsome reputation in its range,[4][5][6] although it typically avoids confrontation with humans when possible.[4]\\r\\nThe king cobra is a prominent symbol in the mythology and folk traditions of India, Sri Lanka and Myanmar.[7][8] It is the national reptile of India.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king cobra was described and drawn by the Danish naturalist Theodore Edward Cantor in 1836, who gave it the scientific name Hamadryas hannah. Cantor had three specimens from the Sundarbans and one caught in the vicinity of Kolkata.[10] It was subordinated to the genus Ophiophagus by Albert Gnther in 1864.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOphiophagus hannah belongs to the monotypic genus Ophiophagus in the family Elapidae, while most other cobras are members of the genus Naja. They can be distinguished from other cobras by size and hood. King cobras are generally larger than other cobras, and the stripe on the neck is a chevron instead of a double or single eye shape that may be seen in most of the other Asian cobras. Moreover, the hood of the king cobra is narrower and longer.[4] A key to identification, clearly visible on the head, is the presence of a pair of large scales known as occipitals, located at the back of the top of the head. These are behind the usual \\"nine-plate\\" arrangement typical of colubrids and elapids, and are unique to the king cobra.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe skin of king cobra is dark olive or brown with black bands and white or yellow crossbands. The head is black with two crossbars near the snout and two behind the eyes. Adult king cobras are 3.18 to 4?m (10.4 to 13.1?ft) long. The longest known individual measured 5.85?m (19.2?ft).[3]\\r\\nIts belly is cream or pale yellow.[12]\\r\\nIt has 17 to 19 rows of smooth scales. Ventral scales are uniformly oval shaped. Dorsal scales are placed in an oblique arrangement.[13]\\r\\nMales have 235 to 250 ventral scales, while females have 239 to 265. The subcaudal scales are single or paired in each row, numbering 83 to 96 in males and 77 to 98 in females.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuveniles are shiny black with narrow yellow bands (can be mistaken for a banded krait, but readily identified with its expandable hood). The head of a mature snake can be quite massive and bulky in appearance, though like all snakes, it can expand its jaws to swallow large prey items. It has proteroglyph dentition, meaning it has two short, fixed fangs in the front of the mouth, which channel venom into the prey like hypodermic needles. The average lifespan of a wild king cobra is about 20?years.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nKing cobras are sexually dimorphic in size, with males reaching larger sizes than females, which is an unusual trait among snakes whose females are usually larger than males. The length and mass of the snakes highly depend on their localities and some other factors.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king cobra typically weighs about 6?kg (13?lb). The longest known specimen was a captive one at the London Zoo, and grew to around 18.5 to 18.8?ft (5.6 to 5.7?m) before being euthanised upon the outbreak of World War II. The heaviest wild specimen was caught at Royal Island Club in Singapore in 1951, which weighed 12?kg (26?lb) and measured 4.8?m (16?ft), though an even heavier captive specimen was kept at New York Zoological Park and was measured as 12.7?kg (28?lb) at 4.4?m (14.4?ft) long in 1972.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome viper species, such as the eastern diamondback rattlesnake and the Gaboon viper, often much shorter in length but bulkier in build, rival the king cobra in average weight.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king cobra is distributed across the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and the southern areas of East Asia (where it is not common), in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and southern China.[1] In India it has been recorded from Goa; Western Ghats of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu; east coastline of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha; Sundarban mangroves; Himalayan foothills from Uttrakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, northern parts of West Bengal to most of the north-east region and Andaman Islands. Type locality Sundarbans. [15]It lives in dense highland forests,[2][16] preferring areas dotted with lakes and streams. King cobra populations have dropped in some areas of its range because of the destruction of forests and ongoing collection for the international pet trade. It is listed as an Appendix II animal within CITES.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nA king cobra, like other snakes, receives chemical information via its forked tongue, which picks up scent particles and transfers them to a special sensory receptor (Jacobson's organ) located in the roof of its mouth.[2] This is akin to the human sense of smell. When the scent of a meal is detected, the snake flicks its tongue to gauge the prey's location (the twin forks of the tongue acting in stereo); it also uses its keen eyesight; king cobras are able to detect moving prey almost 100?m (330?ft) away. Its intelligence[18] and sensitivity to earth-borne vibration are also used to track its prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing envenomation, the king cobra swallows its struggling prey. King cobras, like all snakes, have flexible jaws. The jaw bones are connected by pliable ligaments, enabling the lower jaw bones to move independently. This allows the king cobra to swallow its prey whole, and swallow prey much larger than its head.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nKing cobras are able to hunt throughout the day, but are rarely seen at night, leading most herpetologists to classify them as a diurnal species.[2][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king cobra's generic name, Ophiophagus is a Greek-derived word that means \\"snake-eater\\". Its diet consists primarily of other snakes, including rat snakes, pythons, and even other venomous snakes such as various members of the true cobras and the krait.[19][20]\\r\\nIts most common prey is the rat snake, and it also hunts Malabar pit viper and hump-nosed pit viper by following the snakes' odour trails.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen food is scarce, it also feeds on other small vertebrates, such as lizards, birds, and rodents. In some cases, the cobra constricts its prey, such as birds and larger rodents, using its muscular body, though this is uncommon.[2][20]\\r\\nAfter a large meal, the snake lives for many months without another one because of its slow metabolic rate.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen confronted, this species quickly attempts to escape and avoid confrontation.[6][22] However, if continuously provoked, the king cobra can be highly aggressive.[6][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen alarmed, it rears up the anterior portion (usually one-third) of its body when extending the neck, showing the fangs and hissing loudly.[4][12]\\r\\nIt can be easily irritated by closely approaching objects or sudden movements. When raising its body, the king cobra can still move forward to strike with a long distance[12] and people may misjudge the safe zone. This snake can deliver multiple bites in a single attack,[5] and adults are known to bite and hold on. Many victims bitten by king cobras are actually snake charmers.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome scientists believe that the temperament of this species has been grossly exaggerated. In most of the local encounters with live, wild king cobras, the snakes appear to be of rather placid disposition, and they usually end up being killed or subdued with hardly any hysterics. These support the view that wild king cobras generally have a mild temperament, and despite their frequent occurrence in disturbed and built-up areas, are adept at avoiding humans. Naturalist Michael Wilmer Forbes Tweedie felt that \\"this notion is based on the general tendency to dramatise all attributes of snakes with little regard for the truth about them. A moments reflection shows that this must be so, for the species is not uncommon, even in populated areas, and consciously or unconsciously, people must encounter king cobras quite frequently. If the snake were really habitually aggressive, records of its bite would be frequent; as it is they are extremely rare.\\"[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a king cobra encounters a natural predator, such as the mongoose, which has resistance to the neurotoxins,[25] the snake generally tries to flee. If unable to do so, it forms the distinctive cobra hood and emits a hiss, sometimes with feigned closed-mouth strikes. These efforts usually prove to be very effective, especially since it is much more dangerous than other mongoose prey, as well as being much too large for the small mammal to kill with ease.\\r\\n\\r\\nA good defense for anyone who accidentally encounters this snake is to slowly remove a shirt or hat and toss it to the ground while backing away.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hiss of the king cobra is a much lower pitch than many other snakes and many people thus liken its call to a \\"growl\\" rather than a hiss. While the hisses of most snakes are of a broad-frequency span ranging from roughly 3,000 to 13,000?Hz with a dominant frequency near 7,500?Hz, king cobra growls consist solely of frequencies below 2,500?Hz, with a dominant frequency near 600?Hz, a much lower-sounding frequency closer to that of a human voice. Comparative anatomical morphometric analysis has led to a discovery of tracheal diverticula that function as low-frequency resonating chambers in king cobra and its prey, the rat snake, both of which can make similar growls.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female is gravid for 50 to 59 days, after which she builds a nest, lays 12 to 51 eggs and guards it during the incubation period of about 51 to 79 days. The hatchlings are  31 to 73?cm (12 to 29?in) long and weigh 18.4 to 40?g (0.65 to 1.41?oz).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king cobra is unusual among snakes in that the female is a very dedicated parent. For the nest, the female scrapes up leaves and other debris into a mound, and stays in the nest until the young hatch. She guards the mound tenaciously, rearing up into a threat display if any large animal gets too close.[28] Inside the mound, the eggs are incubated at a steady 28?C (82?F). When the eggs start to hatch, the female leaves the nest. The baby king cobra's venom is as potent as that of the adults. They may be brightly marked, but these colours often fade as they mature. They are alert and nervous, being highly aggressive if disturbed.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe venom of the king cobra consists primarily of neurotoxins, known as the haditoxin,[29] with several other compounds.[19][30] Its murine LD50 toxicity varies from intravenous 1.31?mg/kg[31] and intraperitoneal 1.644?mg/kg[31] to subcutaneous 1.71.93?mg/kg.[32][33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis species is capable of delivering a fatal bite and the victim may receive a large quantity of venom with a dose of 200 to 500?mg [4][35][36] up to 7?ml.[12] Engelmann and Obst (1981) list the average venom yield at 420?mg (dry weight).[33] Accordingly, large quantities of antivenom may be needed to reverse the progression of symptoms developed if bitten by a king cobra.[5] The toxins affect the victim's central nervous system, resulting in severe pain, blurred vision, vertigo, drowsiness, and eventually paralysis. If the envenomation is serious, it progresses to cardiovascular collapse, and the victim falls into a coma. Death soon follows due to respiratory failure. Bites from a king cobra may result in a rapid fatality[4][5] which can be as early as 30?minutes after the envenomation.[5][37] The king cobra's envenomation was even recorded to be capable of killing elephants within hours.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo types of antivenom are made specifically to treat king cobra envenomations. The Red Cross in Thailand manufactures one, and the Central Research Institute in India manufactures the other; however, both are made in small quantities and, while available to order, are not widely stocked.[39] Ohanin, a protein component of the venom, causes hypolocomotion and hyperalgesia in mammals.[40] Other components have cardiotoxic,[41] cytotoxic and neurotoxic effects.[42] In Thailand, a concoction of alcohol and the ground root of turmeric is ingested, which has been clinically shown to create a strong resilience against the venom of the king cobra, and other snakes with neurotoxic venom.[43][44] Proper and immediate treatments are critical to avoid death. Successful precedents include a client who recovered and was discharged in 10?days after being treated by accurate antivenom and inpatient care.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nSnakebites from this species are rare, and most victims are snake handlers.[4] Not all king cobra bites result in envenomation, but they are often considered of medical importance.[45] Clinical mortality rates vary between different regions and depend on many factors, such as local medical advancement. A Thai survey reports 10 deaths out of 35?patients received for king cobra bites, whose fatality rate posed (28%) is higher than those of other cobra species.[46] Department of Clinical Toxinology in University of Adelaide gives this serpent a general untreated fatality rate of 50ÿ60%, implying that the snake has about a half chance to deliver bites involving nonfatal quantities of venom.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe species is classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN due to pressure from harvesting for meat, skin and use in traditional medicine, and because of increasing loss of habitat to deforestation.[1] In India, king cobras are placed under Schedule II of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 (as amended) and a person guilty of killing the snake can be imprisoned for up to six?years.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nA ritual in Myanmar involves a king cobra and a female snake charmer. The charmer is a priestess who is usually tattooed with three pictograms and kisses the snake on the top of its head at the end of the ritual.[8][20]\\r\\nMembers of the Pakokku clan tattoo themselves with ink mixed with cobra venom on their upper bodies in a weekly inoculation that potentially might protect them from the snake, though no scientific evidence supports this.[20][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nCobra stones or gems or pearls are believed to develop from the cobra's hood.[49]","input":"What does a king cobra's habitat look like?"},{"output":"about 1","context":"Gram per cubic centimetre is a unit of density in the CGS system, commonly used in chemistry, defined as mass in grams divided by volume in cubic centimetres.

During the time of the third caliph Uthman, Aisha had a leading part in the opposition that grew against him, though she did not agree either with those responsible for his assassination nor with the party of Ali.[10] During the reign of Ali, she wanted to avenge Uthman's death, which she attempted to do in the Battle of the Camel. She participated in the battle by giving speeches and leading troops on the back of her camel. She ended up losing the battle, but her involvement and determination left a lasting impression.[6] Afterwards, she lived quietly in Medina for more than twenty years, took no part in politics, became reconciled to Ali and did not oppose caliph Mu'awiya.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of traditional hadith sources state that Aisha was married to Muhammad at the age of six or seven, but she stayed in her parents' home until the age of nine, or ten according to Ibn Hisham,[11] when the marriage was consummated with Muhammad, then 53, in Medina.[12][13][14] This timeline has been challenged by a number of scholars in modern times.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Shia have a generally negative view of Aisha.

Abu Bakr was uncertain at first \\"as to the propriety or even legality of marrying his daughter to his 'brother'.\\"[21] British historian William Montgomery Watt suggests that Muhammad hoped to strengthen his ties with Abu Bakr;[10] the strengthening of ties commonly served as a basis for marriage in Arabian culture.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAisha's age at the time of her marriage is frequently mentioned in Islamic literature.[11] According to Sunni hadith sources, Aisha was six or seven years old when she was married to Muhammad in Mecca. The marriage was consummated after the Hegira to Medina, when she had reached the age of nine or ten years old.[23] Many scholars interpret this to indicate that she reached puberty at this age.[10][11][12][13][14][24][25][26] For example, Sahih al-Bukhari states that Aisha narrated that \\"the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).\\"[27][23]  Some narrations such as the following mention her menstruating:[28] \\"Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet used to lean on my lap and recite Qur'an while I was in menses.\\"[29] and \\"Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet used to embrace me during my menses. He also used to put his head out of the mosque while he was in Itikaf, and I would wash it during my menses.\\"[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the modern era, Aisha's age at marriage has been a source of controversy and debate, and some Muslims have attempted to revise the previously-accepted timeline of her life.[31] All biographical information on Muhammad and his companions was first recorded over a century after his death,[32] but the ahadith and Islamic literature provide records of early Islam through an unbroken chain of witnesses. Various ahadith stating that Aisha was either nine or ten at the time of her consummation come from collections with sahih status, meaning they are regarded as reputable by the majority of Muslims.[33][34] Some other traditional sources also mention Aisha's age. The sira of Ibn Ishaq edited by Ibn Hisham states that she was nine or ten years old at the consummation.[35] The historian al-Tabari also states that she was nine.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarriage at a young age was not unheard of at the time, and Aisha's marriage to Muhammad may have had a political connotation, as her father Abu Bakr was an influential man in the community.[37] Abu Bakr, on his part, may have sought to further the bond of kinship between Muhammad and himself by joining their families together in marriage via Aisha. Leila Ahmed notes that Aisha's betrothal and marriage to Muhammad are presented as ordinary in Islamic literature, and may indicate that it was not unusual for children to be married to their elders in that era.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Muslim authors have attempted to calculate Aisha's age based on details found in some biographies, eschewing the traditionally-accepted ahadith, though Kecia Ali labels these attempts as \\"revisionist\\".[31] One hadith recorded in the works of some medieval scholars, including al-Dhahabi,[39] states that Aisha's older sister Asma was ten years older than her. This has been combined with information about Asma's age at the time of her death and used to suggest that Aisha was over thirteen at the time of her marriage.[40] Gibril Haddad criticizes this approach as relying on a single narrator, and notes that a hadith from the same narrator gives a broader range for the age difference between the sisters.[41] Muhammad Niknam Arabshahi, an Iranian Islamic scholar, has considered six different approaches[clarification needed] to determining Aisha's age and concluded that she was engaged in her late teens.[42] Using reports on the birth year of Fatimah as a reference point, the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement scholar Muhammad Ali has estimated that Aisha was over ten years old at the time of marriage and over fifteen at the time of its consummation.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nNoting the references to Aisha's age as either nine or ten at the age of consummation, American historian Denise Spellberg states that \\"these specific references to the bride's age reinforce Aisha's pre-menarcheal status and, implicitly, her virginity\\".[11] She notes that Aisha herself seemed to promote the fact that she was a virgin prior to her marriage to Muhammad, as a way to distinguish herself from his other, non-virginal wives. This was of great importance to those who supported Aisha's position in the debate of the succession to Muhammad. These supporters considered that as Muhammad's only virgin wife, Aisha was divinely intended for him, and therefore the most credible regarding the debate.[44][dubious  ÿ discuss] The Islamic scholar Kecia Ali disagrees with Spellberg's assessment, and states that early Islamic literature does not present Aishas young age as noteworthy or exceptional. She notes that some of Mohammed's companions are reported to have engaged in marriages with a similar age gap, and that the marriage would likely not have seemed controversial at the time.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many Muslim traditions, Aisha is described as Muhammad's most beloved or favored wife after his first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid, who died before the migration to Medina took place.[45][46][47][48][49] There are several hadiths, or stories or sayings of Muhammad, that support this belief. One relates that when a companion asked Muhammad, \\"who is the person you love most in the world?\\" he responded, \\"Aisha.\\"[50] Others relate that Muhammad built Aishas apartment so that her door opened directly into the mosque,[51][52] and that she was the only woman with whom Muhammad received revelations.[53][54] They bathed in the same water and he prayed while she lay stretched out in front of him.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also various traditions that reveal the mutual affection between Muhammad and Aisha. He would often just sit and watch her and her friends play with dolls, and on occasion he would even join them.[56][57][58] Additionally, they were close enough that each was able to discern the mood of the other, as many stories relate.[59][60] It is also important to note that there exists evidence that Muhammad did not view himself as entirely superior to Aisha, at least not enough to prevent Aisha from speaking her mind, even at the risk of angering Muhammad. On one such instance, Muhammad's \\"announcement of a revelation permitting him to enter into marriages disallowed to other men drew from her [Aisha] the retort, 'It seems to me your Lord hastens to satisfy your desire!'\\"[61] Furthermore, Muhammad and Aisha had a strong intellectual relationship.[62] Muhammad valued her keen memory and intelligence and so instructed his companions to draw some of their religious practices from her.[63][64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of accusation of adultery levied against Aisha can be traced to sura (chapter) An-Nur of the Qur'an. As the story goes, Aisha left her howdah in order to search for a missing necklace. Her slaves mounted the howdah and prepared it for travel without noticing any difference in weight without Aisha's presence. Hence the caravan accidentally departed without her. She remained at the camp until the next morning, when Safwan ibn al-Muattal, a nomad and member of Muhammad's army, found her and brought her back to Muhammad at the army's next camp. Rumours that Aisha and Safwan had committed adultery were spread, particularly by Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy, Hassan ibn Thabit, Mistah ibn Uthatha and Hammanah bint Jahsh (sister of Zaynab bint Jahsh, another of Muhammad's wives). Usama ibn Zayd, son of Zayd ibn Harithah, defended Aisha's reputation; while Ali ibn Abi Talib advised \\"Women are plentiful, and you can easily change one for another.\\" Muhammad came to speak directly with Aisha about the rumours. He was still sitting in her house when he announced that he had received a revelation from God confirming Aisha's innocence. Surah 24 details the Islamic laws and punishment regarding adultery and slander. Aisha's accusers were subjected to punishments of 80 lashes.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the daily Asr prayer, Muhammad would visit each of his wives' apartments to inquire about their well-being. Muhammad was just in the amount of time he spent with them and attention he gave to them.[66] Once, Muhammad's fifth wife, Zaynab bint Jahsh, received some honey from a relative which Muhammad took a particular liking to. As a result, every time Zaynab offered some of this honey to him he would spend a longer time in her apartment. This did not sit well with Aisha and Hafsa bint Umar.\\r\\n\\r\\nHafsa and I decided that when the Prophet entered upon either of us, she would say, \\"I smell in you the bad smell of Maghafir (a bad smelling raisin). Have you eaten Maghafir?\\" When he entered upon one of us, she said that to him. He replied (to her), \\"No, but I have drunk honey in the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again.\\"...\\"But I have drunk honey.\\" Hisham said: It also meant his saying, \\"I will not drink anymore, and I have taken an oath, so do not inform anybody of that'\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after this event, Muhammad reported that he had received a revelation in which he was told that he could eat anything permitted by God. Some Sunni commentators on the Qur'an sometimes give this story as the \\"occasion of revelation\\" for At-Tahrim, which opens with the following verses: \\r\\nO Prophet! Why holdest thou to be forbidden that which Allah has made lawful to thee? Thou seekest to please thy consorts. But Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.Allah has already ordained for you, (O men), the dissolution of your oaths (in some cases): and Allah is your Protector, and He is Full of Knowledge and Wisdom.\\r\\n Word spread to the small Muslim community that Muhammad's wives were speaking sharply to him and conspiring against him. Muhammad, saddened and upset, separated from his wives for a month. Umar, Hafsa's father, scolded his daughter and also spoke to Muhammad of the matter. By the end of this time, his wives were humbled; they agreed to \\"speak correct and courteous words\\"[69] and to focus on the afterlife.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nAisha remained Muhammad's favorite wife throughout his life. When he became ill and suspected that he was probably going to die, he began to ask his wives whose apartment he was to stay in next. They eventually figured out that he was trying to determine when he was due with Aisha, and they then allowed him to retire there. He remained in Aisha's apartment until his death, and his last breath was taken as he lay in the arms of Aisha, his most beloved wife.[71][72][73][74][75]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Muhammad's death, which ended Aisha and Muhammad's 14-year-long marriage, Aisha lived fifty more years in and around Medina. Much of her time was spent learning and acquiring knowledge of the Quran and the sunnah of Muhammad. Aisha was one of three wives (the other two being Hafsa bint Umar and Umm Salama) who memorized the Qur'an. Like Hafsa, Aisha had her own script of the Quran written after Muhammad's death.[76] During Aisha's life many prominent customs of Islam, such as veiling and seclusion of women, began.\\r\\n\\r\\nAisha's importance to revitalizing the Arab tradition and leadership among the Arab women highlights her magnitude within Islam.[77] Aisha became involved in the politics of early Islam and the first three caliphate reigns: Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman. During a time in Islam when women were not expected, or wanted, to contribute outside the household, Aisha delivered public speeches, became directly involved in war and even battles, and helped both men and women to understand the practices of Muhammad.[45][additional citation(s) needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Muhammad's death in 632, Abu Bakr was appointed as the first caliph. This matter of succession to Muhammad is extremely controversial to the Shia who believe that Ali had been appointed by Muhammad to lead while Sunni maintain that the public elected Abu Bakr.[78] Abu Bakr had two advantages in achieving his new role: his long personal friendship with Muhammad and his role as father-in-law. As caliph, Abu Bakr was the first to set guidelines for the new position of authority.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nAisha garnered more special privilege in the Islamic community for being known as both a wife of Muhammad and the daughter of the first caliph. Being the daughter of Abu Bakr tied Aisha to honorable titles earned from her father's strong dedication to Islam. For example, she was given the title of al-siddiqa bint al-siddiq, meaning 'the truthful woman, daughter of the truthful man',[11] a reference to Abu Bakr's support of the Isra and Mi'raj.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 634 Abu Bakr fell sick and was unable to recover. Prior to his death, he appointed Umar, one of his chief advisers, as the second caliph.[11] Throughout Umar's time in power Aisha continued to play the role of a consultant in political matters.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Umar died, Uthmn was chosen to be the third caliph. He wanted to promote the interests of the Umayyads. Aisha had little involvement with Uthmn for the first couple years, but eventually she found a way into the politics of his reign. She eventually grew to despise Uthmn, and many are unsure of what specifically triggered her eventual opposition towards him. A prominent opposition that arose towards him was when Uthmn mistreated Ammar ibn Yasir (companion of Muhammad) by beating him. Aisha became enraged and spoke out publicly, saying, \\"How soon indeed you have forgotten the practice (sunnah) of your prophet and these, his hairs, a shirt, and sandal have not yet perished!\\".[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs time continued issues of antipathy towards Uthmn continued to arise. Another instance of opposition arose when the people came to Aisha, after Uthmn ignored the rightful punishment for Walid idn Uqbah (Uthmn's brother). Aisha and Uthmn argued with each other, Uthmn eventually made a comment on why Aisha had come and how she was \\"ordered to stay at home\\".[82] Arising from this comment, was the question of whether Aisha, and for that matter women, still had the ability to be involved in public affairs. The Muslim community became split: \\"some sided with Uthmn, but others demanded to know who indeed had better right than Aisha in such matters\\".[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe caliphate took a turn for the worse when Egypt was governed by Abdullah ibn Saad. Abbott reports that Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa of Egypt, an opponent of Uthmn, forged letters in the Mothers of the Believers' names to the conspirators against Uthmn. The people cut off Uthmn's water and food supply. When Aisha realized the behavior of the crowd, Abbott notes, Aisha could not believe the crowd \\"would offer such indignities to a widow of Mohammad\\".[83] This refers to when Safiyya bint Huyayy (one of Muhammad's wives) tried to help Uthmn and was taken by the crowd. Malik al-Ashtar then approached her about killing Uthmn and the letter, and she claimed she would never want to \\"command the shedding of the blood of the Muslims and the killing of their Imm\\";[83] she also claimed she did not write the letters.[84] The city continued to oppose Uthmn, but as for Aisha, her journey to Mecca was approaching. With the journey to Mecca approaching at this time, she wanted to rid herself of the situation. Uthmn heard of her not wanting to hurt him, and he asked her to stay because of her influence on the people, but this did not persuade Aisha, and she continued on her journey.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 655, Uthman's house was put under siege by about 1000 rebels. Eventually the rebels broke into the house and murdered Uthman, provoking the First Fitna.[85] After killing Uthman, the rebels asked Ali to be the new caliph, although Ali was not involved in the murder of Uthman according to many reports.[86][87] Ali reportedly initially refused the caliphate, agreeing to rule only after his followers persisted.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Ali could not execute those merely accused of Uthman's murder, Aisha delivered a fiery speech against him for not avenging the death of Uthman. The first to respond to Aisha was Abdullah ibn Aamar al-Hadhrami, the governor of Mecca during the reign of Uthman, and prominent members of the Banu Umayya. With the funds from the \\"Yemeni Treasury\\" Aisha set out on a campaign against the Rashidun Caliphate of Ali.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAisha, along with an army including Zubayr ibn al-Awam and Talha ibn Ubayd-Allah, confronted Ali's army, demanding the prosecution of Uthman's killers who had mingled with his army outside the city of Basra. When her forces captured Basra she ordered the execution of 600 Muslims and 40 others, including Hakim ibn Jabala, who were put to death in the Grand Mosque of Basra.[88][89][90] \\r\\nAisha's forces are also known to have tortured and imprisoned Othman ibn Hanif the governor of Basra appointed by Ali.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nAli rallied supporters and fought Aisha's forces near Basra in 656. The battle is known as the Battle of the Camel, after the fact that Aisha directed her forces from a howdah on the back of a large camel.  Aisha's forces were defeated and an estimated 10,000 Muslims were killed in the battle,[92] considered the first engagement where Muslims fought Muslims.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 110 days of conflict the Rashidun Caliph Ali ibn Abi Talib met Aisha with reconciliation. He sent her back to Medina under military escort headed by her brother Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, one of Ali's commanders. She subsequently retired to Medina with no more interference with the affairs of state. She was also awarded a pension by Ali.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough she retired to Medina, her forsaken efforts against the Rashidun Caliphate of Ali did not end the First Fitna.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 25 years of a monogamous relationship with his first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid, Muhammad participated in nine years of polygyny, marrying at least nine further wives. Muhammad's subsequent marriages were depicted purely as political matches rather than unions of sexual indulgence. In particular, Muhammad's unions with Aisha and Hafsa bint Umar associated him with two of the most significant leaders of the early Muslim community, Aisha's and Hafsa's fathers, Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattb, respectively.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nAisha's marriage has given her significance among many within Islamic culture, becoming known as the most learned woman of her time. Being Muhammad's favorite wife, Aisha occupied an important position in his life.[77] When Muhammad married Aisha in her youth, she was accessible \\"...to the values needed to lead and influence the sisterhood of Muslim women.\\"[97] After the death of Muhammad, Aisha was discovered to be a renowned source of hadiths, due to her qualities of intelligence and memory.[77] Aisha conveyed ideas expressing Muhammad's practice (sunnah). She expressed herself as a role model to women, which can also be seen within some traditions attributed to her. The traditions regarding Aisha habitually opposed ideas unfavorable to women in efforts to elicit social change.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Reza Aslan:[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe so-called Muslim womens movement is predicated on the idea that Muslim men, not Islam, have been responsible for the suppression of womens rights. For this reason, Muslim feminists throughout the world are advocating a return to the society Muhammad originally envisioned for his followers. Despite differences in culture, nationalities, and beliefs, these women believe that the lesson to be learned from Muhammad in Medina is that Islam is above all an egalitarian religion. Their Medina is a society in which Muhammad designated women like Umm Waraqa as spiritual guides for the Ummah; in which the Prophet himself was sometimes publicly rebuked by his wives; in which women prayed and fought alongside the men; in which women like Aisha and Umm Salamah acted not only as religious but also as politicaland on at least one occasion militaryleaders; and in which the call to gather for prayer, bellowed from the rooftop of Muhammads house, brought men and women together to kneel side by side and be blessed as a single undivided community.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only was Aisha supportive of Muhammad, but she contributed scholarly intellect to the development of Islam.[97] She was given the title al-Siddiqah, meaning 'the one who affirms the truth'. Aisha was known for her \\"...expertise in the Quran, shares of inheritance, lawful and unlawful matters, poetry, Arabic literature, Arab history, genealogy, and general medicine.\\"[97] Her intellectual contributions regarding the verbal texts of Islam were in time transcribed into written form, becoming the official history of Islam.[100] After the death of Muhammad, Aisha was regarded as the most reliable source in the teachings of hadith.[97] Aisha's authentication of Muhammad's ways of prayer and his recitation of the Qur'an allowed for development of knowledge of his sunnah of praying and reading verses of the Quran.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Aisha's entire life she was a strong advocate for the education of Islamic women, especially in law and the teachings of Islam. She was known for establishing the first madrasa for women in her home.[97][additional citation(s) needed] Attending Aisha's classes were various family relatives and orphaned children. Men also attended Aisha's classes, with a simple curtain separating the male and female students.[97][additional citation(s) needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome[who?] say that Aisha's political influence helped promote her father, Abu Bakr, to the caliphate after Muhammad's death.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the defeat at the Battle of the Camel, Aisha retreated to Medina and became a teacher.[3] Upon her arrival in Medina, Aisha retired from her public role in politics. Her discontinuation of public politics, however, did not stop her political influence completely. Privately, Aisha continued influencing those intertwined in the Islamic political sphere. Amongst the Islamic community, she was known as an intelligent woman who debated law with male companions.[101] Aisha was also considered to be the embodiment of proper rituals while partaking in the pilgrimage to Mecca, a journey she made with several groups of women. For the last two years of her life, Aisha spent much of her time telling the stories of Muhammad, hoping to correct false passages that had become influential in formulating Islamic law. Due to this, Aisha's political influence continues to impact those in Islam.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAisha died at her home in Medina on 17 Ramadan 58 AH (16 July 678).[a] She was 67 years old.[1] Some such as Sibt ibn al-Jawzi,[103] Hakim Sanai,[104] and Khwaja Mehboob Qasim Chishti Muhsarafee Qadiri[105] say that she was murdered by Muawiyah. Muhammad's companion Abu Hurairah led her funeral prayer after the tahajjud (night) prayer, and she was buried at Jannat al-Baqi.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nSunnis believe she was Muhammad's favorite wife. They consider her (among other wives) to be Umm al-Muminin and among the members of the Ahl al-Bayt, or Muhammad's family. According to Sunni hadith reports, Muhammad saw Aisha in two dreams[107][108] in which he was shown that he would marry her.[109][110]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Shia view Aisha negatively. They accuse her of hating Ali and defying him during his caliphate in the Battle of the Camel, when she fought men from Ali's army in Basra.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nAisha was eighteen years of age at the time when the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died and she remained a widow for forty-eight years till she died at the age of sixty-seven. She saw the rules of four caliphs in her lifetime. She died in Ramadan 58 AH during the caliphate of Muawiya...\\r\\n\\r\\nAisha was born at the beginning of the fourth year of prophethood\\r\\n\\r\\n According to these sources, we can conclude that Aisha was much older than what she claimed and narrated in some hadith... and she was 17 or 19 years old when she got engaged and she would be 20 or 22 when she had sex.

Hids) was the ancient Greek chthonic god of the underworld, which eventually took his name.[1]\\r\\nIn Greek mythology, Hades was regarded as the oldest son of Cronus and Rhea, although the last son regurgitated by his father.[2] He and his brothers Zeus and Poseidon defeated their father's generation of gods, the Titans, and claimed rulership over the cosmos. Hades received the underworld, Zeus the sky, and Poseidon the sea, with the solid earthlong the province of Gaiaavailable to all three concurrently. Hades was often portrayed with his three-headed guard dog Cerberus.\\r\\nThe Etruscan god Aita and Roman gods Dis Pater and Orcus were eventually taken as equivalent to the Greek Hades and merged as Pluto, a Latinization of his euphemistic Greek name Plouton.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of Hades' name is uncertain, but has generally been seen as meaning \\"The Unseen One\\" since antiquity. An extensive section of Plato's dialogue Cratylus is devoted to the etymology of the god's name, in which Socrates is arguing for a folk etymology not from \\"unseen\\" but from \\"his knowledge (eidenai) of all noble things\\". Modern linguists have proposed the Proto-Greek form *Awides (\\"unseen\\").[4] The earliest attested form is A?ds (??Ѵ?), which lacks the proposed digamma. West argues instead for an original meaning of \\"the one who presides over meeting up\\" from the universality of death.[5]\\r\\nIn Homeric and Ionic Greek, he was known as ?ds.[6] Other poetic variations of the name include A?dne~s (??Ѵ??) and the inflected forms ?dos (??Ѵ?, gen.), ?di (??Ѵ, dat.), and ?da (??Ѵϫ, acc.), whose reconstructed nominative case *?s (*???) is, however, not attested.[7] The name as it came to be known in classical times was Hids (?Ѵ?). Later the iota became silent, then a subscript marking (??Ѵ?), and finally omitted entirely (?Ѵ?).[8]\\r\\nPerhaps from fear of pronouncing his name, around the 5th century BC, the Greeks started referring to Hades as Pluto (?, Plo~tn), with a root meaning \\"wealthy\\", considering that from the abode below (i.e., the soil) come riches (e.g., fertile crops, metals and so on).[9] Plouton became the Roman god who both rules the underworld and distributed riches from below. This deity was a mixture of the Greek god Hades and the Eleusinian icon Ploutos, and from this he also received a priestess, which was not previously practiced in Greece.[10] More elaborate names of the same genre were Ploutod܇ts (Ѵ??) or Ploutodot?r (Ѵ?) meaning \\"giver of wealth\\".[11]\\r\\nEpithets of Hades include Agesander (??ϫѴ?) and Agesilaos (?ۚ?ϫ?),[12] both from g (?, \\"lead\\", \\"carry\\" or \\"fetch\\") and an?r (??, \\"man\\") or laos (ϫ??, \\"men\\" or \\"people\\"), describing Hades as the god who carries away all.[13][14][15][16] Nicander uses the form Hegesilaus (?ۚ?ϫ?).[17] He was also referred to as Zeus Katachthonios (? ϫϫĲ?),[18] meaning \\"the Zeus of the Underworld\\", by those avoiding his actual name, as he had complete control over the Underworld.[19]\\r\\nIn Greek mythology, Hades, the god of the underworld, was a son of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. He had three sisters, Demeter, Hestia, and Hera, as well as two brothers, Zeus, the youngest of the three, and Poseidon. Upon reaching adulthood, Zeus managed to force his father to disgorge his siblings. After their release, the six younger gods, along with allies they managed to gather, challenged the elder gods for power in the Titanomachy, a divine war. The war lasted for ten years and ended with the victory of the younger gods. Following their victory, according to a single famous passage in the Iliad (xv.187ÿ93), Hades and his two brothers, Poseidon and Zeus, drew lots[20] for realms to rule. Zeus received the sky, Poseidon received the seas, and Hades received the underworld,[21] the unseen realm to which the souls of the dead go upon leaving the world as well as any and all things beneath the earth. Some myths suggest that Hades was dissatisfied with his turnout, but had no choice and moved to his new realm.[22]\\r\\nHades obtained his wife and queen, Persephone, through abduction at the behest of Zeus. This myth is the most important one Hades takes part in;[23] it also connected the Eleusinian Mysteries with the Olympian pantheon, particularly as represented in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, which is the oldest story of the abduction, most likely dating back to the beginning of the 6th Century BC.[10] Helios told the grieving Demeter that Hades was not unworthy as a consort for Persephone:\\r\\nAidoneus, the Ruler of Many, is no unfitting husband among the deathless gods for your child, being your own brother and born of the same stock: also, for honor, he has that third share which he received when division was made at the first, and is appointed lord of those among whom he dwells.\\r\\nDespite modern connotations of death as evil, Hades was actually more altruistically inclined in mythology. Hades was often portrayed as passive rather than evil; his role was often maintaining relative balance. That said, he was also depicted as cold and stern, and he held all of his subjects equally accountable to his laws.[25] Any other individual aspects of his personality are not given, as Greeks refrained from giving him much thought to avoid attracting his attention.[19]\\r\\nHades ruled the dead, assisted by others over whom he had complete authority. The House of Hades was described as full of \\"guests,\\" though he rarely left the Underworld.[26] He cared little about what happened in the Upperworld, as his primary attention was ensuring none of his subjects ever left.\\r\\nHe strictly forbade his subjects to leave his domain and would become quite enraged when anyone tried to leave, or if someone tried to steal the souls from his realm. His wrath was equally terrible for anyone who tried to cheat death or otherwise crossed him, as Sisyphus and Pirithous found out to their sorrow. While usually indifferent to his subjects, Hades was very focused on the punishment of these two people; particularly Pirithous, as he entered the underworld in an attempt to steal Persephone for himself, and consequently was forced onto the \\"Chair of Forgetfulness\\".[19] Another myth is about the Roman god Asclepius who was originally a demigod, fathered by Apollo and birthed by Coronis, a Thessalian princess. During his lifetime, he became a famous and talented physician, who eventually was able to bring the dead back to life. Feeling cheated, Plouton persuaded Zeus to kill him with a thunderbolt. After his death, he was brought to Olympus where he became a god.[27] Hades was only depicted outside of the Underworld once in myth, and even that is believed to have been an instance where he had just left the gates of the Underworld, which was when Heracles shot him with an arrow as Hades was attempting to defend the city of Plyus.[3] After he was shot, however, he traveled to Olympus to heal. Besides Heracles, the only other living people who ventured to the Underworld were also heroes: Odysseus, Aeneas (accompanied by the Sibyl), Orpheus, who Hades showed uncharacteristic mercy towards at Persephone's persuasion, who was moved by Orpheus' music,[28] Theseus with Pirithous, and, in a late romance, Psyche. None of them were pleased with what they witnessed in the realm of the dead. In particular, the Greek war hero Achilles, whom Odysseus conjured with a blood libation, said:\\r\\nO shining Odysseus, never try to console me for dying.\\r\\nI would rather follow the plow as thrall to another\\r\\nman, one with no land allotted to him and not much to live on,\\r\\nthan be a king over all the perished dead.\\r\\nHades, as the god of the dead, was a fearsome figure to those still living; in no hurry to meet him, they were reluctant to swear oaths in his name, and averted their faces when sacrificing to him. Since to many, simply to say the word \\"Hades\\" was frightening, euphemisms were pressed into use. Since precious minerals come from under the earth (i.e., the \\"underworld\\" ruled by Hades), he was considered to have control of these as well, and was referred to as ? (Plouton, related to the word for \\"wealth\\"), Latinized as Pluto. Sophocles explained the notion of referring to Hades as \\"the rich one\\" with these words: \\"the gloomy Hades enriches himself with our sighs and our tears.\\" In addition, he was called Clymenus (\\"notorious\\"), Polydegmon (\\"who receives many\\"), and perhaps Eubuleus (\\"good counsel\\" or \\"well-intentioned\\"),[29] all of them euphemisms for a name that was unsafe to pronounce, which evolved into epithets.\\r\\nHe spent most of the time in his dark realm. Formidable in battle, he proved his ferocity in the famous Titanomachy, the battle of the Olympians versus the Titans, which established the rule of Zeus.\\r\\nFeared and loathed, Hades embodied the inexorable finality of death: \\"Why do we loathe Hades more than any god, if not because he is so adamantine and unyielding?\\" The rhetorical question is Agamemnon's.[30] He was not, however, an evil god, for although he was stern, cruel, and unpitying, he was still just. Hades ruled the Underworld and was therefore most often associated with death and feared by men, but he was not Death itself  the actual embodiment of Death was Thanatos, although Euripides' play \\"Alkestis\\" states fairly clearly that Thanatos and Hades were one and the same deity, and gives an interesting description of him as dark-cloaked and winged[31]; moreover, Hades was also referred to as \\"Hesperos Theos\\" (\\"God of Death and Darkness\\")[32].\\r\\nWhen the Greeks propitiated Hades, they banged their hands on the ground to be sure he would hear them.[33] Black animals, such as sheep, were sacrificed to him, and the very vehemence of the rejection of human sacrifice expressed in myth suggests an unspoken memory of some distant past.[citation needed] The blood from all chthonic sacrifices including those to propitiate Hades dripped into a pit or cleft in the ground. The person who offered the sacrifice had to avert his face.[34]\\r\\nOne ancient source says that he possessed the Cap of invisibility. His chariot, drawn by four black horses, made for a fearsome and impressive sight. His other ordinary attributes were the narcissus and cypress plants, the Key of Hades and Cerberus, the three-headed dog.[35] In certain portraits, snakes also appeared to be attributed to Hades[36] as he was occasionally portrayed to be either holding them or accompanied by them. This is believed to hold significance as in certain classical sources Hades ravished Kore in the guise of a snake, who went on to give birth to Zagreus-Dionysus[37]. While bearing the name 'Zeus', Zeus Olympios, the great king of the gods, noticeably differs from the Zeus Meilichios, a decidedly Chthonian character, often portrayed as a snake, and as seen beforehand, they cannot be different manifestations of the same god, in fact whenever 'another Zeus' is mentioned, this always refers to Hades[38]. Zeus Meilichios and Zeus Eubouleus are often referred to being alternate names for Hades[39].\\r\\nThe philosopher Heraclitus, unifying opposites, declared that Hades and Dionysus, the very essence of indestructible life (zo?), are the same god.[40] Among other evidence Kernyi notes that the grieving goddess Demeter refused to drink wine, which is the gift of Dionysus, after Persephone's abduction, because of this association, and suggests that Hades may in fact have been a \\"cover name\\" for the underworld Dionysus.[41] He suggests that this dual identity may have been familiar to those who came into contact with the Mysteries.[42] One of the epithets of Dionysus was \\"Chthonios\\", meaning \\"the subterranean\\".[43] The role of unifying Hades, Zeus and Dionysus as a single tripartite god was used to represent the birth, death and resurrection of a deity and to unify the 'shining' realm of Zeus and the dark underworld realm of Hades[44].\\r\\nHades was depicted so infrequently in artwork, as well as mythology, because the Greeks were so afraid of him.[19] His artistic representations, which are generally found in Archaic pottery, are not even concretely thought of as the deity; however at this point in time it is heavily believed that the figures illustrated are indeed Hades.[10] He was later presented in the classical arts in the depictions of the Rape of Persephone.[45] Within these illustrations, Hades was often young, yet he was also shown as varying ages in other works.[10] Due to this lack of depictions, there weren't very strict guidelines when representing the deity.[10] On pottery, he has a dark beard and is presented as a stately figure on an \\"ebony throne.\\"[22] His attributes in art include a scepter, cornucopia, rooster,[46] and a key, which both represented his control over the underworld and acted as a reminder that the gates of the Underworld were always locked so that souls could not leave.[47] Even if the doors were open, Cerberus, the three-headed guard dog of the Underworld, ensured that while all souls were allowed to enter into The Underworld freely, none could ever escape.[48] The dog is often portrayed next to the god as a means of easy identification, since no other deity relates to it so directly. Sometimes, artists painted Hades as looking away from the other gods, as he was disliked by them as well as humans.[10]\\r\\nAs Plouton, he was regarded in a more positive light. He holds a cornucopia, representing the gifts he bestows upon people as well as fertility, which he becomes connected to.[10]\\r\\nThe consort of Hades was Persephone, represented by the Greeks as the beautiful daughter of Demeter.[49]\\r\\nPersephone did not submit to Hades willingly, but was abducted by him while picking flowers in the fields of Nysa. In protest of his act, Demeter cast a curse on the land and there was a great famine; though, one by one, the gods came to request she lift it, lest mankind perish, she asserted that the earth would remain barren until she saw her daughter again. Finally, Zeus intervened; via Hermes, he requested that Hades return Persephone. Hades complied,\\r\\nBut he on his part secretly gave her sweet pomegranate seed to eat, taking care for himself that she might not remain continually with grave, dark-robed Demeter.\\r\\nDemeter questioned Persephone on her return to light and air:\\r\\n...but if you have tasted food, you must go back again beneath the secret places of the earth, there to dwell a third part of the seasons every year: yet for the two parts you shall be with me and the other deathless gods.\\r\\nThis bound her to Hades and the Underworld, much to the dismay of Demeter. It is not clear whether Persephone was accomplice to the ploy. Zeus proposed a compromise, to which all parties agreed: of the year, Persephone would spend one third with her husband.[52]\\r\\nIt is during this time that winter casts on the earth \\"an aspect of sadness and mourning.\\"[53]\\r\\nTheseus and Pirithous pledged to kidnap and marry daughters of Zeus. Theseus chose Helen and together they kidnapped her and decided to hold onto her until she was old enough to marry. Pirithous chose Persephone. They left Helen with Theseus' mother, Aethra, and traveled to the Underworld. Hades knew of their plan to capture his wife, so he pretended to offer them hospitality and set a feast; as soon as the pair sat down, snakes coiled around their feet and held them there. Theseus was eventually rescued by Heracles but Pirithous remained trapped as punishment for daring to seek the wife of a god for his own.\\r\\nHeracles' final labour was to capture Cerberus. First, Heracles went to Eleusis to be initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries. He did this to absolve himself of guilt for killing the centaurs and to learn how to enter and exit the underworld alive. He found the entrance to the underworld at Taenarum. Athena and Hermes helped him through and back from Hades. Heracles asked Hades for permission to take Cerberus. Hades agreed as long as Heracles didn't harm Cerberus. When Heracles dragged the dog out of Hades, he passed through the cavern Acherusia.\\r\\nThe nymph Minthe, associated with the river Cocytus, loved by Hades, was turned into the mint plant, by a jealous Persephone.[54]\\r\\nIn older Greek myths, the realm of Hades is the misty and gloomy[55] abode of the dead (also called Erebus[55]) where all mortals go when they die. Very few mortals could leave Hades once they entered. The exceptions, Heracles and Theseus, are heroic.[citation needed] Even Odysseus in his Nekyia (Odyssey, xi) calls up the spirits of the departed, rather than descend to them. Later Greek philosophy introduced the idea that all mortals are judged after death and are either rewarded or cursed.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere were several sections of the realm of Hades, including Elysium, the Asphodel Meadows, and Tartarus. Greek mythographers were not perfectly consistent about the geography of the afterlife. A contrasting myth of the afterlife concerns the Garden of the Hesperides, often identified with the Isles of the Blessed, where the blessed heroes may dwell.\\r\\nIn Roman mythology, the entrance to the Underworld located at Avernus, a crater near Cumae, was the route Aeneas used to descend to the realm of the dead.[56] By synecdoche, \\"Avernus\\" could be substituted for the underworld as a whole. The di inferi were a collective of underworld divinities.\\r\\nFor Hellenes, the deceased entered the underworld by crossing the Styx, ferried across by Charon kair'-on), who charged an obolus, a small coin for passage placed in the mouth of the deceased by pious relatives. Paupers and the friendless gathered for a hundred years on the near shore according to Book VI of Vergil's Aeneid. Greeks offered propitiatory libations to prevent the deceased from returning to the upper world to \\"haunt\\" those who had not given them a proper burial. The far side of the river was guarded by Cerberus, the three-headed dog defeated by Heracles (Roman Hercules). Passing beyond Cerberus, the shades of the departed entered the land of the dead to be judged.\\r\\nThe five rivers of the realm of Hades, and their symbolic meanings, are Acheron (the river of sorrow, or woe), Cocytus (lamentation), Phlegethon (fire), Lethe (oblivion), and Styx (hate), the river upon which even the gods swore and in which Achilles was dipped to render him invincible. The Styx forms the boundary between the upper and lower worlds. See also Eridanos.\\r\\nThe first region of Hades comprises the Fields of Asphodel, described in Odyssey xi, where the shades of heroes wander despondently among lesser spirits, who twitter around them like bats. Only libations of blood offered to them in the world of the living can reawaken in them for a time the sensations of humanity.\\r\\nBeyond lay Erebus, which could be taken for a euphonym of Hades, whose own name was dread. There were two pools, that of Lethe, where the common souls flocked to erase all memory, and the pool of Mnemosyne (\\"memory\\"), where the initiates of the Mysteries drank instead. In the forecourt of the palace of Hades and Persephone sit the three judges of the Underworld: Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Aeacus. There at the trivium sacred to Hecate, where three roads meet, souls are judged, returned to the Fields of Asphodel if they are neither virtuous nor evil, sent by the road to Tartarus if they are impious or evil, or sent to Elysium (Islands of the Blessed) with the \\"blameless\\" heroes.\\r\\nIn the Sibylline oracles, a curious hodgepodge of Greco-Roman and Judaeo-Christian elements, Hades again appears as the abode of the dead, and by way of folk etymology, it even derives Hades from the name Adam (the first man), saying it is because he was the first to enter there.[57] Owing to its appearance in the New Testament of the Bible, Hades also has a distinct meaning in Christianity.","input":"Who is the oldest of zeus poseidon and hades?"},{"output":"the Book of Exodus","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses (/?mo?z?z, -z?s/)[2][Note 1] was a prophet in the Abrahamic religions. According to the Hebrew Bible, he was adopted by an Egyptian princess, and later in life became the leader of the Israelites and lawgiver, to whom the authorship of the Torah, or acquisition of the Torah from Heaven is traditionally attributed. Also called Moshe Rabbenu in Hebrew (?????? ????????, lit. \\"Moses our Teacher\\"), he is the most important prophet in Judaism.[3][4] He is also an important prophet in Christianity, Islam, the Bah' Faith, and a number of other Abrahamic religions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Book of Exodus, Moses was born in a time when his people, the Israelites, an enslaved minority, were increasing in numbers and the Egyptian Pharaoh was worried that they might ally themselves with Egypt's enemies.[5] Moses' Hebrew mother, Jochebed, secretly hid him when the Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed in order to reduce the population of the Israelites. Through the Pharaoh's daughter (identified as Queen Bithia in the Midrash), the child was adopted as a foundling from the Nile river and grew up with the Egyptian royal family. After killing an Egyptian slavemaster (because the slavemaster was smiting a Hebrew), Moses fled across the Red Sea to Midian, where he encountered The Angel of the Lord,[6] speaking to him from within a burning bush on Mount Horeb (which he regarded as the Mountain of God).\\r\\n\\r\\nGod sent Moses back to Egypt to demand the release of the Israelites from slavery. Moses said that he could not speak eloquently,[7] so God allowed Aaron, his brother, to become his spokesperson. After the Ten Plagues, Moses led the Exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt and across the Red Sea, after which they based themselves at Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Ten Commandments. After 40 years of wandering in the desert, Moses died within sight of the Promised Land on Mount Nebo.\\r\\n\\r\\nScholarly consensus sees Moses as a legendary figure and not a historical person.[8] Rabbinic Judaism calculated a lifespan of Moses corresponding to 1391ÿ1271 BCE;[9] Jerome gives 1592 BCE,[10] and James Ussher 1571 BCE as his birth year.[11][Note 2] In the Book of Deuteronomy, Moses was mentioned as \\"the man of God.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Biblical account of Moses' birth provides him with a folk etymology to explain the ostensible meaning of his name.[15][16]  He is said to have received it from the Pharaoh's daughter: \\"he became her son. She named him Moses (Moshe), saying, 'I drew him out (meshitihu) of the water.'\\"[17][18] This explanation links it to a verb mashah, meaning \\"to draw out\\", which makes the Pharaoh's daughter's declaration a play on words.[18][19] The princess made a grammatical mistake which is prophetic of his future role in legend, as someone who will \\"draw the people of Israel out of Egypt through the waters of the Red Sea.\\"[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral etymologies have been proposed. An Egyptian root msy, \\"child of\\", has been considered as a possible etymology, arguably an abbreviation of a theophoric name, as for example in Egyptian names like Thutmoses (Thoth created him) and Ramesses (Ra created him),[15] with the god's name omitted. Abraham Yahuda, based on the spelling given in the Tanakh, argues that it combines \\"water\\" or \\"seed\\" and \\"pond, expanse of water\\", thus yielding the sense of \\"child of the Nile\\" (mw-?e).[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hebrew etymology in the Biblical story may reflect an attempt to cancel out traces of Moses' Egyptian origins.[20] The Egyptian character of his name was recognized as such by ancient Jewish writers like Philo of Alexandria and Josephus.[20] Philo linked Mss (߻ҿ??) to the Egyptian (Coptic) word for water (mou/?), while Josephus, in his Antiquities of the Jews, claimed that the second element, -ess, meant 'those who are saved'. The problem of how an Egyptian princess, known to Josephus as Thermutis (identified as Tharmuth)[18] and in later Jewish tradition as Bithiah,[22] could have known Hebrew puzzled medieval Jewish commentators like Abraham ibn Ezra and Hezekiah ben Manoah, known also as Hizkuni. Hizkuni suggested she either converted or took a tip from Jochebed.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Israelites had settled in the Land of Goshen in the time of Joseph and Jacob, but a new pharaoh arose who oppressed the children of Israel. At this time Moses was born to his father Amram, son of Kehath the Levite, who entered Egypt with Jacob's household; his mother was Jochebed (also Yocheved), who was kin to Kehath. Moses had one older (by seven years) sister, Miriam, and one older (by three years) brother, Aaron.[Note 3]\\r\\nThe Pharaoh had commanded that all male Hebrew children born would be drowned in the river Nile, but Moses' mother placed him in an ark and concealed the ark in the bulrushes by the riverbank, where the baby was discovered and adopted by Pharaoh's daughter, and raised as an Egyptian. One day after Moses had reached adulthood he killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew. Moses, in order to escape the Pharaoh's death penalty, fled to Midian (a desert country south of Judah), where he married Zipporah.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere, on Mount Horeb, God appeared to Moses as a burning bush revealed to Moses his name YHWH (probably pronounced Yahweh)[26] and commanded him to return to Egypt and bring his chosen people (Israel) out of bondage and into the Promised Land (Canaan).[27]  During the journey, God tried to kill Moses, but Zipporah saved his life. Moses returned to carry out God's command, but God caused the Pharaoh to refuse, and only after God had subjected Egypt to ten plagues did the Pharaoh relent. Moses led the Israelites to the border of Egypt, but there God hardened the Pharaoh's heart once more, so that he could destroy the Pharaoh and his army at the Red Sea Crossing as a sign of his power to Israel and the nations.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Egypt, Moses led the Israelites to biblical Mount Sinai, where he was given the Ten Commandments from God, written on stone tablets. However, since Moses remained a long time on the mountain, some of the people feared that he might be dead, so they made a statue of a golden calf and worshiped it, thus disobeying and angering God and Moses. Moses, out of anger, broke the tablets, and later ordered the elimination of those who had worshiped the golden statue, which was melted down and fed to the idolaters.[29] He also wrote the ten commandments on a new set of tablets. Later at Mount Sinai, Moses and the elders entered into a covenant, by which Israel would become the people of YHWH, obeying his laws, and YHWH would be their god. Moses delivered the laws of God to Israel, instituted the priesthood under the sons of Moses' brother Aaron, and destroyed those Israelites who fell away from his worship. In his final act at Sinai, God gave Moses instructions for the Tabernacle, the mobile shrine by which he would travel with Israel to the Promised Land.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Sinai, Moses led the Israelites to the Desert of Paran on the border of Canaan. From there he sent twelve spies into the land. The spies returned with samples of the land's fertility, but warned that its inhabitants were giants.  The people were afraid and wanted to return to Egypt, and some rebelled against Moses and against God.  Moses told the Israelites that they were not worthy to inherit the land, and would wander the wilderness for forty years until the generation who had refused to enter Canaan had died, so that it would be their children who would possess the land.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the forty years had passed, Moses led the Israelites east around the Dead Sea to the territories of Edom and Moab.  There they escaped the temptation of idolatry, received God's blessing through Balaam the prophet, and massacred the Midianites, who by the end of the Exodus journey had become the enemies of the Israelites. Moses was twice given notice that he would die before entry to the Promised Land: in Numbers 27:13, once he had seen the Promised Land from a viewpoint on Mount Abarim, and again in Numbers 31:1 once battle with the Midianites had been won.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the banks of the Jordan River, in sight of the land, Moses assembled the tribes. After recalling their wanderings he delivered God's laws by which they must live in the land, sang a song of praise and pronounced a blessing on the people, and passed his authority to Joshua, under whom they would possess the land.  Moses then went up Mount Nebo to the top of Pisgah, looked over the promised land of Israel spread out before him, and died, at the age of one hundred and twenty. More humble than any other man (Num. 12:3), \\"there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom YHWH knew face to face\\" (Deuteronomy 34:10). The New Testament states that after Moses' death, Michael the Archangel and the Devil disputed over his body (Epistle of Jude 1:9).\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses is honoured among Jews today as the \\"lawgiver of Israel\\", and he delivers several sets of laws in the course of the four books. The first is the Covenant Code (Exodus 20:19ÿ23:33), the terms of the covenant which God offers to the Israelites at biblical Mount Sinai. Embedded in the covenant are the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments, Exodus 20:1ÿ17) and the Book of the Covenant (Exodus 20:22ÿ23:19).[32] The entire Book of Leviticus constitutes a second body of law, the Book of Numbers begins with yet another set, and the Book of Deuteronomy another.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses has traditionally been regarded as the author of those four books and the Book of Genesis, which together comprise the Torah, the first and most revered section of the Hebrew Bible.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern scholarly consensus is that the figure of Moses is legendary, and not historical,[8] although a \\"Moses-like figure may have existed somewhere in the southern Transjordan in the mid-late 13th century B.C.\\"[33] Certainly no Egyptian sources mention Moses or the events of Exodus-Deuteronomy, nor has any archaeological evidence been discovered in Egypt or the Sinai wilderness to support the story in which he is the central figure.[34] The story of his discovery picks up a familiar motif in ancient Near Eastern mythological accounts of the ruler who rises from humble origins: Thus Sargon of Akkad's Akkadian account of his origins runs;\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother, the high priestess, conceived; in secret she bore me\\r\\nShe set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid\\r\\nShe cast me into the river which rose over me.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tradition of Moses as a lawgiver and culture hero of the Israelites may go back to the 7th-century BCE sources of the Deuteronomist, which might conserve earlier traditions. Kenneth Kitchen, described as a distinguished but lonely voice among British Egyptologists on the subject,[36] argues that there is an historic core behind the Exodus, with Egyptian corve labour exacted from Hebrews during the imperialist control exercised by the Egyptian Empire over Canaan from the time of the Thutmosides down to the revolt against Merneptah and Rameses III.[37] Kitchen argued that there is a lack of factual evidence to deny his existence.[38] Martin Noth called the Deuteronomic description of Moses' burial a lone historical tradition.[39] William Albright believed in the essential historicity of the biblical tales of Moses and the Exodus, accepting however that the core narrative had been overlaid by legendary accretions.[40] Biblical minimalists such as Philip R. Davies and Niels Peter Lemche regard all biblical books, and the stories of an Exodus, united monarchy, exile and return as fictions composed by a social elite in Yehud in the Persian period or even later, the purpose being to legitimize a return to indigenous roots.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the imposing fame associated with Moses, no source mentions him until he emerges in texts associated with the Babylonian exile.[40] A theory developed by Cornelius Tiele in 1872, which had proved influential, argued that Yahweh was a Midianite god, introduced to the Israelites by Moses,  whose father-in-law Jethro was a Midianite priest.[42] It was to such a Moses that Yahweh reveals his real name, hidden from the Patriarchs who knew him only as El Shaddai.[43] Against this view is the modern consensus that most of the Israelites were native to Palestine.[44] Martin Noth argued that the Pentateuch uses the figure of Moses, originally linked to legends of a Transjordan conquest, as a narrative bracket or late reductional device to weld together 4 of the 5, originally independent, themes of that work.[40][45]\\r\\nManfred G?rg[46] and Rolf Krauss,[47] the latter in a somewhat sensationalist manner,[48]  have suggested that the Moses story is a distortion or transmogrification of the historical pharaoh Amenmose (ca. 1200 BCE), who was dismissed from office and whose name was later simplified to msy (Mose). Aidan Dodson regards this hypothesis as \\"intriguing, but beyond proof.\\"[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name King Mesha of Moab has been linked to that of Moses. Mesha also is associated with narratives of an exodus and a conquest, and several motifs in stories about him are shared with the Exodus tale and that regarding Israel's war with Moab (2 Kings 3). Moab rebels against oppression, like Moses, leads his people out of Israel, as Moses does from Egypt, and his first-born son is slaughtered at the wall of Kir-hareseth as the firstborn of Israel are condemned to slaughter in the Exodus story, \\"an infernal passover that delivers Mesha while wrath burns against his enemies\\".[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Egyptian version of the tale that crosses over with the Moses story is found in Manetho who,  according to the summary in Josephus, wrote that a certain Osarseph, a Heliopolitan priest, became overseer of a band of lepers, when Amenophis, following indications by Amenhotep, son of Hapu, had all the lepers in Egypt quarantined in order to cleanse the land so that he might see the gods. The lepers are bundled into Avaris, the former capital of the Hyksos, where Osarseph prescribes for them everything forbidden in Egypt, while proscribing everything permitted in Egypt. They invite the Hyksos to reinvade Egypt, rule with them for 13 years ÿ Osarseph then assumes the name Moses - and are then driven out.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-biblical writings about Jews, with references to the role of Moses, first appear at the beginning of the Hellenistic period, from 323?BCE to about 146?BCE. Shmuel notes that \\"a characteristic of this literature is the high honour in which it holds the peoples of the East in general and some specific groups among these peoples.\\"[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the Judeo-Roman or Judeo-Hellenic historians Artapanus, Eupolemus, Josephus, and Philo, a few non-Jewish historians including Hecataeus of Abdera (quoted by Diodorus Siculus), Alexander Polyhistor, Manetho, Apion, Chaeremon of Alexandria, Tacitus and Porphyry also make reference to him. The extent to which any of these accounts rely on earlier sources is unknown.[53] Moses also appears in other religious texts such as the Mishnah (c.?200?CE), Midrash (200ÿ1200?CE),[54] and the Quran (c. 610ÿ53).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure of Osarseph in Hellenistic historiography is a renegade Egyptian priest who leads an army of lepers against the pharaoh and is finally expelled from Egypt, changing his name to Moses.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest existing reference to Moses in Greek literature occurs in the Egyptian history of Hecataeus of Abdera (4th?century?BCE). All that remains of his description of Moses are two references made by Diodorus Siculus, wherein, writes historian Arthur Droge, he \\"describes Moses as a wise and courageous leader who left Egypt and colonized Judaea.\\"[55]  Among the many accomplishments described by Hecataeus, Moses had founded cities, established a temple and religious cult, and issued laws:\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the establishment of settled life in Egypt in early times, which took place, according to the mythical account, in the period of the gods and heroes, the first... to persuade the multitudes to use written laws was Mneves [Moses], a man not only great of soul but also in his life the most public-spirited of all lawgivers whose names are recorded.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nDroge also points out that this statement by Hecataeus was similar to statements made subsequently by Eupolemus.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jewish historian Artapanus of Alexandria (2nd century BCE), portrayed Moses as a cultural hero, alien to the Pharaonic court. According to theologian John Barclay, the Moses of Artapanus \\"clearly bears the destiny of the Jews, and in his personal, cultural and military splendor, brings credit to the whole Jewish people.\\"[56]\\r\\n\\r\\n Jealousy of Moses' excellent qualities induced Chenephres to send him with unskilled troops on a military expedition to Ethiopia, where he won great victories. After having built the city of Hermopolis, he taught the people the value of the ibis as a protection against the serpents, making the bird the sacred guardian spirit of the city; then he introduced circumcision. After his return to Memphis, Moses taught the people the value of oxen for agriculture, and the consecration of the same by Moses gave rise to the cult of Apis. Finally, after having escaped another plot by killing the assailant sent by the king, Moses fled to Arabia, where he married the daughter of Raguel [Jethro], the ruler of the district.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nArtapanus goes on to relate how Moses returns to Egypt with Aaron, and is imprisoned, but miraculously escapes through the name of YHWH in order to lead the Exodus. This account further testifies that all Egyptian temples of Isis thereafter contained a rod, in remembrance of that used for Moses' miracles. He describes Moses as 80 years old, \\"tall and ruddy, with long white hair, and dignified.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome historians, however, point out the \\"apologetic nature of much of Artapanus' work,\\"[58] with his addition of extra-biblical details, such as his references to Jethro: the non-Jewish Jethro expresses admiration for Moses' gallantry in helping his daughters, and chooses to adopt Moses as his son.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nStrabo, a Greek historian, geographer and philosopher, in his Geographica (c.?24?CE), wrote in detail about Moses, whom he considered to be an Egyptian who deplored the situation in his homeland, and thereby attracted many followers who respected the deity. He writes, for example, that Moses opposed the picturing of the deity in the form of man or animal, and was convinced that the deity was an entity which encompassed everything ÿ land and sea:[60]\\r\\n\\r\\n35. An Egyptian priest named Moses, who possessed a portion of the country called the Lower Egypt, being dissatisfied with the established institutions there, left it and came to Judaea with a large body of people who worshipped the Divinity. He declared and taught that the Egyptians and Africans entertained erroneous sentiments, in representing the Divinity under the likeness of wild beasts and cattle of the field; that the Greeks also were in error in making images of their gods after the human form. For God [said he] may be this one thing which encompasses us all, land and sea, which we call heaven, or the universe, or the nature of things....\\r\\n\\r\\n36. By such doctrine Moses persuaded a large body of right-minded persons to accompany him to the place where Jerusalem now stands....[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Strabo's writings of the history of Judaism as he understood it, he describes various stages in its development: from the first stage, including Moses and his direct heirs; to the final stage where \\"the Temple of Jerusalem continued to be surrounded by an aura of sanctity.\\"  Strabo's \\"positive and unequivocal appreciation of Moses' personality is among the most sympathetic in all ancient literature.\\"[62] His portrayal of Moses is said to be similar to the writing of Hecataeus who \\"described Moses as a man who excelled in wisdom and courage.\\"[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nEgyptologist Jan Assmann concludes that Strabo was the historian \\"who came closest to a construction of Moses' religion as monotheistic and as a pronounced counter-religion.\\" It recognized \\"only one divine being whom no image can represent... [and] the only way to approach this god is to live in virtue and in justice.\\"[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Roman historian Tacitus (c. 56ÿ120?CE) refers to Moses by noting that the Jewish religion was monotheistic and without a clear image. His primary work, wherein he describes Jewish philosophy, is his Histories (c. 100), where, according to Arthur Murphy, as a result of the Jewish worship of one God, \\"pagan mythology fell into contempt.\\"[64] Tacitus states that, despite various opinions current in his day regarding the Jews' ethnicity, most of his sources are in agreement that there was an Exodus from Egypt. By his account, the Pharaoh Bocchoris, suffering from a plague, banished the Jews in response to an oracle of the god Zeus-Amun.\\r\\n\\r\\n A motley crowd was thus collected and abandoned in the desert. While all the other outcasts lay idly lamenting, one of them, named Moses, advised them not to look for help to gods or men, since both had deserted them, but to trust rather in themselves, and accept as divine the guidance of the first being, by whose aid they should get out of their present plight.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this version, Moses and the Jews wander through the desert for only six days, capturing the Holy Land on the seventh.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Septuagint, the Greek version of the Hebrew Bible, influenced Longinus, who may have been the author of the great book of literary criticism, On the Sublime. The date of composition is unknown, but it is commonly assigned to the late Ist century C.E.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe writer quotes Genesis in a \\"style which presents the nature of the deity in a manner suitable to his pure and great being,\\" however he does not mention Moses by name, calling him 'no chance person' (? ? ? ??) but \\"the Lawgiver\\" (ĲĲ??, thesmothete) of the Jews,\\" a term that puts him on a par with Lycurgus and Minos.[67]  Aside from a reference to Cicero, Moses is the only non-Greek writer quoted in the work, contextually he is put on a par with Homer,[68] and he is described \\"with far more admiration than even Greek writers who treated Moses with respect, such as Hecataeus and Strabo.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Josephus' (37 ÿ c.?100 CE) Antiquities of the Jews,  Moses is mentioned throughout. For example Book VIII Ch. IV, describes Solomon's Temple, also known as the First Temple, at the time the Ark of the Covenant was first moved into the newly built temple:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen King Solomon had finished these works, these large and beautiful buildings, and had laid up his donations in the temple, and all this in the interval of seven years, and had given a demonstration of his riches and alacrity therein; ...he also wrote to the rulers and elders of the Hebrews, and ordered all the people to gather themselves together to Jerusalem, both to see the temple which he had built, and to remove the ark of God into it; and when this invitation of the whole body of the people to come to Jerusalem was everywhere carried abroad, ...The Feast of Tabernacles happened to fall at the same time, which was kept by the Hebrews as a most holy and most eminent feast. So they carried the ark and the tabernacle which Moses had pitched, and all the vessels that were for ministration to the sacrifices of God, and removed them to the temple. ...Now the ark contained nothing else but those two tables of stone that preserved the ten commandments, which God spake to Moses in Mount Sinai, and which were engraved upon them...[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Feldman, Josephus also attaches particular significance to Moses' possession of the \\"cardinal virtues of wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice.\\" He also includes piety as an added fifth virtue. In addition, he \\"stresses Moses' willingness to undergo toil and his careful avoidance of bribery. Like Plato's philosopher-king, Moses excels as an educator.\\"[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nNumenius, a Greek philosopher who was a native of Apamea, in Syria, wrote during the latter half of the 2nd century CE. Historian Kennieth Guthrie writes that \\"Numenius is perhaps the only recognized Greek philosopher who explicitly studied Moses, the prophets, and the life of Jesus...\\"[72]  He describes his background:\\r\\n\\r\\nNumenius was a man of the world; he was not limited to Greek and Egyptian mysteries, but talked familiarly of the myths of Brahmins and Magi.  It is however his knowledge and use of the Hebrew scriptures which distinguished him from other Greek philosophers. He refers to Moses simply as \\"the prophet\\", exactly as for him Homer is the poet. Plato is described as a Greek Moses.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Christian saint and religious philosopher Justin Martyr (103ÿ165 CE) drew the same conclusion as Numenius, according to other experts. Theologian Paul Blackham notes that Justin considered Moses to be \\"more trustworthy, profound and truthful because he is older than the Greek philosophers.\\"[74]  He quotes him:\\r\\n\\r\\nI will begin, then, with our first prophet and lawgiver, Moses... that you may know that, of all your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or lawgivers, by far the oldest, as the Greek histories show us, was Moses, who was our first religious teacher.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of what is known about Moses from the Bible comes from the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.[75] The majority of scholars consider the compilation of these books to go back to the Persian period, 538ÿ332?BCE, but based on earlier written and oral traditions.[76][77] There is a wealth of stories and additional information about Moses in the Jewish apocrypha and in the genre of rabbinical exegesis known as Midrash, as well as in the primary works of the Jewish oral law, the Mishnah and the Talmud.  Moses is also given a number of bynames in Jewish tradition. The Midrash identifies Moses as one of seven biblical personalities who were called by various names.[78] Moses' other names were: Jekuthiel (by his mother), Heber (by his father), Jered (by Miriam), Avi Zanoah (by Aaron), Avi Gedor (by Kohath), Avi Soco (by his wet-nurse), Shemaiah ben Nethanel (by people of Israel).[79] Moses is also attributed the names Toviah (as a first name), and Levi (as a family name) (Vayikra Rabbah 1:3), Heman,[80] Mechoqeiq (lawgiver)[81] and Ehl Gav Ish (Numbers 12:3).[82] In another exegesis, Moses had ascended to the first heaven until the seventh, even visited Paradise and Hell alive, after he saw the Divine vision in Mount Horeb.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nJewish historians who lived at Alexandria, such as Eupolemus, attributed to Moses the feat of having taught the Phoenicians their alphabet,[84] similar to legends of Thoth. Artapanus of Alexandria explicitly identified Moses not only with Thoth/Hermes, but also with the Greek figure Musaeus (whom he called \\"the teacher of Orpheus\\"), and ascribed to him the division of Egypt into 36 districts, each with its own liturgy. He named the princess who adopted Moses as Merris, wife of Pharaoh Chenephres.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nJewish tradition considers Moses to be the greatest prophet who ever lived.[86][87] Despite his importance, Judaism stresses that Moses was a human being, and is therefore not to be worshipped.[88] Only God is worthy of worship in Judaism.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Orthodox Jews, Moses is called Moshe Rabbenu, \`Eved HaShem, Avi haNeviim zya\\"a: \\"Our Leader Moshe, Servant of God, Father of all the Prophets (may his merit shield us, amen)\\".[89] In the orthodox view, Moses received not only the Torah, but also the revealed (written and oral) and the hidden (the \`hokhmat nistar teachings, which gave Judaism the Zohar of the Rashbi, the Torah of the Ari haQadosh and all that is discussed in the Heavenly Yeshiva between the Ramhal and his masters).\\r\\n\\r\\nArising in part from his age of death (120 according to Deut. 34:7) and that \\"his eye had not dimmed, and his vigor had not diminished,\\" the phrase \\"may you live to 120\\" has become a common blessing among Jews, especially since 120 is elsewhere stated as the maximum age for Noah's descendants (one interpretation of Genesis 6:3).\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses is mentioned more often in the New Testament than any other Old Testament figure. For Christians, Moses is often a symbol of God's law, as reinforced and expounded on in the teachings of Jesus. New Testament writers often compared Jesus' words and deeds with Moses' to explain Jesus' mission. In Acts 7:39ÿ43, 51ÿ53, for example, the rejection of Moses by the Jews who worshipped the golden calf is likened to the rejection of Jesus by the Jews that continued in traditional Judaism.[90][91]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses also figures in several of Jesus' messages. When he met the Pharisee Nicodemus at night in the third chapter of the Gospel of John, he compared Moses' lifting up of the bronze serpent in the wilderness, which any Israelite could look at and be healed, to his own lifting up (by his death and resurrection) for the people to look at and be healed. In the sixth chapter, Jesus responded to the people's claim that Moses provided them manna in the wilderness by saying that it was not Moses, but God, who provided. Calling himself the \\"bread of life\\", Jesus stated that He was provided to feed God's people.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses, along with Elijah, is presented as meeting with Jesus in all three Gospel accounts of the Transfiguration of Jesus in Matthew 17, Mark 9, and Luke 9, respectively. Jesus refers to the scribes and the Pharisees of the Temple as \\"seated in the chair of Moses\\" (Greek:  ? 翼? ϫĲѴϫ?, epi ts Muses kathedras) [92]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis relevance to modern Christianity has not diminished. Moses is considered to be a saint by several churches; and is commemorated as a prophet in the respective Calendars of Saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Lutheran churches on September 4. In Eastern Orthodox liturgics for September 4, Moses is commemorated as the \\"Holy Prophet and God-seer Moses, on Mount Nebo\\".[93][94][Note 4] The Orthodox Church also commemorates him on the Sunday of the Forefathers, two Sundays before the Nativity.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Armenian Apostolic Church commemorates him as one of the Holy Forefathers in their Calendar of Saints on July 30.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (colloquially called Mormons) generally view Moses in the same way that other Christians do. However, in addition to accepting the biblical account of Moses, Mormons include Selections from the Book of Moses as part of their scriptural canon.[98] This book is believed to be the translated writings of Moses, and is included in the Pearl of Great Price.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nLatter-day Saints are also unique in believing that Moses was taken to heaven without having tasted death (translated). In addition, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery stated that on April 3, 1836, Moses appeared to them in the Kirtland Temple (located in Kirtland, Ohio) in a glorified, immortal, physical form and bestowed upon them the \\"keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of the north.\\"[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses is mentioned more in the Quran than any other individual and his life is narrated and recounted more than that of any other Islamic prophet.[101]  In general, Moses is described in ways which parallel the Islamic prophet Muhammad,[102] and \\"his character exhibits some of the main themes of Islamic theology,\\" including the \\"moral injunction that we are to submit ourselves to God.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses is defined in the Quran as both prophet (nabi) and messenger (rasul), the latter term indicating that he was one of those prophets who brought a scripture and law to his people.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nHuston Smith describes an account in the Quran of meetings in heaven between Moses and Muhammad, which Huston states were \\"one of the crucial events in Muhammad's life,\\" and resulted in Muslims observing 5 daily prayers.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses is mentioned 502 times in the Quran; passages mentioning Moses include 2.49ÿ61, 7.103ÿ160, 10.75ÿ93, 17.101ÿ104, 20.9ÿ97, 26.10ÿ66, 27.7ÿ14, 28.3ÿ46, 40.23ÿ30, 43.46ÿ55, 44.17ÿ31, and 79.15ÿ25. and many others. Most of the key events in Moses' life which are narrated in the Bible are to be found dispersed through the different Surahs of the Quran, with a story about meeting Khidr which is not found in the Bible.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Moses story related by the Quran, Jochebed is commanded by God to place Moses in an ark and cast him on the waters of the Nile, thus abandoning him completely to God's protection.[101][104] The Pharaoh's wife Asiya, not his daughter, found Moses floating in the waters of the Nile. She convinced the Pharaoh to keep him as their son because they were not blessed with any children.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Quran's account has emphasized Moses' mission to invite the Pharaoh to accept God's divine message[105] as well as give salvation to the Israelites.[101][106] According to the Quran, Moses encourages the Israelites to enter Canaan, but they are unwilling to fight the Canaanites, fearing certain defeat. Moses responds by pleading to Allah that he and his brother Aaron be separated from the rebellious Israelites. After which the Israelites are made to wander for 40 years.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Islamic tradition, Moses is buried at Maqam El-Nabi Musa, Jericho.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses is one of the most important of God's messengers in the Bah' Faith being designated a Manifestation of God.[108] An epithet of Moses in Baha'i scriptures is the One Who Conversed with God.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nImportant figures in the Bahai religion, such as Abdull-Baha, have highlighted the fact that Moses, like Abraham, had none of the makings of a great man of history, but through God's assistance he was able achieve many great things. He is described as having been \\"for a long time a shepherd in the wilderness,\\" of having had a stammer, and of being \\"much hated and detested\\" by the Pharaoh and the ancient Egyptians of his time. He is said to have been raised in an oppressive household, and to have been known, in Egypt, as a man who had committed murder ÿ though he had done so in order to prevent an act of cruelty.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, like Abraham, through the assistance of God, he achieved great things and gained renown even beyond the Levant. Chief among these achievements was the freeing of his people, the Hebrews, from bondage in Egypt and leading \\"them to the Holy Land.\\" He is viewed as the one who bestowed on Israel 'the religious and the civil law' which gave them \\"honour among all nations,\\" and which spread their fame to different parts of the world.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, through the law, Moses is believed to have led the Hebrews 'to the highest possible degree of civilization at that period. Abdull-Baha asserts that the ancient Greek philosophers regarded \\"the illustrious men of Israel as models of perfection.\\" Chief among these philosophers, he says, was Socrates who \\"visited Syria, and took from the children of Israel the teachings of the Unity of God and of the immortality of the soul.\\"[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses is further described as paving the way for Bah'u'llh and his ultimate revelation, and as a teacher of truth, whose teachings were in line with the customs of his time.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a metaphorical sense in the Christian tradition, a \\"Moses\\" has been referred to as the leader who delivers the people from a terrible situation. Among the Presidents of the United States known to have used the symbolism of Moses were Harry S. Truman, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who referred to his supporters as \\"the Moses generation.\\"[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn subsequent years, theologians linked the Ten Commandments with the formation of early democracy. Scottish theologian William Barclay described them as \\"the universal foundation of all things the law without which nationhood is impossible.  Our society is founded upon it.[113] Pope Francis addressed the United States Congress in 2015 stating that all people need to \\"keep alive their sense of unity by means of just legislation... [and] the figure of Moses leads us directly to God and thus to the transcendent dignity of the human being.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences to Moses were used by the Puritans, who relied on the story of Moses to give meaning and hope to the lives of Pilgrims seeking religious and personal freedom in America. John Carver was the first governor of Plymouth colony and first signer of the Mayflower Compact, which he wrote in 1620 during the ship Mayflower's three-month voyage. He inspired the Pilgrims with a \\"sense of earthly grandeur and divine purpose,\\" notes historian Jon Meacham,[115] and was called the \\"Moses of the Pilgrims.\\"[116] Early American writer James Russell Lowell noted the similarity of the founding of America by the Pilgrims to that of ancient Israel by Moses:\\r\\n\\r\\nNext to the fugitives whom Moses led out of Egypt, the little shipload of outcasts who landed at Plymouth are destined to influence the future of the world.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Carver's death the following year, William Bradford was made governor. He feared that the remaining Pilgrims would not survive the hardships of the new land, with half their people having already died within months of arriving. Bradford evoked the symbol of Moses to the weakened and desperate Pilgrims to help calm them and give them hope: \\"Violence will break all. Where is the meek and humble spirit of Moses?\\"[118] William G. Dever explains the attitude of the Pilgrims: \\"We considered ourselves the 'New Israel,' particularly we in America. And for that reason we knew who we were, what we believed in and valued, and what our 'manifest destiny' was.\\"[119][120]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 4, 1776, immediately after the Declaration of Independence was officially passed, the Continental Congress asked John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin to design a seal that would clearly represent a symbol for the new United States.  They chose the symbol of Moses leading the Israelites to freedom.[121]  The Founding Fathers of the United States inscribed the words of Moses on the Liberty Bell: \\"Proclaim Liberty thro' all the Land to all the Inhabitants thereof.\\" (Leviticus 25)\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the death of George Washington in 1799, two thirds of his eulogies referred to him as \\"America's Moses,\\" with one orator saying that \\"Washington has been the same to us as Moses was to the Children of Israel.\\"[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin Franklin, in 1788, saw the difficulties that some of the newly independent American states were having in forming a government, and proposed that until a new code of laws could be agreed to, they should be governed by \\"the laws of Moses,\\" as contained in the Old Testament.[123]  He justified his proposal by explaining that the laws had worked in biblical times: \\"The Supreme Being having rescued them from bondage by many miracles, performed by his servant Moses, he personally delivered to that chosen servant, in the presence of the whole nation, a constitution and code of laws for their observance.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Adams, 2nd President of the United States, stated why he relied on the laws of Moses over Greek philosophy for establishing the United States Constitution: \\"As much as I love, esteem, and admire the Greeks, I believe the Hebrews have done more to enlighten and civilize the world. Moses did more than all their legislators and philosophers.[115]  Swedish historian Hugo Valentin credited Moses as the \\"first to proclaim the rights of man.\\"[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorian Gladys L. Knight describes how leaders who emerged during and after the period in which slavery in the United States was legal often personified the Moses symbol. \\"The symbol of Moses was empowering in that it served to amplify a need for freedom.\\"[126] Therefore, when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865 after the passage of the amendment to the Constitution outlawing slavery, Black Americans said they had lost \\"their Moses\\".[127] Lincoln biographer Charles Carleton Coffin writes, \\"The millions whom Abraham Lincoln delivered from slavery will ever liken him to Moses, the deliverer of Israel.\\"[128] Similarly, Harriet Tubman, who rescued approximately seventy enslaved family and friends, was also described as the \\"Moses\\" of her people.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s, a leading figure in the civil rights movement was Martin Luther King Jr., who was called \\"a modern Moses,\\" and often referred to Moses in his speeches: \\"The struggle of Moses, the struggle of his devoted followers as they sought to get out of Egypt. This is something of the story of every people struggling for freedom.\\"[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nLiterature\\r\\n\\r\\nArt\\r\\n\\r\\nMichelangelo's statue of Moses in the Church of San Pietro in Vincoli, Rome, is one of the most familiar masterpieces in the world.[citation needed] The horns the sculptor included on Moses' head are the result of a mistranslation of the Hebrew Bible into the Latin Vulgate Bible with which Michelangelo was familiar. The Hebrew word taken from Exodus means either a \\"horn\\" or an \\"irradiation.\\" Experts at the Archaeological Institute of America show that the term was used when Moses \\"returned to his people after seeing as much of the Glory of the Lord as human eye could stand,\\" and his face \\"reflected radiance.\\"[137] In early Jewish art, moreover, Moses is often \\"shown with rays coming out of his head.\\"[138]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother author explains, \\"When Saint Jerome translated the Old Testament into Latin, he thought no one but Christ should glow with rays of light  so he advanced the secondary translation.[139][140] However, writer J. Stephen Lang points out that Jerome's version actually described Moses as \\"giving off hornlike rays,\\" and he \\"rather clumsily translated it to mean 'having horns.'\\"[141] It has also been noted that he had Moses seated on a throne, yet Moses was never given the title of a King nor ever sat on such thrones.[142]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses is depicted in several U.S. government buildings because of his legacy as a lawgiver. In the Library of Congress stands a large statue of Moses alongside a statue of the Paul the Apostle. Moses is one of the 23 lawgivers depicted in marble bas-reliefs in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives in the United States Capitol. The plaque's overview states: \\"Moses (c.?1350ÿ1250?B.C.) Hebrew prophet and lawgiver; transformed a wandering people into a nation; received the Ten Commandments.\\"[143]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other twenty-two figures have their profiles turned to Moses, which is the only forward-facing bas-relief.[144][145]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoses appears eight times in carvings that ring the Supreme Court Great Hall ceiling. His face is presented along with other ancient figures such as Solomon, the Greek god Zeus and the Roman goddess of wisdom, Minerva. The Supreme Court Building's east pediment depicts Moses holding two tablets. Tablets representing the Ten Commandments can be found carved in the oak courtroom doors, on the support frame of the courtroom's bronze gates and in the library woodwork. A controversial image is one that sits directly above the Chief Justice of the United States' head. In the center of the 40-foot-long Spanish marble carving is a tablet displaying Roman numerals I through X, with some numbers partially hidden.[146]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilm and television\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Paine and Numbers 31:13-18\\r\\nIn the late eighteenth century, the deist Thomas Paine commented at length on Moses' Laws in The Age of Reason (1794, 1795, and 1807). Paine considered Moses to be a \\"detestable villain\\", and cited Numbers 31:13ÿ18 as an example of his \\"unexampled atrocities\\".[152] In the passage, the Jewish army had returned from conquering the Midianites, and Moses has gone down to meet it:\\r\\n\\r\\n And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp; and Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle; and Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord. Now, therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known a man by lying with him; but all the women-children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.[153]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prominent atheist Richard Dawkins also made reference to these verses in his 2006 book, The God Delusion, concluding that Moses was \\"not a great role model for modern moralists\\".[154]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, some Jewish sources defend Moses' role. The Chasam Sofer emphasizes that this war was not fought at Moses' behest, but was commanded by God as an act of revenge against the Midianite women,[155] who, according to the Biblical account, had seduced the Israelites and led them to sin. In Legend of the Jews, Phinehas son of Eleazar defend their innocent action in leaving the women remain alive because Moses instructed them to take revenge \\"only to the Midianites,\\" without mentioning \\"Midianite women.\\"[156] As God had also commanded them to be a holy nation,[157] the \\"polluted\\" or unvirgin women should not be preferred among sons of Israel, therefore the \\"pure\\" or virgin women are more sacred for themselves.[158]\\r\\n\\r\\nRabbi Joel Grossman argued that the story is a \\"powerful fable of lust and betrayal\\", and that Moses' execution of the women was a symbolic condemnation of those who seek to turn sex and desire to evil purposes.[159] Alan Levin, an educational specialist with the Reform movement, has similarly suggested that the story should be taken as a cautionary tale, to \\"warn successive generations of Jews to watch their own idolatrous behavior\\".[160]\\r\\n\\r\\nInformational notes\\r\\n\\r\\nCitations\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to preach this morning from the subject, 'The Birth of a New Nation.'

Senate presiding officer is a role, not an actual office. The actual role is usually performed by one of three officials: the Vice President; an elected United States Senator; or, in special cases, the Chief Justice. Outside the constitutionally mandated roles, the actual appointment of a person to do the job of presiding over the Senate as a body is governed by Rule I of the Standing Rules.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vice President is assigned the responsibility by the Constitution of presiding over the Senate and designated as its president. The vice president has the authority (ex officio, for they are not an elected member of the Senate) to cast a tie-breaking vote. Early vice presidents took an active role in regularly presiding over proceedings of the body, with the president pro tempore only being called on during the vice president's absence. During the 20th century, the role of the vice president evolved into more of an executive branch position. Now, the vice president is usually seen as an integral part of a president's administration and presides over the Senate only on ceremonial occasions or when a tie-breaking vote may be needed.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution also provides for the appointment of one of the elected senators to serve as President pro tempore. This senator presides when the vice president is absent from the body. The president pro tempore is selected by the body specifically for the role of presiding in the absence of (as the meaning of pro tempore, literally \\"for the time being\\") the actual presiding officer. By tradition, the title of President pro tempore has come to be given more-or-less automatically to the most senior senator of the majority party. In actual practice in the modern Senate, the president pro tempore also does not often serve in the role (though it is their constitutional right to do so). Instead, as governed by Rule I, they frequently designate a junior senator to perform the function.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Senate hears an impeachment trial of the President of the United States, by the procedure established in the Constitution, the Chief Justice is designated as the presiding officer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution provides for two officers to preside over the Senate.

In this capacity, the vice president was expected to preside at regular sessions of the Senate, casting votes only to break ties. From John Adams in 1789 to Richard Nixon in the 1950s, presiding over the Senate was the chief function of vice presidents, who had an office in the Capitol, received their staff support and office expenses through the legislative appropriations, and rarely were invited to participate in cabinet meetings or other executive activities. In 1961, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson changed the vice presidency by moving his chief office from the Capitol to the White House, by directing his attention to executive functions, and by attending Senate sessions only at critical times when his vote, or ruling from the chair, might be necessary. Vice presidents since Johnson's time have followed his example.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, Article One, Section 3, Clause 5 provides that in the absence of the vice president the Senate could choose a president pro tempore to temporarily preside and perform the duties of the chair. Since vice presidents presided routinely in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Senate thought it necessary to choose a president pro tempore only for the limited periods when the vice president might be ill or otherwise absent. As a result, the Senate frequently elected several presidents pro tempore during a single session.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn three occasions during the 19th century, the Senate was without both a president and a president pro tempore:\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, Article One, Section 3, Clause 6 grants to the Senate the sole power to try federal impeachments and spells out the basic procedures for impeachment trials. Among the requirements is the stipulation that the Chief Justice is to preside over presidential impeachment trials. This rule underscores the solemnity of the occasion and aims, in part, to avoid the possible conflict of interest of a Vice President's presiding over the proceeding for the removal of the one official standing between the Vice President and the presidency.[3] The Chief Justice has presided as such only twice:\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Article One, Section 5, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, the Senate is allowed to establish, for itself, its own rules of operations, including the roles and duties of the presiding officer.  Those rules are known as the Standing Rules of the United States Senate, and Rule I deals with the appointment of a person to act as the chair, or presiding officer, for normal Senate proceedings.  It recognizes the constitutionally mandated roles of vice president and president pro tempore, but goes further to allow for the appointment of an acting president pro tempore, and further allows for the president pro tempore to also designate any other senator to perform his duties. As a result, during the day-to-day operation of the body, it is rare for the actual presiding role to be handled by the president pro tempore (and rarer still for the vice president to do so). Instead, a designated junior senator is most commonly appointed to do the job.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presiding officer is usually addressed as \\"Mr. President\\" or \\"Madame President.\\" One exception is during impeachment trials of the president; the Chief Justice was referred to as \\"Mr. Chief Justice\\" both in 1868 and in 1999 while presiding over the Senate.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring joint sessions of Congress in which the President of the United States is giving the address, practices have varied as to how the president refers to the vice president. Barack Obama and his predecessor George W. Bush addressed the vice president as \\"Vice President Biden\\" (in 2010) and \\"Vice President Cheney\\" (in 2008 and several previous years), or as \\"Mr. Vice President\\" (George W. Bush in 2001). However, earlier presidents referred to the vice president as \\"Mr. President\\" while addressing a joint session of Congress; Dwight D. Eisenhower, for instance, did so in 1960, and George H. W. Bush did so in 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis list includes all Presidents of the Senate (the Vice Presidents of the United States), those Presidents pro tempore of the Senate who presided during intraÿterm vacancies in the vice presidency or when the Vice President was acting as President of the United States, and those Chief Justices who presided during presidential impeachment trials. It does not include Presidents pro tempore who presided over sessions temporarily during an absence of the Senate President, or junior senators designated by the President pro tempore to preside temporarily.","input":"Who is presiding officer of the us senate?"},{"output":"an outer silicate solid crust","context":"The internal structure of the Earth is layered in spherical shells: an outer silicate solid crust, a highly viscous asthenosphere and mantle, a liquid outer core that is much less viscous than the mantle, and a solid inner core. Scientific understanding of the internal structure of the Earth is based on observations of topography and bathymetry, observations of rock in outcrop, samples brought to the surface from greater depths by volcanoes or volcanic activity, analysis of the seismic waves that pass through the Earth, measurements of the gravitational and magnetic fields of the  Earth, and experiments with crystalline solids at pressures and temperatures characteristic of the Earth's deep interior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe force exerted by Earth's gravity can be used to calculate its mass. Astronomers can also calculate Earth's mass by observing the motion of orbiting satellites. Earths average density can be determined through gravimetric experiments, which have historically involved pendulums.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mass of Earth is about 7024600000000000000?6G1024?kg.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe structure of Earth can be defined in two ways: by mechanical properties such as rheology, or chemically. Mechanically, it can be divided into lithosphere, asthenosphere, mesospheric mantle, outer core, and the inner core. Chemically, Earth can be divided into the crust, upper mantle, lower mantle, outer core, and inner core. The geologic component layers of Earth[3][not in citation given] are at the following depths below the surface:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe layering of Earth has been inferred indirectly using the time of travel of refracted and reflected seismic waves created by earthquakes.  The core does not allow shear waves to pass through it, while the speed of travel (seismic velocity) is different in other layers.  The changes in seismic velocity between different layers causes refraction owing to Snell's law, like light bending as it passes through a prism.  Likewise, reflections are caused by a large increase in seismic velocity and are similar to light reflecting from a mirror.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crust ranges from 5ÿ70 kilometres (3.1ÿ43.5?mi) in depth and is the outermost layer. The thin parts are the oceanic crust, which underlie the ocean basins (5ÿ10?km) and are composed of dense  (mafic) iron magnesium silicate igneous rocks, like basalt. The thicker crust is continental crust, which is less dense and composed of (felsic) sodium potassium aluminium silicate rocks, like granite. The rocks of the crust fall into two major categories ÿ  sial and sima (Suess,1831ÿ1914). It is estimated that sima starts about 11?km below the Conrad discontinuity (a second order discontinuity). The uppermost mantle together with the crust constitutes the lithosphere. The crust-mantle boundary occurs as two physically different events. First, there is a discontinuity in the seismic velocity, which is most commonly known as the Mohorovi?i? discontinuity or Moho. The cause of the Moho is thought to be a change in rock composition from rocks containing plagioclase feldspar (above) to rocks that contain no feldspars (below). Second, in oceanic crust, there is a chemical discontinuity between ultramafic cumulates and tectonized harzburgites, which has been observed from deep parts of the oceanic crust that have been obducted onto the continental crust and preserved as ophiolite sequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany rocks now making up Earth's crust formed less than 100 million (1G108) years ago; however, the oldest known mineral grains are about 4.4 billion (4.4G109) years old, indicating that Earth has had a solid crust for at least 4.4 billion years.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarth's mantle extends to a depth of 2,890?km, making it the thickest layer of Earth. The mantle is divided into upper and lower mantle. The upper and lower mantle are separated by the transition zone. The lowest part of the mantle next to the core-mantle boundary is known as the D (pronounced dee-double-prime[5]) layer. The pressure at the bottom of the mantle is 140 GPa (1.4 Matm). The mantle is composed of silicate rocks that are rich in iron and magnesium relative to the overlying crust. Although solid,  the high temperatures within the mantle cause the silicate material to be sufficiently ductile that it can flow on very long timescales. Convection of the mantle is expressed at the surface through the motions of tectonic plates. As there is intense and increasing pressure as one travels deeper into the mantle, the lower part of the mantle flows less easily than does the upper mantle (chemical changes within the mantle may also be important). The viscosity of the mantle ranges between 1021 and 1024 Pa{s, depending on depth.[6] In comparison, the viscosity of water is approximately 10?3 Pa{s and that of pitch is 107 Pa{s. The source of heat that drives plate tectonics is the primordial heat left over from the planets formation as well as the radioactive decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium in Earths crust and mantle.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average density of Earth is\\r\\n7000551499999999999?5.515?g/cm3.[8] Because the average density of surface material is only around 7000300000000000000?3.0?g/cm3, we must conclude that denser materials exist within Earth's core. \\r\\nThis result has been known since the Schiehallion experiment, performed in the 1770s.\\r\\nCharles Hutton in his 1778 report concluded that the mean density of the Earth must be about  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n9\\r\\n5\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\tfrac {9}{5}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n that of surface rock, concluding that the interior of the Earth must be metallic. Hutton estimated  this metallic portion to occupy some 65% of the diameter of the Earth.[9]\\r\\nHutton's estimate on the mean density of the Earth was still about 20% too low, at 7000450000000000000?4.5?g/cm3\\r\\nHenry Cavendish in his torsion balance experiment of 1798 found a value of 7000545000000000000?5.45?g/cm3, within 1% of the modern value.[10]\\r\\nSeismic measurements show that the core is divided into two parts, a \\"solid\\" inner core with a radius of 1,220?km[11] and a liquid outer core extending beyond it to a radius of 3,400?km. The densities are between 9,900 and 12,200?kg/m3 in the outer core and 12,600ÿ13,000?kg/m3 in the inner core.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inner core was discovered in 1936 by Inge Lehmann and is generally believed to be composed primarily of iron and some nickel. Since this layer is able to transmit shear waves (transverse seismic waves), it must be solid.  Experimental evidence has at times been critical of crystal models of the core.[13]  Other experimental studies show a discrepancy under high pressure: diamond anvil (static) studies at core pressures yield melting temperatures that are approximately 2000?K below those from shock laser (dynamic) studies.[14][15]  The laser studies create plasma,[16] and the results are suggestive that constraining inner core conditions will depend on whether the inner core is a solid or is a plasma with the density of a solid.  This is an area of active research.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early stages of Earth's formation about 4.6 billion years ago, melting would have caused denser substances to sink toward the center in a process called planetary differentiation (see also the iron catastrophe), while less-dense materials would have migrated to the crust. The core is thus believed to largely be composed of iron (80%), along with nickel and one or more light elements, whereas other dense elements, such as lead and uranium, either are too rare to be significant or tend to bind to lighter elements and thus remain in the crust (see felsic materials). Some have argued that the inner core may be in the form of a single iron crystal.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder laboratory conditions a sample of ironÿnickel alloy was subjected to the corelike pressures by gripping it in a vise between 2 diamond tips (diamond anvil cell), and then heating to approximately 4000 K. The sample was observed with x-rays, and strongly supported the theory that Earth's inner core was made of giant crystals running north to south.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquid outer core surrounds the inner core and is believed to be composed of iron mixed with nickel and trace amounts of lighter elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent speculation suggests that the innermost part of the core is enriched in gold, platinum and other siderophile elements.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe matter that comprises Earth is connected in fundamental ways to matter of certain chondrite meteorites, and to matter of outer portion of the Sun.[22][23] There is good reason to believe that Earth is, in the main, like a chondrite meteorite. Beginning as early as 1940, scientists, including Francis Birch, built geophysics upon the premise that Earth is like ordinary chondrites, the most common type of meteorite observed impacting Earth, while totally ignoring another, albeit less abundant type, called enstatite chondrites. The principal difference between the two meteorite types is that enstatite chondrites formed under circumstances of extremely limited available oxygen, leading to certain normally oxyphile elements existing either partially or wholly in the alloy portion that corresponds to the core of Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nDynamo theory suggests that convection in the outer core, combined with the Coriolis effect, gives rise to Earth's magnetic field. The solid inner core is too hot to hold a permanent magnetic field (see Curie temperature) but probably acts to stabilize the magnetic field generated by the liquid outer core. The average magnetic field strength in Earth's outer core is estimated to be 25 Gauss (2.5?mT), 50 times stronger than the magnetic field at the surface.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent evidence has suggested that the inner core of Earth may rotate slightly faster than the rest of the planet;[26] however, more recent studies in 2011[which?] found this hypothesis to be inconclusive. Options remain for the core which may be oscillatory in nature or a chaotic system.[citation needed] In August 2005 a team of geophysicists announced in the journal Science that, according to their estimates, Earth's inner core rotates approximately 0.3 to 0.5?degrees per year faster relative to the rotation of the surface.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current scientific explanation for Earth's temperature gradient is a combination of heat left over from the planet's initial formation, decay of radioactive elements, and freezing of the inner core.\\r\\n\\r\\n Media related to Structure of the Earth at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What is the interior structure of the earth?"},{"output":"January 1, 1898","context":"","input":"When did brooklyn become part of new york city?"},{"output":"in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain","context":"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless body fluid found in the brain and spinal cord. It is produced in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.\\r\\nThe CSF occupies the subarachnoid space (between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater) and the ventricular system around and inside the brain and spinal cord. It fills the ventricles of the brain, cisterns, and sulci, as well as the central canal of the spinal cord. There is also a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear via the perilymphatic duct where the perilymph is continuous with the cerebrospinal fluid.\\r\\nA sample of CSF can be taken via lumbar puncture. This can reveal the intracranial pressure, as well as indicate diseases including infections of the brain or its surrounding meninges. Although noted by Hippocrates, it was only in the 18th century that Emanuel Swedenborg is credited with its rediscovery, and as late as 1914 that Harvey W. Cushing demonstrated CSF was secreted by the choroid plexus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is about 125-150?mL of CSF at any one time.[1] This CSF circulates within the ventricular system of the brain. The ventricles are a series of cavities filled with CSF. The majority of CSF is produced from within the two lateral ventricles. From here, the CSF passes through the interventricular foramina to the third ventricle, then the cerebral aqueduct to the fourth ventricle. From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes into the subarachnoid space through four openings ÿ the central canal of the spinal cord, the median aperture, and the two lateral apertures.[1] CSF is present within the subarachnoid space, which covers the brain, spinal cord, and stretches below the end of the spinal cord to the sacrum.[1][2] There is a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear making the cerebrospinal fluid continuous with the perilymph in 93% of people.[3]\\r\\nCSF moves in a single outward direction from the ventricles, but multidirectionally in the subarachnoid space.[3] Fluid movement is pulsatile, matching the pressure waves generated in blood vessels by the beating of the heart.[3] Some authors dispute this, posing that there is no unidirectional CSF circulation, but cardiac cycle-dependent bi-directional systolic-diastolic to-and-fro cranio-spinal CSF movements.[4]\\r\\nThe CSF is derived from blood plasma and is largely similar to it, except that CSF is nearly protein-free compared with plasma and has some different electrolyte levels. Due to the way it is produced, CSF has a higher chloride level than plasma, and an equivalent sodium level.[2][5]\\r\\nCSF contains approximately 0.3% plasma proteins, or approximately 15 to 40?mg/dL, depending on sampling site.[6] In general, globular proteins and albumin are in lower concentration in ventricular CSF compared to lumbar or cisternal fluid.[7]  This continuous flow into the venous system dilutes the concentration of larger, lipid-insoluble molecules penetrating the brain and CSF.[8] CSF is normally free of red blood cells, and at most contains only a few white blood cells. Any white blood cell count higher than this constitutes pleocytosis.[9]\\r\\nAt around the third week of development, the embryo is a three-layered disc, covered with ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. A tube-like formation develops in the midline, called the notochord. The notochord releases extracellular molecules that affect the transformation of the overlying ectoderm into nervous tissue.[10] The neural tube, forming from the ectoderm, contains CSF prior to the development of the choroid plexuses.[3] The open neuropores of the neural tube close after the first month of development, and CSF pressure gradually increases.[3]\\r\\nAs the brain develops, by the fourth week of embryological development three swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the central nervous system: the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon.[10] Subarachnoid spaces are first evident around the 32nd day of development near the rhombencephalon; circulation is visible from the 41st day.[3] At this time, the first choroid plexus can be seen, found in the fourth ventricle, although the time at which they first secrete CSF is not yet known.[3]\\r\\nThe developing forebrain surrounds the neural cord. As the forebrain develops, the neural cord within it becomes a ventricle, ultimately forming the lateral ventricles. Along the inner surface of both ventricles, the ventricular wall remains thin, and a choroid plexus develops, producing and releasing CSF.[10] The CSF quickly fills the neural canal.[10] Arachnoid villi are formed around the 35th week of development, with aracnhoid granulations noted around the 39th, and continuing developing until 18 months of age.[3]\\r\\nThe subcommissural organ secretes SCO-spondin, which forms Reissner's fiber within the CSF that assist movement through the cerebral aqueduct. It is present in early intrauterine life but disappears during early development.[3]\\r\\nCSF serves several purposes:\\r\\nThe brain produces roughly 500?mL of cerebrospinal fluid per day,[2] at a rate of about 25?mL an hour.[1] This transcellular fluid is constantly reabsorbed, so that only 125ÿ150?mL is present at any one time.[1]\\r\\nMost (about two-thirds to 80%) of CSF is produced by the choroid plexus.[1][2] The choroid plexus is a network of blood vessels present within sections of the four ventricles of the brain. It is present throughout the ventricular system except for the cerebral aqueduct, frontal horn of the lateral ventricle, and occipital horn of the lateral ventricle.[15] CSF is also produced by the single layer of column-shaped ependymal cells which line the ventricles; by the lining surrounding the subarachnoid space; and a small amount directly from the tiny spaces surrounding blood vessels around the brain.[2]\\r\\nCSF is produced by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space,[1] with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid.[3] This fluid then needs to pass through the epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into the CSF by creating osmotic pressure.[3] Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.[16]\\r\\nWater and carbon dioxide from the interstitial fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells, carbonic anhydrase converts the substances into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium.[3] Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen.[2][3] This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into the CSF,[2] facilitated by aquaporins.[3] Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality.[2] Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of the CSF.[2] As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein.[5] Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors, vitamins B1, 12 C, folate, beta-2 microglobulin, arginine vasopressin and nitrous oxide into the CSF.[3] A Na-K-Cl cotransporter and Na/K ATPase found on the surface of the choroid endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.[3][1]\\r\\nOre?kovi? and Klarica hypothesise that CSF is not primarily produced by the choroid plexus, but is being permanently produced inside the entire CSF system, as a consequence of water filtration through the capillary walls into the interstitial fluid of the surrounding brain tissue, regulated by AQP-4.[4]\\r\\nThere are circadian variations in CSF secretion, with the mechanisms not fully understood, but potentially relating to differences in the activation of the autonomic nervous system over the course of the day.[3]\\r\\nCSF returns to the vascular system by entering the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations.[2] These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage.[2] This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses.[3] CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels,[17] particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known,[1] but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate.[3] CSF turns over at a rate of three to four times a day.[2] CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.[3]\\r\\nThe composition and rate of CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF.[3] For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there is less of a pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation.[3] The autonomic nervous system influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing secretion and the parasympathetic nervous system decreasing it.[3] Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.[3]\\r\\nCSF pressure, as measured by lumbar puncture, is 10ÿ18 cmH2O (8ÿ15 mmHg or 1.1ÿ2 kPa) with the patient lying on the side and 20ÿ30 cmH2O (16ÿ24 mmHg or 2.1ÿ3.2 kPa) with the patient sitting up.[18] In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 cmH2O (4.4ÿ7.3?mmHg or 0.78ÿ0.98?kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of jugular veins in the neck. When lying down, the CSF pressure as estimated by lumbar puncture is similar to the intracranial pressure.\\r\\nHydrocephalus is an abnormal accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain.[19] Hydrocephalus can occur because of obstruction of the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality.[19][20] Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur.[19] Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired thinking.[20] In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as the bones of the skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness.[20] A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions,[19][20] and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure.[21] Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, which diverts fluid to another part of the body, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.[19][20]\\r\\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension is a condition of unknown cause characterised by a rise in CSF pressure. It is associated with headaches, double vision, difficulties seeing, and a swollen optic disc.[19] It can occur in association with the use of Vitamin A and tetracycline antibiotics, or without any identifiable cause at all, particularly in younger obese women.[19] Management may include ceasing any known causes, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide, repeated drainage via lumbar puncture, or the insertion of a shunt such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.[19]\\r\\nCSF can leak from the dura as a result of different causes such as physical trauma or a lumbar puncture, or from no known cause when it is termed spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak.[22] It is usually associated with intracranial hypotension: low CSF pressure.[21] It can cause headaches, made worse by standing, moving and coughing,[21] as the low CSF pressure causes the brain to \\"sag\\" downwards and put pressure on its lower structures.[21] If a leak is identified, a beta-2 transferrin test of the leaking fluid, when positive, is highly specific and sensitive for the detection for CSF leakage.[22] Medical imaging such as CT scans and MRI scans can be used to investigate for a presumed CSF leak when no obvious leak is found but low CSF pressure is identified.[23] Caffeine, given either orally or intravenously, often offers symptomatic relief.[23] Treatment of an identified leak may include injection of a person's blood into the epidural space (an epidural blood patch), spinal surgery, or fibrin glue.[23]\\r\\nCSF can be tested for the diagnosis of a variety of neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture.[24] Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested.[22] About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture,[22] and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.[1]\\r\\nTesting often including observing the colour of the fluid, measuring CSF pressure, and counting and identifying white and red blood cells within the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and culturing the fluid.[22][24] The presence of red blood cells and xanthochromia may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage; whereas central nervous system infections such as meningitis, may be indicated by elevated white blood cell levels.[24] A CSF culture may yield the microorganism that has caused the infection,[22] or PCR may be used to identify a viral cause.[24] Investigations to the total type and nature of proteins reveal point to specific diseases, including multiple sclerosis, paraneoplastic syndromes, systemic lupus erythematosus, neurosarcoidosis, cerebral angiitis;[1] and specific antibodies such as Aquaporin 4 may be tested for to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune conditions.[1] A lumbar puncture that drains CSF may also be used as part of treatment for some conditions, including idiopathic intracranial hypertension and normal pressure hydrocephalus.[1]\\r\\nLumbar puncture can also be performed to measure the intracranial pressure, which might be increased in certain types of hydrocephalus. However, a lumbar puncture should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure is suspected due to certain situations such as a tumour, because it can lead to fatal brain herniation.[22]\\r\\nSome anaesthetics and chemotherapy are injected intrathecally into the subarachnoid space, where they spread around the CSF, meaning substances that cannot cross the blood-brain barrier can still be active throughout the central nervous system.[25][26] Baricity refers to the density of a substance compared to the density of human cerebrospinal fluid and is used in general anesthesia to determine the manner in which a particular drug will spread in the intrathecal space.[25]\\r\\nVarious comments by ancient physicians have been read as referring to CSF. Hippocrates discussed \\"water\\" surrounding the brain when describing congenital hydrocephalus, and Galen referred to \\"excremental liquid\\" in the ventricles of the brain, which he believed was purged into the nose. But for some 16 intervening centuries of ongoing anatomical study, CSF remained unmentioned in the literature. This is perhaps because of the prevailing autopsy technique, which involved cutting off the head, thereby removing evidence of the CSF before the brain was examined.[27]\\r\\nThe modern rediscovery of CSF is now credited to Emanuel Swedenborg. In a manuscript written between 1741 and 1744, unpublished in his lifetime, Swedenborg referred to CSF as \\"spirituous lymph\\" secreted from the roof of the fourth ventricle down to the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. This manuscript was eventually published in translation in 1887.[27]\\r\\nAlbrecht von Haller, a Swiss physician and physiologist, made note in his 1747 book on physiology that the \\"water\\" in the brain was secreted into the ventricles and absorbed in the veins, and when secreted in excess, could lead to hydrocephalus.[27] Francois Magendie studied the properties of CSF by vivisection. He discovered the foramen Magendie, the opening in the roof of the fourth ventricle, but mistakenly believed that CSF was secreted by the pia mater.[27]\\r\\nThomas Willis (noted as the discoverer of the circle of Willis) made note of the fact that the consistency of the CSF is altered in meningitis.[27] In 1869 Gustav Schwalbe proposed that CSF drainage could occur via lymphatic vessels.[1]\\r\\nIn 1891, W. Essex Wynter began treating tubercular meningitis by tapping the subarachnoid space, and Heinrich Quincke began to popularize lumbar puncture, which he advocated for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.[27] In 1912, a neurologist William Mestrezat gave the first accurate description of the chemical composition of the CSF.[27] In 1914, Harvey W. Cushing published conclusive evidence that the CSF is secreted by the choroid plexus.[27]\\r\\nDuring phylogenesis, cerebrospinal fluid is present within the neuraxis before it circulates.[3] The CSF of Teleostei fish are contained within the ventricles of the brains, but not in a nonexistent subarachnoid space.[3] In mammals, where a subarachnoid space is present, the CSF is present in it.[3] Absorption of CSF is seen in amniotes and more complex species, and as species become progressively more complex, the system of absorption becomes progressively more enhanced, and the role of spinal epidural veins in absorption plays a progressively smaller and smaller role.[3]\\r\\nThe amount of cerebrospinal fluid varies by size and species.[28] In humans and other mammals, cerebrospinal fluid, produced, circulating, and reabsorbed in a similar manner to humans, and with a similar function, turns over at a rate of 3ÿ5 times a day.[28] Problems with CSF circulation leading to hydrocephalus occur in other animals.[28]","input":"Where is cerebral spinal fluid (csf) produced?"},{"output":"July 21, 1969","context":"","input":"What is the date of the first moon walk?"},{"output":"Paul Tutmarc","context":"","input":"Who was the inventor of the electric bass?"},{"output":"The Red Vineyards near Arles","context":"The Red Vineyards near Arles is an oil painting by the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, executed on a privately primed Toile de 30 piece of burlap in early November 1888.

The members, after being court-martialed \\"for a crime they didn't commit\\", escaped from military prison and, while still on the run, worked as soldiers of fortune. The series was created by Stephen J. Cannell and Frank Lupo. A feature film based on the series was released by 20th Century Fox in 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A-Team was created by writers and producers Stephen J. Cannell and Frank Lupo at the behest of Brandon Tartikoff, NBC's Entertainment president. Cannell was fired from ABC in the early 1980s, after failing to produce a hit show for the network, and was hired by NBC; his first project was The A-Team. Brandon Tartikoff pitched the series to Cannell as a combination of The Dirty Dozen, Mission Impossible, The Magnificent Seven, Mad Max and Hill Street Blues, with \\"Mr. T driving the car\\".[1][2][3][4]\\r\\nThe A-Team was not generally expected to become a hit, although Stephen J. Cannell has said that George Peppard suggested it would be a huge hit \\"before we ever turned on a camera\\".[5] The show became very popular; the first regular episode, which aired after Super Bowl XVII on January 30, 1983, reached 26.4% of the television audience, placing fourth in the top 10 Nielsen-rated shows.[6] The A-Team was portrayed as acting on the side of good and helping the oppressed.\\r\\nThe show remains prominent in popular culture for its cartoonish, over-the-top violence (in which people were seldom seriously hurt), formulaic episodes, its characters' ability to form weaponry and vehicles out of old parts, and its distinctive theme tune. The show boosted the career of Mr. T, who portrayed the character of B. A. Baracus, around whom the show was initially conceived.[7][8] Some of the show's catchphrases, such as \\"I love it when a plan comes together\\",[9] \\"Hannibal's on the jazz\\", and \\"I ain't gettin' on no plane!\\" have also made their way onto T-shirts and other merchandise.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe show's name comes from the \\"A-Teams\\", the nickname coined for U.S. Special Forces' Operational Detachments Alpha (ODA) during the Vietnam War,[10] although this connection was never mentioned on-screen.\\r\\nIn a 2003 Yahoo! survey of 1,000 television viewers, The A-Team was voted the one \\"oldie\\" television show viewers would most like to see revived, beating out such popular television series from the 1980s as The Dukes of Hazzard and Knight Rider.[11]\\r\\n- John Ashley's opening narration.\\r\\nThe A-Team is a naturally episodic show, with few overarching stories, except the characters' continuing motivation to clear their names, with few references to events in past episodes and a recognizable and steady episode structure. In describing the ratings drop that occurred during the show's fourth season, reviewer Gold Burt points to this structure as being a leading cause for the decreased popularity \\"because the same basic plot had been used over and over again for the past four seasons with the same predictable outcome\\".[12] Similarly, reporter Adrian Lee called the plots \\"stunningly simple\\" in a 2006 article for The Express (UK newspaper), citing such recurring elements \\"as BA's fear of flying, and outlandish finales when the team fashioned weapons from household items\\".[13] The show became emblematic of this kind of \\"fit-for-TV warfare\\" due to its depiction of high-octane combat scenes, with lethal weapons, wherein the participants (with the notable exception of General Fulbright) are never killed and rarely seriously injured (see also On-screen violence section).\\r\\nAs the television ratings of The A-Team fell dramatically during the fourth season, the format was changed for the show's final season in 1986ÿ87 in a bid to win back viewers. After years on the run from the authorities, the A-Team is finally apprehended by the military. General Hunt Stockwell, a mysterious CIA operative played by Robert Vaughn, propositions them to work for him, whereupon he will arrange for their pardons upon successful completion of several suicide missions. In order to do so, the A-Team must first escape from their captivity. With the help of a new character, Frankie \\"Dishpan Man\\" Santana, Stockwell fakes their deaths before a military firing squad. The new status of the A-Team, no longer working for themselves, remained for the duration of the fifth season while Eddie Velez and Robert Vaughn received star billing along with the principal cast. The missions that the team had to perform in season five were somewhat reminiscent of Mission: Impossible, and based more around political espionage than beating local thugs, also usually taking place in foreign countries, including successfully overthrowing an island dictator, the rescue of a scientist from East Germany, and recovering top secret Star Wars defense information from Soviet hands. These changes proved unsuccessful with viewers, however, and ratings continued to decline. Only 13 episodes aired in the fifth season. In what was supposed to be the final episode, \\"The Grey Team\\" (although \\"Without Reservations\\" was broadcast on NBC as the last first-run episode in March 1987), Hannibal, after being misled by Stockwell one time too many, tells him that the team will no longer work for him. At the end, the team discusses what they were going to do if they get their pardon, and it is implied that they would continue doing what they were doing as the A-Team. The character of Howling Mad Murdock can be seen in the final scene wearing a T-shirt that says, \\"Fini\\".\\r\\nDuring the Vietnam War, the A-Team were members of the 5th Special Forces Group (see episode \\"West Coast Turnaround\\"). In episode \\"Bad Time on the Border\\", Colonel John \\"Hannibal\\" Smith, portrayed by George Peppard, indicated that the A-Team were \\"ex-Green Berets\\". During the Vietnam War, the A-Team's commanding officer, Colonel Morrison, gave them orders to rob the Bank of Hanoi to help bring the war to an end. They succeeded in their mission, but on their return to base four days after the end of the war, they discovered that Morrison had been killed by the Viet Cong, and that his headquarters had been burned to the ground. This meant that the proof that the A-Team members were acting under orders had been destroyed. They were arrested, and imprisoned at Fort Bragg, from which they quickly escaped before standing trial.\\r\\nThe origin of the A-Team is directly linked to the Vietnam War, during which the team formed. The show's introduction in the first four seasons mentions this, accompanied by images of soldiers coming out of a helicopter in an area resembling a forest or jungle. Besides this, The A-Team would occasionally feature an episode in which the team came across an old ally or enemy from those war days. For example, the first season's final episode \\"A Nice Place To Visit\\" revolved around the team traveling to a small town to honor a fallen comrade and end up avenging his death, and in season two's \\"Recipe For Heavy Bread\\", a chance encounter leads the team to meet both the POW cook who helped them during the war, and the American officer who sold his unit out.\\r\\nAn article in the New Statesman (UK) published shortly after the premiere of The A-Team in the United Kingdom, also pointed out The A-Team's connection to the Vietnam War, characterizing it as the representation of the idealization of the Vietnam War, and an example of the war slowly becoming accepted and assimilated into American culture.[14]\\r\\nOne of the team's primary antagonists, Col. Roderick Decker (Lance LeGault), had his past linked back to the Vietnam War, in which he and Hannibal had come to fisticuffs in \\"the DOOM Club\\" (Da Nang Open Officers' Mess).[15] At other times, members of the team would refer back to a certain tactic used during the War, which would be relevant to the team's present predicament. Often, Hannibal would refer to such a tactic, after which the other members of the team would complain about its failure during the War. This was also used to refer to some of Face's past accomplishments in scamming items for the team, such as in the first-season episode \\"Holiday In The Hills\\", in which Murdock fondly remembers Face being able to secure a '53 Cadillac while in the Vietnam jungle.\\r\\nThe team's ties to the Vietnam War were referred to again in the fourth-season finale, \\"The Sound of Thunder\\", in which the team is introduced to Tia (Tia Carrere), a war orphan and daughter of fourth season antagonist General Fulbright. Returning to Vietnam, Fulbright is shot in the back and gives his last words as he dies. The 2006 documentary Bring Back The A-Team joked that the scene lasted seven and a half minutes,[16] but his death actually took a little over a minute. His murderer, a Vietnamese colonel, is killed in retaliation. Tia then returns with the team to the United States (see also: casting). This episode is notable for having one of the show's few truly serious dramatic moments, with each team member privately reminiscing on their war experiences, intercut with news footage from the war with Barry McGuire's Eve of Destruction playing in the background.\\r\\nThe show's ties to the Vietnam War are fully dealt with in the opening arc of the fifth season, dubbed \\"The Court-Martial (Part 1ÿ3)\\", in which the team is finally court-martialed for the robbery of the bank of Hanoi. The character of Roderick Decker makes a return on the witness stand, and various newly introduced characters from the A-Team's past also make appearances. The team, after a string of setbacks, decides to plead guilty to the crime and they are sentenced to be executed. They escape this fate and come to work for a General Hunt Stockwell, leading into the remainder of the fifth season.\\r\\nThe show ran for five seasons on the NBC television network, from January 23, 1983 to December 30, 1986 (with one additional, previously unbroadcast episode shown on March 8, 1987), for a total of 98 episodes.\\r\\nThe A-Team revolves around the four members of a former commando outfit, now mercenaries. Their leader is Lieutenant Colonel/Colonel John \\"Hannibal\\" Smith (George Peppard), whose plans tend to be unorthodox but effective. Lieutenant Templeton Peck (Dirk Benedict; Tim Dunigan appeared as Templeton Peck in the pilot), usually called \\"Face\\" or \\"Faceman\\", is a smooth-talking con man who serves as the team's appropriator of vehicles and other useful items, as well as the team's second-in-command. The team's pilot is Captain H.M. \\"Howling Mad\\" Murdock (Dwight Schultz), who has been declared insane and lives in a Veterans' Administration mental institution for the show's first four seasons. Finally, there is the team's strong man, mechanic and Sergeant First Class Bosco \\"B.A.\\", or \\"Bad Attitude\\", Baracus (Mr. T).\\r\\nThe team belonged to the 5th Special Forces as seen in the left side shoulder patch on Hannibal's uniform in the episode A Nice Place to Visit. A patch on Hannibal's uniform on the right shoulder in the episode \\"A Nice Place To Visit\\" indicates he belonged to the 101st Airborne during a prior combat assignment, but that patch was replaced by the 1st Air Cavalry Division patch in the episode \\"Trial by Fire\\". The patch worn on the left sleeve according to uniform wear in the Army is the current assignment of the person wearing it and in the episode A Nice Place to Visit shows that the team was assigned to the Special Forces with a tab Airborne over the shoulder patch. Also their berets in that episode are green and have the tab of the 5th Special Forces in Vietnam on them. In the episode \\"West Coast Turnaround\\", Hannibal stated they were with the 5th Special Forces Group. Then, in episode \\"Bad Time on the Border\\", Hannibal refers to his friends as \\"ex-Green Berets\\". Though the name they have adopted comes from the \\"A-Teams\\", the nickname coined for Special Forces Operational Detachments Alpha, these detachments usually consisted of twelve members; whether the four were considered a \\"detachment\\" of their own or had once had eight compatriots who were killed in action was never revealed. In the episode A Nice Place to Visit Ray Brenner is stated to have been a Major and part of Hannibal's team in Vietnam.\\r\\nFor its first season and the first half of the second season, the team was assisted by reporter Amy Amanda Allen (Melinda Culea). In the second half of the second season, Allen was replaced by fellow reporter Tawnia Baker (Marla Heasley). The character of Tia (Tia Carrere), a Vietnam war orphan now living in the United States, was meant to join the Team in the fifth season,[17] but she was replaced by Frankie Santana (Eddie Velez), who served as the team's special effects expert. Velez was added to the opening credits of the fifth season after its second episode.\\r\\nDuring their adventures, the A-Team was constantly met by opposition from the Military Police. In the show's first season, the MPs were led by Colonel Francis Lynch (William Lucking), but he was replaced for the second, third, and earlier fourth season by Colonel Roderick Decker (Lance LeGault) and his aide Captain Crane (Carl Franklin). Lynch returned for one episode in the show's third season (\\"Showdown!\\") but was not seen after. Decker was also briefly replaced by a Colonel Briggs (Charles Napier) in the third season for one episode (\\"Fire\\") when LeGault was unavailable, but returned shortly after. For the latter portion of the show's fourth season, the team was hunted by General Harlan \\"Bull\\" Fulbright (Jack Ging), who would later hire the A-Team to find Tia in the season four finale, during which Fulbright was killed.\\r\\nThe fifth season introduced General Hunt Stockwell (Robert Vaughn) who, while serving as the team's primary antagonist, was also the team's boss and joined them on several missions. He was often assisted by Carla (Judith Ledford, sometimes credited as Judy Ledford).\\r\\nJohn \\"Hannibal\\" Smith is a master of disguise. His most used disguise (onscreen only on the pilot episode) is Mr. Lee, the dry cleaner. This is one of the final parts of the client screening process, as he tells the client where to go in order to make full contact with the A-Team. He dresses most often in a white safari jacket and black leather gloves. He also is constantly seen smoking a cigar. Hannibal carries either a Browning Hi-Power, Colt M1911A1 or a Smith & Wesson Model 39 as a sidearm, most often \\"Mexican carried\\" although he uses a holster when on missions. His catchphrase is \\"I love it when a plan comes together\\". Often said, usually by B.A., to be \\"on the jazz\\" when in the fury of completing a mission.\\r\\nTempleton \\"Faceman\\" Peck is a master of the persuasive arts. The team's scrounger, he can get virtually anything he sets his mind to, usually exploiting women with sympathy-appeal and flirtation. However, he is not without integrity, as stated by Murdock in the episode \\"Family Reunion\\": \\"He would rip the shirt off his back for you, and then scam one for himself.\\" Faceman is also the A-Team's accountant. He dresses suavely, often appearing in suits. Faceman carries a Colt Lawman Mk III revolver for protection, and drives a custom white 1984 Corvette with orange trim.\\r\\nBosco \\"B.A.\\" (Bad Attitude) Baracus is the muscle for the A-Team, able to perform amazing feats of strength. He is also the team's mechanic. B.A. affects a dislike for Murdock, calling him a \\"crazy fool\\", but his true feelings of friendship are revealed when he prevents Murdock from drowning in his desire to live like a fish. B.A. also has a deep fear of flying, and the others usually have to trick and/or knock him out in order to get him on a plane. It is very rare that B.A. is awake while flying, and even rarer for him actually to consent to it. When he does, however, he then goes into a catatonic state. B.A. generally wears overalls and leopard or tiger print shirts in the early seasons, then later wears a green jumpsuit in the later seasons. He is almost always seen with about 50 pounds of gold necklaces and rings on every finger, and also wears a weightlifting belt. Baracus's hair is always styled in a mohawk-like cut. He drives a customized black GMC van, which is the team's usual mode of transport.\\r\\nH.M. \\"Howling Mad\\" Murdock is the A-Team's pilot, and can fly any kind of aircraft with extreme precision. However, due to a helicopter crash in Vietnam, Murdock apparently went insane. He lives in a Veterans' Hospital in the mental wing. Whenever the rest of the team requires a pilot, they have to break him out of the hospital, generally using Faceman to do so. In Seasons 1ÿ4, Murdock has a different pet, imaginary friend, or persona in each episode. Whenever one of his pets or imaginary friends is killed by an enemy, Murdock snaps and takes revenge (but never kills). Many times, when B.A is mad at Murdock for being crazy, Hannibal will side with Murdock in a sympathetic way. Once he is discharged from the hospital in Season 5, Murdock has a different job each episode. Murdock usually wears a leather flight jacket, a baseball cap, and basketball sneakers.\\r\\nAlthough the part of Face was written by Frank Lupo and Stephen J. Cannell with Dirk Benedict in mind, NBC insisted that the part should be played by another actor, instead. Therefore, in the pilot, Face was portrayed by Tim Dunigan, who was later replaced by Dirk Benedict, with the comment that Dunigan was \\"too tall and too young\\".[18] According to Dunigan: \\"I look even younger on camera than I am. So it was difficult to accept me as a veteran of the Vietnam War, which ended when I was a sophomore in high school.\\"[19]\\r\\nCarrere was intended to join the principal cast of the show in its fifth season after appearing in the season four finale,[17] providing a tie to the team's inception during the war. Unfortunately for this plan, Carrere was under contract to General Hospital, which prevented her from joining The A-Team. Her character was abruptly dropped as a result.\\r\\nAccording to Mr. T's account in Bring Back... The A-Team in 2006, the role of B. A. Baracus was written specifically for him. This is corroborated by Stephen J. Cannell's own account of the initial concept proposed by Tartikoff.[1]\\r\\nJames Coburn, who co-starred in The Magnificent Seven, was considered for the role of Hannibal in The A-Team, while George Peppard (Hannibal) was the original consideration for the role of Vin (played by Steve McQueen instead) in The Magnificent Seven.[16] Robert Vaughn, of course, actually appeared in the film.\\r\\nAccording to Dirk Benedict, Robert Vaughn was actually added to the cast in season 5 because of his friendship with the notoriously prickly George Peppard. It was hoped that Vaughn would help ease worsening tensions between Peppard and Mr. T. In a later interview, Vaughn recounted how T's verbosity and loud personality would get on everyone's nerves, including his, even though he had been hired specifically because of his easy going and calming personality.\\r\\nNotable guest stars included:\\r\\nDuring the show's first three seasons, The A-Team managed to pull in 17% to 20% of the American households on average. The first regular episode (\\"Children of Jamestown\\"), reached 26.4% of the television watching audience, placing fourth in the top 10 rated shows, according to the Nielsen ratings.[6] By March, The A-Team, now on its regular Tuesday timeslot, dropped to the eight spot, but rated a 20.5%.[20] During the sweeps week in May of that year, The A-Team dropped again but remained steady at 18.5%,[21] and rose to 18.8% during the second week of May sweeps.[22] These were the highest ratings NBC had achieved in five years.[23] During the second season, the ratings continued to soar, reaching third place in the twenty-highest rated programs, behind Dallas and Simon & Simon, in January (mid-season),[24] while during the third season, it was beaten out only by four other NBC shows, including The Cosby Show.\\r\\nThe fourth season saw The A-Team experience a dramatic fall, as it started to lose its position while television viewership increased. As such, the ratings, while stable, were relatively less. The season premiere ranked a 17.4% (a 26% audience share on that timeslot) on the Nielsen Rating scale,[25] but after ratings quickly declined. In October, The A-Team had fallen to the 19th and by Super Bowl Night had fallen still to 29th the night on which the show had originally scored its first hit three years before.[26] For the remainder of its fourth season The A-Team managed to hang around the 20th spot, far from original top 10 position it had enjoyed during its first three seasons.\\r\\nAfter four years on Tuesday, NBC decided to move The A-Team to a new timeslot on Friday for what would be its final season. Ratings continued to drop, and after seven episodes, The A-Team fell out of the top 50 altogether with a 13.3 Nielsen Rating.[27] In November 1986, NBC cancelled the series, declining to order the last nine episodes of what would have been a 22-episode season.\\r\\nThe series has achieved cult status through heavy syndication in the U.S. and internationally. It has also remained popular overseas, such as in the United Kingdom, where the show has been on-air almost continuously in some form since it was first shown in July 1983. It is airing on satellite and cable channel Esquire Network. The series was to begin airing over NBC-TV's OTA digital subchannel network, Cozi TV, in January 2016.[29] Forces TV started showing the series every weekday since October 17, 2016. The series has been airing in Spanish on Telemundo-TV's OTA digital subchannel network, TeleXitos since December 2014. The series is currently available through Starz.\\r\\nThe A-Team has been broadcast all over the world; international response has been varied. In 1984, the main cast members of The A-Team, George Peppard, Mr. T, Dirk Benedict and Dwight Schultz were invited to the Netherlands. George Peppard was the first to receive the invitation and thus thought the invite pertained only to him. When the other cast members were also invited, Peppard declined, leaving only Mr. T, Benedict and Schultz to visit the Netherlands.[30] The immense turn-out for the stars was unpredicted, and they were forced to leave early as a security measure. A video was released with the present actors in which Dwight Schultz apologized and thanked everyone that had attended.[31]\\r\\nIn Australia The A-Team was broadcast on Channel Ten. From 2010 7mate has been showing reruns of show. The show was broadcast in New Zealand on TV2. In Brazil, the series was broadcast on SBT from 1984 to 1989, later moving to Rede Globo in the early 1990s. In the UK, the program was shown on ITV, starting on Friday, July 22, 1983; when it return for its second run (resuming mid-second season) it moved to Saturday evenings. The series continued to be repeated on ITV until 1994. The series was later repeated on UK Gold from 1997 through 2007 at various times. Then in 2002 it took a break from the channel before returning 2005 to 2006. It was also repeated on Bravo from 1997 to 1999. It returned to the channel in 2009. In 2017 the digital channel Spike began showing the series from the beginning. Although ratings soared during its early seasons, many television critics described the show largely as cartoonish and thereby wrote the series off. Most reviews focused on acting and the formulaic nature of the episodes, most prominently the absence of actual killing in a show about Vietnam War veterans.\\r\\nMary Harron, New Statesman[32]\\r\\nThe violence presented in The A-Team is highly sanitized. People do not bleed or bruise when hit (though they might develop a limp or require a sling), nor do the members of the A-Team kill people. The results of violence were only ever presented when it was required for the script. In almost every car crash there is a short take showing the occupants of the vehicle climbing out of the mangled or burning wreck, even in helicopter crashes. However, more of these types of takes were dropped near the end of the fourth season. According to Stephen J. Cannell, this part of the show did become a running joke for the writing staff and they would at times test the limits of realism on purpose.[33]\\r\\nThe show has been described as cartoonish and likened to Tom and Jerry. Dean P. of the Courier-Mail described the violence in the show as \\"hypocritical\\" and that \\"the morality of giving the impression that a hail of bullets does no-one any harm is ignored. After all, Tom and Jerry survived all sorts of mayhem for years with no ill-effects.\\"[34] Television reviewer Ric Meyers joked that the A-Team used \\"antineutron bulletsthey destroy property for miles around, but never harm a human being\\".[35] According to certain estimates, an episode of the A-Team held up to 46 violent acts. Stephen J. Cannell, co-creator of the show responds: \\"They were determined to make a point, and we were too big a target to resist. Cartoon violence is a scapegoat issue.\\"[2] Originally, The A-Team's status as a hit show remained strong, but it ultimately lost out to more family-oriented shows such as The Cosby Show, Who's the Boss? and Growing Pains.[2] John J. O'Connor of The New York Times wrote in a 1986 article that \\"...a substantial number of viewers, if the ratings in recent months are to be believed, are clearly fed up with mindless violence of the car-chasing, fist-slugging variety\\".[36]\\r\\nDuring its tenure, the show was occasionally criticized for being sexist.[16] These critiques were based on the notion that most female roles on the show were either a lead-in to the episode's plot, the recipient of Face's affections, or both. The only two regular female members of the cast, Melinda Culea (season 1 and the first half of season 2) and Marla Heasley (the latter half of season 2) did not have long tenures with the show. Both Culea and Heasley had been brought in by the network and producers to stem these critiques, hoping that a female character would properly balance the otherwise all-male cast.[37] Culea was fired during the second season because of creative differences between her and the show's writers; she wanted more lines and more action scenes.[38] Culea's character of Amy Allen suddenly disappeared between two episodes, and was only briefly referred to once in the episode \\"In Plane Sight\\", and a couple of times in \\"The Battle of Bel Air\\" in which she was cited to have taken a correspondence job overseas (in Jakarta, Indonesia). The latter episode also introduced Heasley's character, Tawnia Baker. The new character was also an assisting reporter character, but with a more fragile and seductive quality to her. Ultimately, she was written out of the show at the start of the third season when the network determined that a female cast member was not necessary. Tawnia left the team on-screen, choosing to marry and move out of Los Angeles.\\r\\nAs Marla Heasley recounts in Bring Back... The A-Team (May 18, 2006), although sexism was not prevalent on the set per se, there was a sense that a female character was not necessary on the show. On her first day on set George Peppard took her aside and told her \\"We don't want you on the show. None of the guys want you here. The only reason you're here is because the network and the producers want you. For some reason they think they need a girl.\\" The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again, saying: \\"I'm sorry that this is your last day, but remember what I said the very first day, that we didn't want a girl, has nothing to do with you. You were very professional, but no reason to have a girl.\\" In Bring Back... the A-Team, Dirk Benedict also remarked that: \\"It was a guy's show. It was male driven. It was written by guys. It was directed by guys. It was acted by guys. It's about what guys do. We talked the way guys talked. We were the boss. We were the God. We smoked when we wanted. We shot guns when we wanted. We kissed the girls and made them cry... when we wanted. It was the last truly masculine show.\\"\\r\\nThe 1983 GMC Vandura van used by the A-Team, with its characteristic red stripe, black and red turbine mag wheels, and rooftop spoiler,[39] has become an enduring pop culture icon. The customized 1994 Chevrolet G20 used on the A-Team movie was also on display at the 2010 New York International Auto Show.[40]\\r\\nA number of devices were seen in the back of the van in different episodes, including a mini printing press (\\"Pros and Cons\\"), an audio surveillance recording device (\\"A Small and Deadly War\\"), Hannibal's disguise kits in various episodes, and a gun storage locker.\\r\\nEarly examples of the van had a red GMC logo on the front grille, and an additional GMC logo on the rear left door. Early in the second season, these logos were blacked out, although GMC continued to supply vans and receive a credit on the closing credits of each episode.\\r\\nThe van was commonly said to be all-black,[citation needed] but the section above the red stripe was metallic gray. The angle of the rear spoiler can also be seen to vary on different examples of the van within the series. Additionally, some versions of the van have a sunroof, whereas others, typically those used for stunts (and including the one displayed in the aforementioned Cars of the Stars Motor Museum) do not. This led to continuity errors in some episodes, such as in the third season's \\"The Bells of St. Mary's\\", in a scene where Face (his double) jumps from a building onto the roof of the van with no sunroof. Moments later, in an interior studio shot, Face climbs in through the sunroof. Also, in many stunts where the van would surely be totaled, other makes have been used, such as a black Ford Econoline with red hubcaps painted to simulate the original red turbine mag wheels.\\r\\nMany GMC/Chevrolet Vandura vans, and many of the very similar Bedford CF vans, were styled after the A-Team's van by fans of the show.\\r\\nThe huge success of the series saw a vast array of merchandise, including toys and snacks released both in America and internationally. There were several sets trading cards and stickers, action figures of the characters were produced by Galoob as well as vehicles, including B.A.'s van and Face's Corvette (available in several different sizes), as well as items such as helicopters, trucks and jeeps to fit in with the line, from model car manufacturer Ertl. Some of the other array of items available included jigsaw puzzles, View-Master reels containing 21 3-D pictures (over three reels) of the second seasonA-Team story \\"When You Comin' Back, Range Rider?\\", was produced by View-Master International (available both as a pack of reels, and also as a \\"gift set\\" with 3-D viewer), an electric race car track with A-Team vehicle covers instead of normal cars, and a TYCO produced train set with various accessories and pieces themed for the A-Team look. The set includes a Baldwin shark nose engine painted up like the Van and a matching Caboose. Following the original cancellation of the series, further merchandise has appeared as the series has achieved cult status, including an A-Team van by \\"Hot Wheels\\". In 2016 Lego released a pack that includes a B.A. Baracus minifigure and constructible van; the pack will unlock additional A-Team themed content in the video game Lego Dimensions, including all four team members as playable characters.[41]\\r\\nMarvel Comics produced a three-issue A-Team comic book series, which was later reprinted as a trade paperback. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, an A-Team comic strip appeared for several years in the 1980s as part of the children's television magazine and comic Look-In, to tie in with the British run of the series. It was preceded, though, by a short run in the final year (1984) of TV Comic, drawn by Jim Eldridge.\\r\\nSeveral novels were based on the series, the first six published in America by Dell and in Britain by Target Books; the last four were only published in Britain. The first six are credited to Charles Heath. The books are generally found in paperback form, although hardback copies (with different cover artwork) were also released.\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom from 1985 to 1988, four Annuals were produced, each consisting of text and comic strip stories, puzzles, and photos of the show's stars, with a further one produced by Marvel Comics consisting of several reprinted comic strips, released in 1989/1990.\\r\\nA Panini set of stickers, which adapted six TV episodes (from the first and earlier second season) using shots from the episodes, could be stick into an accompanying book, with text under each inserted sticker to narrate the story.\\r\\nThe original main theme by Mike Post and Pete Carpenter was released on the vinyl LP Mike Post?ÿ Television Theme Songs (Elektra Records E1-60028Y, 1982) and again on the Mike Post?ÿ Mike Post LP (RCA Records AFL1-5183, 1984), both long out-of-print; however, this was not the same version of the theme as heard on-screen. The theme, as heard on seasons two through four (including the opening narration and sound effects), was also released on TVT's Television's Greatest Hits: 70s and 80s.\\r\\nThough no original music other than the theme has been released, in 1984 EMI issued an album of re-recorded material from the series conducted by Daniel Caine (reissued by Silva Screen on compact disc in 1999, SILVAD 3509).\\r\\nDuring its time, The A-Team was nominated for three Emmy Awards: In 1983 (Outstanding Film Sound Mixing for a Series) for the pilot episode, in 1984 (Outstanding Film Sound Mixing for a Series) for the episode \\"When You Comin' Back, Range Rider?\\" and in 1987 (Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series) for the episode \\"Firing Line\\".\\r\\nThe show featured professional wrestlers such as Hulk Hogan, Professor Toru Tanaka, Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat, The Dynamite Kid, Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan, Davey Boy Smith (The British Bulldog), Big John Studd and Greg \\"The Hammer\\" Valentine, in most cases playing themselves. In the episode \\"Body Slam\\", which featured Hogan, wrestling interviewer and announcer \\"Mean\\" Gene Okerlund also appeared.\\r\\nIn addition, the music video for John Cena's \\"Bad, Bad Man\\" (on Cena's You Can't See Me album) featured the Chain Gang as a three-man A-TeamCena as Hannibal, plus Cena's cousin Tha Trademarc as Howling Mad and Bumpy Knuckles as B.A.\\r\\nThe opening theme tune was composed by Mike Post and Pete Carpenter.\\r\\nIn early episodes the team used Colt AR-15 SP1 semi-automatic rifles (with automatic sound effects, simulating the M16), while in later seasons they used the Ruger Mini-14, and on rare occasions, the selective fire AC-556K variant of the Mini-14. Hannibal is also seen using an M60 machine gun (which Hannibal called \\"Baby\\") in some episodes as well as a Micro-Uzi. MAC-11s with parts added to simulate the Uzi appear in at least two early episodes. Hannibal's sidearms are either a nickel-plated Smith & Wesson Model 59, or a stainless steel Smith & Wesson Model 639. Unusually in the episode \\"Black Day At Bad Rock\\" he is seen carrying a Browning Hi-Power. Many antagonists and members of the team are seen using 1911s as well. Starting from Season 4, the then-exotic Steyr AUG bullpup rifle also became prominent in the series. \\"So many different firearms were used in the 1980s hit 'The A-Team' that its impossible to list them all. For five seasons, the wrongly accused foursome used rifles, handguns, submachine guns and shotguns to bring justice for the little guy while trying to stay out of jail. And the best part had to be that regardless of the number of explosions or rounds fired, nobody ever got seriously hurt except for the occasional flesh wound of a team member.\\"[42] As a result, the American Rifleman declared The A-Team the Number One Show on Television to regularly feature firearms.[42]\\r\\nUniversal Studios Home Entertainment has released all five seasons of The A-Team on DVD in Region 1, 2, and 4. In Region 2, a complete series set entitled The A-Team--The Ultimate Collection was released on October 8, 2007.[43] A complete series set was released in Region 1 on June 8, 2010.[44] The set includes 25 discs packaged in a replica of the A-Team's signature black van from the show. The complete series set was released in Region 4 on November 3, 2010.\\r\\nAll 5 seasons were re-released in Region 2 with new packaging on June 21, 2010. The series has been remastered and was released on Blu-ray disc in the United Kingdom on October 17, 2016.[45]\\r\\nOn May 18, 2006, Channel 4 in the UK attempted to reunite the surviving cast members of The A-Team for the show Bring Back... in an episode titled \\"Bring Back...The A-Team\\".[46] Justin Lee Collins presented the challenge, securing interviews and appearances from Dirk Benedict, Dwight Schultz, Marla Heasley, Jack Ging, series co-creator Stephen Cannell, and Mr. T.\\r\\nCollins eventually managed to bring together Benedict, Schultz, Heasley, Ging and Cannell, along with William Lucking, Lance LeGault, and George Peppard's son, Christian. Mr. T was unable to make the meeting, which took place in the Friar's Club in Beverly Hills, but he did manage to appear on the show for a brief talk with Collins.\\r\\nA feature film based on The A-Team was released on June 11, 2010, and was produced by 20th Century Fox.[47] Both Dirk Benedict (Face) and Dwight Schultz (Murdock) made brief cameo appearances in the film (as a prisoner using a sunbed and a psychiatrist overseeing Murdock's shock therapy, respectively); because of timing issues, these scenes were moved to the end of the credits. They were later reinserted for the extended-cut of the film.\\r\\nIn September 2015, Fox announced that they were developing a reboot A-Team series with Chris Morgan as executive producer with Cannell's daughter, Tawnia McKiernan, and Albert Kim writing. The team is to be made up of both male and female characters.[48]","input":"What years was the a team on tv?"},{"output":"portions of Czechoslovakia along the country's borders mainly inhabited by German speakers, for which a new territorial designation, the \\"Sudetenland\\", was coined","context":"","input":"What territory did germany gain at the munich conference?"},{"output":"AT&T Stadium","context":"This article is a list of current National Football League stadiums, sorted by capacity, their locations, their first year of usage and home teams. Though there are 32 teams in the National Football League (NFL), there are only 31 full-time NFL stadiums because the New York Giants and New York Jets share MetLife Stadium. This number is scheduled to decrease to 30 when the Los Angeles Rams and the Los Angeles Chargers will begin to share the Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park in 2020.\\r\\nThe newest NFL stadium is Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, home of the Atlanta Falcons, which opened for the 2017 season. Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, home of the Los Angeles Rams, is the oldest, having opened in 1923.\\r\\nThe NFL uses several other stadiums on a regular basis in addition to the teams' designated regular home sites. In England, Wembley Stadium in London is contracted to host at least two games per season, as part of the NFL International Series which runs through 2020, and Twickenham Stadium, also in London, is scheduled to host at least one game. Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, Mexico, will also host a NFL International Series game in 2018. In addition, Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, Ohio, is the location of the annual exhibition Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. Since 2016, Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida has hosted the Pro Bowl.\\r\\nThe majority of NFL stadiums have sold naming rights to corporations. As of the 2018 season, there are five exceptions: Arrowhead Stadium, Lambeau Field, OaklandÿAlameda County Coliseum, Paul Brown Stadium, and Soldier Field. Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum has sold their naming rights in a deal that will not officially change their name until 2019.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStadiums represent a considerable expense to a community, and thus their construction, use, and funding often enters the public discourse.[2] Also, given the perceived advantage a team gets to playing in its home stadium, particular attention is given in the media to the peculiarities of each stadium's environment. Climate, playing surface (either natural or artificial turf), and the type of roof all contribute to giving each team its home-field advantage.\\r\\nStadiums are either open, enclosed, or have a retractable roof. For retractable roofs, the home team determines if the roof is to be opened or closed 90 minutes before kickoff. The roof remains open unless precipitation or lightning is within the vicinity of the stadium, the temperature drops below 40?F (4?C), or wind gusts are greater than 40 miles per hour (64?km/h), in which case the roof operators will close the roof.[3]\\r\\nWith a peak capacity of over 100,000 spectators, AT&T Stadium has the highest capacity of any NFL stadium, while MetLife Stadium has the highest listed seating capacity at 82,500. The smallest stadium is StubHub Center, which is hosting the Los Angeles Chargers in 2017 with a capacity of 27,000 seats; it is the smallest stadium to host a full NFL season for a team since a 25,000-seat City Stadium hosted its last Green Bay Packers games in 1956.\\r\\nIn their normal configurations, 29 of the league's 31 stadiums have a seating capacity of at least 60,000 spectators; of those, a majority (16) have less than 70,000 seats, while eight have between 70,000 and 80,000 and five can seat 80,000 or more. In contrast to college football stadiums, the largest of which can and regularly do accommodate over 100,000 spectators, no stadium in the league currently has a listed seating capacity of more than 82,500. Teams rarely build their stadiums far beyond the 80,000 seat threshold (and even then, only in the largest markets) because of the league's blackout policy, which prohibited the televising of any NFL game within 75 miles of its home market if a game does not sell all of its non-premium seating. For this reason, until the blackout was suspended in 2015, the Cowboys restricted capacity to 80,000 seats at AT&T Stadium, a stadium that can hold over 100,000 spectators at full capacity; likewise, the Los Angeles Rams cap capacity at the 93,607-seat Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to 80,000 seats for most games. OaklandÿAlameda County Coliseum, the stadium that hosts the Oakland Raiders, has over 60,000 seats, but the team has restricted capacity to under 57,000 in more recent seasons.[4] In the opposite direction, the league has a firm minimum on the number of seats an NFL stadium should have; since 1971 the league has not allowed any stadium under 50,000 seats to host a full-time NFL team (not counting the StubHub Center, there have been two exceptions to this; 45,000-seat Metropolitan Stadium in Minnesota was not replaced until 1982, and 40,000-seat Vanderbilt Stadium hosted the Tennessee Oilers for one season in 1998 after a planned two-year residency in Memphis was cut in half). In normal circumstances, all NFL stadiums are all-seaters.\\r\\nSome stadiums can be expanded to fit larger crowds for other events such as concerts or conventions. Official seating capacities do not include standing room.\\r\\n*In 2020 the Oakland Raiders will move to Las Vegas and become the Las Vegas Raiders","input":"What is the largest seating capacity nfl stadium?"},{"output":"January 1999","context":"Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials, MJ,[3] is an American retired professional basketball player, businessman, and principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Jordan played 15 seasons in the NBA for the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards. His biography on the NBA website states: \\"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.\\"[4] Jordan was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s.[5]\\r\\nJordan played three seasons for coach Dean Smith at the University of North Carolina. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick. He quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free throw line in slam dunk contests, earned him the nicknames Air Jordan and His Airness. He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball.[6] In 1991, he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a \\"three-peat\\". Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the beginning of the 1993ÿ94 NBA season and started a new career playing minor league baseball, he returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three additional championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins in the 1995ÿ96 NBA season. Jordan retired for a second time in January 1999, but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Wizards.\\r\\nJordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include five Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, ten All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game appearances, three All-Star Game MVP Awards, ten scoring titles, three steals titles, six NBA Finals MVP Awards, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. Among his numerous accomplishments, Jordan holds the NBA records for highest career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and highest career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by ESPN, and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press's list of athletes of the century. Jordan is a two-time inductee into the Basketball Hall of Fame, having been enshrined in 2009 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as part of the group induction of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\\"The Dream Team\\"). He became a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015.\\r\\nJordan is also known for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1985 and remain popular today.[7] Jordan also starred in the 1996 film Space Jam as himself. In 2006, he became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the then-Charlotte Bobcats, buying a controlling interest in 2010. In 2015, Jordan became the first billionaire NBA player in history as a result of the increase in value of NBA franchises. He is the third-richest African-American, behind Oprah Winfrey and Robert F. Smith.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJordan was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Deloris (ne Peoples), who worked in banking, and James R. Jordan Sr., an equipment supervisor. His family moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, when he was a toddler.[8]\\r\\nJordan is the fourth of five children. He has two older brothers, Larry Jordan and James R. Jordan, Jr., one older sister, Deloris, and one younger sister, Roslyn. Jordan's brother James retired in 2006 as the Command Sergeant Major of the 35th Signal Brigade of the XVIII Airborne Corps in the U.S. Army.[9]\\r\\nJordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the varsity basketball team during his sophomore year, but at 5'11\\" (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend, Harvest Leroy Smith, was the only sophomore to make the team.[10][11]\\r\\nMotivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity squad, and tallied several 40-point games.[10] The following summer, he grew four inches (10?cm)[11][4] and trained rigorously. Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, Jordan averaged about 20 points per game over his final two seasons of high school play.[12][13] As a senior, he was selected to the McDonald's All-American Team[14] after averaging a triple-double: 29.2 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 10.1 assists.[15]\\r\\nJordan was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia.[16] In 1981, Jordan accepted a basketball scholarship to North Carolina, where he majored in cultural geography.[17]\\r\\nAs a freshman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, he was named ACC Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 points per game (ppg) on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage).[18] He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing.[4] Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.[19] During his three seasons at North Carolina, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting, and added 5.0 rebounds per game (rpg).[12] He was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons. After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick, after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center.[20] However, Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center, but more a matter of taking Sam Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.[21] ESPN, citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.[22] Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986.[23]\\r\\nDuring his rookie season in the NBA, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting.[18] He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas,[24][25][26] and appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the heading \\"A Star Is Born\\" just over a month into his professional career.[27][28] Jordan was also voted in as an All-Star starter by the fans in his rookie season.[4] Controversy arose before the All-Star game when word surfaced that several veteran playersled by Isiah Thomaswere upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving.[4] This led to a so-called \\"freeze-out\\" on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him throughout the game.[4] The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted Rookie of the Year.[29] The Bulls finished the season 38ÿ44[30] and lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs.[29]\\r\\nJordan's second season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games.[4] Despite Jordan's injury and a 30ÿ52 record (at the time it was fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history),[30][31] the Bulls made the playoffs. Jordan recovered in time to participate in the playoffs and performed well upon his return. Against a 1985ÿ86 Boston Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history,[32] Jordan set the still-unbroken record for points in a playoff game with 63 in Game 2.[33] The Celtics, however, managed to sweep the series.[29]\\r\\nJordan had completely recovered in time for the 1986ÿ87 season, and he had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history. He joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only two players to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league high 37.1 points on 48.2% shooting.[18] In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season.[34] Despite Jordan's success, Magic Johnson won the league's Most Valuable Player Award. The Bulls reached 40 wins,[30] and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year. However, they were again swept by the Celtics.[29]\\r\\nJordan again led the league in scoring during the 1987ÿ88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting[18] and won his first league MVP Award. He was also named the Defensive Player of the Year, as he had averaged 1.6 blocks and a league high 3.16 steals per game.[35] The Bulls finished 50ÿ32,[30] and made it out of the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games.[36] However, the Bulls then lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons,[29] who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the \\"Bad Boys\\".[37]\\r\\nIn the 1988ÿ89 season, Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8 rpg and 8 assists per game (apg).[18] The Bulls finished with a 47ÿ35 record,[30] and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating the Cavaliers and New York Knicks along the way. The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit The Shot over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series.[38] However, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games,[29] by utilizing their \\"Jordan Rules\\" method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of double and triple teaming him every time he touched the ball.[4]\\r\\nThe Bulls entered the 1989ÿ90 season as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, and under the guidance of new coach Phil Jackson. Jordan averaged a league leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg[18] in leading the Bulls to a 55ÿ27 record.[30] They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers. However, despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.[29]\\r\\nIn the 1990ÿ91 season, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season.[18] The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in 16 years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season.[30] With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star, the Bulls had elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them. However, this time the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep.[39][40]\\r\\nThe Bulls advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy, two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled an outstanding 15ÿ2 playoff record along the way.[39] Perhaps the best known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket.[41] In his first Finals appearance, Jordan posted per game averages of 31.2 points on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.8 steals, and 1.4 blocks.[42] Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award,[43] and he cried while holding the NBA Finals trophy.[44]\\r\\nJordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the 1991ÿ92 season, establishing a 67ÿ15 record, topping their franchise record from 1990ÿ91.[30] Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game on 52% shooting.[35] After winning a physical 7-game series over the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in 6 games, the Bulls met Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Finals. The media, hoping to recreate a MagicÿBird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between \\"Air\\" Jordan and Clyde \\"The Glide\\" during the pre-Finals hype.[45] In the first game, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals.[46] After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. Marv Albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying, \\"I can't believe I'm doing this.\\"[47] The Bulls went on to win Game 1, and defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row[43] and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 53% from the floor.[43]\\r\\nIn the 1992ÿ93 season, despite a 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign,[35] Jordan's streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended as he lost the award to his friend Charles Barkley. Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago's leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series,[48] and became the first player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards.[43] He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in 4 consecutive games. With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.[49]\\r\\nDuring the Bulls' playoff run in 1993, controversy arose when Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the night before a game against the New York Knicks.[50] In that same year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses,[51] and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book claiming he had won $1.25?million from Jordan on the golf course.[51] In 2005, Jordan talked to Ed Bradley of the CBS evening show 60 Minutes about his gambling and admitted that he made some reckless decisions. Jordan stated, \\"Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it. If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah.\\"[52] When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied, \\"No.\\"[52]\\r\\nOn October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, citing a loss of desire to play the game. Jordan later stated that the death of his father three months earlier also shaped his decision.[53] Jordan's father was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked the luxury vehicle. The assailants were traced from calls that they made on James Jordan's cell phone.[54][55] The two criminals were caught, convicted at trial, and sentenced to life in prison. Jordan was close to his father; as a child he had imitated his father's proclivity to stick out his tongue while absorbed in work. He later adopted it as his own signature, displaying it each time he drove to the basket.[4] In 1996, he founded a Chicago area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated it to his father.[56][57]\\r\\nIn his 1998 autobiography For the Love of the Game, Jordan wrote that he had been preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992.[58] The added exhaustion due to the Dream Team run in the 1992 Olympics solidified Jordan's feelings about the game and his ever-growing celebrity status. Jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.[59]\\r\\nJordan then further surprised the sports world by signing a minor league baseball contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994.[60] He reported to spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and was assigned to the team's minor league system on March 31, 1994.[61] Jordan has stated this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who had always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball player.[62] The White Sox were another team owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who continued to honor Jordan's basketball contract during the years he played baseball.[63]\\r\\nIn 1994, Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons, a Double-A minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, batting .202 with three home runs, 51 runs batted in, 30 stolen bases, 114 strikeouts, 51 base on balls, and 11 errors.[13] He also appeared for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the 1994 Arizona Fall League, batting .252 against the top prospects in baseball.[61] On November 1, 1994, his number 23 was retired by the Bulls in a ceremony that included the erection of a permanent sculpture known as The Spirit outside the new United Center.[64][65][66]\\r\\nIn the 1993ÿ94 season, the Bulls, without Jordan, achieved a 55ÿ27 record,[30] and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs. But the 1994ÿ95 Bulls were a shell of the championship team of just two years earlier. Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago was 31ÿ31 at one point in mid-March.[67] The team received help, however, when Jordan decided to return to the NBA for the Bulls.[68]\\r\\nIn March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball due to the ongoing Major League Baseball strike, as he wanted to avoid becoming a potential replacement player.[69] On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his return to the NBA through a two-word press release: \\"I'm back.\\"[4] The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points.[70] The game had the highest Nielsen rating of a regular season NBA game since 1975.[71] Although he could have opted to wear his normal number in spite of the Bulls having retired it, Jordan instead wore number 45, as he had while playing baseball.[70]\\r\\nAlthough he had not played an NBA game in a year and a half, Jordan played well upon his return, making a game-winning jump shot against Atlanta in his fourth game back. He then scored 55 points in the next game against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995.[29] Boosted by Jordan's comeback, the Bulls went 13ÿ4 to make the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Orlando Magic. At the end of Game 1, Orlando's Nick Anderson stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the game-winning basket for the Magic; he would later comment that Jordan \\"didn't look like the old Michael Jordan\\"[72] and that \\"No. 45 doesn't explode like No. 23 used to.\\"[73]\\r\\nJordan responded by scoring 38 points in the next game, which Chicago won. Before the game, Jordan decided that he would resume wearing his former number, 23, immediately. The Bulls were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA.[73] Jordan was fined an additional $5,000 for opting to wear white shoes as the rest of the Bulls wore black.[74] He averaged 31 points per game in the series, but Orlando won the series in 6 games.[12]\\r\\nFreshly motivated by the playoff defeat, Jordan trained aggressively for the 1995ÿ96 season.[75] Strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, the Bulls dominated the league, starting the season 41ÿ3,[76] and eventually finishing with the then-best regular season record in NBA history (later surpassed by the 2015ÿ16 Golden State Warriors): 72ÿ10.[77] Jordan led the league in scoring with 30.4 ppg,[78] and won the league's regular season and All-Star Game MVP awards.[4]\\r\\nIn the playoffs, the Bulls lost only three games in four series (Miami Heat 3ÿ0, New York Knicks 4ÿ1, Orlando Magic 4ÿ0). They defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 4ÿ2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship. Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time,[43] surpassing Magic Johnson's three Finals MVP awards. He also achieved only the second sweep of the MVP Awards in the All-Star Game, regular season and NBA Finals, Willis Reed having achieved the first, during the 1969ÿ70 season.[29] Because this was Jordan's first championship since his father's murder, and it was won on Father's Day, Jordan reacted very emotionally upon winning the title, including a memorable scene of him crying on the locker room floor with the game ball.[4][44]\\r\\nIn the 1996ÿ97 season, the Bulls started out 69ÿ11, but missed out on a second consecutive 70-win season by losing their final two games to finish 69ÿ13.[79] However, this year Jordan was beaten for the NBA MVP Award by Karl Malone. The Bulls again advanced to the Finals, where they faced Malone and the Utah Jazz. The series against the Jazz featured two of the more memorable clutch moments of Jordan's career. He won Game 1 for the Bulls with a buzzer-beating jump shot. In Game 5, with the series tied at 2, Jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus. In what is known as the \\"Flu Game\\", Jordan scored 38 points, including the game-deciding 3-pointer with 25 seconds remaining.[80] The Bulls won 90ÿ88 and went on to win the series in six games.[79] For the fifth time in as many Finals appearances, Jordan received the Finals MVP award.[43] During the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, Jordan posted the first triple double in All-Star Game history in a victorious effort; however, he did not receive the MVP award.[81]\\r\\nJordan and the Bulls compiled a 62ÿ20 record in the 1997ÿ98 season.[30] Jordan led the league with 28.7 points per game,[35] securing his fifth regular-season MVP award, plus honors for All-NBA First Team, First Defensive Team and the All-Star Game MVP.[4] The Bulls won the Eastern Conference Championship for a third straight season, including surviving a seven-game series with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals; it was the first time Jordan had played in a Game 7 since the 1992 Eastern Conference Semifinals with the Knicks.[82][83] After winning, they moved on for a rematch with the Jazz in the Finals.[84]\\r\\nThe Bulls returned to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3ÿ2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered to be one of the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history.[85] With the Bulls trailing 86ÿ83 with 41.9 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and hit a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting the Utah lead to 86ÿ85.[85] The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to forward Karl Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and took the ball out of his hands for a steal.[85] Jordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell,[86][87][88] although the officials did not call a foul. With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan gave Chicago an 87ÿ86 lead with a game-winning jumper, the climactic shot of his Bulls career. Afterwards, John Stockton missed a game-winning three-pointer. Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship and second three-peat. Once again, Jordan was voted the Finals MVP,[43] having led all scorers averaging 33.5 points per game, including 45 in the deciding Game 6.[89] Jordan's six Finals MVPs is a record; Shaquille O'Neal, Magic Johnson, LeBron James and Tim Duncan are tied for second place with three apiece.[43] The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series in history. Game 6 also holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.[90][91]\\r\\nWith Phil Jackson's contract expiring, the pending departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999.[92][93][94] On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player, but as part owner and President of Basketball Operations for the Washington Wizards.[95] Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive. He controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters. Opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed.[96][97] He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (such as forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland),[98][99] but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high schooler Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.[96][100]\\r\\nDespite his January 1999 claim that he was \\"99.9% certain\\" that he would never play another NBA game,[44] in the summer of 2001 Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback,[101][102] this time with his new team. Inspired by the NHL comeback of his friend Mario Lemieux the previous winter,[103] Jordan spent much of the spring and summer of 2001 in training, holding several invitation-only camps for NBA players in Chicago.[104] In addition, Jordan hired his old Chicago Bulls head coach, Doug Collins, as Washington's coach for the upcoming season, a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another Jordan return.[101][102]\\r\\nOn September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks.[105][106] In an injury-plagued 2001ÿ02 season, he led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.42 spg).[4] However, torn cartilage in his right knee ended Jordan's season after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994ÿ95 season.[18] Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 points, 5.4 assists, and 6.0 rebounds, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts. His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game.[107]\\r\\nPlaying in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history (a record since broken by Kobe Bryant).[108] That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them. He averaged 20.0 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals per game.[4] He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free throw line.[4] Even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times.[29] On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game.[109] During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan's home games at the MCI Center were sold out, and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road.[110] However, neither of Jordan's final two seasons resulted in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and Jordan was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him.[111][112] At several points he openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of the number one draft pick in the 2001 NBA draft, Kwame Brown.[111][112]\\r\\nWith the recognition that 2002ÿ03 would be Jordan's final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA. In his final game at his old home court, the United Center in Chicago, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation.[113] The Miami Heat retired the number 23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though Jordan never played for the team.[114] At the 2003 All-Star Game, Jordan was offered a starting spot from Tracy McGrady and Allen Iverson,[115] but refused both. In the end, he accepted the spot of Vince Carter, who decided to give it up under great public pressure.[116]\\r\\nJordan played in his final NBA game on April 16, 2003 in Philadelphia. After scoring only 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds remaining in the third quarter and with his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers, 75ÿ56. Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the First Union Center crowd began chanting \\"We want Mike!\\" After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers' Eric Snow, and stepped to the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench. Jordan received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials and the crowd of 21,257 fans.[117]\\r\\nJordan played on two Olympic gold medal-winning American basketball teams. He won a gold medal as a college player in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The team was coached by Bob Knight and featured players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale. Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.[118]\\r\\nIn the 1992 Summer Olympics, he was a member of the star-studded squad that included Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and David Robinson and was dubbed the \\"Dream Team\\". Jordan was the only player to start all 8 games in the Olympics. Playing limited minutes due to the frequent blowouts, Jordan averaged 14.9 ppg,[119] finishing second on the team in scoring.[120] Jordan and fellow Dream Team members Patrick Ewing and Chris Mullin are the only American men's basketball players to win Olympic gold medals as amateurs and professionals.[118][119]\\r\\nAfter his third retirement, Jordan assumed that he would be able to return to his front office position as Director of Basketball Operations with the Wizards.[121] However, his previous tenure in the Wizards' front office had produced the aforementioned mixed results and may have also influenced the trade of Richard \\"Rip\\" Hamilton for Jerry Stackhouse (although Jordan was not technically Director of Basketball Operations in 2002).[96] On May 7, 2003, Wizards owner Abe Pollin fired Jordan as Washington's President of Basketball Operations.[96] Jordan later stated that he felt betrayed, and that if he knew he would be fired upon retiring he never would have come back to play for the Wizards.[52]\\r\\nJordan kept busy over the next few years. He stayed in shape, played golf in celebrity charity tournaments, and spent time with his family in Chicago. He also promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles.[122] Since 2004, Jordan has owned Michael Jordan Motorsports, a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two Suzukis in the premier Superbike championship sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) until the end of the 2013 season.[123][124] In 2006, Jordan and his wife Juanita pledged $5?million to Chicago's Hales Franciscan High School.[125] The Jordan Brand has made donations to Habitat for Humanity and a Louisiana branch of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.[126]\\r\\nOn June 15, 2006, Jordan bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats, becoming the team's second-largest shareholder behind majority owner Robert L. Johnson. As part of the deal, Jordan took full control over the basketball side of the operation, with the title \\"Managing Member of Basketball Operations.\\"[127] Despite Jordan's previous success as an endorser, he has made an effort not to be included in Charlotte's marketing campaigns.[128] A decade earlier, Jordan had made a bid to become part-owner of Charlotte's original NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets, but talks collapsed when owner George Shinn refused to give Jordan complete control of basketball operations.[129]\\r\\nIn February 2010, it was reported that Jordan was seeking majority ownership of the Bobcats.[130] As February wore on, it became apparent that Jordan and former Houston Rockets president George Postolos were the leading contenders for ownership of the team. On February 27, the Bobcats announced that Johnson had reached an agreement with Jordan and his group, MJ Basketball Holdings, to buy the team pending NBA approval.[131] On March 17, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase, making him the first former player to become the majority owner of an NBA team.[132] It also made him the league's only African-American majority owner of an NBA team.[133]\\r\\nDuring the 2011 NBA lockout, The New York Times wrote that Jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners who wanted to cap the players' share of basketball-related income at 50 percent and as low as 47. Journalists observed that, during the labor dispute in 1998, Jordan had told Washington Wizards then-owner Abe Pollin, \\"If you can't make a profit, you should sell your team.\\"[134] Jason Whitlock of FoxSports.com called Jordan a \\"sellout\\" wanting \\"current players to pay for his incompetence.\\"[135] He cited Jordan's executive decisions to draft disappointing players Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison.[135]\\r\\nDuring the 2011ÿ12 NBA season that was shortened to 66 games by the lockout, the Bobcats posted a 7ÿ59 record. Their .106 winning percentage was the worst in NBA history.[136] \\"I'm not real happy about the record book scenario last year. It's very, very frustrating\\", Jordan said later that year.[137]\\r\\nJordan was a shooting guard who was also capable of playing as a small forward (the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards), and as a point guard.[12] Jordan was known throughout his career for being a strong clutch performer. With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests.[138] His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash-talk[139] and well-known work ethic.[140][141] As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not \\"tough enough\\" to compete with him in practice. To help improve his defense, he spent extra hours studying film of opponents. On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvisation at game time.[142] Noted as a durable player, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986ÿ87 to 2001ÿ02, when he injured his right knee.[12][143] He played all 82 games nine times. Jordan has frequently cited David Thompson, Walter Davis, and Jerry West as influences.[144][145] Confirmed at the start of his career, and possibly later on, Jordan had a special \\"Love of the Game Clause\\" written into his contract (unusual at the time) which allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time, anywhere.[146]\\r\\nJordan had a versatile offensive game. He was capable of aggressively driving to the basket, as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate; his 8,772 free throw attempts are the ninth-highest total of all time.[147] As his career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark fadeaway jump shot, using his leaping ability to \\"fade away\\" from block attempts. According to Hubie Brown, this move alone made him nearly unstoppable.[148] Despite media criticism as a \\"selfish\\" player early in his career, Jordan's 5.3 assists per game[18] also indicate his willingness to defer to his teammates. After shooting under 30% from three-point range in his first five seasons in the NBA, including a career-low 13% in the 1987ÿ88 season, Jordan improved to a career-high 50% in the 1994ÿ95 season.[18] The three-point shot became more of a focus of his game from 1994ÿ95 to 1996ÿ97, when the NBA shortened its three-point line to 22?ft (6.7?m) (from 23?ft 9?in (7.24?m)).[149] His three-point field-goal percentages ranged from 35% to 43% in seasons in which he attempted at least 230 three-pointers between 1989ÿ90 and 1996ÿ97.[12] For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder (6.2 per game).[18]\\r\\nIn 1988, Jordan was honored with the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year Award and became the first NBA player to win both the Defensive Player of the Year and MVP awards in a career (since equaled by Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, and Kevin Garnett; Olajuwon is the only player other than Jordan to win both during the same season). In addition, he set both seasonal and career records for blocked shots by a guard,[150] and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. He ranks third in NBA history in total steals with 2,514, trailing John Stockton and Jason Kidd.[151] Jerry West often stated that he was more impressed with Jordan's defensive contributions than his offensive ones.[152] He was also known to have strong eyesight; broadcaster Al Michaels said that he was able to read baseball box scores on a 27-inch television clearly from about 50 feet away.[153]\\r\\nJordan's marked talent was clear from his rookie season.[24][26] In his first game in Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks, Jordan received a prolonged standing ovation,[26] a rarity for an opposing player. After Jordan scored a playoff record 63 points against the Boston Celtics on April 20, 1986, Celtics star Larry Bird described him as \\"God disguised as Michael Jordan.\\"[33]\\r\\nJordan led the NBA in scoring in 10 seasons (NBA record) and tied Wilt Chamberlain's record of seven consecutive scoring titles.[4] He was also a fixture on the NBA All-Defensive First Team, making the roster nine times (NBA record shared with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant).[154] Jordan also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring averages of 30.1 and 33.4 points per game,[4] respectively. By 1998, the season of his Finals-winning shot against the Jazz, he was well known throughout the league as a clutch performer. In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs, Jordan would always demand the ball at crunch time.[155] Jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest in NBA history.[156] He retired with 32,292 points in regular season play,[157] placing him fourth on the NBA's all-time scoring list behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, and Kobe Bryant.[157]\\r\\nWith five regular-season MVPs (tied for second place with Bill Russellonly Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three All-Star MVPs, Jordan is the most decorated NBA player. Jordan finished among the top three in regular-season MVP voting a record 10 times, and was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996. He is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teams).[158] Since 1976, the year of the NBA's merger with the American Basketball Association,[159] Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team.[160] In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times, more than any other player.[161]\\r\\nMany of Jordan's contemporaries say that Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.[152] In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century, above such luminaries as Babe Ruth and Muhammad Ali.[162] Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press's December 1999 list of 20th century athletes.[163] In addition, the Associated Press voted him as the greatest basketball player of the 20th century.[164] Jordan has also appeared on the front cover of Sports Illustrated a record 50 times.[165] In the September 1996 issue of Sport, which was the publication's 50th anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.[166]\\r\\nJordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back slam dunk contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many with having influenced a generation of young players.[167][168] Several current NBA All-Stars have stated that they considered Jordan their role model while growing up, including LeBron James[169] and Dwyane Wade.[170] In addition, commentators have dubbed a number of next-generation players \\"the next Michael Jordan\\" upon their entry to the NBA, including Anfernee \\"Penny\\" Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Vince Carter, and Dwyane Wade.[171][172][173] Although Jordan was a well-rounded player, his \\"Air Jordan\\" image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players,[167] a fact Jordan himself has lamented.\\r\\nI think it was the exposure of Michael Jordan; the marketing of Michael Jordan. Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking. That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really publicized.[167]\\r\\nAlthough Jordan has done much to increase the status of the game, some of his impact on the game's popularity in America appears to be fleeting.[174] Television ratings in particular increased only during his time in the league,[174] and Finals ratings have not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.[175]\\r\\nIn August 2009, the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained items from his college and NBA careers, as well as from the 1992 \\"Dream Team\\". The exhibit also has a batting glove to signify Jordan's short career in minor league baseball.[176] After Jordan received word of his acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class of 1996 member David Thompson to present him.[177] As Jordan would later explain during his induction speech in September 2009, growing up in North Carolina, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels, and greatly admired Thompson, who played at rival North Carolina State. He was inducted into the Hall in September, with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kuko?.[178] Two of Jordan's former coaches, Dean Smith and Doug Collins, were also among those present. His emotional reaction during his speechwhen he began to crywas captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later become widely shared on social media as the Crying Jordan Internet meme.[179][180] In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with a Presidential Medal of Freedom.[181]\\r\\nJordan married Juanita Vanoy in September 1989, and they had two sons, Jeffrey Michael and Marcus James, and a daughter, Jasmine. Jordan and Vanoy filed for divorce on January 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter. They again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made \\"mutually and amicably\\".[182][183] It is reported that Juanita received a $168?million settlement (equivalent to $200 million in 2016), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time.[184][185]\\r\\nIn 1991, Jordan purchased a lot in Highland Park, Illinois, to build a 56,000 square foot mansion, which was completed four years later. Jordan listed his Highland Park mansion for sale in 2012.[186] Both of his sons attended Loyola Academy, a private Roman Catholic high school located in Wilmette, Illinois.[187] Jeffrey graduated as a member of the 2007 graduating class and played his first collegiate basketball game on November 11, 2007, for the University of Illinois. After two seasons, Jeffrey left the Illinois basketball team in 2009. He later rejoined the team for a third season,[188][189] then received a release to transfer to the University of Central Florida, where Marcus was attending.[190][191] Marcus transferred to Whitney Young High School after his sophomore year at Loyola Academy and graduated in 2009. He began attending UCF in the fall of 2009,[192] and played three seasons of basketball for the school.[193]\\r\\nOn July 21, 2006, a judge in Cook County, Illinois, determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5?million in a breach of contract claim.[194] Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret.[195][196][197] Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5?million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991. A DNA test showed Jordan was not the father of the child.[194]\\r\\nHe proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011,[198] and they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church.[199][200] It was announced on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together.[201][202] On February 11, 2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel.[203]\\r\\nJordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. He has been a major spokesman for such brands as Nike, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald's, Ball Park Franks, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI.[204] Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the \\"Be Like Mike\\" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.[204][205]\\r\\nNike created a signature shoe for him, called the Air Jordan. One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon. In the commercials Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan's abilities and became convinced that \\"it's gotta be the shoes\\".[204] The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of \\"shoe-jackings\\" where people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently, Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the \\"Jordan Brand\\". The company features an impressive list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers.[206][207] The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of North Carolina, Cal, Georgetown, and Marquette.[208]\\r\\nJordan also has been associated with the Looney Tunes cartoon characters. A Nike commercial shown during 1992's Super Bowl XXVI featured Jordan and Bugs Bunny playing basketball.[209] The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live action/animated film Space Jam, which starred Jordan and Bugs in a fictional story set during the former's first retirement from basketball.[210] They have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for MCI.[210] Jordan also made an appearance in the music video of Michael Jackson's \\"Jam\\" (1992).[211]\\r\\nJordan's yearly income from the endorsements is estimated to be over forty million dollars.[212][213] In addition, when Jordan's power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games.[214] Due to this, Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of US $30?million per season.[215] An academic study found that Jordan's first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than $1?billion.[216]\\r\\nMost of Jordan's endorsement deals, including his first deal with Nike, were engineered by his agent, David Falk.[217] Jordan has described Falk as \\"the best at what he does\\" and that \\"marketing-wise, he's great. He's the one who came up with the concept of 'Air Jordan.'\\"[218]\\r\\nIn June 2010, Jordan was ranked by Forbes magazine as the 20th-most powerful celebrity in the world with $55?million earned between June 2009 and June 2010. According to the Forbes article, Jordan Brand generates $1?billion in sales for Nike.[219] In June 2014, Jordan was named the first NBA player to become a billionaire, after he increased his stake in the Charlotte Hornets from 80% to 89.5%.[220][221] On January 20, 2015, Jordan was honored with the Charlotte Business Journal's Business Person of the Year for 2014.[222] In 2017, he became a part owner of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball.[223] As of April 2017, his current net worth is estimated at $1.31?billion by Forbes.[224] Jordan is the third-richest African-American as of 2017, behind Oprah Winfrey and Robert F.

The largest family is the Mantidae (\\"mantids\\"). Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats. They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies may or may not have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name praying mantis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe closest relatives of mantises are the termites and cockroaches (Blattodea), which are all within the superorder Dictyoptera. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (Phasmatodea), other elongated insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), or other unrelated insects with raptorial forelegs such as mantisflies (Mantispidae). Mantises are mostly ambush predators, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey. They normally live for about a year. In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die. The eggs are protected by their hard capsules and hatch in the spring. Females sometimes practice sexual cannibalism, eating their mates after copulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMantises were considered to have supernatural powers by early civilizations, including Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt, and Assyria. A cultural trope popular in cartoons imagines the female mantis as a femme fatale. Mantises are among the insects most commonly kept as pets.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 2,400 species of mantis in about 430 genera are recognized.[1] They are predominantly found in tropical regions, but some live in temperate areas.[2][3] The systematics of mantises have long been disputed. Mantises, along with stick insects (Phasmatodea), were once placed in the order Orthoptera with the cockroaches (now Blattodea) and rock crawlers (now Grylloblattodea). Kristensen (1991) combined the Mantodea with the cockroaches and termites into the order Dictyoptera, suborder Mantodea.[4][5]\\r\\nThe name mantodea is formed from the Ancient Greek words ?? (mantis) meaning \\"prophet\\", and ?Ѵ? (eidos) meaning \\"form\\" or \\"type\\". It was coined in 1838 by the German entomologist Hermann Burmeister.[6][7] The order is occasionally called the mantes, using a Latinized plural of Greek mantis. The name mantid properly refers only to members of the family Mantidae, which was, historically, the only family in the order. The other common name, praying mantis, applied to any species in the order,[8] (though in Europe mainly to Mantis religiosa), comes from the typical \\"prayer-like\\" posture with folded fore limbs.[9][10] The vernacular plural \\"mantises\\" (used in this article) was confined largely to the US, with \\"mantids\\" predominantly used as the plural in the UK and elsewhere, until the family Mantidae was further split in 2002.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the earliest classifications splitting an all-inclusive Mantidae into multiple families was that proposed by Beier in 1968, recognizing eight families[13], though it was not until Ehrmann's reclassification into 15 families in 2002[12] that a multiple-family classification became universally adopted. Klass, in 1997, studied the external male genitalia and postulated that the families Chaeteessidae and Metallyticidae diverged from the other families at an early date.[14] However, the Mantidae and Thespidae are still both considered polyphyletic, so the Mantodea will have to be revised.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest mantis fossils are about 135 million years old, from Siberia.[15] Fossils of the group are rare: by 2007, only about 25 fossil species were known.[15] Fossil mantises, including one from Japan with spines on the front legs as in modern mantises, have been found in Cretaceous amber.[16] Most fossils in amber are nymphs; compression fossils (in rock) include adults. Fossil mantises from the Crato Formation in Brazil include the 10?mm (0.39?in) long Santanmantis axelrodi, described in 2003; as in modern mantises, the front legs were adapted for catching prey. Well-preserved specimens yield details as small as 5 m through X-ray computed tomography.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the superficially similar raptorial forelegs, mantidflies may be confused with mantises, though they are unrelated. Their similarity is an example of convergent evolution; mantidflies do not have tegmina (leathery forewings) like mantises, their antennae are shorter and less thread-like, and the raptorial tibia is more muscular than that of a similar-sized mantis and bends back further in preparation for shooting out to grasp prey.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mantodea Species File[18] lists the following living (with at least 2 extinct) families:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMantises have large, triangular heads with a beak-like snout and mandibles. They have two bulbous compound eyes, three small simple eyes, and a pair of antennae. The articulation of the neck is also remarkably flexible; some species of mantis can rotate their heads nearly 180.[10]\\r\\nThe mantis thorax consists of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer than the other two thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing for a wide range of movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nMantises have two spiked, grasping forelegs (\\"raptorial legs\\") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four legs of a mantis, the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment about as long as the femur, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located at the base of the femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium.[19][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nMantises can be loosely categorized as being macropterous (long-winged), brachypterous (short-winged), micropterous (vestigial-winged), or apterous (wingless). If not wingless, a mantis has two sets of wings: the outer wings, or tegmina, are usually narrow and leathery. They function as camouflage and as a shield for the hind wings, which are clearer and more delicate.[19][22]\\r\\nThe abdomen of all mantises consists of 10 tergites, with a corresponding set of nine sternites visible in males and seven visible in females. The abdomen tends to be slimmer in males than females, but ends in a pair of cerci in both sexes.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nMantises have stereo vision.[23][24][25] They locate their prey by sight; their compound eyes contain up to 10,000 ommatidia. A small area at the front called the fovea has greater visual acuity than the rest of the eye, and can produce the high resolution necessary to examine potential prey. The peripheral ommatidia are concerned with perceiving motion; when a moving object is noticed, the head is rapidly rotated to bring the object into the visual field of the fovea. Further motions of the prey are then tracked by movements of the mantis's head so as to keep the image centered on the fovea.[21][26] The eyes are widely spaced and laterally situated, affording a wide binocular field of vision and precise stereoscopic vision at close range.[27] The dark spot on each eye that moves as it rotates its head is a pseudopupil. This occurs because the ommatidia that are viewed \\"head-on\\" absorb the incident light, while those to the side reflect it.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs their hunting relies heavily on vision, mantises are primarily diurnal. Many species, however, fly at night, and then may be attracted to artificial lights.  Mantises in the family Liturgusidae collected at night have been shown to be predominately males;[29] this is probably true for most mantises. Nocturnal flight is especially important to males in locating less-mobile females by detecting their pheromones. Flying at night exposes mantises to fewer bird predators than diurnal flight would. Many mantises also have an auditory thoracic organ that helps them avoid bats by detecting their echolocation calls and responding evasively.[30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nMantises are generalist predators of arthropods.[2] The majority of mantises are ambush predators that only feed upon live prey within their reach. They either camouflage themselves and remain stationary, waiting for prey to approach, or stalk their prey with slow, stealthy movements.[32] Larger mantises sometimes eat smaller individuals of their own species,[33] as well as small vertebrates such as lizards, frogs, small birds and fishes.[34][35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost mantises stalk tempting prey if it strays close enough, and will go further when they are especially hungry.[37] Once within reach, mantises strike rapidly to grasp the prey with their spiked raptorial forelegs.[38] Some ground and bark species pursue their prey in a more active way. For example, members of a few genera such as the ground mantises, Entella, Ligaria, and Ligariella run over dry ground seeking prey, much as tiger beetles do.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fore gut of some species extends the whole length of the insect and can be used to store prey for digestion later. This may be advantageous in an insect that feeds intermittently.[39] Chinese mantises live longer, grow faster, and produce more young when they are able to eat pollen.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nMantises are preyed on by vertebrates such as frogs, lizards, and birds, and by invertebrates such as spiders, large species of hornets, and ants.[41] Some hunting wasps, such as some species of Tachytes also paralyse some species of mantis to feed their young.[42]  Generally, mantises protect themselves by camouflage, most species being cryptically colored to resemble foliage or other backgrounds, both to avoid predators and to better snare their prey.[43] Those that live on uniformly colored surfaces such as bare earth or tree bark are dorsoventrally flattened so as to eliminate shadows that might reveal their presence.[44] The species from different families called flower mantises are aggressive mimics: they resemble flowers convincingly enough to attract prey that come to collect pollen and nectar.[45][46][47] Some species in Africa and Australia are able to turn black after a molt towards the end of the dry season; at this time of year, bush fires occur and this coloration enables them to blend in with the fire-ravaged landscape (fire melanism).[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen directly threatened, many mantis species stand tall and spread their forelegs, with their wings fanning out wide. The fanning of the wings makes the mantis seem larger and more threatening, with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs. If harassment persists, a mantis may strike with its forelegs and attempt to pinch or bite. As part of the bluffing (deimatic) threat display, some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal spiracles. Mantises lack chemical protection, so their displays are largely bluff. When flying at night, at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly, indicating an approaching bat, they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward the safety of the ground, often preceded by an aerial loop or spin. If caught, they may slash captors with their raptorial legs.[44][48][49]\\r\\n\\r\\nMantises, like stick insects, show rocking behavior in which the insect makes rhythmic, repetitive side-to-side movements. Functions proposed for this behavior include the enhancement of crypsis by means of the resemblance to vegetation moving in the wind. However, the repetitive swaying movements may be most important in allowing the insects to discriminate objects from the background by their relative movement, a visual mechanism typical of animals with simpler sight systems. Rocking movements by these generally sedentary insects may replace flying or running as a source of relative motion of objects in the visual field.[50] As ants may be predators of mantises, genera such as  Loxomantis, Orthodera, and Statilia, like many other arthropods, avoid attacking them. Exploiting this behavior, a variety of arthropods, including some early-instar mantises, mimic ants to evade their predators.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaf mimicry: Choeradodis has leaf-like fore wings and a widened green thorax.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdult female Iris oratoria performs a bluffing threat display, rearing back with the forelegs and wings spread and mouth opened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jeweled flower mantis, Creobroter gemmatus: the brightly colored wings are opened suddenly in a deimatic display to startle predators.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome mantis nymphs mimic ants to avoid predators.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mating season in temperate climates typically takes place in autumn,[52][53] while in tropical areas, mating can occur at any time of the year.[53] To mate following courtship, the male usually leaps onto the female's back, clasping her thorax and wing bases with his forelegs. He then arches his abdomen to deposit and store sperm in a special chamber near the tip of the female's abdomen. The female lays between 10 and 400 eggs, depending on the species. Eggs are typically deposited in a froth mass-produced by glands in the abdomen. This froth hardens, creating a protective capsule, which together with the egg mass is called an ootheca. Depending on the species, the ootheca can be attached to a flat surface, wrapped around a plant, or even deposited in the ground. Despite the versatility and durability of the eggs, they are often preyed on, especially by several species of parasitoid wasps. In a few species, mostly ground and bark mantises in the family Tarachodidae, the mother guards the eggs.[52] The cryptic Tarachodes maurus positions herself on bark with her abdomen covering her egg capsule, ambushing passing prey and moving very little until the eggs hatch.[4] An unusual reproductive strategy is adopted by Brunner's stick mantis from the southern United States; no males have ever been found in this species, and the females breed parthenogenetically.[2] The ability to reproduce by parthenogenesis has been recorded in at least two other species, Sphodromantis viridis and Miomantis sp., although these species usually reproduce sexually.[54][55][56]  In temperate climates, adults do not survive the winter and the eggs undergo a diapause, hatching in the spring.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in closely related insect groups in the superorder Dictyoptera, mantises go through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult (mantises are among the hemimetabolous insects). For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3ÿ4 weeks as opposed to 4ÿ6 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult, and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A mantis nymph grows bigger as it molts its exoskeleton. Molting can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or brachypterous (\\"short-winged\\"), particularly in the female sex. The lifespan of a mantis depends on the species; smaller ones may live 4ÿ8 weeks, while larger species may live 4ÿ6 months.[2][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nMantis religiosa mating (brown male, green female)\\r\\n\\r\\nStagmomantis carolina laying ootheca\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently laid M. religiosa ootheca\\r\\n\\r\\nHatching from the ootheca\\r\\n\\r\\nSexual cannibalism is common among most predatory species of mantises in captivity. It has sometimes been observed in natural populations, where about a quarter of male-female encounters result in the male being eaten by the female.[57][58][59] Around 90% of the predatory species of mantises participate in sexual cannibalism.[60] Adult males typically outnumber females at first, but their numbers may be fairly equivalent later in the adult stage,[5] possibly because females selectively eat the smaller males.[61] In Tenodera sinensis, 83% of males escape cannibalism after an encounter with a female, but since multiple matings occur, the probability of a male's being eaten increases cumulatively.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female may begin feeding by biting off the male's head (as they do with regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's movements may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior appeared to be an artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating.[62] Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of her front legs.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason for sexual cannibalism has been debated; experiments show that females on low quality diets have a higher chance to engage in sexual cannibalism compared to females on high quality diets.[64] Some consider that submissive males gain a selective advantage by producing offspring. This theory is supported by a quantifiable increase in the duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized, in some cases doubling both the duration and the chance of fertilization. This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed.[65] The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates. An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males wait for an opportune time to dismount a hungry female, who would be likely to cannibalize her mate.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the earliest mantis references is in the ancient Chinese dictionary Erya, which gives its attributes in poetry, where it represents courage and fearlessness, and a brief description. A later text, the Jingshi Zhenglei Daguan Bencao  (\\"Great History of Medical Material Annotated and Arranged by Types, Based upon the Classics and Historical Works\\") from 1108, gives accurate details of the construction of the egg packages, the development cycle, anatomy, and the function of the antennae.\\r\\nAlthough mantises are rarely mentioned in Ancient Greek sources, a female mantis in threat posture is accurately illustrated on a series of fifth-century BC silver coins, including didrachms, from Metapontum in Sicily.[66]\\r\\nIn the 10th century AD, Byzantine era Adages, Suidas describes an insect resembling a slow-moving green locust with long front legs.[67] He translates Zenobius 2.94 with the words seriphos (maybe a mantis) and graus, an old woman, implying a thin, dried-up stick of a body.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nWestern descriptions of the biology and morphology of the mantises became more accurate in the 18th century. Roesel von Rosenhof illustrated and described mantises and their cannibalistic behavior in the Insekten-Belustigungen (Insect Entertainments).[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nAldous Huxley made philosophical observations about the nature of death while two mantises mated in the sight of two characters in his 1962 novel Island (the species was Gongylus gongylodes). The naturalist Gerald Durrell's humorously autobiographical 1956 book My Family and Other Animals includes a four-page account of an almost evenly matched battle between a mantis and a gecko. Shortly before the fatal dnouement, Durrell narrates:\\r\\n\\r\\nhe [Geronimo the gecko] crashed into the mantis and made her reel, and grabbed the underside of her thorax in his jaws. Cicely [the mantis] retaliated by snapping both her front legs shut on Geronimo's hindlegs. They rustled and staggered across the ceiling and down the wall, each seeking to gain some advantage.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nM. C. Escher's woodcut Dream depicts a human-sized mantis standing on a sleeping bishop.[71] The 1957 film The Deadly Mantis features a mantis as a giant monster.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cultural trope imagines the female mantis as a femme fatale. The idea is propagated in cartoons by Cable, Guy and Rodd, LeLievre, T. McCracken, and Mark Parisi, among others.[72][73][74][75] It ends Isabella Rossellini's short film about the life of a praying mantis in her 2008 Green Porno season for the Sundance Channel.[76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo martial arts separately developed in China have movements and fighting strategies based on those of the mantis.[78][79] As one of these arts was developed in northern China, and the other in southern parts of the country, the arts are today referred to (both in English and Chinese) as 'Northern Praying Mantis'[80] and 'Southern Praying Mantis'.[79] Both are very popular in China, and have also been exported to the West in recent decades.[79][80][81][82]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mantis was revered by the southern African Khoi and San in whose cultures man and nature were intertwined;  for its praying posture, the mantis was even named Hottentotsgot (\\"god of the Khoi\\") in the Afrikaans language that had developed among the first European settlers.[83] However, at least for the San, the mantis was only one of the manifestations of a trickster-deity who could assume many other forms, such as a snake, hare or vulture.[84] Several ancient civilizations did consider the insect to have supernatural powers; for the Greeks, it had the ability to show lost travelers the way home; in the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead the \\"bird-fly\\" is a minor god that leads the souls of the dead to the underworld; in a list of 9th-century BC Nineveh grasshoppers (buru), the mantis is named necromancer (buru-enmeli) and soothsayer (buru-enmeli-ashaga).[69][85]\\r\\n\\r\\nMantises are among the insects most widely kept as pets.[86][87] Because the lifespan of a mantis is only about a year, people who want to keep mantises often breed them. In 2013 at least 31 species were kept and bred in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States.[88]  In 1996 at least 50 species were known to be kept in captivity by members of the Mantis Study Group.[89] The Independent described the \\"giant Asian praying mantis\\" as \\"part stick insect with a touch of Buddhist monk\\",[90] and stated that they needed a vivarium around 30?cm (12?in) on each side.[90] The Daily South argued that a pet insect was no weirder than a pet rat or ferret, and that while a pet mantis was unusual, it would not \\"bark, shed, [or] need shots or a litter box\\".[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nGardeners who prefer to avoid pesticides may encourage mantises in the hope of controlling insect pests.[92] However, mantises do not have key attributes of biological pest control agents; they do not specialize in a single pest insect, and do not multiply rapidly in response to an increase in such a prey species, but are general predators.[92] They eat whatever they can catch, including both harmful and beneficial insects.[91] They therefore have \\"negligible value\\" in biological control.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo species, the Chinese mantis and the European mantis, were deliberately introduced to North America in the hope that they would serve as pest controls for agriculture; they have spread widely in both the United States and Canada.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nA prototype robot inspired by the forelegs of the praying mantis has front legs that allow the robot to walk, climb steps, and grasp objects. The multi-jointed leg provides dexterity via a rotatable joint. Future models may include a more spiked foreleg to improve the grip and ability to support more weight.[94]","input":"What is the predator of a praying mantis?"},{"output":"the American Revolutionary War","context":"The Patriot is a 2000 American epic historical fiction war film directed by Roland Emmerich, written by Robert Rodat, and starring Mel Gibson, Chris Cooper, Heath Ledger, and Jason Isaacs. The film mainly takes place in rural Berkeley County, South Carolina, and depicts the story of an American Colonist, nominally loyal to the British Crown, who is swept into the American Revolutionary War when his family is threatened. Benjamin Martin is a composite figure the scriptwriter claims is based on four factual figures from the American Revolutionary War: Andrew Pickens, Francis Marion, Daniel Morgan, and Thomas Sumter.\\r\\nThe film takes place during the events of the Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War but attracted controversy over its fictional portrayal of historical British figures and atrocities. Professor Mark Glancy, teacher of film history at Queen Mary, University of London has said: \\"It's horrendously inaccurate and attributes crimes committed by the Nazis in the 1940s to the British in the 1770s.\\"[3] While it is clear that the actions of then-Colonel Banastre Tarleton were certainly despicable, they were nowhere near the atrocities in the film, especially with the infamous \\"Burning church\\" scene, of which there is no historical or written record. Australian film critic David Edwards asserts that \\"this fictional story is set around actual events, but it is not a history of what America was, or even an image of what it has becomeit's a dream of what it should be....The Patriot is a grand epic full of action and emotion....But it's also surprisingly insightful in its evaluation of the American idealif not the reality.\\"[4] While, as critic Roger Ebert states, \\"None of it has much to do with the historical reality of the Revolutionary War\\".[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the American Revolution in 1776, Benjamin Martin, a veteran of the French and Indian War and a widower with seven children, is called to Charleston to vote in the South Carolina General Assembly on a levy supporting the Continental Army.

The Martins care for both British and American wounded from a nearby battle, before British Dragoons, led by the ruthless Colonel William Tavington, arrive, arrest Gabriel, and take captive the African American free men and women who work Benjamin's land. When Benjamin's second son Thomas tries to free Gabriel, he is shot and killed by Tavington, who then orders the Martins' house burned, and wounded Americans executed. After the British leave, Benjamin gives his next two eldest sons rifles, and they ambush the British unit escorting a tied Gabriel. Benjamin skillfully, yet brutally, kills many soldiers with his tomahawk. A British survivor tells Tavington of the attack, earning Benjamin the moniker of the \\"Ghost\\". Gabriel decides to rejoin the Continentals and Benjamin soon follows, leaving the younger children in the care of Benjamin's sister-in-law, Charlotte. On their way to the Continental Army's camp, they witness the southern Continental Army under General Horatio Gates engaging the British Army. Benjamin recognizes the foolishness of the action; sure enough, the Continentals are decisively routed.\\r\\nBenjamin meets his former commanding officer, Colonel Harry Burwell, who makes him colonel of the local colonial militia due to his combat experience and also places Gabriel under Benjamin's command. Benjamin is tasked with keeping Lord Cornwallis's regiments pinned south through guerrilla warfare. French Major Jean Villeneuve helps train the militia and promises more French aid.\\r\\nGabriel asks why Villeneuve and others often mention Benjamin's role in something called \\"Fort Wilderness.\\" Benjamin, having been hesitant to answer the question up to now, finally tells his son the story. Benjamin had been fighting in the British Army in the French and Indian War when he and several other soldiers discovered a French atrocity at a fort that Benjamin and his comrades had been trying to reinforce. In a bloodthirsty rage, Benjamin and his comrades caught up with the French at Fort Wilderness, where Benjamin and his unit literally cut the defending French soldiers apart slowly. Benjamin reveals that he has been haunted by guilt ever since.\\r\\nBenjamin's militia harass British supply lines, even capturing some of Cornwallis' personal effects and his two Great Danes, and burn half the bridges and ferries leading to Charleston. Lord Cornwallis blames Tavington for creating this reaction with his brutal tactics. However, irritated at the lack of progress, and insulted by Benjamin's clever ploy to free some of the captured militia, Cornwallis reluctantly allows Tavington to stop Benjamin by any means necessary.\\r\\nWith the reluctant aid of the Loyalist Captain Wilkins, Tavington learns the identities of some militia members and proceeds to attack their families and burn their homes. Benjamin's family flees Charlotte's plantation as it is burned to live in a Gullah settlement with former black slaves. There, Gabriel marries his betrothed Anne. Tavington's brigade rides into the town that supplies the militia. He assembles all the townspeople, including Anne, into the church promising freedom in exchange for the whereabouts of the rebels. However, after the location is given the doors are barricaded, trapping the people as Tavington orders the church burned, killing them all in a cold-blooded act of mass-murder. After discovering the tragedy, Gabriel and several others race to attack Tavington's encampment. In the ensuing fight, Tavington mortally wounds Gabriel before fleeing. Benjamin arrives soon after, only to have another of his sons die in his arms.\\r\\nBenjamin mourns and wavers in his commitment to continue fighting, but is resolved when reminded of his son's dedication to the cause by finding an American flag he repaired personally. Martin's militia, along with a larger Continental Army regiment, confronts Cornwallis' regiment in a decisive battle at the Battle of Cowpens. The British appear to have the upper hand until Benjamin rallies the troops forward against their lines and Tavington rushes to personally target him. The two duel and Tavington gains the upper hand, delivering several wounds to Benjamin. A beaten Benjamin slumps to his knees, and Tavington prepares to deliver the coup de grace. At the last second, however, Benjamin dodges the attack and stabs Tavington to death, avenging his sons' deaths. The battle is a Continental victory and Cornwallis is forced to retreat.\\r\\nAfter many eventual retreats, Cornwallis is besieged at Yorktown, Virginia where he surrenders to the surrounding Continental Army and the long-awaited French naval force. After the conflict ends, Benjamin returns with his family and discovers his militia men rebuilding his homestead in their new nation.\\r\\nScreenwriter Robert Rodat wrote seventeen drafts of the script before there was an acceptable one. In an early version, Anne is pregnant with Gabriel's child when she dies in the burning church. Rodat wrote the script with Gibson in mind for Benjamin Martin, and gave the Martin character six children to signal this preference to studio executives. After the birth of Gibson's seventh child, the script was changed so that Martin had seven children. Like the character William Wallace, which Gibson portrayed in Braveheart five years earlier, Martin is a man seeking to live his life in peace until revenge drives him to lead a cause against a national enemy after the life of an innocent family member is taken.\\r\\nJoshua Jackson, Elijah Wood, Jake Gyllenhaal and Brad Renfro were considered to play Gabriel Martin. The producers and director narrowed their choices for this role to Ryan Phillippe and Heath Ledger, with the latter chosen because the director thought he possessed \\"exuberant youth\\".\\r\\nThe film's German director Emmerich said \\"these were characters I could relate to, and they were engaged in a conflict that had a significant outcomethe creation of the first modern democratic government.\\"[6]\\r\\nThe film was shot entirely on location in South Carolina, including Charleston, Rock Hillfor many of the battle scenes, and Lowrysfor the farm of Benjamin Martin, as well as nearby Fort Lawn.[7] Other scenes were filmed at Mansfield Plantation, an antebellum rice plantation in Georgetown, Middleton Place in Charleston, South Carolina, at the Cistern Yard on the campus of College of Charleston, and Hightower Hall and Homestead House at Brattonsville, South Carolina, along with the grounds of the Brattonsville Plantation in McConnells, South Carolina.[8] Producer Mark Gordon said the production team \\"tried their best to be as authentic as possible\\" because \\"the backdrop was serious history,\\" giving attention to details in period dress.[6] Producer Dean Devlin and the film's costume designers examined actual Revolutionary War uniforms at the Smithsonian Institution prior to shooting.[6]\\r\\nThe musical score for The Patriot was composed by John Williams and was nominated for an Academy Award.[9] David Arnold, who composed the scores to Emmerich's Stargate, Independence Day, and Godzilla, created a demo for The Patriot that was ultimately rejected. As a result, Arnold never returned to compose for any of Emmerich's subsequent films and was replaced by Harald Kloser and Thomas Wanker.\\r\\nThe Patriot received mildly favorable reviews from critics. The film scored a \\"Fresh\\" rating of 61% rating among all critics on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 134 reviews and with an average rating of 6.1/10, which notes that it \\"can be entertaining to watch, but it relies too much on formula and melodrama.\\"[10][11] The Patriot is one of two Emmerich films to ever be given a \\"fresh\\" rating from that website (the other is Independence Day). Rotten Tomatoes also notes that, \\"While his hero is conscience-stricken about killing, Emmerich sure enjoys serving it up in generous helpings.[12] \\" On Metacritic, the film earned a rating of 63 out of 100, based on reviews from 35 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell gave the film a generally negative review, although he praised its casting and called Mel Gibson \\"an astonishing actor\\", particularly for his \\"on-screen comfort and expansiveness\\". He said the film is a \\"gruesome hybrid, a mix of sentimentality and brutality\\".[13] Jamie Malanowski, also writing in The New York Times, said The Patriot \\"will prove to many a satisfying way to spend a summer evening. It's got big battles and wrenching hand-to-hand combat, a courageous but conflicted hero and a dastardly and totally guilt-free villain, thrills, tenderness, sorrow, rage and a little bit of kissing\\".[14] The film was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, and Best Sound.\\r\\nA highly positive review was purportedly written by a critic named David Manning, who was credited to The Ridgefield Press, a small Connecticut weekly news publication. During an investigation into Manning's quotes, Newsweek reporter John Horn discovered that the newspaper had never heard of him.[15] The story emerged at around the same time as an announcement that Sony had used employees posing as moviegoers in television commercials to praise the film. These occurrences, in tandem, raised questions and controversy about ethics in movie marketing practices.\\r\\nOn June 10, 2001, the episode of Le Show, host Harry Shearer conducted an in-studio interview with Manning, whose \\"review\\" of the film was positive. The voice of Manning was provided by a computer voice synthesizer.[16]\\r\\nOn August 3, 2005, Sony made an out-of-court settlement and agreed to refund $5 each to dissatisfied customers who saw this and four other films in American theatres, as a result of Manning's reviews.[17]\\r\\nThe Patriot opened in 3,061 venues at #2 with $22,413,710 domestically in its opening weekend, falling slightly short of expectations (predictions had the film opening #1 with roughly $25 million ahead). The film opened behind Warner Bros The Perfect Storm, which opened at #1 with $41,325,042.[18] The film closed on October 16, 2000 with $113,330,342 domestically, which barely recouped its budget of $110 million. It was successful overseas grossing $101,964,000 with a grand total of $215,294,342.[2]\\r\\nThe Patriot was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Sound Mixing (Kevin O'Connell, Greg P. Russell and Lee Orloff), Best Cinematography, and Best Original Score.[19] It also received several guild awards, including the American Society of Cinematographers award to Caleb Deschanel for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography[20] and the Hollywood Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist Guild Award for Best Period Makeup and Best Period Hair Styling.[21]\\r\\nDuring development, Emmerich and his team consulted with experts at the Smithsonian Institution on set, props, and costumes; advisor Rex Ellis even recommended the Gullah village as an appropriate place for Martin's family to hide.[22] In addition, screenwriter Robert Rodat read through many journals and letters of colonists as part of his preparation for writing the screen play.[23]\\r\\nProducer Mark Gordon said that in making the film, \\"while we were telling a fictional story, the backdrop was serious history\\".[6] Some of the resulting characters and events thus were composites of real characters and events that were designed to serve the fictional narrative without losing the historical flavor. Rodat said of Gibson's character: \\"Benjamin Martin is a composite character made up of Thomas Sumter, Daniel Morgan, Andrew Pickens, and Francis Marion, and a few bits and pieces from a number of other characters.\\"[6] Rodat also indicated that the fictional Colonel William Tavington is \\"loosely based on Colonel Banastre Tarleton, who was particularly known for his brutal acts\\".[6]\\r\\nWhile some events, such as Tarleton's pursuit of Francis Marion and his fellow irregular soldiers who escaped by disappearing into the swamps of South Carolina, were loosely based on history,[24] and others were adapted, such as the final battle in the film which combined elements of the Battles of Cowpens and Battle of Guilford Court House, most of the plot events in the film are pure fiction.\\r\\nThe film was harshly criticized in the British press in part because of its connection to Francis Marion, a militia leader in South Carolina known as the \\"Swamp Fox\\". After the release of The Patriot, the British newspaper The Guardian denounced Marion as \\"a serial rapist who hunted Red Indians for fun.[25] Historian Christopher Hibbert said of Marion:\\r\\n\\"The truth is that people like Marion committed atrocities as bad, if not worse, than those perpetrated by the British.\\"[26]\\r\\nThe Patriot does not depict the American character Benjamin Martin as innocent of atrocities; a key plot point revolves around the character's guilt over acts he engaged in, such as torturing, killing, and mutilating prisoners during the French and Indian War, while not mentioning his crimes against fellow colonists during the Revolutionary War. In Hibbert's book Redcoats and Rebels: The American Revolution Through British Eyes, written before The Patriot was released, Hibbert included no criticism of Marion. Conservative radio host Michael Graham rejected Hibbert's criticism of Marion in a commentary published in National Review:\\r\\n\\"Was Francis Marion a slave owner? Was he a determined and dangerous warrior? Did he commit acts in an 18th century war that we would consider atrocious in the current world of peace and political correctness? As another great American film hero might say: 'You're damn right.' \\"That's what made him a hero, 200 years ago and today.\\"[27]\\r\\nGraham also refers to what he describes as \\"the unchallenged work of South Carolina's premier historian\\" Dr. Walter Edgar, who claimed in his 1998 South Carolina: A History that Marion's partisans were \\"a ragged band of both black and white volunteers\\".[27]\\r\\nAmy Crawford, in Smithsonian magazine, stated that modern historians such as William Gilmore Simms and Hugh Rankin have written accurate biographies of Marion, including Simms' The Life of Francis Marion.[28] The introduction to the 2007 edition of Simms' book was written by Sean Busick, a professor of American history at Athens State University in Alabama, who wrote:\\r\\n\\"Marion deserves to be remembered as one of the heroes of the War for Independence....Francis Marion was a man of his times: he owned slaves, and he fought in a brutal campaign against the Cherokee Indians...Marion's experience in the French and Indian War prepared him for more admirable service.\\"[28]\\r\\nDuring pre-production, the producers debated on whether Martin would own slaves, ultimately deciding not to make him a slave owner. This decision received criticism from Spike Lee, who in a letter to The Hollywood Reporter accused the film's portrayal of slavery as being \\"a complete whitewashing of history\\".[29] Lee wrote that after he and his wife went to see the film, \\"we both came out of the theatre fuming. For three hours The Patriot dodged around, skirted about or completely ignored slavery.\\" Gibson himself remarked: \\"I think I would have made him a slave holder. Not to seems kind of a cop-out.\\"[30]\\r\\nAfter release, several British voices criticized the film for its depiction of the film's villain Tavington and defended the historical character of Banastre Tarleton. Ben Fenton, commenting in the Daily Telegraph, wrote:\\r\\n\\"There is no evidence that Tarleton, called 'Bloody Ban' or 'The Butcher' in rebel pamphlets, ever broke the rules of war and certainly did not ever shoot a child in cold blood.\\"[31]\\r\\nAlthough Tarleton gained the reputation among Americans as a butcher for his involvement in the Waxhaw massacre in South Carolina, he was a hero in Liverpool, England. Liverpool City Council, led by Mayor Edwin Clein, called for a public apology for what they viewed as the film's \\"character assassination\\" of Tarleton.[32] What happened during the Battle of The Waxhaws, known to the Americans as the Buford Massacre or as the Waxhaw massacre, is the subject of debate. According to an American field surgeon named Robert Brownfield who witnessed the events, the Continental Army Col. Buford raised a white flag of surrender, \\"expecting the usual treatment sanctioned by civilized warfare\\". While Buford was calling for quarter, Tarleton's horse was struck by a musket ball and fell. This gave the Loyalist cavalrymen the impression that the Continentals had shot at their commander while asking for mercy. Enraged, the Loyalist troops charged at the Virginians. According to Brownfield, the Loyalists attacked, carrying out \\"indiscriminate carnage never surpassed by the most ruthless atrocities of the most barbarous savages\\".\\r\\nIn Tarleton's own account, he stated that his horse had been shot from under him during the initial charge in which he was knocked out for several minutes and that his men, thinking him dead, engaged in \\"a vindictive asperity not easily restrained\\".[33]\\r\\nTarleton's role in the Revolutionary War in the Carolinas is examined by Ben Rubin who shows that historically, while the actual events of the Battle of the Waxhaws were presented differently according to which side was recounting them, the story of Tarleton's atrocities at Waxhaws and on other occasions became a rallying cry, particularly at the Battle of King's Mountain.[34] The tales of Tarleton's atrocities were a part of standard U.S. accounts of the war and were described by Washington Irving and by Christopher Ward in his 1952 history, The War of the Revolution, where Tarleton is described as \\"cold-hearted, vindictive, and utterly ruthless. He wrote his name in letters of blood all across the history of the war in the South.\\"[35] Not until Anthony Scotti's 2002 book, Brutal Virtue: The Myth and Reality of Banastre Tarleton, were Tarleton's actions fully reexamined. Scotti challenged the factual accounts of atrocities and stressed the \\"propaganda value that such stories held for the Americas both during and after the war\\".[36] Scotti's book, however, did not come out until two years after The Patriot. Screenwriters consulting American works to build the character Tavington based on Tarleton would have commonly found descriptions of him as barbaric and accounts of his name being used for recruiting and motivation during the Revolutionary War itself.[37]\\r\\nWhereas Tavington is depicted as aristocratic but penniless, Tarleton came from a wealthy Liverpool merchant family. Tarleton did not die in battle or from impalement, as Tavington did in the film. Tarleton died on January 16, 1833, in Leintwardine, Herefordshire, England, at the age of 78, nearly 50 years after the war ended. He outlived Col. Francis Marion who died in 1795, by 38 years. Before his death, Tarleton had achieved the military rank of General, equal to that held by the overall British Commanders during the American Revolution, and became a baronet and a member of the British Parliament.\\r\\nThe Patriot was criticized for misrepresenting atrocities during the Revolutionary War, including the killing of prisoners of war and wounded soldiers and burning a church filled with townsfolk. While atrocities occurred during the war, the most striking of the film's depictions of British atrocitiesthe burning of a church full of unarmed colonial civilianshad virtually no factual basis nor parallel in the American or European 18th century wars, with the exception of the Massacre at Lucs-sur-Boulogne in 1794. The New York Post film critic Jonathan Foreman was one of several focusing on this distortion in the film and wrote the following in an article at Salon.com:\\r\\n\\"The most disturbing thing about The Patriot is not just that German director Roland Emmerich (director of Independence Day) and his screenwriter Robert Rodat (who was criticized for excluding the roles played by British, Canadian (Juno Beach) and other Allied troops in the Normandy landings from his script for Saving Private Ryan) depicted British troops as committing savage atrocities, but that those atrocities bear such a close resemblance to war crimes carried out by German troopsparticularly the SS in World War II. It's hard not to wonder if the filmmakers have some kind of subconscious agenda....They have made a film that will have the effect of inoculating audiences against the unique historical horror of Oradourand implicitly rehabilitating the Nazis while making the British seem as evil as history's worst monsters....So it's no wonder that the British press sees this film as a kind of blood libel against the British people.\\"[38]\\r\\nThe Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunter, a historian of the era, said: \\"Any image of the American Revolution which represents you Brits as Nazis and us as gentle folk is almost certainly wrong. It was a very bitter war, a total war, and that is something that I am afraid has been lost to history....[T]he presence of the Loyalists (colonists who did not want to join the fight for independence from Britain) meant that the War of Independence was a conflict of complex loyalties.\\"[39] The historian Richard F. Snow, editor of American Heritage magazine, said of the church-burning scene: \\"Of course it never happenedif it had do you think Americans would have forgotten it? It could have kept us out of World War I.\\"[40][41]\\r\\nSlate columnist Michael Lind criticized the identification of the leading character's actions with patriotism. Specifically, Lind stated that \\"this movie is deeply subversive patriotism. Indeed, patriotism is a concept that neither the screenwriter...nor the director...seems to understand\\". He further wrote that \\"the message of The Patriot is that country is an abstraction, family is everything. It should have been called The Family Man\\".[42]\\r\\nIn contrast, historian Ben Rubin argues that because the American Revolution was a conflict that as often pitted neighbor against neighborWhigs (advocates of Revolution) against Tories (loyalists to Britain)as it pitted nascent Americans against the British, many people stayed neutral until goaded into taking a stand in reaction to perceived atrocities.[43] From this perspective, Benjamin Martin's joining of the militia becomes, according to commentator Jon Roland, a deep patriotism that \\"shows them being called up, not as an act of an official, but by private persons aware of a common threat...[reacting to a] militia duty to defend one another\\".[44]\\r\\nIn the film, Gibson's character asks, \\"Why should I trade one tyrant three thousand miles away for three thousand tyrants one mile away?\\" \\"They Call me a brainless Tory,\\" said (Doctor) Reverend Mather Byles while watching three thousand Sons of Liberty parading the streets of Boston, \\"but tell me my young friend, which is better, to be ruled by one tyrant three thousand miles away or three thousand tyrants not a mile away\\".[45]\\r\\nThe Patriot was released on DVD on October 24, 2000, a Blu-Ray release followed on July 3, 2007.[46] The Patriot was later released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on May 22, 2018.[47]","input":"What war was the movie patriot based on?"},{"output":"Saint John the Baptist","context":"Mission San Juan Bautista is a Spanish mission in San Juan Bautista, San Benito County, California. Founded on June 24, 1797 by Fermn Lasun of the Franciscan order, the mission was the fifteenth of the Spanish missions established in present-day California. Named for Saint John the Baptist, the mission is the namesake of the city of San Juan Bautista.\\r\\nBarracks for the soldiers, a nunnery, the Jose Castro House, and other buildings were constructed around a large grassy plaza in front of the church and can be seen today in their original form. The Ohlone, the original residents of the valley, were brought to live at the mission and baptized, followed by Yokuts from the Central Valley. Mission San Juan Bautista has served mass daily since 1797, and today functions as a parish church of the Diocese of Monterey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing its creation in 1797, San Juan's population grew quickly. By 1803, there were 1,036 Native Americans living at the mission. Ranching and farming activity had moved apace, with 1,036 cattle, 4,600 sheep, 22 swine, 540 horses and 8 mules counted that year. At the same time, the harvest of wheat, barley and corn was estimated at 2,018 fanegas, each of about 220 pounds.\\r\\nFather Pedro Estvan Tpis (who had a special talent for music) joined Father Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta, at Mission San Juan Bautista in 1815 to teach singing to the Indians. He employed a system of notation developed in Spain that uses varied colors or textures for polyphonic music, usually (from bottom to top) solid black, solid red, black outline (sometimes solid yellow) and red outline (or black outline when yellow was used). His choir of Native American boys performed for many visitors, earning the San Juan Bautista Mission the nickname \\"the Mission of Music.\\" Two of his handwritten choir books are preserved at the San Juan Bautista Museum. When Father Tapis died in 1825 he was buried on the mission grounds. The town of San Juan Bautista, which grew up around the mission, expanded rapidly during the California Gold Rush and continues to be a thriving community today.\\r\\nThe mission is situated adjacent to the San Andreas Fault, and has suffered damage from numerous earthquakes, such as those of 1800 and 1906. However, the mission was never entirely destroyed at once. It was restored initially in 1884, and then again in 1949 with funding from the Hearst Foundation. The three-bell campanario, or \\"bell wall,\\" located by the church entrance, was fully restored in 2010. An unpaved stretch of the original El Camino Real, just east of the mission, lies on a fault scarp.[9]\\r\\nAlthough initially secularized in 1835, the church was reconsecrated by the Roman Catholic Church in 1859, and continues to serve as a parish of the Diocese of Monterey. The mission includes a cemetery, with the remains of over 4,000 Native American converts and Europeans buried there.\\r\\nThe mission and its grounds were featured prominently in the 1958 Alfred Hitchcock film Vertigo. Associate producer Herbert Coleman's daughter Judy Lanini suggested the mission to Hitchcock as a filming location. A steeple, added sometime after the mission's original construction and secularization, had been demolished following a fire, so Hitchcock added a bell tower using scale models, matte paintings, and trick photography at the Paramount studio in Los Angeles. The tower does not resemble the original steeple. The tower's staircase was assembled inside a studio.","input":"Who was mission san juan capistrano named after?"},{"output":"3,014 in 2015","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Komodo dragon[4] (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the Komodo monitor, is a species of lizard found in the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, Gili Motang, and Padar.[5] A member of the monitor lizard family Varanidae, it is the largest living species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of 3 metres (10?ft) in rare cases and weighing up to approximately 70 kilograms (150?lb).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir unusually large size has been attributed to island gigantism, since no other carnivorous animals fill the niche on the islands where they live.[6][7] However, recent research suggests the large size of Komodo dragons may be better understood as representative of a relict population of very large varanid lizards that once lived across Indonesia and Australia, most of which, along with other megafauna, died out after the Pleistocene (likely as a result of human activity).[1] Fossils very similar to V. komodoensis have been found in Australia dating to greater than 3.8 million years ago, and its body size remained stable on Flores, one of the handful of Indonesian islands where it is currently found, over the last 900,000 years, \\"a time marked by major faunal turnovers, extinction of the island's megafauna, and the arrival of early hominids by 880 ka [kiloannums].\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of their size, these lizards dominate the ecosystems in which they live.[8] Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates, birds, and mammals. It has been claimed that they have a venomous bite; there are two glands in the lower jaw which secrete several toxic proteins. The biological significance of these proteins is disputed, but the glands have been shown to secrete an anticoagulant. Komodo dragons' group behaviour in hunting is exceptional in the reptile world. The diet of big Komodo dragons mainly consists of Timor deer, though they also eat considerable amounts of carrion.[5] Komodo dragons also occasionally attack humans.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nMating begins between May and August, and the eggs are laid in September. About 20 eggs are deposited in abandoned megapode nests or in a self-dug nesting hole.[5] The eggs are incubated for seven to eight months, hatching in April, when insects are most plentiful. Young Komodo dragons are vulnerable and therefore dwell in trees, safe from predators and cannibalistic adults. They take 8 to 9 years to mature, and are estimated to live up to 30 years.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nKomodo dragons were first recorded by Western scientists in 1910.[10] Their large size and fearsome reputation make them popular zoo exhibits. In the wild, their range has contracted due to human activities, and they are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.[2] They are protected under Indonesian law, and a national park, Komodo National Park, was founded to aid protection efforts.\\r\\n\\r\\nKomodo dragons were first documented by Europeans in 1910, when rumors of a \\"land crocodile\\" reached Lieutenant van Steyn van Hensbroek of the Dutch colonial administration.[11] Widespread notoriety came after 1912, when Peter Ouwens, the director of the Zoological Museum at Bogor, Java, published a paper on the topic after receiving a photo and a skin from the lieutenant, as well as two other specimens from a collector.[3] The first two live Komodo dragons to arrive in Europe were exhibited in the Reptile House at London Zoo when it opened in 1927.[12] Joan Beauchamp Procter made some of the earliest observations of these animals in captivity and she demonstrated the behaviour of one of these animals at a Scientific Meeting of the Zoological Society of London in 1928.[13] The Komodo dragon was the driving factor for an expedition to Komodo Island by W. Douglas Burden in 1926. After returning with 12 preserved specimens and 2 live ones, this expedition provided the inspiration for the 1933 movie King Kong.[14] It was also Burden who coined the common name \\"Komodo dragon.\\"[15] Three of his specimens were stuffed and are still on display in the American Museum of Natural History.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch, realizing the limited number of individuals in the wild, outlawed sport hunting and heavily limited the number of individuals taken for scientific study. Collecting expeditions ground to a halt with the occurrence of World War II, not resuming until the 1950s and 1960s, when studies examined the Komodo dragon's feeding behavior, reproduction, and body temperature. At around this time, an expedition was planned in which a long-term study of the Komodo dragon would be undertaken. This task was given to the Auffenberg family, who stayed on Komodo Island for 11 months in 1969. During their stay, Walter Auffenberg and his assistant Putra Sastrawan captured and tagged more than 50 Komodo dragons.[17] The research from the Auffenberg expedition would prove to be enormously influential in raising Komodo dragons in captivity.[18] Research after that of the Auffenberg family has shed more light on the nature of the Komodo dragon, with biologists such as Claudio Ciofi continuing to study the creatures.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Komodo dragon is also known as the Komodo monitor or the Komodo Island monitor in scientific literature,[4] although this is not very common. To the natives of Komodo Island, it is referred to as ora, buaya darat (land crocodile), or biawak raksasa (giant monitor).[20][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evolutionary development of the Komodo dragon started with the genus Varanus, which originated in Asia about 40 million years ago and migrated to Australia, where it evolved into giant forms (the largest of all being the recently extinct Megalania), helped by the absence of competing placental carnivorans. Around 15 million years ago, a collision between Australia and Southeast Asia allowed these larger varanids to move back into what is now the Indonesian archipelago, extending their range as far east as the island of Timor. The Komodo dragon was believed to have differentiated from its Australian ancestors 4 million years ago. However, recent fossil evidence from Queensland suggests the Komodo dragon actually evolved in Australia before spreading to Indonesia.[1][21] Dramatic lowering of sea level during the last glacial period uncovered extensive stretches of continental shelf that the Komodo dragon colonised, becoming isolated in their present island range as sea levels rose afterwards.[1][11] Extinct Pliocene species of similar size to the modern Komodo dragon, such as Varanus sivalensis, have been found in Eurasia as well, indicating that they fared well even in environments containing competition such as mammalian carnivores until the climate change and extinction events that marked the beginning of the Pleistocene.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wild, an adult Komodo dragon usually weighs around 70?kg (150?lb), although captive specimens often weigh more.[23] According to Guinness World Records, an average adult male will weigh 79 to 91?kg (174 to 201?lb) and measure 2.59?m (8.5?ft), while an average female will weigh 68 to 73?kg (150 to 161?lb) and measure 2.29?m (7.5?ft).[24] The largest verified wild specimen was 3.13?m (10.3?ft) long and weighed 166?kg (366?lb), including undigested food.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Komodo dragon has a tail as long as its body, as well as about 60 frequently replaced, serrated teeth that can measure up to 2.5?cm (1?in) in length. Its saliva is frequently blood-tinged, because its teeth are almost completely covered by gingival tissue that is naturally lacerated during feeding.[25] It also has a long, yellow, deeply forked tongue.[11] Komodo dragon skin is reinforced by armoured scales, which contain tiny bones called osteoderms that function as a sort of natural chain-mail.[26][27] This rugged hide makes Komodo dragon skin a poor source of leather.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with other varanids, Komodo dragons have only a single ear bone, the stapes, for transferring vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea. This arrangement means they are likely restricted to sounds in the 400 to 2,000 hertz range, compared to humans who hear between 20 and 20,000 hertz.[11][28] It was formerly thought to be deaf when a study reported no agitation in wild Komodo dragons in response to whispers, raised voices, or shouts. This was disputed when London Zoological Garden employee Joan Proctor trained a captive specimen to come out to feed at the sound of her voice, even when she could not be seen.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Komodo dragon can see objects as far away as 300?m (980?ft), but because its retinas only contain cones, it is thought to have poor night vision. It can distinguish colours, but has poor visual discrimination of stationary objects.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Komodo dragon uses its tongue to detect, taste, and smell stimuli, as with many other reptiles, with the vomeronasal sense using the Jacobson's organ, rather than using the nostrils.[31] With the help of a favorable wind and its habit of swinging its head from side to side as it walks, a Komodo dragon may be able to detect carrion from 4ÿ9.5?km (2.5ÿ5.9?mi) away.[30] It only has a few taste buds in the back of its throat.[31] Its scales, some of which are reinforced with bone, have sensory plaques connected to nerves to facilitate its sense of touch. The scales around the ears, lips, chin, and soles of the feet may have three or more sensory plaques.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Komodo dragon prefers hot and dry places, and typically lives in dry, open grassland, savanna, and tropical forest at low elevations. As an ectotherm, it is most active in the day, although it exhibits some nocturnal activity. Komodo dragons are solitary, coming together only to breed and eat. They are capable of running rapidly in brief sprints up to 20?km/h (12?mph), diving up to 4.5?m (15?ft), and climbing trees proficiently when young through use of their strong claws.[23] To catch out-of-reach prey, the Komodo dragon may stand on its hind legs and use its tail as a support.[29] As it matures, its claws are used primarily as weapons, as its great size makes climbing impractical.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor shelter, the Komodo dragon digs holes that can measure from 1 to 3?m (3.3 to 9.8?ft) wide with its powerful forelimbs and claws.[32] Because of its large size and habit of sleeping in these burrows, it is able to conserve body heat throughout the night and minimise its basking period the morning after.[33] The Komodo dragon hunts in the afternoon, but stays in the shade during the hottest part of the day.[15] These special resting places, usually located on ridges with cool sea breezes, are marked with droppings and are cleared of vegetation. They serve as strategic locations from which to ambush deer.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nKomodo dragons are carnivores. Although they have been considered as eating mostly carrion,[6] they will frequently ambush live prey with a stealthy approach. When suitable prey arrives near a dragon's ambush site, it will suddenly charge at the animal at high speeds and go for the underside or the throat.[25] Komodo dragons make no attempt to deliberately allow the prey to escape with fatal injuries, but try to kill prey outright using a combination of lacerating damage and blood loss. They have been recorded as killing wild pigs within seconds,[35] and observations of Komodo dragons tracking prey for long distances are likely misinterpreted cases of prey escaping an attack before succumbing to infection.[36] Komodo dragons have been observed knocking down large pigs and deer with their strong tails.[37][35] It is able to locate carcasses using its keen sense of smell, which can locate a dead or dying animal from a range of up to 9.5?km (5.9?mi).\\r\\n\\r\\nKomodo dragons eat by tearing large chunks of flesh and swallowing them whole while holding the carcass down with their forelegs. For smaller prey up to the size of a goat, their loosely articulated jaws, flexible skulls, and expandable stomachs allow them to swallow prey whole. The vegetable contents of the stomach and intestines are typically avoided.[34] Copious amounts of red saliva the Komodo dragons produce help to lubricate the food, but swallowing is still a long process (15ÿ20?minutes to swallow a goat). A Komodo dragon may attempt to speed up the process by ramming the carcass against a tree to force it down its throat, sometimes ramming so forcefully, the tree is knocked down.[34] A small tube under the tongue that connects to the lungs allows it to breathe while swallowing.[25] After eating up to 80% of its body weight in one meal,[8] it drags itself to a sunny location to speed digestion, as the food could rot and poison the dragon if left undigested for too long. Because of their slow metabolism, large dragons can survive on as few as 12 meals a year.[25] After digestion, the Komodo dragon regurgitates a mass of horns, hair, and teeth known as the gastric pellet, which is covered in malodorous mucus. After regurgitating the gastric pellet, it rubs its face in the dirt or on bushes to get rid of the mucus, suggesting it does not relish the scent of its own excretions.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest animals eat first, while the smaller ones follow a hierarchy. The largest male asserts his dominance and the smaller males show their submission by use of body language and rumbling hisses. Dragons of equal size may resort to \\"wrestling\\". Losers usually retreat, though they have been known to be killed and eaten by victors.[38][39]\\r\\nThe Komodo dragon's diet is wide-ranging, and includes invertebrates, other reptiles (including smaller Komodo dragons), birds, bird eggs, small mammals, monkeys, wild boar, goats, deer, horses, and water buffalo.[40] Young Komodos will eat insects, eggs, geckos, and small mammals, while adults prefer to hunt large mammals.[6] Occasionally, they attack and bite humans (see first paragraphs of this article). Sometimes they consume human corpses, digging up bodies from shallow graves.[29] This habit of raiding graves caused the villagers of Komodo to move their graves from sandy to clay ground and pile rocks on top of them to deter the lizards.[34] The Komodo dragon may have evolved to feed on the extinct dwarf elephant Stegodon that once lived on Flores, according to evolutionary biologist Jared Diamond.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Komodo dragon drinks by sucking water into its mouth via buccal pumping (a process also used for respiration), lifting its head, and letting the water run down its throat.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough previous studies proposed that Komodo dragon saliva contains a variety of highly septic bacteria that would help to bring down prey,[38][42] research in 2013 suggested that the bacteria in the mouths of Komodo dragons are ordinary and similar to those found in other carnivores. They actually have surprisingly good mouth hygiene. As Bryan Fry put it: \\"After they are done feeding, they will spend 10 to 15 minutes lip-licking and rubbing their head in the leaves to clean their mouth... Unlike people have been led to believe, they do not have chunks of rotting flesh from their meals on their teeth, cultivating bacteria.\\" Nor do Komodo dragons wait for prey to die and track it at a distance, as vipers do; observations of them hunting deer, boar and in some cases buffalo reveal that they kill prey in less than half an hour, using their dentition to cause shock and trauma.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe observation of prey dying of sepsis would then be explained by the natural instinct of water buffalos, who are not native to the islands where the Komodo dragon lives, to run into water after escaping an attack. The warm, faeces-filled water would then cause the infections.[36] The study used samples from 16 captive dragons (10 adults and six neonates) from three U.S. zoos.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers have isolated a powerful antibacterial peptide from the blood plasma of Komodo dragons, VK25. Based on their analysis of this peptide, they have synthesized a short peptide dubbed DRGN-1 and tested it against multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Preliminary results of these tests show that DRGN-1 is effective in killing drug-resistant bacterial strains and even some fungi. It has the added observed benefit of significantly promoting wound healing in both uninfected and mixed biofilm infected wounds.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2005, researchers at the University of Melbourne speculated the perentie (Varanus giganteus), other species of monitors, and agamids may be somewhat venomous. The team believes the immediate effects of bites from these lizards were caused by mild envenomation. Bites on human digits by a lace monitor (V. varius), a Komodo dragon, and a spotted tree monitor (V. scalaris) all produced similar effects: rapid swelling, localised disruption of blood clotting, and shooting pain up to the elbow, with some symptoms lasting for several hours.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, the same researchers published further evidence demonstrating Komodo dragons possess a venomous bite. MRI scans of a preserved skull showed the presence of two glands in the lower jaw. The researchers extracted one of these glands from the head of a terminally ill dragon in the Singapore Zoological Gardens, and found it secreted several different toxic proteins. The known functions of these proteins include inhibition of blood clotting, lowering of blood pressure, muscle paralysis, and the induction of hypothermia, leading to shock and loss of consciousness in envenomated prey.[46][47] As a result of the discovery, the previous theory that bacteria were responsible for the deaths of Komodo victims was disputed.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther scientists have stated that this allegation of venom glands \\"has had the effect of underestimating the variety of complex roles played by oral secretions in the biology of reptiles, produced a very narrow view of oral secretions and resulted in misinterpretation of reptilian evolution\\". According to these scientists \\"reptilian oral secretions contribute to many biological roles other than to quickly dispatch prey\\". These researchers concluded that, \\"Calling all in this clade venomous implies an overall potential danger that does not exist, misleads in the assessment of medical risks, and confuses the biological assessment of squamate biochemical systems\\".[49] Evolutionary biologist Schwenk says that even if the lizards have venom-like proteins in their mouths they may be using them for a different function, and he doubts venom is necessary to explain the effect of a Komodo dragon bite, arguing that shock and blood loss are the primary factors.[50][51]\\r\\n\\r\\nMating occurs between May and August, with the eggs laid in September.[11] During this period, males fight over females and territory by grappling with one another upon their hind legs, with the loser eventually being pinned to the ground. These males may vomit or defecate when preparing for the fight.[29] The winner of the fight will then flick his long tongue at the female to gain information about her receptivity.[8] Females are antagonistic and resist with their claws and teeth during the early phases of courtship. Therefore, the male must fully restrain the female during coitus to avoid being hurt. Other courtship displays include males rubbing their chins on the female, hard scratches to the back, and licking.[52] Copulation occurs when the male inserts one of his hemipenes into the female's cloaca.[30] Komodo dragons may be monogamous and form \\"pair bonds\\", a rare behavior for lizards.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nFemale Komodos lay their eggs from August to September and may use several types of locality; in one study, 60% laid their eggs in the nests of orange-footed scrubfowl (a moundbuilder or megapode), 20% on ground level and 20% in hilly areas.[53] The females make many camouflage nests/holes to prevent other dragons from eating the eggs.[54] Clutches contain an average of 20 eggs, which have an incubation period of 7ÿ8 months.[29] Hatching is an exhausting effort for the neonates, which break out of their eggshells with an egg tooth that falls off before long. After cutting themselves out, the hatchlings may lie in their eggshells for hours before starting to dig out of the nest. They are born quite defenseless and are vulnerable to predation.[38] Sixteen youngsters from a single nest were on average 46.5?cm long and weighed 105.1?grams.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Komodo dragons spend much of their first few years in trees, where they are relatively safe from predators, including cannibalistic adults, as juvenile dragons make up 10% of their diets.[29] The habit of cannibalism may be advantageous in sustaining the large size of adults, as medium-sized prey on the islands is rare.[37] When the young approach a kill, they roll around in faecal matter and rest in the intestines of eviscerated animals to deter these hungry adults.[29] Komodo dragons take approximately 8 to 9 years to mature, and may live for up to 30 years.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Komodo dragon at London Zoo named Sungai laid a clutch of eggs in late 2005 after being separated from male company for more than two years. Scientists initially assumed she had been able to store sperm from her earlier encounter with a male, an adaptation known as superfecundation.[55] On 20 December 2006, it was reported that Flora, a captive Komodo dragon living in the Chester Zoo in England, was the second known Komodo dragon to have laid unfertilised eggs: she laid 11 eggs, and seven of them hatched, all of them male.[56] Scientists at Liverpool University in England performed genetic tests on three eggs that collapsed after being moved to an incubator, and verified Flora had never been in physical contact with a male dragon. After Flora's eggs' condition had been discovered, testing showed Sungai's eggs were also produced without outside fertilization.[57] On 31 January 2008, the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas, became the first zoo in the Americas to document parthenogenesis in Komodo dragons. The zoo has two adult female Komodo dragons, one of which laid about 17 eggs on 19ÿ20 May 2007. Only two eggs were incubated and hatched due to space issues; the first hatched on 31 January 2008, while the second hatched on 1 February. Both hatchlings were males.[58][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nKomodo dragons have the ZW chromosomal sex-determination system, as opposed to the mammalian XY system. Male progeny prove Flora's unfertilised eggs were haploid (n) and doubled their chromosomes later to become diploid (2n) (by being fertilised by a polar body, or by chromosome duplication without cell division), rather than by her laying diploid eggs by one of the meiosis reduction-divisions in her ovaries failing. When a female Komodo dragon (with ZW sex chromosomes) reproduces in this manner, she provides her progeny with only one chromosome from each of her pairs of chromosomes, including only one of her two sex chromosomes. This single set of chromosomes is duplicated in the egg, which develops parthenogenetically. Eggs receiving a Z chromosome become ZZ (male); those receiving a W chromosome become WW and fail to develop,[60][61] meaning that only males are produced by parthenogenesis in this species.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been hypothesised that this reproductive adaptation allows a single female to enter an isolated ecological niche (such as an island) and by parthenogenesis produce male offspring, thereby establishing a sexually reproducing population (via reproduction with her offspring that can result in both male and female young).[60] Despite the advantages of such an adaptation, zoos are cautioned that parthenogenesis may be detrimental to genetic diversity.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nAttacks on humans are rare, but this species has been responsible for several human fatalities, in both the wild and captivity. According to a data from Komodo National Park, within 38 years in a period between 1974 and 2012, there were 24 reported attacks on humans, 5 of them deadly. Most of the victims are local villagers living around the national park.[63] Reports of attacks include:[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Komodo dragon is a vulnerable species and is on the IUCN Red List.[2] The Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to protect Komodo dragon populations on islands including Komodo, Rinca, and Padar.[66] Later, the Wae Wuul and Wolo Tado Reserves were opened on Flores to aid with Komodo dragon conservation.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nKomodo dragons avoid encounters with humans. Juveniles are very shy and will flee quickly into a hideout if a human comes closer than about 100 metres (330?ft). Older animals will also retreat from humans from a shorter distance away. If cornered, they will react aggressively by gaping their mouth, hissing, and swinging their tail. If they are disturbed further, they may start an attack and bite. Although there are anecdotes of unprovoked Komodo dragons attacking or preying on humans, most of these reports are either not reputable or caused by defensive bites. Only a very few cases are truly the result of unprovoked attacks by abnormal individuals, which lost their fear towards humans.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nVolcanic activity, earthquakes, loss of habitat, fire,[25][19] loss of prey due to poaching, tourism, and illegal poaching of the dragons themselves have all contributed to the vulnerable status of the Komodo dragon. Under Appendix I of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), commercial trade of skins or specimens is illegal.[67][68]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, total population in the wild was assessed as 3,222 individuals, declining to 3,092 in 2014 and 3,014 in 2015. Populations remained relatively stable on the bigger islands (Komodo and Rinca), but decreased on smaller island such as Nusa Kode and Gili Motang, likely due to diminishing prey availability.[69]\\r\\nOn Padar, a former population of the Komodo dragon became extinct, of which the last individuals were seen in 1975.[70] It is widely assumed that the Komodo dragon died out on Padar after a strong decline of the populations of large ungulate prey, for which poaching was most likely responsible.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nKomodo dragons have long been great zoo attractions, where their size and reputation make them popular exhibits. They are, however, rare in zoos because they are susceptible to infection and parasitic disease if captured from the wild, and do not readily reproduce.[20] As of May 2009, there were 13 European, 2 African, 35 North American, 1 Singaporean, and 2 Australian institutions that kept Komodo dragons.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Komodo dragons were displayed at London Zoo in 1927. A Komodo dragon was exhibited in 1934 at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., but it lived for only two years. More attempts to exhibit Komodo dragons were made, but the lifespan of these animals was very short, averaging five years in the National Zoological Park. Studies done by Walter Auffenberg, which were documented in his book The Behavioral Ecology of the Komodo Monitor, eventually allowed for more successful managing and reproducing of the dragons in captivity.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nA variety of behaviors have been observed from captive specimens. Most individuals are relatively tame within a short time,[73][74] and are capable of recognising individual humans and discriminating between familiar keepers.[75] Komodo dragons have also been observed to engage in play with a variety of objects, including shovels, cans, plastic rings, and shoes. This behavior does not seem to be \\"food-motivated predatory behavior\\".[8][11][76]\\r\\n\\r\\nEven seemingly docile dragons may become unpredictably aggressive, especially when the animal's territory is invaded by someone unfamiliar. In June 2001, a Komodo dragon seriously injured Phil Bronstein, the then husband of actress Sharon Stone, when he entered its enclosure at the Los Angeles Zoo after being invited in by its keeper. Bronstein was bitten on his bare foot, as the keeper had told him to take off his white shoes and socks, which the keeper stated could potentially excite the Komodo dragon as they were the same colour as the white rats the zoo fed the dragon.[77][78] Although he escaped, Bronstein needed to have several tendons in his foot reattached surgically.[79]","input":"How many komodo dragons are there in the wild?"},{"output":"promote the ratification of the United States Constitution","context":"The Federalist (later known as The Federalist Papers) is a collection of 85 articles and essays written under the pseudonym \\"Publius\\" by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay to promote the ratification of the United States Constitution. Seventy-seven of these essays were published serially in the Independent Journal, the New York Packet, and The Daily Advertiser between October 1787 and August 1788. A two-volume compilation of these and eight others was published in 1788 as The Federalist: A Collection of Essays, Written in Favour of the New Constitution, as Agreed upon by the Federal Convention, September 17, 1787.[1][2] The collection was commonly known as The Federalist until the name The Federalist Papers emerged in the 20th century.\\r\\nThough the authors of The Federalist foremost wished to influence the vote in favor of ratifying the Constitution, in \\"Federalist No. 1\\", they explicitly set that debate in broader political terms:\\r\\nIt has been frequently remarked, that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not, of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend, for their political constitutions, on accident and force.[3]\\r\\n\\"Federalist No. 10\\", in which Madison discusses the means of preventing rule by majority faction and advocates a large, commercial republic, is generally regarded as the most important of the 85 articles from a philosophical perspective; it is complemented by \\"Federalist No. 14\\", in which Madison takes the measure of the United States, declares it appropriate for an extended republic, and concludes with a memorable defense of the constitutional and political creativity of the Federal Convention.[4] In \\"Federalist No. 84\\", Hamilton makes the case that there is no need to amend the Constitution by adding a Bill of Rights, insisting that the various provisions in the proposed Constitution protecting liberty amount to a \\"bill of rights\\". \\"Federalist No. 78\\", also written by Hamilton, lays the groundwork for the doctrine of judicial review by federal courts of federal legislation or executive acts. \\"Federalist No. 70\\" presents Hamilton's case for a one-man chief executive. In \\"Federalist No. 39\\", Madison presents the clearest exposition of what has come to be called \\"Federalism\\". In \\"Federalist No. 51\\", Madison distills arguments for checks and balances in an essay often quoted for its justification of government as \\"the greatest of all reflections on human nature.\\"\\r\\nAccording to historian Richard B. Morris, they are an \\"incomparable exposition of the Constitution, a classic in political science unsurpassed in both breadth and depth by the product of any later American writer.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Federal Convention sent the proposed Constitution to the Confederation Congress, which in turn submitted it to the states for ratification at the end of September 1787. On September 27, 1787, \\"Cato\\" first appeared in the New York press criticizing the proposition; \\"Brutus\\" followed on October 18, 1787.[6] These and other articles and public letters critical of the new Constitution would eventually become known as the \\"Anti-Federalist Papers\\". In response, Alexander Hamilton decided to launch a measured defense and extensive explanation of the proposed Constitution to the people of the state of New York. He wrote in Federalist No. 1 that the series would \\"endeavor to give a satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their appearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.\\"[7]\\r\\nHamilton recruited collaborators for the project. He enlisted John Jay, who after four strong essays (Federalist Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5), fell ill and contributed only one more essay, Federalist No. 64, to the series. He also distilled his case into a pamphlet in the spring of 1788, An Address to the People of the State of New-York; Hamilton cited it approvingly in Federalist No. 85. James Madison, present in New York as a Virginia delegate to the Confederation Congress, was recruited by Hamilton and Jay, and became Hamilton's major collaborator. Gouverneur Morris and William Duer were also apparently considered; Morris turned down the invitation, and Hamilton rejected three essays written by Duer.[8] Duer later wrote in support of the three Federalist authors under the name \\"Philo-Publius\\", or \\"Friend of Publius\\".\\r\\nHamilton chose \\"Publius\\" as the pseudonym under which the series would be written. While many other pieces representing both sides of the constitutional debate were written under Roman names, Albert Furtwangler contends that \\"'Publius' was a cut above 'Caesar' or 'Brutus' or even 'Cato.' Publius Valerius was not a late defender of the republic but one of its founders. His more famous name, Publicola, meant 'friend of the people.'\\"[9] It was not the first time Hamilton had used this pseudonym: in 1778, he had applied it to three letters attacking fellow Federalist Samuel Chase. Chase's patriotism was questioned when Hamilton revealed that Chase had taken advantage of knowledge gained in Congress to try to dominate the flour market.\\r\\nAt the time of publication the authorship of the articles was a closely guarded secret, though astute observers discerned the identities of Hamilton, Madison, and Jay. Following Hamilton's death in 1804, a list that he had drafted claiming fully two-thirds of the papers for himself became public, including some that seemed more likely the work of Madison (No. 49ÿ58 and 62ÿ63). The scholarly detective work of Douglass Adair in 1944 postulated the following assignments of authorship, corroborated in 1964 by a computer analysis of the text:\\r\\nA total of 85 articles were written by the three men in a span of ten months under the pseudonym \\"Publius\\" because it recalled the founder of the Roman Republic, and using it implied a positive intention.[9] Madison is now acknowledged as the father of the Constitutiondespite his repeated rejection of this honor during his lifetime.[11] Madison became a leading member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia (1789ÿ1797), Secretary of State (1801ÿ1809), and ultimately the fourth President of the United States.[12] Hamilton, who had been a leading advocate of national constitutional reform throughout the 1780s and represented New York at the Constitutional Convention, in 1789 became the first Secretary of the Treasury, a post he held until his resignation in 1795. John Jay, who had been secretary for foreign affairs under the Articles of Confederation from 1784 through their expiration in 1789, became the first Chief Justice of the United States in 1789, stepping down in 1795 to accept election as governor of New York, a post he held for two terms, retiring in 1801.\\r\\nThe Federalist articles appeared in three New York newspapers: The Independent Journal, the New-York Packet, and the Daily Advertiser, beginning on October 27, 1787. Although written and published with haste, The Federalist articles were widely read and greatly influenced the shape of American political institutions.[13] Between them, Hamilton, Madison and Jay kept up a rapid pace, with at times three or four new essays by Publius appearing in the papers in a week. Garry Wills observes that the pace of production \\"overwhelmed\\" any possible response: \\"Who, given ample time could have answered such a battery of arguments? And no time was given.\\"[14] Hamilton also encouraged the reprinting of the essay in newspapers outside New York state, and indeed they were published in several other states where the ratification debate was taking place. However, they were only irregularly published outside New York, and in other parts of the country they were often overshadowed by local writers.[15]\\r\\nBecause the essays were initially published in New York, most of them begin with the same salutation: \\"To the People of the State of New York\\".\\r\\nThe high demand for the essays led to their publication in a more permanent form. On January 1, 1788, the New York publishing firm J. & A. McLean announced that they would publish the first thirty-six essays as a bound volume; that volume was released on March 2 and was titled The Federalist. New essays continued to appear in the newspapers; Federalist No. 77 was the last number to appear first in that form, on April 2. A second bound volume containing the last forty-nine essays was released on May 28. The remaining eight papers were published in the New York newspapers between June 14 and August 16.[16]\\r\\nA 1792 French edition ended the collective anonymity of Publius, announcing that the work had been written by \\"MM Hamilton, Maddisson E Gay\\", citizens of the State of New York. In 1802, George Hopkins published an American edition that similarly named the authors. Hopkins wished as well that \\"the name of the writer should be prefixed to each number,\\" but at this point Hamilton insisted that this was not to be, and the division of the essays among the three authors remained a secret.[17]\\r\\nThe first publication to divide the papers in such a way was an 1810 edition that used a list left by Hamilton to associate the authors with their numbers; this edition appeared as two volumes of the compiled \\"Works of Hamilton\\". In 1818, Jacob Gideon published a new edition with a new listing of authors, based on a list provided by Madison. The difference between Hamilton's list and Madison's formed the basis for a dispute over the authorship of a dozen of the essays.[18]\\r\\nBoth Hopkins's and Gideon's editions incorporated significant edits to the text of the papers themselves, generally with the approval of the authors. In 1863, Henry Dawson published an edition containing the original text of the papers, arguing that they should be preserved as they were written in that particular historical moment, not as edited by the authors years later.[19]\\r\\nModern scholars generally use the text prepared by Jacob E. Cooke for his 1961 edition of The Federalist; this edition used the newspaper texts for essay numbers 1ÿ76 and the McLean edition for essay numbers 77ÿ85.[20]\\r\\nThe authorship of seventy-three of The Federalist essays is fairly certain. Twelve of these essays are disputed over by some scholars, though the modern consensus is that Madison wrote essays Nos. 49ÿ58, with Nos. 18ÿ20 being products of a collaboration between him and Hamilton; No. 64 was by John Jay. The first open designation of which essay belonged to whom was provided by Hamilton who, in the days before his ultimately fatal gun duel with Aaron Burr, provided his lawyer with a list detailing the author of each number. This list credited Hamilton with a full sixty-three of the essays (three of those being jointly written with Madison), almost three-quarters of the whole, and was used as the basis for an 1810 printing that was the first to make specific attribution for the essays.[21]\\r\\nMadison did not immediately dispute Hamilton's list, but provided his own list for the 1818 Gideon edition of The Federalist. Madison claimed twenty-nine numbers for himself, and he suggested that the difference between the two lists was \\"owing doubtless to the hurry in which [Hamilton's] memorandum was made out.\\" A known error in Hamilton's listHamilton incorrectly ascribed No. 54 to John Jay, when in fact, Jay wrote No. 64provided some evidence for Madison's suggestion.[22]\\r\\nStatistical analysis has been undertaken on several occasions to try to ascertain the authorship question based on word frequencies and writing styles. Nearly all of the statistical studies show that the disputed papers were written by Madison, although a computer science study theorizes the papers were a collaborative effort.[23][24][25]\\r\\nThe Federalist Papers were written to support the ratification of the Constitution, specifically in New York. Whether they succeeded in this mission is questionable. Separate ratification proceedings took place in each state, and the essays were not reliably reprinted outside of New York; furthermore, by the time the series was well underway, a number of important states had already ratified it, for instance Pennsylvania on December 12. New York held out until July 26; certainly The Federalist was more important there than anywhere else, but Furtwangler argues that it \\"could hardly rival other major forces in the ratification contests\\"specifically, these forces included the personal influence of well-known Federalists, for instance Hamilton and Jay, and Anti-Federalists, including Governor George Clinton.[26] Further, by the time New York came to a vote, ten states had already ratified the Constitution and it had thus already passedonly nine states had to ratify it for the new government to be established among them; the ratification by Virginia, the tenth state, placed pressure on New York to ratify. In light of that, Furtwangler observes, \\"New York's refusal would make that state an odd outsider.\\"[27]\\r\\nOnly 19 Federalists were elected to New York's ratification convention, compared to the Anti-Federalists' 46 delegates. While New York did indeed ratify the Constitution on July 26, the lack of public support for pro-Constitution Federalists has led historian John Kaminski to suggest that the impact of The Federalist on New York citizens was \\"negligible\\".[28]\\r\\nAs for Virginia, which only ratified the Constitution at its convention on June 25, Hamilton writes in a letter to Madison that the collected edition of The Federalist had been sent to Virginia; Furtwangler presumes that it was to act as a \\"debater's handbook for the convention there,\\" though he claims that this indirect influence would be a \\"dubious distinction.\\"[29] Probably of greater importance to the Virginia debate, in any case, were George Washington's support for the proposed Constitution and the presence of Madison and Edmund Randolph, the governor, at the convention arguing for ratification.\\r\\nIn Federalist No. 1, Hamilton listed six topics to be covered in the subsequent articles:\\r\\nFurtwangler notes that as the series grew, this plan was somewhat changed. The fourth topic expanded into detailed coverage of the individual articles of the Constitution and the institutions it mandated, while the two last topics were merely touched on in the last essay.\\r\\nThe papers can be broken down by author as well as by topic. At the start of the series, all three authors were contributing; the first twenty papers are broken down as eleven by Hamilton, five by Madison and four by Jay. The rest of the series, however, is dominated by three long segments by a single writer: No. 21 through No. 36 by Hamilton, No. 37 through 58 by Madison, written while Hamilton was in Albany, and No. 65 through the end by Hamilton, published after Madison had left for Virginia.[31]\\r\\nThe Federalist Papers (specifically Federalist No. 84) are notable for their opposition to what later became the United States Bill of Rights. The idea of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was originally controversial because the Constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or protect the rights of the people, rather it listed the powers of the government and left all that remained to the states and the people. Alexander Hamilton, the author of Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once written down explicitly, would later be interpreted as a list of the only rights that people had[citation needed].\\r\\nHowever, Hamilton's opposition to a Bill of Rights was far from universal. Robert Yates, writing under the pseudonym Brutus, articulated this view point in the so-called Anti-Federalist No. 84, asserting that a government unrestrained by such a bill could easily devolve into tyranny. References in The Federalist and in the ratification debates warn of demagogues of the variety who through divisive appeals would aim at tyranny. The Federalist begins and ends with this issue.[32] In the final paper Hamilton offers \\"a lesson of moderation to all sincere lovers of the Union, and ought to put them on their guard against hazarding anarchy, civil war, a perpetual alienation of the States from each other, and perhaps the military despotism of a successful demagogue\\".[33] The matter was further clarified by the Ninth Amendment.\\r\\nFederal judges, when interpreting the Constitution, frequently use The Federalist Papers as a contemporary account of the intentions of the framers and ratifiers.[34] They have been applied on issues ranging from the power of the federal government in foreign affairs (in Hines v. Davidowitz) to the validity of ex post facto laws (in the 1798 decision Calder v. Bull, apparently the first decision to mention The Federalist).[35] By 2000[update], The Federalist had been quoted 291 times in Supreme Court decisions.[36]\\r\\nThe amount of deference that should be given to The Federalist Papers in constitutional interpretation has always been somewhat controversial. As early as 1819, Chief Justice John Marshall noted in the famous case McCulloch v. Maryland, that \\"the opinions expressed by the authors of that work have been justly supposed to be entitled to great respect in expounding the Constitution. No tribute can be paid to them which exceeds their merit; but in applying their opinions to the cases which may arise in the progress of our government, a right to judge of their correctness must be retained.\\"[37] In a letter to Thomas Ritchie in 1821, he stated that \\"the legitimate meaning of the Instrument must be derived from the text itself; or if a key is to be sought elsewhere, it must be not in the opinions or intentions of the Body which planned & proposed the Constitution, but in the sense attached to it by the people in their respective State Conventions where it recd. all the authority which it possesses.\\" [38][39]\\r\\nThe colors used to highlight the rows correspond to the author of the paper.","input":"What was the purpose of the federalist paper?"},{"output":"May 1990","context":"The Little Mermaid is a 1989 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Based on the Danish fairy tale of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen, The Little Mermaid tells the story of a beautiful mermaid princess who dreams of becoming human. Written, produced, and directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, with music by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (who also served as a co-producer), the film features the voices of Jodi Benson, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Pat Carroll, Samuel E. Wright, Jason Marin, Kenneth Mars, Buddy Hackett, and Ren Auberjonois.\\r\\nThe 28th Disney animated feature film, The Little Mermaid was released to theaters on November 17, 1989 to largely positive reviews, garnering $84 million at the domestic box office during its initial release,[4] and $211 million in total lifetime gross worldwide.[3] After the success of the 1988 Disney/Amblin film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Little Mermaid is given credit for breathing life back into the art of Disney animated feature films after a string of critical or commercial failures produced by Disney that dated back to the early 1970s. It also marked the start of the era known as the Disney Renaissance.[5]\\r\\nA stage adaptation of the film with a book by Doug Wright[6] and additional songs by Alan Menken and new lyricist Glenn Slater opened in Denver in July 2007 and began performances on Broadway January 10, 2008.[7][8]\\r\\nIn May 2016, Disney announced that a live-action film adaptation of The Little Mermaid is currently in the works.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAriel, a sixteen-year-old mermaid princess, is dissatisfied with underwater life in the kingdom of Atlantica, and is curious about the human world. With her best friend Flounder, Ariel collects human artifacts in her grotto, and often goes to the surface of the ocean to visit Scuttle, a seagull who offers very inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She ignores the warnings of her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, and Sebastian, a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden.\\r\\nOne night, Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian travel to the ocean surface to watch a celebration for the birthday of Prince Eric on a ship. Ariel instantly becomes enamored with Eric. A violent storm arrives, with a bolt of lightning striking the ship, engulfing it in flames and eventually destroying it, tossing Eric overboard. She rescues Eric and brings him to shore. Ariel sings to Eric, but immediately leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Fascinated by the memory of her voice, Eric vows to find who saved and sang to him, and Ariel vows to find a way to join him and his world. When Triton discovers Ariel's love for Eric, Triton confronts her in the grotto and destroys most of the artifacts with his trident. After Triton leaves, two eels named Flotsam and Jetsam convince Ariel to visit Ursula, a sea witch.\\r\\nUrsula tricks Ariel into making a deal to transform her into a human for three days in exchange for Ariel's voice, which Ursula puts in a nautilus shell. Within these three days, Ariel must receive the \\"kiss of true love\\" from Eric. If Ariel gets Eric to kiss her, she will remain a human permanently. Otherwise, she will transform back into a mermaid and be captured by Ursula. Ariel accepts, and is given human legs to emerge to the land above. Eric finds Ariel on the beach and takes her to his castle, unaware that she is the one who had rescued him earlier. Ariel spends time with Eric, and at the end of the second day, they almost kiss, but are disrupted by Flotsam and Jetsam. Furious at their narrow escape, Ursula sets a trap for Eric and Ariel: she disguises herself as a beautiful young woman named Vanessa and hypnotizes Eric with her singing voice.\\r\\nDiscovering that Vanessa is actually Ursula in disguise, Scuttle informs Ariel of Ursula's plan to marry Eric while Sebastian informs Triton about Ursula's actions. Assisted by her friends, Ariel stops Eric's wedding to Ursula, destroying the nautilus shell around Ursula's neck and restoring Ariel's voice. Realizing that Ariel is the girl who saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets, and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid before Ursula kidnaps her. Triton furiously confronts Ursula and demands Ariel's release, but the deal is inviolable. Ursula tricks Triton into taking Ariel's place as Ursula's prisoner, giving up his trident. Ariel is released as Triton is transformed into a polyp. Ursula steps forward as the new queen, but before she can use the trident, Eric intervenes with a harpoon. Ursula attempts to attack Eric, but inadvertently kills Flotsam and Jetsam in the process. Enraged, Ursula uses the trident to expand into monstrous proportions.\\r\\nAriel and Eric reunite on the surface before Ursula gains full control of the entire ocean, creating a storm and bringing sunken ships to the surface. In her attempt to murder Ariel, Ursula herself is impaled to death by one of the wrecked ships. With Ursula slain, Triton and the other polyps are restored to their original forms. Realizing that Ariel truly loves Eric, Triton willingly changes her from a mermaid into a human and approves her marriage to Eric. Ariel and Eric marry on a ship and depart.\\r\\nThe Little Mermaid was originally planned as part of one of Walt Disney's earliest feature films, a proposed package film featuring vignettes of Hans Christian Andersen tales.[11] Development started soon after Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in the late 1930s, but was delayed due to various circumstances.[12]\\r\\nIn 1985, Ron Clements became interested in a film adaptation of The Little Mermaid while he was serving as a director on The Great Mouse Detective (1986) alongside John Musker.[13] Clements discovered the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale while browsing through a bookstore.[14] Believing the story provided an \\"ideal basis\\" for an animated feature film and keen on creating a film that took place underwater,[13] Clements wrote and presented a two-page treatment of Mermaid to Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg at a \\"gong show\\" idea suggestion meeting. Katzenberg passed the project over, because at that time the studio was in development on a sequel to their live-action mermaid comedy Splash (1984) and felt The Little Mermaid would be too similar a project.[14] The next day, however, Katzenberg approved of the idea for possible development, along with Oliver & Company. While in production in the 1980s, the staff found, by chance, original story and visual development work done by Kay Nielsen for Disney's proposed 1930s Andersen feature.[11] Many of the changes made by the staff in the 1930s to Hans Christian Andersen's original story were coincidentally the same as the changes made by Disney writers in the 1980s.[14]\\r\\nThat year Clements and Musker expanded the two-page idea into a 20-page rough script, eliminating the role of the mermaid's grandmother and expanding the roles of the Merman King and the sea witch. However, the film's plans were momentarily shelved as Disney focused its attention on Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Oliver & Company as more immediate releases.[14] In 1987, songwriter Howard Ashman became involved with the writing and development of Mermaid after he was asked to contribute a song to Oliver & Company. He proposed changing the minor character Clarence, the English-butler crab, to a Jamaican crab and shifting the music style throughout the film to reflect this. At the same time, Katzenberg, Clements, Musker, and Ashman revised the story format to make Mermaid a musical with a Broadway-style story structure, with the song sequences serving as the tentpoles of the film.[11] Ashman and composer Alan Menken, both noted for their work as the writers of the successful Off-Broadway stage musical Little Shop of Horrors, teamed up to compose the entire song score. In 1988, with Oliver out of the way, Mermaid was slated as the next major Disney release.[15]\\r\\nMore money and resources were dedicated to Mermaid than any other Disney animated film in decades.[11] Aside from its main animation facility in Glendale, California, Disney opened a satellite feature animation facility during the production of Mermaid in Lake Buena Vista, Florida (near Orlando, Florida), within Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park at Walt Disney World.[16] Opening in 1989, the Disney-MGM facility's first projects were to produce an entire Roger Rabbit cartoon short, Roller Coaster Rabbit, and to contribute ink and paint support to Mermaid.[16] Another first for recent years was the filming of live actors and actresses for motion reference material for the animators, a practice used frequently for many of the Disney animated features produced under Walt Disney's supervision. Sherri Lynn Stoner, a former member of Los Angeles' Groundlings improvisation comedy group, and Joshua Finkel, a Broadway actor, performed key scenes as Ariel and Eric respectively.[14][17] Jodi Benson had already been cast as Ariel's voice actor by this time, and her recorded dialogue was used as playback to guide these live-action references.[17]\\r\\nMermaid's supervising animators included Glen Keane and Mark Henn on Ariel, Duncan Marjoribanks on Sebastian, Andreas Deja on King Triton, and Ruben Aquino on Ursula.[11] Originally, Keane had been asked to work on Ursula, as he had established a reputation for drawing large, powerful figures, such as the bear in The Fox and the Hound (1981) and Professor Ratigan in The Great Mouse Detective (1986). Keane, however, was assigned as one of the two lead artists on the petite Ariel and oversaw the \\"Part of Your World\\" musical number. He jokingly stated that his wife looks exactly like Ariel \\"without the fins.\\"[18] The character's body type and personality were based upon that of Alyssa Milano, then starring on TV's Who's the Boss? and the effect of her hair underwater was based on both footage of Sally Ride when she was in space,[11] and scenes of Stoner in a pool for guidance in animating Ariel's swimming.[19]\\r\\nThe design of the villainous Ursula was based upon drag performer Divine.[11] An additional early inspiration before Divine was Joan Collins in her role as Alexis Carrington in the television show Dynasty, due to a suggestion from Howard Ashman, who was a fan of the series.[20] Pat Carroll was not Clements and Musker's first choice to voice Ursula; the original script had been written with Bea Arthur of the Disney-owned TV series The Golden Girls in mind. After Arthur turned the part down, actresses such as Nancy Marchand, Nancy Wilson, Roseanne, Charlotte Rae, and Elaine Stritch were considered for the part.[21] Stritch was eventually cast as Ursula, but clashed with Howard Ashman's style of music production and was replaced by Carroll.[21] Various actors auditioned for additional roles in the film, including Jim Carrey for the role of Prince Eric, and comedians Bill Maher and Michael Richards for the role of Scuttle.[20]\\r\\nThe underwater setting required the most special effects animation for a Disney animated feature since Fantasia in 1940. Effects animation supervisor Mark Dindal estimated that over a million bubbles were drawn for this film, in addition to the use of other processes such as airbrushing, backlighting, superimposition, and some computer animation. The artistic manpower needed for Mermaid required Disney to farm out most of the underwater bubble effects animation in the film to Pacific Rim Productions, a China-based firm with production facilities in Beijing.[11] An attempt to use Disney's famed multiplane camera for the first time in years for quality \\"depth\\" shots failed because the machine was reputedly in dilapidated condition. The multiplane shots were instead photographed at an outside animation camera facility.[11]\\r\\nThe Little Mermaid was the last Disney feature film to use the traditional hand-painted cel method of animation. Disney's next film, The Rescuers Down Under, used a digital method of coloring and combining scanned drawings developed for Disney by Pixar called CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), which would eliminate the need for cels, the multiplane camera, and many of the optical effects used for the last time in Mermaid. A CAPS prototype was used experimentally on a few scenes in Mermaid, and one shot produced using CAPSthe penultimate shot in the film, of Ariel and Eric's wedding ship sailing away under a rainbowappears in the finished film. Computer-generated imagery was used to create some of the wrecked ships in the final battle, a staircase behind a shot of Ariel in Eric's castle, and the carriage Eric and Ariel are riding in when she bounces it over a ravine. These objects were animated using 3D wireframe models, which were plotted as line art to cels and painted traditionally.[11]\\r\\nThe Little Mermaid was considered by some as \\"the film that brought Broadway into cartoons\\".[22] Alan Menken wrote the Academy Award winning score, and collaborated with Howard Ashman on the songs. One of the film's most prominent songs, \\"Part of Your World\\", was nearly cut from the film when it seemingly tested poorly with an audience of school children, who became rowdy during the scene. This caused Jeffrey Katzenberg to feel that the song needed to be cut, an idea that was resisted by Musker, Clements, and Keane. Both Muscker and Clements cited the similar situation of the popular song \\"Over the Rainbow\\" nearly being cut from 1939's The Wizard of Oz when appealing to Katzenberg. Keane pushed for the song to remain until the film was in a more finalized state. During a second test screening, the scene, now colorized and further developed, tested well with a separate child audience, and the musical number was kept.[20]\\r\\nThe film was originally released on November 17, 1989, followed by a November 14, 1997, reissue. After the success of the 3D re-release of The Lion King, Disney announced a 3D re-release of The Little Mermaid scheduled for September 13, 2013,[23] but this was cancelled on January 14, 2013, due to the under-performances of other Disney 3D re-releases.[24] The 3D version was released on Blu-ray instead,[25][26] but it did play a limited engagement at the El Capitan Theatre from September to October 2013.[27] On September 20, 2013, The Little Mermaid began playing in select theaters where audiences could bring iPads and use an app called Second Screen Live.[28] The film was also screened out of competition at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival.[29]\\r\\nIn a then atypical and controversial move for a new Disney animated film, The Little Mermaid was released as part of the Walt Disney Classics line of VHS and Laserdisc home video releases in May 1990, six months after the release of the film.[15][30] Before Mermaid, only a select number of Disney's catalog animated films had been released to home video, as the company was afraid of upsetting its profitable practice of theatrically reissuing each film every seven years.[15] Mermaid became that year's top-selling title on home video, with over 10 million units sold (including 7 million in its first month).[31] This success led future Disney films to be released soon after the end of their theatrical runs, rather than delayed for several years.[15]\\r\\nFollowing Mermaid's 1997 re-release in theaters, a new VHS version was released in March 1998 as part of the Masterpiece Collection and included a bonus music video of Jodi Benson singing \\"Part of Your World\\" during the end credits, replacing \\"Under the Sea\\" as the end credit song.[32] The VHS sold 13 million units and ranked as the third best-selling video of the year.[33][34]\\r\\nThe Little Mermaid was released in a Limited Issue \\"bare-bones\\" DVD in 1999, with a standard video transfer.[35] The film was re-released on DVD on October 3, 2006, as part of the Walt Disney Platinum Editions line of classic Walt Disney animated features, including the song \\"Kiss the Girl\\" performed by Ashley Tisdale.[36] Deleted scenes and several in-depth documentaries were included, as well as an Academy Award-nominated short film intended for the shelved Fantasia 2006, The Little Match Girl.[37] The DVD sold 1.6 million units on its first day of release,[38] and over 4 million units during its first week, making it the biggest animated DVD debut for October. By year's end, the DVD had sold about 7 million units and was one of the year's top ten selling DVDs.[39] The Platinum Edition DVD was released as part of a \\"Little Mermaid Trilogy\\" boxed set on December 16, 2008.[40] The Platinum Edition of the film, along with its sequels, went on moratorium in January 2009. The film was re-released on 3-disc Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy Combo, a 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD combo and 3D Blu-ray on October 1, 2013, as part of the Walt Disney Diamond Editions line.[25][41]\\r\\nIn June 2016, Disney held special presentations of the film at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, entitled The Little Mermaid in Concert. The performances combined a screening of The Little Mermaid with live accompaniment by guest musicians, including Sara Bareilles (who performed as Ariel), Tituss Burgess, Darren Criss, Rebel Wilson and Norm Lewis (who performed as King Triton as a reprisal of his role in the stage adaptation). The four additional songs written for the stage adaptation were also incorporated into the presentation, accompanied by scenes of the film's original concept art. During the third and final performance, Jodi Benson joined the cast in lieu of Bareilles to reprise her original role as Ariel. The final performance also featured special appearances by Brad Kane (the singing voice of the title character of Aladdin) and Susan Egan (who played Belle in the stage adaptation of Beauty and the Beast), who sang songs from their respective films, and a duet of A Whole New World.[42][43]\\r\\nOn May 16, 2017, ABC announced that it planned to air a special broadcast of the film, The Wonderful World of Disney: The Little Mermaid Live, on October 3, 2017. The special was to feature a presentation of the film intertwined with live performances of its songs by guest musicians, in a similar fashion to the Hollywood Bowl concerts.[44] However, on August 3, 2017, it was announced that the special was postponed due to budget constraints.[45]\\r\\nEarly in the production of The Little Mermaid, Jeffrey Katzenberg cautioned Clements, Musker, and their staff, reminding them that since Mermaid was a \\"girl's film\\", it would make less money at the box office than Oliver & Company, which had been Disney's biggest animated box office success in a decade.[14][15] However, by the time the film was closer to completion, Katzenberg was convinced Mermaid would be a hit and the first animated feature to earn more than $100 million and become a \\"blockbuster\\" film.[14][15]\\r\\nDuring its original 1989 theatrical release, Mermaid earned $84.4 million at the North American box office,[3] falling just short of Katzenberg's expectations but earning 64% more than Oliver.[15] The film was theatrically reissued on November 14, 1997, on the same day as Anastasia, a Don Bluth animated feature for Fox Animation Studios. The reissue brought $27.2 million in additional gross. The film also drew $99.8 million in box office earnings outside the United States and Canada between both releases, resulting in a total international box office figure of $211 million.[3]\\r\\nThe Little Mermaid received largely positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film has a 93% \\"Certified Fresh\\" score based on 67 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The site's consensus reads \\"The Little Mermaid ushered in a new golden era for Disney animation with warm and charming hand-drawn characters and catchy musical sequences\\".[46] Roger Ebert, film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, was enthusiastic about the film and wrote that, \\"The Little Mermaid is a jolly and inventive animated fantasya movie that's so creative and so much fun it deserves comparison with the best Disney work of the past.\\" Ebert also commented positively on the character of Ariel, stating, \\"... Ariel is a fully realized female character who thinks and acts independently, even rebelliously, instead of hanging around passively while the fates decide her destiny.\\"[47] The staff of TV Guide wrote a positive review, praising the film's return to the traditional Disney musical as well as the film's animation. Yet they also wrote that the film is detracted by the juvenile humor and the human characters' eyes. While still giving a positive review, they stated that the film \\"can't compare to the real Disney classics (which appealed equally to both kids and adults).\\"[48] The staff of Variety praised the film for its cast of characters, Ursula in particular, as well as its animation, stating that the animation \\"proves lush and fluid, augmented by the use of shadow and light as elements like fire, sun and water illuminate the characters.\\" They also praised the musical collaboration between Howard Ashman and Alan Menken \\"whose songs frequently begin slowly but build in cleverness and intensity.\\"[49]\\r\\nTodd Gilchrist of IGN wrote a positive review of the film, stating that the film is \\"an almost perfect achievement.\\" Gilchrist also praised how the film revived interest in animation as it was released at a time when interest in animation was at a lull.[50] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote a mixed review of the film, referring to it as a \\"likably unspectacular adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen classic.\\" Hinson went on to write that the film is average even at its highest points. He wrote that while there is nothing wrong with the film, it would be difficult for children to identify with Ariel and that the characters seemed bland. Hinson concluded his review saying that the film is \\"accomplished but uninspiring, The Little Mermaid has enough to please any kid. All that's missing is the magic.\\"[51] Empire gave a positive review of the film, stating that \\"[The Little Mermaid is] a charmer of a movie, boasting all the ingredients that make a Disney experience something to treasure yet free of all the politically correct, formulaic elements that have bogged down the more recent productions.\\"[52]\\r\\nIn April 2008 ÿ almost 20 years after the film's initial release in 1989 ÿ Yahoo! users voted \\"The Little Mermaid\\" as No. 14 on the top 30 animated films of all time. Later, when Yahoo! updated the list in June of the same year, the film remained on the list but dropped six slots to end at #20. (Only three other traditionally animated Disney animated films - Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King, respectively - scored above it in the poll even after the update.)[53] In 2011, Richard Corliss of TIME Magazine named it one of \\"The 25 All-TIME Best Animated Films\\".[54]\\r\\nThe Little Mermaid, Disney's first animated fairy tale since Sleeping Beauty (1959),[14] is an important film in animation history for many reasons. Chief among these are its re-establishment of animation as a profitable venture for The Walt Disney Company, as the company's theme parks, television productions, and live-action features had overshadowed the animated output since the 1950s.[15] Mermaid was the second film, following Oliver & Company, produced after Disney began expanding its animated output following its successful live action/animated film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and became Disney's first animated major box office and critical hit since The Rescuers in 1977.[15] Walt Disney Feature Animation was further expanded as a result of Mermaid and increasingly successful follow-ups  Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), and The Lion King (1994). The staff increased from 300 members in 1988 to 2,200 in 1999 spread across three studios in Burbank, California, Lake Buena Vista, Florida, and Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France.[16]\\r\\nIn addition, Mermaid signaled the re-establishment of the musical film format as a standard for Disney animated films. The majority of Disney's most popular animated films from the 1930s on had been musicals, though by the 1970s and 1980s the role of music had been de-emphasized in the films.[14] 1988's Oliver & Company had served as a test of sorts to the success of the musical format before Disney committed to the Broadway-style structure of The Little Mermaid.[14]\\r\\nIn January 1990, The Little Mermaid earned three Academy Award nominations, making it the first Disney animated film to earn an Academy Award nomination since The Rescuers in 1977. The film won two of the awards, for Best Song (\\"Under the Sea\\") and Best Score. The film also earned four Golden Globe nominations, including Best PictureComedy or Musical, and won the awards for Best Song (\\"Under the Sea\\") and Best Score.[55]\\r\\nIn addition to the box office and critical success of the film itself, the Mermaid soundtrack album earned two awards at the 33rd Grammy Awards in 1991: the Grammy Award for Best Album for Children and the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.[56] Bolstered by the film's success and the soundtrack's Oscars, Golden Globes and Grammy Awards, was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in September 1990 for shipments of two million copies of the soundtrack album, an unheard of feat for an animated film at the time.[57] To date, the soundtrack has been certified six times platinum.[57]\\r\\nThe Little Mermaid won two Academy Awards for Best Original Score as well as Best Song for Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's \\"Under the Sea\\", sung by Samuel E. Wright in a memorable scene.[58] Another song from the film, \\"Kiss the Girl\\", was nominated but lost to \\"Under the Sea\\".[58] The film also won two Golden Globes for Best Original Score as well Best Original Song for \\"Under the Sea\\". It was also nominated in two other categories, Best Motion Picture and another Best Original Song. Menken and Ashman also won a Grammy Award in 1991 for \\"Under the Sea.\\"[59]\\r\\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\\r\\nControversy arose regarding the artwork for the cover for the Classics VHS cassette when the film was first released on video when close examination of the artwork revealed an oddly shaped structure on the castle, closely resembling a human penis.[65][66] Disney and the cover designer insist it was an accident, resulting from a late night rush job to finish the cover artwork. The questionable object does not appear on the cover of the second releasing of the movie.[65] A second allegation is that a clergyman is seen with an erection during a scene late in the film.[67][68][69] The clergyman is a short man, dressed in Bishop's clothing, and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in a few of the frames that are actually later shown to be the stubby-legged man's knees, but the image is small and is very difficult to distinguish. The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file suit against The Walt Disney Company in 1995, though she dropped the suit two months later.[68][69][70][71][72]\\r\\nIn May 2016, Deadline Hollywood reported that Disney is in early development for a live-action version of the film.[73] Three months later, it was announced that Alan Menken would return as the film's composer and write new songs alongside Lin-Manuel Miranda, who will also co-produce the movie with Marc Platt.[74] Studio veteran Lindsay Lohan has expressed interest in starring in the adaption.[75][76]","input":"When was the little mermaid released on vhs?"},{"output":"1 January 1999","context":"The euro came into existence on 1 January 1999, although it had been a goal of the European Union (EU) and its predecessors since the 1960s. After tough negotiations, particularly due to opposition from the United Kingdom, the Maastricht Treaty entered into force in 1993 with the goal of creating an economic and monetary union by 1999 for all EU states except the UK and Denmark (even though Denmark has a fixed exchange rate policy with the euro).\\r\\nIn 1999 the currency was born virtually and in 2002 notes and coins began to circulate. It rapidly took over from the former national currencies and slowly expanded behind the rest of the EU. In 2009 the Lisbon Treaty finalised its political authority, the Eurogroup, alongside the European Central Bank.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst ideas of an economic and monetary union in Europe were raised well before establishing the European Communities. For example, already in the League of Nations, Gustav Stresemann asked in 1929 for a European currency[1] against the background of an increased economic division due to a number of new nation states in Europe after World War I. At this time memories of the Latin Monetary Union[2] involving principally France, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland and which, for practical purposes, had disintegrated following the First World War, figured prominently in the minds of policy makers.\\r\\nA first attempt to create an economic and monetary union between the members of the European Economic Community goes back to an initiative by the European Commission in 1969, which set out the need for \\"greater co-ordination of economic policies and monetary cooperation.\\"[3] This was followed up at a meeting of the European Council at The Hague in December 1969. The European Council tasked Pierre Werner, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, with finding a way to reduce currency exchange rate volatility. His report was published in October 1970 and recommended centralisation of the national macroeconomic policies entailing \\"the total and irreversible fixing of parity rates and the complete liberation of movements of capital.\\" But he did not propose a single currency or central bank.[4] An attempt to limit the fluctuations of European currencies, using a snake in the tunnel, failed.\\r\\nIn 1971, US President Richard Nixon removed the gold backing from the US dollar, causing a collapse in the Bretton Woods system that managed to affect all of the world's major currencies. The widespread currency floats and devaluations set back aspirations for European monetary union.[4] However, in March 1979 the European Monetary System (EMS) was created, fixing exchange rates onto the European Currency Unit (ECU), an accounting currency, to stabilise exchange rates and counter inflation. It also created the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (EMCF).[4]\\r\\nIn February 1986 the Single European Act formalised political co-operation within the Community including competency in monetary policy.[4] European Council summit in Hannover on 14 June 1988 began to outline monetary co-operation. France, Italy and European Commission backed a fully monetary union with a central bank, which British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher opposed.[5][6]\\r\\nThe Hannover European Council asked Commission President Jacques Delors to chair an ad hoc committee of central bank governors to propose a new timetable with clear, practical and realistic steps for creating an economic and monetary union.[7] This way of working was derived from the Spaak method.\\r\\nFrance and the UK were opposed to German reunification, and attempted to influence the Soviet Union to stop it.[8] However, in late 1989 France extracted German commitment to the Monetary Union in return for support for German reunification.[9]\\r\\nThe Delors report[10] of 1989 set out a plan to introduce the EMU in three stages and it included the creation of institutions such as the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), which would become responsible for formulating and implementing monetary policy. It laid out monetary union being accomplished in three steps. Beginning the first of these steps, on 1 July 1990, exchange controls were abolished, thus capital movements were completely liberalised in the European Economic Community. Leaders reached agreement on currency union with the Maastricht Treaty, signed on 7 February 1992. It agreed to create a single currency, although without the participation of the United Kingdom, by January 1999.[4]\\r\\nGaining approval for the treaty was a challenge. Germany was cautious about giving up its stable currency, i.e., the German Mark,[11] France approved the treaty by a narrow margin[12] and Denmark refused to ratify until they got an opt out from monetary union as the United Kingdom, an opt-out which they maintain as of 2011.[13] On 16 September 1992, known in the UK as Black Wednesday, the British pound sterling was forced to withdraw from the fixed exchange rate system due to a rapid fall in the value of the pound.[14]\\r\\nDelors' second stage began in 1994 with creation of the European Monetary Institute, succeeding the EMCF, under Maastricht. It was created as the forerunner to the European Central Bank. It met for the first time on 12 January under its first president, Alexandre Lamfalussy.[4] After much disagreement, in December 1995 the name euro was adopted for the new currency (replacing the name Ecu used for the previous accounting currency),[4] on the suggestion of then-German finance minister Theo Waigel. They also agreed on the date 1 January 1999 for its launch.[4]\\r\\nOn 17 June 1997 the European Council decided in Amsterdam to adopt the Stability and Growth Pact, designed to ensure budgetary discipline after creation of the euro, and a new exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) was set up to provide stability above the euro and the national currencies of countries that hadn't yet entered the eurozone. Then, on 3 May 1998, at the European Council in Brussels, the 11 initial countries that would participate in the third stage from 1 January 1999 were selected. To participate in the new currency, member states had to meet strict criteria such as a budget deficit of less than 3% of their GDP, a debt ratio of less than 60% of GDP, low inflation, and interest rates close to the EU average. Greece failed to meet the criteria and was excluded from participating on 1 January 1999.\\r\\nOn 1 June 1998 the European Central Bank succeeded the European Monetary Institute. However it wouldn't take on its full powers until the euro was created on 1 January 1999. The bank's first President was Wim Duisenberg, former head of the EMI and the Dutch central bank.[4] The conversion rates between the 11 participating national currencies and the euro were then established. The rates were determined by the Council of the European Union, based on a recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998, so that one ECU would equal one euro. These rates were set by Council Regulation 2866/98 (EC), of 31 December 1998. They could not be set earlier, because the ECU depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally the pound sterling) that day. Due to differences in national conventions for rounding and significant digits, all conversion between the national currencies had to be carried out using the process of triangulation via the euro.\\r\\nThe currency was introduced in non-physical form (traveller's cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently in that their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other, effectively making them mere non-decimal subdivisions of the euro. The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued to be used as legal tender until new notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002 (having been distributed in small amounts in the previous December). Beginning on 1 January 1999, all bonds and other forms of government debt by eurozone nations were denominated in euros.\\r\\nThe value of the euro, which started at USD 1.1686 on 31 December 1998, rose during its first day of trading, Monday, 4 January 1999, closing at approximately USD 1.18.[15] It was rapidly taken up and dealers were surprised by the speed at which it replaced the national currencies. Trading in the Deutsche Mark was expected to continue in parallel but vanished as soon as the markets opened.[16] However, by the end of 1999 the euro had dropped to parity with the dollar[4] leading to emergency action from the G7 to support the euro in 2001.[17]\\r\\nLater in 2000, Denmark held a referendum on whether to abandon their opt-out from the euro. The referendum resulted in a decision to retain the krone, and also set back plans for a referendum in the UK as a result.[18] The procedure used to fix the irrevocable conversion rate of 340.750 between the Greek drachma and the euro was different, since the euro by then was already two years old. While the conversion rates for the initial eleven currencies were determined only hours before the euro was introduced as a virtual currency, the conversion rate for the Greek drachma was fixed several months beforehand, in Council Regulation 1478/2000 (EC),[19] of 19 June 2000.\\r\\nThe designs for the new coins and notes were announced between 1996 and 1998, and production began at the various mints and printers on 11 May 1998.[20] The task was large, and would require the full three years and a half. In all, 7.4 billion notes and 38.2 billion coins would be available for issuance to consumers and businesses on 1 January 2002.[21] In 7 nations, the new coins, struck in the run-up to 1 January 2002, would bear a 2002 date. In Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, the new coins would bear the date of striking, so those 5 countries would be the only ones to strike euro coins dated 1999, 2000, and 2001. Small numbers of coins from Monaco, Vatican City, and San Marino were also struck. These immediately became popular collector's items, commanding premiums well above face value. New issues continue to do so to this day.\\r\\nMeanwhile, a parallel task was to educate the European public about the new coins. Posters were issued showing the designs, which were used on items ranging from playing cards to T-shirts. As a final step, on 15 December 2001, banks began exchanging \\"euro starter kits\\", plastic pouches with a selection of the new coins in each country (generally, between 10 and 20 euros worththough Finland's contained one of each coin, totalling ?3.88). They would not be usable in commerce until 1 January, when notes would be made available as well. Larger starter kits, containing a roll of each denomination, were available as well in some nations.\\r\\nRetailers and government agencies had a considerable task as well. For items to be sold to the public, dual pricing was commonly utilised. Postage stamps for governments (as well as stamps issued by the United Nations Postal Administration for the UN offices in Vienna) often bore denominations both in the legacy currency and euros, assuring continued utility beyond 2001. Banks bore a huge task, not only in preparation for the change of the notes and coins, but also in the back office. Beginning in 1999, all deposits and loans were technically in euros, but deposits and withdrawals continued in the legacy currency. Statements would bear balances in both currencies beginning no later than 1 July 2001, and earlier if required by the customer's needs.\\r\\nBeginning on 1 December 2001, coins and notes were distributed from secure storage, first to large retailers, and then to smaller ones. It was widely expected that there would be massive problems on and after 1 January. Such a changeover, across twelve populous countries, had never been attempted before.\\r\\nThe new coins and notes were first valid on the French island of Runion in the Indian Ocean.[22] The first official purchase using euro coins and notes took place there, for one kilogram of lychees.[23] The coming of midnight in Frankfurt at the ECB offices, though, symbolised the transition.\\r\\nIn Finland, the Central Bank had opened for an hour at midnight to allow citizens to exchange currency, while a huge euro pyramid had decorated Syntagma Square in Athens. Other countries noted the coming of the euro as wellParis's Pont Neuf was decorated in EU colours, while in the northern German town of Gifhorn a sombre, symbolic funeral for the Deutsche Mark took place.\\r\\nExcept for Germany, the plan for introduction of the new currency was basically the same. Banks would accept the exchange of legacy currencies, begin to dispense euros from ATMs, and only euros would be available as withdrawals were made, beginning on 1 January. Merchants would accept legacy currency, but give change only in euros. In Germany, the Deutsche Mark would no longer be a legal tender on 1 January, but would have to be exchanged at the banks.\\r\\nDespite the massive amounts of euros available, chaos was feared. In France, these fears were accentuated by a threatened postal workers' strike.[24] The strike, however, was settled. Similarly, workers at the French bank BNP Paribas threatened to disrupt the introduction of euro currency with a strike. That was also settled.[25]\\r\\nIn practice, the roll-out was smooth, with few problems. By 2 January, all ATMs in 7 countries and at least 90 percent in 4 others were issuing euros rather than legacy currency, with Italy, the worst offender, having only 85% of ATMs dispensing euros.[27] The unexpected tendency of consumers to spend their legacy currency, rather than exchange it at banks, led to temporary shortages of euro small change, with some consumers being given change in legacy currency.[28]\\r\\nSome businesses did take advantage of the currency exchange to raise prices. According to a study by the Deutsche Bundesbank, there was a price rise, but consumers refused to buy as much. A coffee bar in Italy that took advantage of the transition to raise coffee prices by a third was ordered to pay compensation to customers.[29]\\r\\nNations were allowed to keep legacy currency in circulation as legal tender for two months, until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany; the Mark officially ceased to be legal tender after 31 December 2001. Most member states, though, permitted their legacy currency to remain in circulation the full two months. The legacy currency was exchangeable at commercial banks in the currency's nation for a further period, generally until 30 June 2002.\\r\\nHowever, even after the official dates, they continued to be accepted for exchange by national central banks for varying periodsand indefinitely in Austria, Germany, Ireland, and Spain. Coins from those four countries, Italy, and Finland remain exchangeable. The earliest coins to become non-convertible were the Portuguese escudos, which ceased to have monetary value after 31 December 2002, although banknotes remain exchangeable until 2022. All banknotes current on 1 January 2002 would remain valid until at least 2012.[30]\\r\\nIn Germany, Deutsche Telekom modified 50,000 pay phones to take Deutsche Mark coins in 2005, at least on a temporary basis.[31] Callers were allowed to use DM coins, at least initially, with the Mark pegged to equal one euro, almost twice the usual rate.[32]\\r\\nIn France, receipts still indicate the value of products in the legacy currency along with the euro value, as do receipts in Slovenia. In other eurozone countries this has long been considered unnecessary. In June 2008, The New York Times reported that many merchants in the French town of Collobrires, in Provence, choose to accept exchangeable franc notes.[33]\\r\\nAfter dropping to an interday low of $0.8296 on 26 October 2001, and a brief crash to $0.8115 on 15 January 2002, the euro soon recovered from its early slump. Its value last closed below $1.00 on 6 November 2002 ($0.9971), and increased rapidly from there. It peaked at $1.35 in 2004, and reached its highest value versus the U.S. dollar at $1.5916 on 14 July 2008.[34] As its values increased against the pound sterling in the late-2000s, peaking at 97.73p on 31 December 2008, its international usage grew rapidly.[35] The euro grew in importance steadily, with its share of foreign exchange reserves rising from nearly 18% in 1999 to 25% in 2003 - while the dollar share fell by an equivalent margin.[36] Alan Greenspan in 2007 said the eurozone had profited from the euro's rise and claimed it was perfectly conceivable that it could trade equally or become more important than the US dollar in the future.[37]\\r\\nPublic support for the euro in each state between 2001 to 2006[38]\\r\\nAs a result of the global financial crisis that began in 2007/2008, the eurozone entered its first official recession in the third quarter of 2008, official figures confirmed in January 2009.[39] The EU was in negative growth for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 before returning to positive growth (for the eurozone as a whole).[40] Despite the recession, Estonia acceded to the eurozone and Iceland put in an EU application to join the euro, seeing it at the time as a safe haven.\\r\\nIn 2009, the Lisbon Treaty formalised the Eurogroup, the meeting of euro finance ministers, with an official president. Jean-Claude Juncker served as president before and after formalisation and has been an advocate of strengthening the group, economic co-operation and common representation. Appetite for stronger economic co-operation grew due to the recession and the potential failure of some weaker eurozone members.[41] However Germany had opposed previous moves to strengthen the Eurogroup, such as French President Nicolas Sarkozy's attempts at Eurogroup summits, due to fears of undermining the ECB's independence. Jean-Claude Trichet, who succeeded Duisenberg as ECB president in 2003, fended off numerous attacks from Sarkozy at the start of the recession. Before that formalisation of the Eurogroup, eurozone leaders held an extraordinary summit in reaction to the financial crisis on 11 October 2008 in Paris. Rather than the Eurogroup meeting as finance ministers, they met as head of states or government (similar to the European Council) to define a joint action plan for the eurozone and the European Central Bank to stabilise the European economy. These such meetings would be where many euro governance reforms would be agreed.\\r\\nThe leaders hammered out a plan to confront the financial crisis which will involve hundreds of billions of euros of new initiatives to head off a feared meltdown. They agreed a bank rescue plan: governments would buy into banks to boost their finances and guarantee interbank lending. Coordination against the crisis is considered vital to prevent the actions of one country harming another and exacerbating the bank solvency and credit shortage problems.[citation needed]\\r\\nDespite initial fears by speculators in early 2009 that the stress of such a large recession could lead to the break-up of the eurozone, the euro's position actually strengthened as the year progressed. Far from the poorer performing economies moving further away and becoming a default risk, bond yield spreads between Germany and the weakest economies decreased easing the strain on these economies. Much of the credit for the turn around in fortunes has been attributed to the ECB, which injected ?500bn into the banks in June.[42] Indeed, the euro came to be seen as a safe haven, as countries outside it such as Iceland fared worse than those with the euro. Iceland subsequently applied to the EU to get the benefit of using a larger currency with the support of the ECB.[43]\\r\\nHowever, with the risk of a default in Greece and other members in late 2009ÿ10, eurozone leaders agreed to agree provisions for bailing out member states who could not raise funds (triggered for Greece in April 2010).[44][45] This was a u-turn on the EU treaties which rule out any bail out of a euro member to encourage them to manage their finances better. Yet with Greece struggling to restore its finances, other member states also at risk and the repercussions this would have on the rest of the eurozone economy; a temporary bail out mechanism was agreed and devised in the form of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) named \\"European Financial Stability Facility\\" (complemented by the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism and funds form the International Monetary Fund), aiming at preserving financial stability in Europe by providing financial assistance to eurozone states in difficulty. The crisis also spurred consensus for further economic integration and a range of proposals such as a \\"European Monetary Fund\\" or federal treasury.[46][47][48]\\r\\nHowever, in June 2010, broad agreement was finally reached on a controversial proposal for member states to peer review each other's budgets prior to their presentation to national parliaments. Although showing the entire budget to each other was opposed by Germany, Sweden and the UK, each government would present to their peers and the Commission their estimates for growth, inflation, revenue and expenditure levels six months before they go to national parliaments. If a country was to run a deficit, they would have to justify it to the rest of the EU while countries with a debt more than 60% of GDP would face greater scrutiny.[49] The plans would apply to all EU members, not just the eurozone, and have to be approved by EU leaders along with proposals for states to face sanctions before they reach the 3% limit in the Stability and Growth Pact. Poland has criticised the idea of withholding regional funding for those who break the deficit limits, as that would only impact the poorer states.[49] In June 2010 France agreed to back Germany's plan for suspending the voting rights of members who breach the rules.[50]\\r\\nIn late 2010/early 2011 it was agreed to replace the European Financial Stability Facility and European Financial Stability Mechanism with a larger and permanent European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The ESM required a treaty amendment to allow it and a separate treaty to establish it but, if ratified successfully, would be established in time to take over when the old facilities expire in 2013. Meanwhile, to support Italy and prevent it having to ask for a bail-out later, the ECB controversially started buying Italian bonds, as it had done with Greece.\\r\\nIn March 2011 was initiated a new reform of the Stability and Growth Pact aiming at straightening the rules by adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the deficit or the debt rules.[51][52] The Euro Plus Pact sets out a wide range of reforms to take place in the eurozone to ensure and the French and German governments further agreed to push for a 'true economic government' that would involve twice-yearly eurozone leader summits and a financial transactions tax.[53]\\r\\nThe European Fiscal Union is a proposal for a treaty about fiscal integration described in a decision adopted on 9 December 2011 by the European Council. The participants are the eurozone member states and all other EU members without the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic. The treaty entered into force on 1 January 2013 for the 16 states which completed ratification prior of this date[54] and on 1 April 2014 entered into force for all 25 signatories.\\r\\nDespite speculation that the crisis in Greece could spread and that the euro might fail, some newer EU states from the 2004 enlargement joined the currency during the recession. Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus all acceded within the first two years of the recession, closely followed by Slovakia in 2009. The three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania joined in 2011, 2014 and 2015 respectively.\\r\\nSlovenia was the first country to join the eurozone after the launch of the coins and banknotes. Participation in ERM II began on 28 June 2004[55] and on 11 July 2006 the Council of EU adopted a decision allowing Slovenia to join the euro area as from 1 January 2007.[56] The euro replaced the Slovenian tolar on 1 January 2007. The exchange rate between the euro and tolar had been set on 11 July 2006 at 239.640?SIT, but unlike the previous launches, cash and non-cash transactions were introduced simultaneously.\\r\\nCyprus replaced the Cypriot pound with the euro on 1 January 2008.[57]\\r\\nA formal letter of application to join the eurozone was submitted on 13 February 2007.[58] On 16 May 2007 the European Commission, backed by the European Central Bank, gave its go-ahead for the introduction in January 2008.[59][60]\\r\\nThe campaign to inform the citizens of Cyprus about the euro officially began in Cypriot media on 9 March 2007. On 15 March 2007, the Cypriot House of Representatives passed the necessary laws for the introduction of the euro on 1 January 2008. The European Commissioner for Economic & Financial Affairs Joaqun Almunia, on 16 May 2007, recommended that Cyprus adopt the euro as scheduled and the European Parliament concurred on 21 June 2007, the date was confirmed by the EU leaders. The final decision was taken by the EU finance ministers (Ecofin) on 10 July 2007 and the conversion rate was fixed at 0.585274 CYP.[61] On 23 October 2007, the coin designs were officially published in the Official Journal of the European Union.[62]\\r\\nOn 1 January 2008 the euro replaced the Cypriot pound as the official currency.[63] The euro is only used in the government-controlled areas of the Republic, the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (under UK jurisdiction, outside the EU) and in the United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus.[64] The de facto Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus continues to use the new Turkish lira as its primary currency and the euro as its secondary currency.[65]\\r\\nMalta replaced the Maltese lira with the euro on 1 January 2008.[57] The aims were officially confirmed on 26 February 2007.[66] On 16 May 2007, the Commissioner for Economic & Financial Affairs of the EU, Joaqun Almunia, recommended that Malta adopt the euro as scheduled, a decision later confirmed by the Council of Finance Ministers of 10 July 2007. On the same day, dual displaying became mandatory and the first Maltese euro coins were struck at Monnaie de Paris. The first Maltese euro coins were available for the public on 1 December 2007, as business starter packs worth ?131 each started being available for small businesses to fill up their cash registers with sufficient amount of euro coins before the ?-day (Jum ?). Mini-kits each worth ?11.65 were available for the general public on 10 December 2007.[67] Maltese coins which were current at the time of the euro transition may be exchanged through 1 February 2010.[30]\\r\\nMaltese citizens could obtain euro information directly from their town or village between December 2007 and January 2008. From the Euro Centres (?entru l-ewro) which opened during the day. People trained specifically on matters related to the changeover to the euro were available to provide council at euro centres along with information materials.[68]\\r\\nIn December 2007, as part of the euro changeover celebrations, streets of Valletta were covered with carpets depicting euro coins. Celebrations reached climax on New Year's Eve with a firework display near the Grand Harbour area, several other activities had to be moved indoors because of the stormy weather that struck the island on that night.\\r\\nSlovakia adopted the euro on 1 January 2009. The koruna was part of ERM II from 28 November 2005, requiring that it trade within 15% of an agreed central rate; this rate was changed on 17 March 2007 and again on 28 May 2008. The rate of 30.126?SKK from May 2008 was finally confirmed on 8 July 2008.[69]\\r\\nTo assist the process of conversion to the euro, on 1 April 2008, the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) announced their plan for withdrawal of the Slovak koruna notes and coins.[70] A few days later, on 5 April 2008, Slovakia officially applied to enter the eurozone.[71] On 7 May 2008, the European Commission approved the application and asked member states to endorse the bid during the EU finance ministers' meeting in July 2008.[72][73][74]\\r\\nSlovakia fulfilled the euro convergence criteria. At 2.2%, Slovakia's twelve-month inflation was well below the 3.2% threshold. However, for March 2008 annual inflation was 3.6%. Fiscal deficit was 2.2% versus the reference value of 3.0%. And finally, the government debt ratio was 29.4% of GDP in 2007, well below the maximum ratio of 60.0%.[75] Public opinion supported the switch, with 58% in favour and 35% opposed, but 65% worried about the inflationary impacts of the adoption.[76] Three months after the adoption of the currency 83 percent of Slovaks consider Slovakia's decision to adopt the euro to have been right.[77]\\r\\nPublicity for the transition from the koruna to the euro on 1 January 2009 included an \\"euromobile\\", with a professional actor driving around the countryside holding impromptu quiz shows about the euro. Winners received euro T-shirts, euro conversion calculators, and chocolate euro coins.[78] Euro starter kits, available for 500 koruna, were a popular Christmas gift in 2008. The coins therein, however, were not valid as legal tender in the eurozone until 1 January 2009, with koruna exchanged through 17 January 2009, though redeemable at the central bank in Bratislava until a date to be determined. Anyone using Slovakian euro coins before 1 January could have been fined. Businesses using the transition to raise prices also were subject to penalty.[78]\\r\\nIn 2010 Estonia gained the support of the European Commission, Central Bank and Parliament for accession on 1 January 2011 with Estonia adopting the currency on that date.[79][80] In 2013 Latvia gained the support of the European Commission, Central Bank and Parliament for accession on 1 January 2014 with Latvia adopting the currency on that date.[81][82] On 23 July 2014 Lithuania became the last Baltic state to gain permission to join the euro, which was adopted on 1 January 2015.[83]\\r\\nThe chart below provides a full summary of all applying exchange-rate regimes for EU members, since the European Monetary System with its Exchange Rate Mechanism and the related new common currency ECU was born on 13 March 1979. The euro replaced the ECU 1:1 at the exchange rate markets, on 1 January 1999. During 1979-1999, the D-Mark functioned as a de facto anchor for the ECU, meaning there was only a minor difference between pegging a currency against ECU and pegging it against the D-mark.\\r\\nSources: EC convergence reports 1996-2014, Italian lira[dead link], Spanish peseta, Portuguese escudo, Finish markka, Greek drachma, UK pound\\r\\nThe eurozone was born with its first 11 Member States on 1 January 1999. The first enlargement of the eurozone, to Greece, took place on 1 January 2001, one year before the euro had physically entered into circulation. The next enlargements were to states which joined the EU in 2004, and then joined the eurozone on 1 January in the mentioned year: Slovenia (2007), Cyprus (2008), Malta (2008), Slovakia (2009), Estonia (2011), Latvia (2014), and Lithuania (2015).\\r\\nAll new EU members having joined the bloc after the signing of the Maastricht treaty in 1992, are obliged to adopt the euro under the terms of their accession treaties. However, the last of the five economic convergence criteria which needs first to be complied with in order to qualify for euro adoption, is the exchange rate stability criterion, which requires having been an ERM-member for a minimum of two years without the presence of \\"severe tensions\\" for the currency exchange rate.\\r\\nIn September 2011, a diplomatic source close to the euro adoption preparation talks between the seven remaining new Member States from Eastern Europe who had yet to adopt the euro (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania), claimed that the monetary union (eurozone) they had thought they were going to join upon their signing of the accession treaty may very well end up being a very different union entailing much closer fiscal, economic and political convergence. This changed legal status of the eurozone could potentially cause them to conclude that the conditions for their promise to join were no longer valid, which \\"could force them to stage new referendums\\" on euro adoption.[84]\\r\\nThe following lists the percentage of respondents supporting the euro in each country, according to the Standard Eurobarometer. The date reflects the month the field work was conducted in.[38]","input":"When was the euro introduced as legal currency?"},{"output":"South Bay","context":"","input":"What part of the bay area is san jose?"},{"output":"Great Britain","context":"The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles.[7] Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159?km2,[5] and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: the Republic of Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island of Ireland)[8] and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago.[9][10]\\r\\nThe oldest rocks in the group are in the north west of Scotland, Ireland and North Wales and are 2,700 million years old.[11] During the Silurian period the north-western regions collided with the south-east, which had been part of a separate continental landmass. The topography of the islands is modest in scale by global standards. Ben Nevis rises to an elevation of only 1,344 metres (4,409?ft), and Lough Neagh, which is notably larger than other lakes on the isles, covers 390 square kilometres (151?sq?mi). The climate is temperate marine, with mild winters and warm summers. The North Atlantic Drift brings significant moisture and raises temperatures 11?C (20?F) above the global average for the latitude. This led to a landscape which was long dominated by temperate rainforest, although human activity has since cleared the vast majority of forest cover. The region was re-inhabited after the last glacial period of Quaternary glaciation, by 12,000 BC, when Great Britain was still part of a peninsula of the European continent. Ireland, which became an island by 12,000 BC, was not inhabited until after 8000 BC.[12] Great Britain became an island by 5600 BC.\\r\\nHiberni (Ireland), Pictish (northern Britain) and Britons (southern Britain) tribes, all speaking Insular Celtic,[13] inhabited the islands at the beginning of the 1st millennium AD. Much of Brittonic-controlled Britain was conquered by the Roman Empire from AD 43. The first Anglo-Saxons arrived as Roman power waned in the 5th century and eventually dominated the bulk of what is now England.[14] Viking invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements and political changeparticularly in England. The subsequent Norman conquest of England in 1066 and the later Angevin partial conquest of Ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new Norman ruling elite across much of Britain and parts of Ireland. By the Late Middle Ages, Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, while control in Ireland fluxed between Gaelic kingdoms, Hiberno-Norman lords and the English-dominated Lordship of Ireland, soon restricted only to The Pale. The 1603 Union of the Crowns, Acts of Union 1707 and Acts of Union 1800 attempted to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as Crown Dependencies. The expansion of the British Empire and migrations following the Irish Famine and Highland Clearances resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty (1919ÿ1922), with six counties remaining in the UK as Northern Ireland.\\r\\nThe term British Isles is controversial in Ireland,[7][15] where there are objections to its usage due to the association of the word British with Ireland.[16] The Government of Ireland does not recognise or use the term[17] and its embassy in London discourages its use.[18] As a result, Britain and Ireland is used as an alternative description,[16][19][20] and Atlantic Archipelago has had limited use among a minority in academia,[21][22][23][24] while British Isles is still commonly employed.[19] Within them, they are also sometimes referred to as these islands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest known references to the islands as a group appeared in the writings of sea-farers from the ancient Greek colony of Massalia.[25][26] The original records have been lost; however, later writings, e.g. Avienus's Ora maritima, that quoted from the Massaliote Periplus (6th century BC) and from Pytheas's On the Ocean (circa 325ÿ320 BC)[27] have survived. In the 1st century BC, Diodorus Siculus has Prettanik nsos,[28] \\"the British Island\\", and Prettanoi,[29] \\"the Britons\\".[26] Strabo used Ϛϫ? (Brettanike),[30][31][32] and Marcian of Heraclea, in his Periplus maris exteri, used ϫ? Ϛϫϫ? ? (the Prettanic Isles) to refer to the islands.[33] Historians today, though not in absolute agreement, largely agree that these Greek and Latin names were probably drawn from native Celtic-language names for the archipelago.[34] Along these lines, the inhabitants of the islands were called the Ϛϫ? (Priteni or Pretani).[26][35] The shift from the \\"P\\" of Pretannia to the \\"B\\" of Britannia by the Romans occurred during the time of Julius Caesar.[36]\\r\\nThe Greco-Egyptian scientist Claudius Ptolemy referred to the larger island as great Britain (ך? Ϛϫ?ϫ megale Brettania) and to Ireland as little Britain (? Ϛϫ?ϫ mikra Brettania) in his work Almagest (147ÿ148 AD).[37] In his later work, Geography (c. 150 AD), he gave these islands the names Alwion, Iwernia, and Mona (the Isle of Man),[38] suggesting these may have been names of the individual islands not known to him at the time of writing Almagest.[39] The name Albion appears to have fallen out of use sometime after the Roman conquest of Great Britain, after which Britain became the more commonplace name for the island called Great Britain.[36]\\r\\nThe earliest known use of the phrase Brytish Iles in the English language is dated 1577 in a work by John Dee.[40] Today, this name is seen by some as carrying imperialist overtones[19] although it is still commonly used. Other names used to describe the islands include the Anglo-Celtic Isles,[41][42] Atlantic archipelago, British-Irish Isles,[43] Britain and Ireland, UK and Ireland, and British Isles and Ireland.[44] Owing to political and national associations with the word British, the Government of Ireland does not use the term British Isles[17] and in documents drawn up jointly between the British and Irish governments, the archipelago is referred to simply as \\"these islands\\".[45] Nonetheless, British Isles is still the most widely accepted term for the archipelago.[45]\\r\\nThe British Isles lie at the juncture of several regions with past episodes of tectonic mountain building. These orogenic belts form a complex geology that records a huge and varied span of Earth's history.[46] Of particular note was the Caledonian Orogeny during the Ordovician Period, c. 488ÿ444 Ma and early Silurian period, when the craton Baltica collided with the terrane Avalonia to form the mountains and hills in northern Britain and Ireland. Baltica formed roughly the northwestern half of Ireland and Scotland. Further collisions caused the Variscan orogeny in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, forming the hills of Munster, southwest England, and southern Wales. Over the last 500?million years the land that forms the islands has drifted northwest from around 30S, crossing the equator around 370?million years ago to reach its present northern latitude.[47]\\r\\nThe islands have been shaped by numerous glaciations during the Quaternary Period, the most recent being the Devensian.[citation needed] As this ended, the central Irish Sea was deglaciated and the English Channel flooded, with sea levels rising to current levels some 4,000 to 5,000 years ago, leaving the British Isles in their current form. Whether or not there was a land bridge between Great Britain and Ireland at this time is somewhat disputed, though there was certainly a single ice sheet covering the entire sea.\\r\\nThe west coasts of Ireland and Scotland that directly face the Atlantic Ocean are generally characterised by long peninsulas, and headlands and bays; the internal and eastern coasts are \\"smoother\\".\\r\\nThere are about 136 permanently inhabited islands in the group, the largest two being Great Britain and Ireland. Great Britain is to the east and covers 83,700?sq?mi (217,000?km2).[48] Ireland is to the west and covers 32,590?sq?mi (84,400?km2).[48] The largest of the other islands are to be found in the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland to the north, Anglesey and the Isle of Man between Great Britain and Ireland, and the Channel Islands near the coast of France.\\r\\nThe islands are at relatively low altitudes, with central Ireland and southern Great Britain particularly low-lying: the lowest point in the islands is the North Slob in County Wexford, Ireland, with an elevation of ?3.0 metres (?9.8?ft). The Scottish Highlands in the northern part of Great Britain are mountainous, with Ben Nevis being the highest point on the islands at 1,343?m (4,406?ft).[49] Other mountainous areas include Wales and parts of Ireland, although only seven peaks in these areas reach above 1,000?m (3,281?ft). Lakes on the islands are generally not large, although Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland is an exception, covering 150 square miles (390?km2).[citation needed] The largest freshwater body in Great Britain (by area) is Loch Lomond at 27.5 square miles (71?km2), and Loch Ness, by volume whilst Loch Morar is the deepest freshwater body in the British Isles, with a maximum depth of 310?m (1,017?ft).[50] There are a number of major rivers within the British Isles. The longest is the Shannon in Ireland at 224?mi (360?km).[citation needed] The river Severn at 220?mi (354?km)[citation needed] is the longest in Great Britain.\\r\\nThe climate is mild, moist and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. It is defined as a temperate oceanic climate, or Cfb on the K?ppen climate classification system, a classification it shares with most of northwest Europe.[51][52] The country receives generally cool summers and mild winters. The North Atlantic Drift (\\"Gulf Stream\\"), which flows from the Gulf of Mexico, brings with it significant moisture and raises temperatures 11?C (20?F) above the global average for the islands' latitudes.[53] Winters are cool and wet, with summers mild and also wet. Most Atlantic depressions pass to the north of the islands, combined with the general westerly circulation and interactions with the landmass, this imposes an eastÿwest variation in climate.[54]\\r\\nThe islands enjoy a mild climate and varied soils, giving rise to a diverse pattern of vegetation. Animal and plant life is similar to that of the northwestern European mainland. There are however, fewer numbers of species, with Ireland having even less. All native flora and fauna in Ireland is made up of species that migrated from elsewhere in Europe, and Great Britain in particular. The only window when this could have occurred was between the end of the last Ice Age (about 12,000 years ago) and when the land bridge connecting the two islands was flooded by sea (about 8,000 years ago).\\r\\nAs with most of Europe, prehistoric Britain and Ireland were covered with forest and swamp. Clearing began around 6000 BC and accelerated in medieval times. Despite this, Britain retained its primeval forests longer than most of Europe due to a small population and later development of trade and industry, and wood shortages were not a problem until the 17th century. By the 18th century, most of Britain's forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from Scandinavia, North America, and the Baltic. Most forest land in Ireland is maintained by state forestation programmes. Almost all land outside urban areas is farmland. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England. Oak, elm, ash and beech are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, pine and birch are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, wych elm, birch and pine. Beech and lime, though not native to Ireland, are also common there. Farmland hosts a variety of semi-natural vegetation of grasses and flowering plants. Woods, hedgerows, mountain slopes and marshes host heather, wild grasses, gorse and bracken.\\r\\nMany larger animals, such as wolf, bear and the European elk are today extinct. However, some species such as red deer are protected. Other small mammals, such as rabbits, foxes, badgers, hares, hedgehogs, and stoats, are very common and the European beaver has been reintroduced in parts of Scotland. Wild boar have also been reintroduced to parts of southern England, following escapes from boar farms and illegal releases. Many rivers contain otters and seals are common on coasts. Over 200 species of bird reside permanently and another 200 migrate. Common types are the common chaffinch, common blackbird, house sparrow and common starling; all small birds. Large birds are declining in number, except for those kept for game such as pheasant, partridge, and red grouse. Fish are abundant in the rivers and lakes, in particular salmon, trout, perch and pike. Sea fish include dogfish, cod, sole, pollock and bass, as well as mussels, crab and oysters along the coast. There are more than 21,000 species of insects.\\r\\nFew species of reptiles or amphibians are found in Great Britain or Ireland. Only three snakes are native to Great Britain: the common European adder, the grass snake and the smooth snake;[55] none are native to Ireland. In general, Great Britain has slightly more variation and native wild life, with weasels, polecats, wildcats, most shrews, moles, water voles, roe deer and common toads also being absent from Ireland. This pattern is also true for birds and insects. Notable exceptions include the Kerry slug and certain species of woodlouse native to Ireland but not Great Britain.\\r\\nDomestic animals include the Connemara pony, Shetland pony, English Mastiff, Irish wolfhound and many varieties of cattle and sheep.\\r\\nThe demographics of the British Isles today are characterised by a generally high density of population in England, which accounts for almost 80% of the total population of the islands. In elsewhere on Great Britain and on Ireland, high density of population is limited to areas around, or close to, a few large cities. The largest urban area by far is the Greater London Built-up Area with 9 million inhabitants. Other major population centres include the Greater Manchester Built-up Area (2.4?million), West Midlands conurbation (2.4?million) and West Yorkshire Urban Area (1.6?million) in England,[56] Greater Glasgow (1.2?million) in Scotland[57] and Greater Dublin Area (1.9 million) in Ireland.[58]\\r\\nThe population of England rose rapidly during the 19th and 20th centuries, whereas the populations of Scotland and Wales showed little increase during the 20th century, the population of Scotland remaining unchanged since 1951. Ireland for most of its history comprised a population proportionate to its land area (about one third of the total population). However, since the Great Irish Famine, the population of Ireland has fallen to less than one tenth of the population of the British Isles. The famine, which caused a century-long population decline, drastically reduced the Irish population and permanently altered the demographic make-up of the British Isles. On a global scale, this disaster led to the creation of an Irish diaspora that numbers fifteen times the current population of the island.\\r\\nThe linguistic heritage of the British Isles is rich,[59] with twelve languages from six groups across four branches of the Indo-European family. The Insular Celtic languages of the Goidelic sub-group (Irish, Manx and Scottish Gaelic) and the Brittonic sub-group (Cornish, Welsh and Breton, spoken in north-western France) are the only remaining Celtic languagesthe last of their continental relations becoming extinct before the 7th century.[60] The Norman languages of Guernsiais, Jrriais and Sercquiais spoken in the Channel Islands are similar to French. A cant, called Shelta, is spoken by Irish Travellers, often as a means to conceal meaning from those outside the group.[61] However, English, sometimes in the form of Scots, is the dominant language, with few monoglots remaining in the other languages of the region.[62] The Norn language of Orkney and Shetland became extinct around 1880.[63]\\r\\nAt the end of the last ice age, what are now the British Isles were joined to the European mainland as a mass of land extending north west from the modern-day northern coastline of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Ice covered almost all of what is now Scotland, most of Ireland and Wales, and the hills of northern England. From 14,000 to 10,000 years ago, as the ice melted, sea levels rose separating Ireland from Great Britain and also creating the Isle of Man. About two to four millennia later, Great Britain became separated from the mainland. Britain probably became repopulated with people before the ice age ended and certainly before it became separated from the mainland. It is likely that Ireland became settled by sea after it had already become an island.\\r\\nAt the time of the Roman Empire, about two thousand years ago, various tribes, which spoke Celtic dialects of the Insular Celtic group, were inhabiting the islands. The Romans expanded their civilisation to control southern Great Britain but were impeded in advancing any further, building Hadrian's Wall to mark the northern frontier of their empire in 122 AD. At that time, Ireland was populated by a people known as Hiberni, the northern third or so of Great Britain by a people known as Picts and the southern two thirds by Britons.\\r\\nAnglo-Saxons arrived as Roman power waned in the 5th century AD. Initially, their arrival seems to have been at the invitation of the Britons as mercenaries to repulse incursions by the Hiberni and Picts. In time, Anglo-Saxon demands on the British became so great that they came to culturally dominate the bulk of southern Great Britain, though recent genetic evidence suggests Britons still formed the bulk of the population. This dominance creating what is now England and leaving culturally British enclaves only in the north of what is now England, in Cornwall and what is now known as Wales. Ireland had been unaffected by the Romans except, significantly, for being Christianisedtraditionally by the Romano-Briton, Saint Patrick. As Europe, including Britain, descended into turmoil following the collapse of Roman civilisation, an era known as the Dark Ages, Ireland entered a golden age and responded with missions (first to Great Britain and then to the continent), the founding of monasteries and universities. These were later joined by Anglo-Saxon missions of a similar nature.\\r\\nViking invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements, particularly along the east coast of Ireland, the west coast of modern-day Scotland and the Isle of Man. Though the Vikings were eventually neutralised in Ireland, their influence remained in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Wexford. England, however, was slowly conquered around the turn of the first millennium AD, and eventually became a feudal possession of Denmark. The relations between the descendants of Vikings in England and counterparts in Normandy, in northern France, lay at the heart of a series of events that led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, which conquered England, remain associated to the English Crown as the Channel Islands to this day. A century later, the marriage of the future Henry II of England to Eleanor of Aquitaine created the Angevin Empire, partially under the French Crown. At the invitation of Diarmait Mac Murchada, a provincial king, and under the authority of Pope Adrian IV (the only Englishman to be elected pope), the Angevins invaded Ireland in 1169. Though initially intended to be kept as an independent kingdom, the failure of the Irish High King to ensure the terms of the Treaty of Windsor led Henry II, as King of England, to rule as effective monarch under the title of Lord of Ireland. This title was granted to his younger son, but when Henry's heir unexpectedly died, the title of King of England and Lord of Ireland became entwined in one person.\\r\\nBy the Late Middle Ages, Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of England and Scotland. Power in Ireland fluxed between Gaelic kingdoms, Hiberno-Norman lords and the English-dominated Lordship of Ireland. A similar situation existed in the Principality of Wales, which was slowly being annexed into the Kingdom of England by a series of laws. During the course of the 15th century, the Crown of England would assert a claim to the Crown of France, thereby also releasing the King of England as from being vassal of the King of France. In 1534, King Henry VIII, at first having been a strong defender of Roman Catholicism in the face of the Reformation, separated from the Roman Church after failing to secure a divorce from the Pope. His response was to place the King of England as \\"the only Supreme Head in Earth of the Church of England\\", thereby removing the authority of the Pope from the affairs of the English Church. Ireland, which had been held by the King of England as Lord of Ireland, but which strictly speaking had been a feudal possession of the Pope since the Norman invasion was declared a separate kingdom in personal union with England.\\r\\nScotland, meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom. In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland inherited the Crown of England, and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. Religious division heightened and the king in England came into conflict with parliament over his tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created a new Ascendancy class which obliterated the remnants of Old English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and English, whilst the populace was largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The \\"Glorious Revolution\\" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne and at the militarily crucial Battle of Aughrim in Ireland. Resistance held out, eventually forcing the guarantee of religious tolerance in the Treaty of Limerick. However, the terms were never honoured and a new monarchy was installed.\\r\\nThe Kingdoms of England and Scotland were unified in 1707 creating the Kingdom of Great Britain. Following an attempted republican revolution in Ireland in 1798, the Kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain were unified in 1801, creating the United Kingdom. The Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining outside of the United Kingdom but with their ultimate good governance being the responsibility of the British Crown (effectively the British government). Although, the colonies of North America that would become the United States of America were lost by the start of the 19th century, the British Empire expanded rapidly elsewhere. A century later it would cover one third of the globe. Poverty in the United Kingdom remained desperate, however, and industrialisation in England led to terrible condition for the working classes. Mass migrations following the Irish Famine and Highland Clearances resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty (1919ÿ1922), with the six counties that formed Northern Ireland remaining as an autonomous region of the UK.\\r\\nThere are two sovereign states in the isles: Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Ireland, sometimes called the Republic of Ireland, governs five sixths of the island of Ireland, with the remainder of the island forming Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, usually shortened to simply the United Kingdom, which governs the remainder of the archipelago with the exception of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The Isle of Man and the two states of the Channel Islands, Jersey and Guernsey, are known as the Crown dependencies. They exercise constitutional rights of self-government and judicial independence;[64] responsibility for international representation rests largely upon the UK (in consultation with the respective governments); and responsibility for defence is reserved by the UK. The United Kingdom is made up of four constituent parts: England, Scotland and Wales, forming Great Britain, and Northern Ireland in the north-east of the island of Ireland. Of these, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have \\"devolved\\" governments, meaning that each has its own parliament or assembly and is self-governing with respect to certain areas set down by law. For judicial purposes, Scotland, Northern Ireland and England and Wales (the latter being one entity) form separate legal jurisdiction, with there being no single law for the UK as a whole.\\r\\nIreland, the United Kingdom and the three Crown dependencies are all parliamentary democracies, with their own separate parliaments. All parts of the United Kingdom return members to parliament in London. In addition to this, voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland return members to a parliament in Edinburgh and to assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast respectively. Governance in the norm is by majority rule, however, Northern Ireland uses a system of power sharing whereby unionists and nationalists share executive posts proportionately and where the assent of both groups are required for the Northern Ireland Assembly to make certain decisions. (In the context of Northern Ireland, unionists are those who want Northern Ireland to remain a part of the United Kingdom and nationalists are those who want Northern Ireland to join with the rest of Ireland.) The British monarch is the head of state of the United Kingdom, while in the Republic of Ireland the head of state is the President of Ireland.\\r\\nIreland and the United Kingdom are both part of the European Union (EU). The Crown dependencies are not a part of the EU, but do participate in certain aspects that were negotiated as a part of the UK's accession to the EU.[64][65][66] Neither the United Kingdom or Ireland are part of the Schengen Area, that allow passport-free travel between EU members states. However, since the partition of Ireland, an informal free-travel area had existed across the region. This area required formal recognition in 1997 during the course of negotiations for the Amsterdam Treaty of the European Union, and is now known as the Common Travel Area.\\r\\nReciprocal arrangements allow British and Irish citizens full voting rights in the two states. Exceptions to this are presidential elections and constitutional referendums in the Republic of Ireland, for which there is no comparable franchise in the other states. In the United Kingdom, these pre-date European Union law, and in both jurisdictions go further than that required by European Union law. Other EU nationals may only vote in local and European Parliament elections while resident in either the UK or Ireland. In 2008, a UK Ministry of Justice report investigating how to strengthen the British sense of citizenship proposed to end this arrangement, arguing that \\"the right to vote is one of the hallmarks of the political status of citizens; it is not a means of expressing closeness between countries\\".[67]\\r\\nIn addition, some civil bodies are organised throughout the islands as a wholefor example the Samaritans, which is deliberately organised without regard to national boundaries on the basis that a service which is not political or religious should not recognise sectarian or political divisions.[citation needed] The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), a charity that operates a lifeboat service, is also organised throughout the islands as a whole, covering the waters of the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands.[68]\\r\\nThe Northern Ireland peace process has led to a number of unusual arrangements between the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. For example, citizens of Northern Ireland are entitled to the choice of Irish or British citizenship or both and the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom consult on matters not devolved to the Northern Ireland Executive. The Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of Ireland also meet as the North/South Ministerial Council to develop policies common across the island of Ireland. These arrangements were made following the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.\\r\\nAnother body established under the Good Friday Agreement, the BritishÿIrish Council, is made up of all of the states and territories of the British Isles. The BritishÿIrish Parliamentary Assembly (Irish: Tion܇l Pharlaiminteach na Breataine agus na hireann) predates the BritishÿIrish Council and was established in 1990. Originally it comprised 25 members of the Oireachtas, the Irish parliament, and 25 members of the parliament of the United Kingdom, with the purpose of building mutual understanding between members of both legislatures. Since then the role and scope of the body has been expanded to include representatives from the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the States of Jersey, the States of Guernsey and the High Court of Tynwald (Isle of Man).\\r\\nThe Council does not have executive powers, but meets biannually to discuss issues of mutual importance. Similarly, the Parliamentary Assembly has no legislative powers but investigates and collects witness evidence from the public on matters of mutual concern to its members. Reports on its findings are presented to the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom. During the February 2008 meeting of the BritishÿIrish Council, it was agreed to set up a standing secretariat that would serve as a permanent 'civil service' for the Council.[69] Leading on from developments in the BritishÿIrish Council, the chair of the BritishÿIrish Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, Niall Blaney, has suggested that the body should shadow the BritishÿIrish Council's work.[70]\\r\\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland have separate media, although British television, newspapers and magazines are widely available in Ireland,[71] giving people in Ireland a high level of familiarity with cultural matters in the United Kingdom. Irish newspapers are also available in the UK, and Irish state and private television is widely available in Northern Ireland.[citation needed] Certain reality TV shows have embraced the whole of the islands, for example The X Factor, seasons 3, 4 and 7 of which featured auditions in Dublin and were open to Irish voters, whilst the show previously known as Britain's Next Top Model became Britain and Ireland's Next Top Model in 2011. A few cultural events are organised for the island group as a whole. For example, the Costa Book Awards are awarded to authors resident in the UK or Ireland. The Mercury Music Prize is handed out every year to the best album from a British or Irish musician or group.\\r\\nMany globally popular sports had modern rules codified in the British Isles, including golf, association football, cricket, rugby, snooker and darts, as well as many minor sports such as croquet, bowls, pitch and putt, water polo and handball. A number of sports are popular throughout the British Isles, the most prominent of which is association football. While this is organised separately in different national associations, leagues and national teams, even within the UK, it is a common passion in all parts of the islands. Rugby union is also widely enjoyed across the islands with four national teams from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The British and Irish Lions is a team chosen from each national team and undertakes tours of the Southern Hemisphere rugby-playing nations every four years. Ireland play as a united team, represented by players from both Northern Ireland and the Republic. These national rugby teams play each other each year for the Triple Crown as part of the Six Nations Championship. Also, since 2001, the professional club teams of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy compete against each other in the Pro14.\\r\\nThe Ryder Cup in golf was originally played between a United States team and a team representing Great Britain and Ireland. From 1979 onwards this was expanded to include the whole of Europe.\\r\\nLondon Heathrow Airport is Europe's busiest airport in terms of passenger traffic and the Dublin-London route is both the busiest air route in Europe collectively,[72] and is the busiest route out of Heathrow, It's also the 2nd busiest international air route in the world. The English Channel and the southern North Sea are the busiest seaways in the world.[73] The Channel Tunnel, opened in 1994, links Great Britain to France and is the second-longest rail tunnel in the world.\\r\\nThe idea of building a tunnel under the Irish Sea has been raised since 1895,[74] when it was first investigated. Several potential Irish Sea tunnel projects have been proposed, most recently the Tusker Tunnel between the ports of Rosslare and Fishguard proposed by The Institute of Engineers of Ireland in 2004.[75] A rail tunnel was proposed in 1997 on a different route, between Dublin and Holyhead, by British engineering firm Symonds. Either tunnel, at 50?mi (80?km), would be by far the longest in the world, and would cost an estimated S15?billion or ?20?billion. A proposal in 2007,[76] estimated the cost of building a bridge from County Antrim in Northern Ireland to Galloway in Scotland at S3.5bn (?5bn).\\r\\nBritish-Irish Isles, the (geography) see British Isles\\r\\nBritish Isles, the (geography) A geographical (not political or constitutional) term for Engliand, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland (including the Republic of Ireland), together with all offshore islands.

It is the time when the sun is descending from its zenith in the sky to somewhat before its terminus at the horizon in the west direction. In human life, it occupies roughly the latter half of the standard work and school day. It is also associated with a number of concerns related to health, safety, and economic productivity: generally, the early afternoon, after most people have eaten lunch, corresponds to decreased work performance, decreased alertness, and a higher incidence of motor vehicle accidents. It is usually from 12 PM to 6 PM, but during winter it may be from 12 PM to 4 PM and during summer it may be from 12 PM to 8 PM.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfternoon is the time occurring between noon and evening.[1] The specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction: noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm,[2] but when afternoon ends is dependent on when evening begins, for which there is no standard definition.[3] However, before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pmpossible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along which one concept of noon was definedand so afternoon would have referred to a narrower timeframe.[4]\\r\\nThe word afternoon, which derives from after and noon, has been attested from about the year 1300; Middle English contained both afternoon and the synonym aftermete. The standard locative marking for the word was at afternoon in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries but has shifted to in the afternoon since then.[5] In Southern U.S. and Midland American English, the word evening is sometimes used to encompass all times between noon and night.[3] The Irish language contains four different words to mark time intervals from late afternoon to nightfall, this period being considered mystical.[6] Metaphorically, the word afternoon refers to a relatively late period in the expanse of time or in one's life.[1]\\r\\nThe term should not be confused with \\"after noon\\" (two separate words), which is a translation of the Latin post meridiem (p.m.), meaning a time between 12:00 midday and 12:00 midnight.\\r\\nAfternoon is a time when the sun is descending from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky.[7] The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or eveningarchetypally, 9 am to 5 pmso the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon.[8] Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.\\r\\nIn diurnal animals, it is typical for blood levels of the hormone cortisolwhich is used to increase blood sugar and aid metabolism and is also produced in response to stressto be most stable in the afternoon after decreasing throughout the morning. However, cortisol levels are also the most reactive to environmental changes unrelated to sleep and daylight during the afternoon. As a result, this time of day is considered optimal for researchers studying stress and hormone levels.[9] Plants generally have their highest photosynthetic levels of the day at noon and in the early afternoon, owing to the sun's high angle in the sky. The large proliferation of maize crops across Earth has caused tiny, harmless fluctuations in the normal pattern of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, since these crops photosynthesize large amounts of carbon dioxide during these times and this process sharply drops down during the late afternoon and evening.[10]\\r\\nIn humans, body temperature is typically highest during the mid to late afternoon.[11] However, human athletes being tested for physical vigor on exercise machines showed no statistically significant difference after lunch.[11] Owners of factory farms are advised to use buildings with an eastÿwest (as opposed to northÿsouth) orientation to house their livestock, because an eastÿwest orientation generally means thicker walls on the east and west to accommodate the sun's acute angle and intense glare during late afternoon. When these animals are too hot, they are more likely to become belligerent and unproductive.[7]\\r\\nThe afternoon, especially the early afternoon, is associated with a dip in a variety of areas of human cognitive and productive functioning. Notably, motor vehicle accidents occur more frequently in the early afternoon, when drivers presumably have recently finished lunch.[12] A study of motor accidents in Sweden between 1987 and 1991 found that the time around 5 pm had by far the most accidents: around 1,600 at 5 pm compared to around 1,000 each at 4 pm and 6 pm. This trend may have been influenced by the afternoon rush hour, but the morning rush hour showed a much smaller increase.[13] In Finland, accidents in the agriculture industry are most common in the afternoon, specifically Monday afternoons in September.[14]\\r\\nOne psychology professor studying circadian rhythms found that his students performed somewhat worse on exams in the afternoon than in the morning, but even worse in the evening. Neither of these differences, however, was statistically significant.[11] Four studies carried out in 1997 found that subjects who were given tests on differentiating traffic signs had longer reaction times when tested at 3:00 pm and 6:00 pm than at 9:00 am and 12:00 pm. These trends held across all four studies and for both complex and abstract questions.[15] However, one UK based researcher failed to find any difference in exam performance on over 300,000 A-level exam papers sat in either the morning or afternoon. [16]\\r\\nHuman productivity routinely decreases in the afternoon. Power plants have shown significant reductions in productivity in the afternoon compared to the morning, the largest differences occurring on Saturdays and the smallest on Mondays.[17] One 1950s study covering two female factory workers for six months found that their productivity was 13 percent lower in the afternoon, the least productive time being their last hour at work. It was summarized that the differences came from personal breaks and unproductive activities at the workplace.[18] Another, larger study found that afternoon declines in productivity were greater during longer work shifts.[19]\\r\\nIt is important to note, however, that not all humans share identical circadian rhythms. One study across Italy and Spain had students fill out a questionnaire, then ranked them on a \\"morningnessÿeveningness\\" scale. The results were a fairly standard bell curve. Levels of alertness over the course of the day had a significant correlation with scores on the questionnaire. All categories of participantsevening types, morning types, and intermediate typeshad high levels of alertness from roughly 2 pm to 8 pm, but outside this window their alertness levels corresponded to their scores.[20]","input":"What is the time between afternoon and evening?"},{"output":"three","context":"Vanity 6 was an American female vocal trio assembled by American musician Prince in midÿ1981.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1981, Prince, himself a rising musical star, suggested that his three female friendshis girlfriend Susan Moonsie, Boston native Brenda Bennett, and Jamie Shoop form a girl group that would be called \\"The Hookers\\". Prince's vision was that the three women would perform in lingerie and sing sensual songs with lyrics about sex and fantasy. Prince had been wanting to mentor a girl singer or group since the lateÿ1970s when he saw the film A Star is Born with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe original trio recorded a few demos before Prince met the then named Denise Matthews, a model and Canadian B movie actress, in January 1980. Matthews was Rick James' date at the American Music Awards when Prince persuaded her to join his girl group.[6] Prince was so taken by her charisma that he decided she would be the perfect frontwoman for his \\"Hookers\\" project. Matthews was eventually re-christened Vanity. Prince had originally suggested that she use the stage name \\"Vagina,\\" but instead they agreed upon \\"Vanity.\\"[7] Other versions of the story suggest that it was Prince himself who coined the name \\"Vanity,\\" as he said that looking at her was like looking in a mirror at the female version of himself. Around this time, Prince and Vanity began a romantic relationship. With Vanity's arrival, Shoop was dropped from the group.\\r\\nWith the new trio finalized, Prince renamed the group Vanity 6. He provided the group, now dressed in lingerie and high heels, with provocative songs (although within the album credits, group members were sometimes given sole writing credits). Their first single, \\"He's So Dull\\", was a minor hit in Australia[8] and the Netherlands,[9] and appeared in the film National Lampoon's Vacation. The second single, \\"Nasty Girl\\", was a hit on both the U.S. R&B chart, peaking at number 7, and U.S. Dance chart (where it hit number one), and it also made an appearance on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart.[10] \\"Nasty Girl\\" was a top 10 hit in the Netherlands,[9] and a top 20 hit in the Flanders region of Belgium.[11] The song was featured in the film Beverly Hills Cop, although it was not included on the soundtrack. \\"Nasty Girl\\" was also featured in the 1983 sex-comedy Private School. During the group's existence, members sometimes provided backing vocals on Prince's albums.\\r\\nThe third single, \\"Drive Me Wild\\", was another minor hit. Music videos were shot for all three singles. Their self-titled album, Vanity 6 (which would turn out to be their only release) was eventually certified gold. The group opened up on the 1999 Tour, between 1982 and 1983, which also featured The Time and Prince, as the headliner. The fact that The Time played behind a curtain during the Vanity 6 performance, caused a rift between the bands and friction within those friendships.[citation needed]\\r\\nTo the other group members' dismay, Prince chose Vanity to pose with him for a Richard Avedon photograph used on the cover of an issue of Rolling Stone magazine. The issue also contained a two-page Avedon photo of Vanity 6. In 1983, Vanity recorded a demo for a new song, \\"Sex Shooter\\", and started reading for her lead role in Purple Rain opposite Prince. Prior to the shooting of the movie, later in 1983, Vanity abruptly decided to leave the Prince camp and relinquish her role in the film. Many reasons were given for her sudden departure, including money, the end of their romantic relationship, and, most importantly, Vanity having been offered a lucrative solo deal from Motown Records.\\r\\nVanity was replaced in Purple Rain by Patricia Kotero, who would adopt the stage name Apollonia. She also inherited the lead role in Vanity 6, which was renamed Apollonia 6, alongside Bennett and Moonsie. The new trio recorded what would be their only album, Apollonia 6 in 1984.\\r\\nIn 1994, former front woman Vanity overdosed on crack cocaine and suffered from near-fatal renal failure. Upon recovering, she renounced her stage name and music and became a born again Christian.[12] Vanity died on February 15, 2016 ÿ aged 57 ÿ from sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis, a complex form of a kidney disease.[13]\\r\\nA number of songs were in fact intended for the Vanity 6 follow up album, but due to Vanity's departure, these songs ended up performed by others.","input":"How many members were in her group vanity 6?"},{"output":"Narragansett people","context":"This is a collection of lists of early settlers (before 1700) in what became the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations and later the state of Rhode Island.

However, his followers visited him at his home in sizable numbers, and the authorities deemed this as preaching. He was to be apprehended and put on a ship for England in January 1636. He was, however, tipped off by magistrate John Winthrop and slipped away from Salem near the middle of January, in the dead of winter, to find shelter with the Wampanoags. He bought a parcel of land in Seekonk from Wampanoag sachem Massasoit which was then at the western edge of the Plymouth Colony (now Rehoboth, Massachusetts). In a 1677 statement, Williams mentioned the four who were with him at Seekonk. The five members of the group were:[3][4][5]\\r\\nIn the spring of 1636, Williams and his company planted crops at Seekonk but were informed in a gentle letter from Governor Edward Winslow of Plymouth that they were within Plymouth's jurisdiction, and this fact would cause difficulties with the Massachusetts authorities. Without urgency, Winslow suggested that Williams and his group move across the Seekonk River into the territory of the Narragansetts, where no colony had any claim. By this time, it is likely that the family members of the original settlers had joined the group. Two other families also joined the settlement. Joshua Verin wrote a statement in 1650 mentioning \\"we six which came first to Providence\\", suggesting that he was the next to join the original five.[6] Also, Benedict Arnold later wrote, \\"Memm. We came to Providence to Dwell the 20th of April, 1636\\"; Providence had not yet been established, so he certainly was referring to Seekonk, where the Arnolds came from Hingham to join the other settlers.[6][7] It is likely, therefore, that sometime about June 1636 the following 25 people crossed the river from Seekonk, in the Plymouth Colony, to a location on the Moshassuck River in Narragansett territory which Williams soon named Providence Plantation:[8]\\r\\nThose named in a deed from Roger Williams, dated about 8 October 1638[10]\\r\\nSeveral young men were admitted as inhabitants to Providence before the settlement was a year old, but they were discontent with their position and wanted to be able to vote and otherwise have equality with the older settlers. The following resolution was adopted in a town meeting on 20 August 1637, and is sometimes called the \\"civil compact.\\" The 1637 date was on the original town records, but when they were transcribed in 1800, the page containing that date was missing.

These two lists come from Bartlett's Records of the Colony of Rhode Island..., and apparently the lists were compiled and incorporated into the town records of Newport on 25 November 1639.

In 1791, John Barber developed a turbine. In 1794 Thomas Mead patented a gas engine. Also in 1794 Robert Street patented an internal combustion engine, which was also the first to use the liquid fuel (gasoline), and built an engine around that time. In 1798, John Stevens designed the first American internal combustion engine. In 1807, French engineers Nicphore (who went on to invent photography) and Claude Nipce ran  a prototype internal combustion engine, using controlled dust explosions, the Pyrolophore. This engine powered a boat on the Sa?ne river, France. The same year,  the  Swiss engineer Fran?ois Isaac de Rivaz built an internal combustion engine ignited by electric spark. In 1823, Samuel Brown patented the first internal combustion engine to be applied industrially, one of his engines pumped water on the Croydon Canal from 1830 to 1836. He also demonstrated a boat using his engine on the Thames in 1827, and an engine driven carriage in 1828.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Eugenio Barsanti, an Italian engineer, together with Felice Matteucci of Florence invented the first real internal combustion engine in 1853. Their patent request was granted in London on June 12, 1854, and published in London's Morning Journal under the title \\"Specification of Eugene Barsanti and Felix Matteucci, Obtaining Motive Power by the Explosion of Gasses\\". In 1860, Belgian Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir produced a gas-fired internal combustion engine. In 1864, Nikolaus Otto patented the first atmospheric gas engine. In 1872, American George Brayton invented the first commercial liquid-fueled internal combustion engine. In 1876, Nikolaus Otto, working with Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach, patented the compressed charge, four-cycle engine. In 1879, Karl Benz patented a reliable two-stroke gas engine. In 1892, Rudolf Diesel developed the first compressed charge, compression ignition engine. In 1926, Robert Goddard launched the first liquid-fueled rocket. In 1939, the Heinkel He 178 became the world's first jet aircraft.  In 1954 German engineer Felix Wankel patented a \\"pistonless\\" engine using an eccentric rotary design.\\r\\n\\r\\n[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly internal combustion engines were started by hand cranking.  Various types of starter motor were later developed.

The most significant distinction between modern internal combustion engines and the early designs is the use of compression of the fuel charge prior to combustion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem of ignition of fuel was handled in early engines with an open flame and a sliding gate.  To obtain a faster engine speed Daimler adopted a Hot Tube ignition which allowed 600?rpm immediately in his 1883 horizontal cylinder engine and very soon after over 900?rpm.  Most of the engines of that time could not exceed 200?rpm due to their ignition and induction systems.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first practical engine, Lenoir's, ran on illuminating gas (coal gas).

It is the only species in the genus Chelonia.[4] Its range extends throughout tropical and subtropical seas around the world, with two distinct populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but it is also found in the Indian Ocean.[5][6] The common name comes from the usually green fat found beneath its carapace[citation needed]; these turtles' shells are olive to black.\\r\\nThis sea turtle's dorsoventrally flattened body is covered by a large, teardrop-shaped carapace; it has a pair of large, paddle-like flippers. It is usually lightly colored, although in the eastern Pacific populations parts of the carapace can be almost black. Unlike other members of its family, such as the hawksbill sea turtle, C. mydas is mostly herbivorous. The adults usually inhabit shallow lagoons, feeding mostly on various species of seagrasses.[7] The turtles bite off the tips of the blades of seagrass, which keeps the grass healthy.\\r\\nLike other sea turtles, green sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding grounds and hatching beaches. Many islands worldwide are known as Turtle Island due to green sea turtles nesting on their beaches. Females crawl out on beaches, dig nests and lay eggs during the night. Later, hatchlings emerge and scramble into the water. Those that reach maturity may live to 80 years in the wild.[5]\\r\\nC. mydas is listed as endangered by the IUCN and CITES and is protected from exploitation in most countries.[8] It is illegal to collect, harm or kill them. In addition, many countries have laws and ordinances to protect nesting areas. However, turtles are still in danger due to human activity. In some countries, turtles and their eggs are hunted for food. Pollution indirectly harms turtles at both population and individual scales, as well as light pollution. Many turtles die after being caught in fishing nets. Also, real estate development often causes habitat loss by eliminating nesting beaches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe green sea turtle is a member of the tribe Chelonini. A 1993 study clarified the status of genus Chelonia with respect to the other marine turtles. The carnivorous Eretmochelys (hawksbill), Caretta (loggerhead) and Lepidochelys (Ridley) were assigned to the tribe Carettini. Herbivorous Chelonia warranted their status as a genus, while Natator (flatback) was further removed from the other genera than previously believed.[9]\\r\\nThe species was originally described by Linnaeus in 1758 as Testudo mydas.[10] In 1868, Marie Firmin Bocourt named a particular species of sea turtle Chelonia agassizii.[11][12] This \\"species\\" was referred to as the \\"black sea turtle\\".[13] Later research determined Bocourt's \\"black sea turtle\\" was not genetically distinct from C. mydas, and thus taxonomically not a separate species.[14] These two \\"species\\" were then united as Chelonia mydas and populations were given subspecies status: C. mydas mydas referred to the originally described population, while C. mydas agassizi referred only to the Pacific population known as the Galpagos green turtle.[15][16] This subdivision was later determined to be invalid and all species members were then designated Chelonia mydas.[4] The oft-mentioned name C. agassizi remains an invalid junior synonym of C. mydas. Other authorities claim that the two populations are phenotypically distinct and treat the East Pacific form as a full species.[17]\\r\\nThe species' common name does not derive from any particular green external coloration of the turtle. Its name comes from the greenish color of the turtles' fat, which is only found in a layer between their inner organs and their shell.[18] As a species found worldwide, the green turtle has many local names. In the Hawaiian language it is called honu,[19][20] and it is locally known as a symbol of good luck and longevity.[21]\\r\\nFemale returning to the sea after nesting in Redang Island, Malaysia\\r\\nImmature Hawaiian C. mydas\\r\\nSwimming in a Mexican coral reef\\r\\nHeading for the ocean on a beach at the Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park\\r\\nGreen sea turtle near Marsa Alam, Egypt\\r\\nGreen sea turtle near Marsa Alam, Egypt\\r\\nGreen sea turtle\\r\\nIts appearance is that of a typical sea turtle. C. mydas has a dorsoventrally flattened body, a beaked head at the end of a short neck, and paddle-like arms well-adapted for swimming.[22] Adult green turtles grow to 1.5 metres (5?ft) long.[23] The average weight of mature individuals is 68ÿ190?kg (150ÿ419?lb) and the average carapace length is 78ÿ112?cm (31ÿ44?in).[24] Exceptional specimens can weigh 315?kg (694?lb) or even more, with the largest known C. mydas having weighed 395?kg (871?lb) and measured 153?cm (60?in) in carapace length.[25]\\r\\nAnatomically, a few characteristics distinguish the green turtle from the other members of its family. Unlike the closely related hawksbill turtle, the green turtle's snout is very short and its beak is unhooked. The neck cannot be pulled into the shell.[26] The sheath of the turtle's upper jaw possesses a denticulated edge, while its lower jaw has stronger, serrated, more defined denticulation. The dorsal surface of the turtle's head has a single pair of prefrontal scales. Its carapace is composed of five central scutes flanked by four pairs of lateral scutes. Underneath, the green turtle has four pairs of inframarginal scutes covering the area between the turtle's plastron and its shell. Mature C. mydas front appendages have only a single claw (as opposed to the hawksbill's two), although a second claw is sometimes prominent in young specimens.[27]\\r\\nThe carapace of the turtle has various color patterns that change over time. Hatchlings of Chelonia mydas, like those of other marine turtles, have mostly black carapaces and light-colored plastrons. Carapaces of juveniles turn dark brown to olive, while those of mature adults are either entirely brown, spotted or marbled with variegated rays. Underneath, the turtle's plastron is hued yellow. C. mydas limbs are dark-colored and lined with yellow, and are usually marked with a large dark brown spot in the center of each appendage.[5][28]\\r\\nThe range of the green sea turtle extends throughout tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide. The two major subpopulations are the Atlantic and the eastern Pacific subpopulations. Each population is genetically distinct, with its own set of nesting and feeding grounds within the population's known range.[5] One of the genetic differences between the two subpopulations is the type of mitochondrial DNA found in individual's cells. Individuals from rookeries in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea have a similar type of mitochondrial DNA, and individuals from The Pacific and Atlantic Oceans have another type of Mitochondrial DNA.[29] Their native range includes tropical to subtropical waters along continental coasts and islands between 30N and 30S. Since green sea turtles are a migrating species, their global distribution spans into the open ocean. The differences in mitochondrial DNA more than likely stems from the populations being isolated from each other by the southern tips of both South America and Africa with no warm waters for the green sea turtles to migrate through. The green sea turtle is estimated to inhabit coastal areas of more than 140 countries, with nesting sites in over 80 countries worldwide throughout the year. In the United States Atlantic coast, green sea turtles can be found from Texas and north to Massachusetts. In the United States Pacific coast, they have been found from southern California north to the southernmost tip of Alaska. The largest populations of green sea turtles within the United States coastline are in the Hawaiian Islands and Florida. Globally, the largest populations of sea turtles are in the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the Caribbean islands.[30]\\r\\nThe green sea turtle can generally be found throughout the Atlantic Ocean. Although the species is most abundant in tropical climates, individuals have been spotted as far north as Canada in the western Atlantic, and the British Isles in the east. The subpopulation's southern range is known until past the southern tip of Africa in the east and Argentina in the western Atlantic. The major nesting sites can be found on various islands in the Caribbean, along the eastern shores of the continental United States, the eastern coast of the South American continent and most notably, on isolated North Atlantic islands.\\r\\nIn the Caribbean, major nesting sites have been identified on Aves Island, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica. In recent years there are signs of increased nesting in the Cayman Islands.[31] One of the region's most important nesting grounds is in Tortuguero in Costa Rica.[32] In fact, the majority of the Caribbean region's C. mydas population hails from a few beaches in Tortuguero.[33] Within United States waters, minor nesting sites have been noted in the states of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and all along the east coast of Florida. Hutchinson Island in particular is a major nesting area in Florida waters. Notable locations in South America include secluded beaches in Suriname and French Guiana.[34] In the Southern Atlantic Ocean, the most notable nesting grounds for Chelonia mydas are found on the island of Ascension,[22] hosts 6,000ÿ13,000 turtle nests.[35][36][37]\\r\\nIn contrast with the sporadic distribution of nesting sites, feeding grounds are much more widely distributed throughout the region. Important feeding grounds in Florida include Indian River Lagoon, the Florida Keys, Florida Bay, Homosassa, Crystal River, and Cedar Key.[22][38]\\r\\nIn the Pacific, its range reaches as far north as the southern coast of Alaska and as far south as Chile in the east. The turtle's distribution in the western Pacific reaches north to Japan and southern parts of Russia's Pacific coast, and as far south as the northern tip of New Zealand and a few islands south of Tasmania. The turtles can be found throughout the Indian Ocean.[39]\\r\\nSignificant nesting grounds are scattered throughout the entire Pacific region, including Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands, the South Pacific, the northern coast of Australia, and Southeast Asia. Major Indian Ocean nesting colonies include India, Pakistan, and other coastal countries. The east coast of the African continent hosts a few nesting grounds, including islands in the waters around Madagascar.[39]\\r\\nNesting grounds are found all along the Mexican coast. These turtles feed in seagrass pastures in the Gulf of California.[40] Green turtles belonging to the distinct Hawaiian subpopulation nest at the protected French Frigate Shoals some 800 kilometers (500?mi) west of the Hawaiian Islands.[20] In the Philippines, green turtles nest in the Turtle Islands along with closely related hawksbill turtles.[41] Indonesia has a few nesting beaches, one in the Meru Betiri National Reserve in East Java.[42] The Coral Sea has nesting areas of world significance.[43] The Great Barrier Reef has two genetically distinct populations; one north and one south. Within the reef, twenty separate locations consisting of small islands and cays were identified as nesting sites for either population of C. mydas. Of these, the most important is on Raine Island.[44][45] Major nesting sites are common on either side of the Arabian Sea, both in Ash Sharqiyah, Oman, and along the coast of Karachi, Pakistan. Some specific beaches there, such as Hawke's Bay and Sandspit, are common to both C. mydas and L. olivacea subpopulation. Sandy beaches along Sindh and Balochistan are nesting sites. Some 25 kilometers (16?mi) off the Pakistani coast, Astola island is another nesting beach.[7][46][47]\\r\\nOn 30 December 2007, fishermen using a hulbot-hulbot (a type of fishnet) accidentally caught an 80?kg (180?lb), 93?cm (37?in) long and 82?cm (32?in) wide turtle off Barangay Bolong, Zamboanga City, Philippines. December is breeding season near the Bolong beach.[48]\\r\\nGreen sea turtles move across three habitat types, depending on their life stage. They lay eggs on beaches. Mature turtles spend most of their time in shallow, coastal waters with lush seagrass beds. Adults frequent inshore bays, lagoons and shoals with lush seagrass meadows. Entire generations often migrate between one pair of feeding and nesting areas.[22] Green sea turtles, Chelonia mydas, are classified as an aquatic species and are distributed around the globe in warm tropical to subtropical waters. The environmental parameter that limits the distribution of the turtles is ocean temperatures below 7 to 10 degrees Celsius.[49] Within their geographical range, the green sea turtles generally stay near continental and island coastlines. Near the coastlines, the green sea turtles live within shallow bays and protected shores. In these protected shores and bays, the green sea turtle habitats include coral reefs, salt marshes, and nearshore seagrass beds. The coral reefs provide red, brown, and green algae for their diet and gives protection from predators and rough storms within the ocean. The salt marshes and seagrass beds contain seaweed and grass vegetation, allowing ample habitat for the sea turtles.[30]\\r\\nTurtles spend most of their first five years in convergence zones within the bare open ocean that surround them.[7][50] These young turtles are rarely seen as they swim in deep, pelagic waters.[51][52] Green sea turtles typically swim at 2.5ÿ3?km/h (1.6ÿ1.9?mph).[53]\\r\\nAs one of the first sea turtle species studied, much of what is known of sea turtle ecology comes from studies of green turtles. The ecology of C. mydas changes drastically with each stage of its life history. Newly emerged hatchlings are carnivorous, pelagic organisms, part of the open ocean mininekton. In contrast, immature juveniles and adults are commonly found in seagrass meadows closer inshore as herbivorous grazers.\\r\\nThe diet of green turtles changes with age.[54] Juveniles are carnivorous, but as they mature they become omnivorous.[55] The young eat fish eggs, molluscs, jellyfish, small invertebrates, worms, sponges, algae, and crustaceans.[56][30] Green sea turtles have a relatively slow growth rate because of the low nutritional value of their diet. Body fat turns green because of the consumed vegetation.[55] This diet shift has an effect on the green turtle's skull morphology.[57] Their serrated jaw helps them chew algae and sea grasses.[58] Most adult sea turtles are strictly herbivorous.[55]\\r\\nOnly human beings and the larger sharks feed on C. mydas adults. Specifically, tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) hunt adults in Hawaiian waters.[59] Juveniles and new hatchlings have significantly more predators, including crabs, small marine mammals and shorebirds.[5] Additionally, their eggs are vulnerable to predation by scavengers like red foxes and golden jackals.[60]\\r\\nGreen sea turtles have a variety of parasites including barnacles, leeches, protozoans, cestodes, and nematodes. Barnacles attach to the carapace, and leeches to the flippers and skin of the turtles, causing damage to the soft tissues and leading to blood loss. Protozoans, cestodes and nematodes lead to many turtle deaths because of the infections in the liver and intestinal tract they cause. The greatest disease threat to the turtle population is fibropapilloma, which produces lethal tumor growth on scales, lungs, stomach, and kidneys. Fibropapilloma is caused by a herpesvirus that is transmitted by leeches such as Ozobranchus branchiatus, a species of leech which feeds almost entirely on green sea turtles.[49][61]\\r\\nGreen sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding sites and nesting sites; some swim more than 2,600 kilometres (1,600?mi) to reach their spawning grounds. Beaches in Southeast Asia, India, islands in the western Pacific, and Central America are where Green sea turtles breed.[6] Mature turtles often return to the exact beach from which they hatched. Females usually mate every two to four years. Males, on the other hand, visit the breeding areas every year, attempting to mate.[62] Mating seasons vary between populations. For most C. mydas in the Caribbean, mating season is from June to September.[22] The French Guiana nesting subpopulation nests from March to June.[34] In the tropics, green turtles nest throughout the year, although some subpopulations prefer particular times of the year. In Pakistan, Indian Ocean turtles nest year-round, but prefer the months of July to December.[46]\\r\\nSea turtles return to the beaches on which they were born to lay their own eggs. The reason for returning to native beaches may be that it guarantees the turtles an environment that has the necessary components for their nesting to be successful. These include a sandy beach, easy access for the hatchlings to get to the ocean, the right incubation temperatures, and low probability of predators that may feed on their eggs. Over time these turtles have evolved these tendencies to return to an area that has provided reproductive success for many generations. Their ability to return to their birthplace is known as natal homing.[63] The males also return to their birthplaces in order to mate. These males that return to their homes know they will be able to find mates because the females born there also return to breed. By doing this, the green sea turtles are able to improve their reproductive success and is why they are willing to expend the energy to travel thousands of miles across the ocean in order to reproduce.\\r\\nMating behaviour is similar to other marine turtles. Female turtles control the process. A few populations practice polyandry, although this does not seem to benefit hatchlings.[64] After mating in the water, the female moves above the beach's high tide line, where she digs a hole 11-22 inches in depth with her hind flippers and deposits her eggs. The hole is then covered up again.[65] Clutch size ranges between 85 and 200, depending on the age of the female. This process takes about an hour to an hour and a half. After the nest is completely covered, she returns to the sea. The female will do this 3 to 5 times in one season.[6]\\r\\nThe eggs are round and white, and about 45?mm in diameter. The hatchlings remain buried for days until they all emerge together at night.[65] The temperature of the nest determines the sex of the turtles before they hatch. At around 50 to 70 days,[66] the eggs hatch during the night, and the hatchlings instinctively head directly into the water. This is the most dangerous time in a turtle's life. As they walk, predators, such as gulls and crabs, feed on them. A significant percentage never make it to the ocean. Little is known of the initial life history of newly hatched sea turtles.[22] Juveniles spend three to five years in the open ocean before they settle as still-immature juveniles into their permanent shallow-water lifestyle.[51][52] It is speculated that they take twenty to fifty years to reach sexual maturity. Individuals live up to eighty years in the wild.[5] It is estimated that only 1% of hatchlings reach sexual maturity.[67]\\r\\nEach year on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic, C. mydas females create 6,000 to 25,000 nests. They are among the largest green turtles in the world; many are more than a metre in length and weigh up to 300 kilograms (660?lb).[68]\\r\\nSea turtles spend almost all their lives submerged, but must breathe air for the oxygen needed to meet the demands of vigorous activity. With a single explosive exhalation and rapid inhalation, sea turtles can quickly replace the air in their lungs. The lungs permit a rapid exchange of oxygen and prevent gases from being trapped during deep dives. Sea turtle blood can deliver oxygen efficiently to body tissues even at the pressures encountered during diving. During routine activity, green and loggerhead turtles dive for about four to five minutes, and surface to breathe for one to three seconds.\\r\\nTurtles can rest or sleep underwater for several hours at a time, but submergence time is much shorter while diving for food or to escape predators. Breath-holding ability is affected by activity and stress, which is why turtles quickly drown in shrimp trawlers and other fishing gear.[27] During the night while sleeping and to protect themselves from potential predators, the adults wedge themselves under rocks below the surface and under ledges in reefs and coastal rocks. Many green sea turtles have been observed in returning to the same sleeping location night after night.[30]\\r\\nGreen sea turtles tend to have good vision, well adapted to a life at sea. The turtles can see many colors, but are most sensitive to light from violet to yellow or wavelengths of 400 to 600 nanometers. They do not see many colors in the orange to red portion of the light spectrum. On land, however, the sea turtles are nearsighted because the lenses in the eyes are spherical and adjusted to refraction underwater.[30] Sea turtles have no external ear and only one ear bone, called the columella. With one ear bone, the turtles can only hear low frequency sounds, from 200 to 700?Hz. Sounds can also be detected through vibrations of the head, backbone, and shell. The nose of the turtle has two external openings and connects to the roof of the mouth through internal openings. The lower surface of the nasal passage has two sets of sensory cells called the Jacobsons organ. The turtle can use this organ to smell by pumping water in and out of its nose.[49]\\r\\nSince green sea turtles migrate long distances during breeding seasons, they have special adaptive systems in order to navigate. In the open ocean, the turtles navigate using wave directions, sun light, and temperatures. The sea turtles also contain an internal magnetic compass. They can detect magnetic information by using magnetic forces acting on the magnetic crystals in their brains. Through these crystals, they can sense the intensity Earths magnetic field and are able to make their way back to their nesting grounds or preferred feeding grounds.[49]\\r\\nNatal homing is an animal's ability to return to its birthplace in order to reproduce. Natal homing is found in all species of sea turtles and in other animals such as salmon. How these turtles are able to return to their birthplace is an interesting phenomenon. Many researchers believe that sea turtle use a process called imprinting, which is a special type of learning that occurs when turtles first hatch that allows them to recognize their native beach. There are two types of imprinting that are thought to be the reason turtles can find these beaches.The first is the chemical imprinting hypothesis. This hypothesis states that much like salmon, sea turtles are able to use olfactory cues and senses to smell their way home. However, a problem with this hypothesis is that some turtles travel thousands of miles to return to their native beaches, and the scents from that area arent likely to travel and be distinguishable from that distance. The second hypothesis is the geomagnetic hypothesis. This hypothesis states that as it hatches, a young turtle will imprint on the magnetic field of the beach they are born on. This hypothesis strongly correlates to the method which sea turtles use to navigate the earth.[63]\\r\\nIn order to tolerate the constant heat loss in the water, sea turtles have the ability to shunt blood away from tissues that are tolerant of low oxygen levels toward the heart, brain, and central nervous system. Other mechanisms include basking on warm beaches and producing heat through their activity and movements of their muscles. In the winter months, turtles living at higher latitudes can hibernate for a short period in the mud.[69]\\r\\nThe green sea turtles exhibit sex differences by their development and appearance. As adult turtles, males are easily distinguishable from the females by having a longer tail (visibly extending past the shell) and longer claws on the front flippers. The hatching time and sex of the turtles are determined by the incubation temperature of the nest. Hatchings occur more quickly in nests that are warmer than nests that are in cooler conditions. Warm nesting sites above 30 degrees Celsius favor the development of females, whereas nesting sites below 30 degrees Celsius produce males. The position of the egg in the nest also affects sex-determination. Eggs in the center tend to hatch as females due to the warmer conditions within the nest.[30]\\r\\nGreen sea turtles play an essential role within the ecosystem in which they live. In the seagrass beds, the turtles feed on the seagrass by trimming only the top and leaving the roots of the plant. Through their feeding technique, the turtles help to improve the health and growth of the seagrass beds. The healthy seagrass beds that the turtles provide give habitat and feeding grounds for many species of fish and crustaceans. On the nesting beaches, the green sea turtles provide key nutrients for the ecosystem through their hatched egg shells. In their coral reef habitat, the green sea turtles have a symbiotic interaction with reef fish, including the yellow tang. The yellow tang fish swims along with the turtle and feeds on the algae, barnacles, and parasites on its shell and flippers. This species interaction provides food for the yellow tang and provides a necessary cleaning and smoothing of the turtles shell. This cleaning helps the turtle swim by reducing the amount of drag and improves their health.[49]\\r\\nHistorically, the turtles' skin was tanned and used to make handbags, especially in Hawaii.[20] Ancient Chinese considered the flesh of sea turtles a culinary delicacy, including and especially C. mydas.[70] Particularly for this species, the turtle's fat, cartilage, and flesh, known as calipee, are sought as ingredients for making turtle soup, a popular 19th century American dish.[18]\\r\\nIn Java, Indonesia, sea turtle eggs were a popular delicacy. However, the turtle's flesh is regarded as ?arm or \\"unclean\\" under Islamic law (Islam is Java's primary religion). In Bali, turtle meat was a prominent feature at ceremonial and religious feasts. Turtles were harvested in the remotest parts of the Indonesian archipelago.[71] Bali has been importing sea turtles since the 1950s, as its own turtle supplies became depleted.[72] The mostly Hindu Balinese do not eat the eggs, but sell them instead to local Muslims.\\r\\nCommercial farms, such as the Cayman Turtle Farm in the West Indies, once bred them for commercial sale of turtle meat, turtle oil (rendered from the fat), turtle shell, and turtle leather made from the skin. The farm's initial stock was in large part from \\"doomed\\" eggs removed from nests threatened by erosion, flooding, or in chemically hostile soil.[73] The farms held as many as 100,000 turtles at any one time. When the international markets were closed by regulations that did not allow even farm-bred turtle products to be exported internationally, the surviving farm became primarily a tourist attraction, supporting 11,000 turtles.[74] Initially started as Mariculture Ltd., then Cayman Turtle Farm Ltd and subsequently branded Boatswain's Beach, in 2010 the farm's brandname was changed to Cayman Turtle Farm: Island Wildlife Encounter.[75]\\r\\nSea turtles are integral to the history and culture of the Cayman Islands. When the islands were first discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1503, he named them \\"Las Tortugas\\" because of the abundance of sea turtles in the waters around the islands.[76] Many of the earliest visitors came to the Cayman Islands to capture the turtles as a source of fresh meat during long voyages. The Green Turtle is a national symbol displayed as part of the Coat of Arms of the Cayman Islands, which also forms part of the national flag of the Cayman Islands. The country's currency uses a turtle as the watermark in its banknotes.[77] A stylised sea turtle nicknamed \\"Sir Turtle\\" is the mascot of the national airline Cayman Airways[78] and is part of the livery of its aircraft.\\r\\nA ki' pohaku (petroglyph) of a turtle (or honu) can be found on The Big Island of Hawaii in the Pu'u Loa lava fields. The green sea turtle (called Honu) has always held a special meaning for Hawaiians and this petroglyph shows its importance dating to possibly when the islands first became populated. The turtle symbolizes a navigator that can find his way home time after time. This symbol mirrors the real life of the green Hawaiian turtle as it will swim hundreds of miles to lay its eggs at its own place of birth. Though there are other myths as well, some Hawaiian legends say the honu were the first to guide the Polynesians to the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaiians revere the turtle and the legend of Kailua, a turtle who could take the form of a girl at will. In human form, she looked after the children playing on Punalu'u beach.[79]\\r\\nIn recent decades, sea turtles have moved from unrestricted exploitation to global protection, with individual countries providing additional protection, although serious threats remain unabated.\\r\\nHuman action presents both intentional and unintentional threats to the species' survival. Intentional threats include continued hunting, poaching and egg harvesting. More dangerous are unintentional threats, including boat strikes, fishermen's nets that lack turtle excluder devices, pollution and habitat destruction. Chemical pollution may create tumors;[80] effluent from harbors near nesting sites may create disturbances; and light pollution may disorient hatchlings. Habitat loss usually occurs due to human development of nesting areas. Beach-front construction, land \\"reclamation\\" and increased tourism are examples of such development.[5][7] An infectious tumor-causing disease, fibropapillomatosis, is also a problem in some populations. The disease kills a sizeable fraction of those it infects, though some individuals seem to resist the disease.[20][81][82] In addition, at least in the Southwestern Atlantic (Ro de la Plata, Uruguay), exotic invasive species such as the rapa whelk Rapana venosa, were reported massively bio-fouling immature green turtles, reducing buoyancy, increasing drag, and causing severe injuries to the carapace.[83] Because of these threats, many populations are in a vulnerable state.\\r\\nPacific green turtles' foraging habitats are poorly understood and mostly unknown.[84] These foraging grounds are most likely along the coast of Baja California, Mexico and southern California,[85] in which these turtles have a high risk of incidental capture by coastal fisheries. The main mortality factor for these turtles is the shrimp trawlers in Mexico, in which many of these turtles go undocumented.[85] The only foraging area that has been identified is the San Diego Bay, but it is heavily polluted with metals and PCBs.[85] These contaminants have a negative effect on the ocean environment, and have been shown to cause lesions and sometimes mortality.[85] Green turtles also are threatened by entanglement and ingestion of plastic.[85] In San Diego Bay, an adult green turtle was found dead with monofilament netting tightly packed in its esophagus.[85] In addition there are indications that global climate change is affecting the ability of Green Turtle populations in Australia to produce males due to their temperature-dependent sex determination and the rising temperatures in the northern Great Barrier Reef region.[86]\\r\\nGreen sea turtles are the most commonly traded species along Java's south coast and are sold in the form of whole, stuffed animals or turtle oil, locally known as \\"minyak bulus\\"[87]\\r\\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has repeatedly listed green sea turtles in its Red List under differing criteria. In 1982, they officially classified it as an endangered species.[88] The 1986,[89] 1988,[90] 1990,[91] 1994,[92] and the landmark 1996 edition of the IUCN Red List, retained the listing.[93]\\r\\nIn 2001, Nicholas Mrosovsky filed a delisting petition, claiming some green turtle populations were large, stable and in some cases, increasing. At the time, the species was listed under the strict EN A1abd criteria. The IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee ruled that visual counts of nesting females could not be considered \\"direct observation\\" and thus downgraded the species' status to EN A1bdretaining the turtle's endangered status.[94]\\r\\nIn 2004, the IUCN reclassified C. mydas as endangered under the EN A2bd criteria, which essentially states the wild populations face a high risk of extinction because of several factors. These factors include a probable population reduction of more than 50% over the past decade as estimated from abundance indices and by projecting exploitation levels.[95]\\r\\nOn 3 May 2007, C. mydas was listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) as a member of the family Cheloniidae.[96] The species was originally listed on Appendix II in 1975. The entire family was moved to Appendix I in 1977, with the exception of the Australian population of C. mydas. In 1981, the Australian population joined the rest. It is therefore illegal to import, export, kill, capture or harass green turtles.[97]\\r\\nThe Mediterranean population is listed as critically endangered.[5][18] The eastern Pacific, Hawaiian and Southern California subpopulations are designated threatened. Specific Mexican subpopulations are listed as endangered. The Florida population is listed as endangered. The World Wide Fund for Nature has labeled populations in Pakistan as \\"rare and declining\\".[47]\\r\\nIn the State of Hawaii, specifically on the Island of Hawaii (Hawaii County), state representative Faye Hanohano, a Native Hawaiian rights activist, pressed for a measure to delist C. mydas from protected status so that Native Hawaiians could legally harvest the turtles and possibly their eggs as well. The bill, HCR14, was largely overlooked by the media since at that point it was only a local issue. While the bill was passed in the House, the Senate's Committee on Energy and Environment refused to hear it, which meant that the bill did not go on to be heard by the Senate.[98]\\r\\nIn addition to management by global entities such as the IUCN and CITES, specific countries around the world have undertaken conservation efforts. Bali has traditional uses that were considered sustainable, but have been questioned considering greater demand from the larger and wealthier human population. The harvest was the most intensive in the world.[71] In 1999, Indonesia restricted turtle trade and consumption because of the decreasing population and threat of a tourist boycott. It rejected a request made by Bali Governor I Made Mangku Pastika in November 2009 to set a quota of 1,000 turtles to be killed in Hindu religious ceremonies. While conservationists respect the need for turtles in rituals, they wanted a smaller quota.[99]\\r\\nEcotourism is one initiative in Sabah, Malaysia. The island of Pulau Selingan is home to a turtle hatchery. Staff people place some of the eggs laid each night in a hatchery to protect them from predators. Incubation takes around sixty days. When the eggs hatch, tourists assist in the release of the baby turtles into the sea.[100]\\r\\nAll populations are listed as \\"Threatened\\".[101][102] The Hawaiian subpopulation has made a remarkable comeback and is now one focus of ecotourism and has become something of a state mascot. Students of Hawaii Preparatory Academy on the Big Island have tagged thousands of specimens since the early 1990s.[20]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom the species is protected by a Biodiversity Action Plan, due to excess harvesting and marine pollution.[103] The Pakistani-branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature has been initiating projects for secure turtle hatching since the 1980s. However, the population has continued to decline.[7]\\r\\nIn the Atlantic, conservation initiatives have centered around Caribbean nesting sites. The Tortuguero nesting beaches in Costa Rica have been the subject of egg-collection limits since the 1950s. The Tortuguero National Park was formally established in 1976, in part, to protect that region's nesting grounds.[32] On Ascension Island, which contains some of the most important nesting beaches, an active conservation program has been implemented.[104] Karumb has been monitoring foraging and developmental areas of juvenile green turtles in Uruguay since 1999.[105]\\r\\nCayman Turtle Farm located in Grand Cayman in the northwest Caribbean Sea is the first farm to have achieved the second generation of Green Sea turtles bred, laid, hatched, and raised in captivity.[106] Since its beginning in 1968, the farm has released over 31,000 turtles into the wild,[76] and each year more captive-bred turtles are released into the Caribbean Sea from beaches around the island of Grand Cayman.[107] Captive-bred turtles released from the farm as hatchlings or yearlings with \\"living tags,\\" have now begun to return to nest on Grand Cayman as adults.[108][109] On February 19, 2012 the farm released the first 2nd-generation captive-bred Green Sea turtle equipped with a Position Tracking Transponder ÿ PTT (also known as a satellite tag).[110] In addition, the farm provides turtle meat products to the local population for whom turtle has been part of the traditional cuisine for centuries. In so doing, the farm curtails the incentive to take turtles from the wild,[111] which over the years in addition to the Cayman Turtle Farm's release of captive-bred turtles has enabled an increase in the number of turtles sighted in the waters around the island of Grand Cayman and nesting on its beaches.[112]\\r\\nIn the Pacific, green sea turtles nest on the motu (islets) in the Funafuti Conservation Area, a marine conservation area covering 33 square kilometers (12.74 square miles) of reef, lagoon and motu on the western side of Funafuti atoll in Tuvalu.[113]\\r\\nThe genome of Chelonia mydas was sequenced in 2013 to examine the development and evolution of the turtle body plan.[114]","input":"Where do green sea turtles live in australia?"},{"output":"March 2004","context":"The National Incident Management System (NIMS) is a standardized approach to incident management developed by the United States Department of Homeland Security.

The prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901.[3][4][5] In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden's central bank) established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, which has been commonly known as the Nobel Prize in Economics.[6][7][8] The Nobel Prize is widely regarded as the most prestigious award available in the fields of literature, medicine, physics, chemistry, economics and activism for peace.[9][10][11]\\r\\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Nobel Prize in Physics, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel; the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; the Swedish Academy grants the Nobel Prize in Literature; and the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded not by a Swedish organization but by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.\\r\\nBetween 1901 and 2017, the Nobel Prizes including the Economic Prizes were awarded 585 times to 923 people and organizations.[4] With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once, this makes a total of 24 organizations, and 892 individuals.[4][12] The prize ceremonies take place annually in Stockholm, Sweden (with the exception of the peace prize, which is held in Oslo, Norway). Each recipient, or laureate, receives a gold medal, a diploma, and a sum of money that has been decided by the Nobel Foundation.

In 1894, Nobel purchased the Bofors iron and steel mill, which he made into a major armaments manufacturer. Nobel also invented ballistite. This invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives, especially the British smokeless powder cordite. As a consequence of his patent claims, Nobel was eventually involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over cordite. Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime, with most of his wealth from his 355?inventions, of which dynamite is the most famous.[16]\\r\\nIn 1888, Nobel was astonished to read his own obituary, titled The merchant of death is dead, in a French newspaper. As it was Alfred's brother Ludvig who had died, the obituary was eight years premature. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his will.[17] On 10 December 1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo, Italy, from a cerebral haemorrhage. He was 63 years old.[18]\\r\\nNobel wrote several wills during his lifetime. He composed the last over a year before he died, signing it at the SwedishÿNorwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895.[19][20] To widespread astonishment, Nobel's last will specified that his fortune be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the \\"greatest benefit on mankind\\" in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace.[21] Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31?million SEK (c. US$186 million, ?150 million in 2008), to establish the five Nobel Prizes.[22][23] Because of skepticism surrounding the will, it was not until 26 April 1897 that it was approved by the Storting in Norway.[24] The executors of Nobel's will, Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist, formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organised the award of prizes.[25]\\r\\nNobel's instructions named a Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Peace Prize, the members of whom were appointed shortly after the will was approved in April 1897. Soon thereafter, the other prize-awarding organizations were designated or established. These were Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June.[26] The Nobel Foundation reached an agreement on guidelines for how the prizes should be awarded; and, in 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II.[21] In 1905, the personal union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved.\\r\\nIn the 19th century the Nobel family who were known for their innovations to the oil industry in Azerbaijan was the leading representative of foreign capital in Baku. Robert Nobel was the first foreign investor in oil sector in Baku. In 1875 R.

Even the Nobel Brothers Petroleum Company\`s symbol was created by taking inspiration from the Fire Temple (Ateshgah) in Surakhani and their oil tankers were given some religious and philosophical names such as Zoroaster, Muhammad, Buddha, Brahma, Socrates, Spinoza and Darwin.\\r\\nAccording to the Alfred Nobel's will and testament read in Stockholm on 30 December 1896, a foundation established by Alfred Nobel would reward those who serve humanity.\\r\\nThe Nobel Prize was funded by Alfred Nobels personal fortune. According to the official sources, Alfred Nobel bequeathed from the shares 94% of his fortune to the Nobel Foundation that now forms the economic base of the Nobel Prize. [28]\\r\\nThe Nobel Foundation was founded as a private organization on 29 June 1900. Its function is to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes.[29] In accordance with Nobel's will, the primary task of the Foundation is to manage the fortune Nobel left. Robert and Ludvig Nobel were involved in the oil business in Azerbaijan, and according to Swedish historian E. Bargengren, who accessed the Nobel family archives, it was this \\"decision to allow withdrawal of Alfred's money from Baku that became the decisive factor that enabled the Nobel Prizes to be established\\".[30] Another important task of the Nobel Foundation is to market the prizes internationally and to oversee informal administration related to the prizes. The Foundation is not involved in the process of selecting the Nobel laureates.[31][32] In many ways, the Nobel Foundation is similar to an investment company, in that it invests Nobel's money to create a solid funding base for the prizes and the administrative activities. The Nobel Foundation is exempt from all taxes in Sweden (since 1946) and from investment taxes in the United States (since 1953).[33] Since the 1980s, the Foundation's investments have become more profitable and as of 31 December 2007, the assets controlled by the Nobel Foundation amounted to 3.628 billion Swedish kronor (c. US$560 million).[34]\\r\\nAccording to the statutes, the Foundation consists of a board of five Swedish or Norwegian citizens, with its seat in Stockholm. The Chairman of the Board is appointed by the Swedish King in Council, with the other four members appointed by the trustees of the prize-awarding institutions. An Executive Director is chosen from among the board members, a Deputy Director is appointed by the King in Council, and two deputies are appointed by the trustees. However, since 1995, all the members of the board have been chosen by the trustees, and the Executive Director and the Deputy Director appointed by the board itself. As well as the board, the Nobel Foundation is made up of the prize-awarding institutions (the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute, the Swedish Academy, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee), the trustees of these institutions, and auditors.[34]\\r\\nOnce the Nobel Foundation and its guidelines were in place, the Nobel Committees began collecting nominations for the inaugural prizes. Subsequently, they sent a list of preliminary candidates to the prize-awarding institutions.\\r\\nThe Nobel Committee's Physics Prize shortlist cited Wilhelm R?ntgen's discovery of X-rays and Philipp Lenard's work on cathode rays. The Academy of Sciences selected R?ntgen for the prize.[35][36] In the last decades of the 19th century, many chemists had made significant contributions. Thus, with the Chemistry Prize, the Academy \\"was chiefly faced with merely deciding the order in which these scientists should be awarded the prize.\\"[37] The Academy received 20 nominations, eleven of them for Jacobus van 't Hoff.[38] Van 't Hoff was awarded the prize for his contributions in chemical thermodynamics.[39][40]\\r\\nThe Swedish Academy chose the poet Sully Prudhomme for the first Nobel Prize in Literature. A group including 42 Swedish writers, artists, and literary critics protested against this decision, having expected Leo Tolstoy to be awarded.[41] Some, including Burton Feldman, have criticised this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet. Feldman's explanation is that most of the Academy members preferred Victorian literature and thus selected a Victorian poet.[42] The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist Emil von Behring. During the 1890s, von Behring developed an antitoxin to treat diphtheria, which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year.[43][44]\\r\\nThe first Nobel Peace Prize went to the Swiss Jean Henri Dunant for his role in founding the International Red Cross Movement and initiating the Geneva Convention, and jointly given to French pacifist Frdric Passy, founder of the Peace League and active with Dunant in the Alliance for Order and Civilization.\\r\\nIn 1938 and 1939, Adolf Hitler's Third Reich forbade three laureates from Germany (Richard Kuhn, Adolf Friedrich Johann Butenandt, and Gerhard Domagk) from accepting their prizes.[45] Each man was later able to receive the diploma and medal.[46] Even though Sweden was officially neutral during the Second World War, the prizes were awarded irregularly. In 1939, the Peace Prize was not awarded. No prize was awarded in any category from 1940ÿ42, due to the occupation of Norway by Germany. In the subsequent year, all prizes were awarded except those for literature and peace.[47]\\r\\nDuring the occupation of Norway, three members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee fled into exile. The remaining members escaped persecution from the Germans when the Nobel Foundation stated that the Committee building in Oslo was Swedish property. Thus it was a safe haven from the German military, which was not at war with Sweden.[48] These members kept the work of the Committee going, but did not award any prizes. In 1944, the Nobel Foundation, together with the three members in exile, made sure that nominations were submitted for the Peace Prize and that the prize could be awarded once again.[45]\\r\\nIn 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Swedish National Bank) celebrated its 300th anniversary by donating a large sum of money to the Nobel Foundation to be used to set up a prize in honor of Nobel. The following year, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded for the first time. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences became responsible for selecting laureates. The first laureates for the Economics Prize were Jan Tinbergen and Ragnar Frisch \\"for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes.\\"[49][50] The Board of the Nobel Foundation decided that after this addition, it would allow no further new prizes.[51]\\r\\nThe award process is similar for all of the Nobel Prizes; the main difference is in who can make nominations for each of them.[52]\\r\\nNomination forms are sent by the Nobel Committee to about 3,000 individuals, usually in September the year before the prizes are awarded. These individuals are generally prominent academics working in a relevant area. Regarding the Peace Prize, inquiries are also sent to governments, former Peace Prize laureates, and current or former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The deadline for the return of the nomination forms is 31 January of the year of the award.[52][53] The Nobel Committee nominates about 300 potential laureates from these forms and additional names.[54] The nominees are not publicly named, nor are they told that they are being considered for the prize. All nomination records for a prize are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize.[55][56]\\r\\nThe Nobel Committee then prepares a report reflecting the advice of experts in the relevant fields. This, along with the list of preliminary candidates, is submitted to the prize-awarding institutions.[57] The institutions meet to choose the laureate or laureates in each field by a majority vote. Their decision, which cannot be appealed, is announced immediately after the vote.[58] A maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected per award. Except for the Peace Prize, which can be awarded to institutions, the awards can only be given to individuals.[59]\\r\\nAlthough posthumous nominations are not presently permitted, individuals who died in the months between their nomination and the decision of the prize committee were originally eligible to receive the prize. This has occurred twice: the 1931 Literature Prize awarded to Erik Axel Karlfeldt, and the 1961 Peace Prize awarded to UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskj?ld. Since 1974, laureates must be thought alive at the time of the October announcement. There has been one laureate, William Vickrey, who in 1996 died after the prize (in Economics) was announced but before it could be presented.[60] On 3 October 2011, the laureates for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine were announced; however, the committee was not aware that one of the laureates, Ralph M. Steinman, had died three days earlier. The committee was debating about Steinman's prize, since the rule is that the prize is not awarded posthumously.[13] The committee later decided that as the decision to award Steinman the prize \\"was made in good faith\\", it would remain unchanged.[61]\\r\\nNobel's will provided for prizes to be awarded in recognition of discoveries made \\"during the preceding year\\". Early on, the awards usually recognised recent discoveries.[62] However, some of those early discoveries were later discredited. For example, Johannes Fibiger was awarded the 1926 Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his purported discovery of a parasite that caused cancer.[63] To avoid repeating this embarrassment, the awards increasingly recognised scientific discoveries that had withstood the test of time.[64][65][66] According to Ralf Pettersson, former chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Physiology or Medicine, \\"the criterion 'the previous year' is interpreted by the Nobel Assembly as the year when the full impact of the discovery has become evident.\\"[65]\\r\\nThe interval between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime body of work rather than a single achievement.[67][68] The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work. For example, 2008 laureate Martti Ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts.[69][70] However, they can also be awarded for specific recent events.[71] For instance, Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations.[72] Similarly Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin, and Shimon Peres received the 1994 award, about a year after they successfully concluded the Oslo Accords.[73]\\r\\nAwards for physics, chemistry, and medicine are typically awarded once the achievement has been widely accepted. Sometimes, this takes decades ÿ for example, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar shared the 1983 Physics Prize for his 1930s work on stellar structure and evolution.[74][75] Not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognised. Some discoveries can never be considered for a prize if their impact is realised after the discoverers have died.[76][77][78]\\r\\nExcept for the Peace Prize, the Nobel Prizes are presented in Stockholm, Sweden, at the annual Prize Award Ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. The recipients' lectures are normally held in the days prior to the award ceremony. The Peace Prize and its recipients' lectures are presented at the annual Prize Award Ceremony in Oslo, Norway, usually on 10 December. The award ceremonies and the associated banquets are typically major international events.[79][80] The Prizes awarded in Sweden's ceremonies' are held at the Stockholm Concert Hall, with the Nobel banquet following immediately at Stockholm City Hall. The Nobel Peace Prize ceremony has been held at the Norwegian Nobel Institute (1905ÿ1946), at the auditorium of the University of Oslo (1947ÿ1989), and at Oslo City Hall (1990ÿpresent).[81]\\r\\nThe highlight of the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm occurs when each Nobel laureate steps forward to receive the prize from the hands of the King of Sweden. In Oslo, the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee presents the Nobel Peace Prize in the presence of the King of Norway.[80][82] At first, King Oscar II did not approve of awarding grand prizes to foreigners. It is said that he changed his mind once his attention had been drawn to the publicity value of the prizes for Sweden.[83]\\r\\nAfter the award ceremony in Sweden, a banquet is held in the Blue Hall at the Stockholm City Hall, which is attended by the Swedish Royal Family and around 1,300 guests.\\r\\nThe Nobel Peace Prize banquet is held in Norway at the Oslo Grand Hotel after the award ceremony. Apart from the laureate, guests include the President of the Storting, the Prime Minister, and, since 2006, the King and Queen of Norway. In total, about 250 guests attend.\\r\\nAccording to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, each laureate is required to give a public lecture on a subject related to the topic of their prize.[84] The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format.[85] These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet), but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize. Some have happened even later. For example, US President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910, after his term in office.[86] The lectures are organized by the same association which selected the laureates.[87]\\r\\nIt was announced on 30 May 2012 that the Nobel Foundation had awarded the contract for the production of the five (Swedish) Nobel Prize medals to Svenska Medalj AB. Formerly, the Nobel Prize medals were minted by Myntverket (the Swedish Mint) from 1902 to 2010. Myntverket, Sweden's oldest company, ceased operations in 2011 after 1,017 years. In 2011, the Mint of Norway, located in Kongsberg, made the medals. The Nobel Prize medals are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation.[88] Each medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse. The medals for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death. Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Peace Prize medal and the medal for the Economics Prize, but with a slightly different design. For instance, the laureate's name is engraved on the rim of the Economics medal.[89] The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the medals for chemistry and physics share the same design.[90]\\r\\nAll medals made before 1980 were struck in 23 carat gold. Since then, they have been struck in 18 carat green gold plated with 24 carat gold. The weight of each medal varies with the value of gold, but averages about 175 grams (0.386?lb) for each medal. The diameter is 66 millimetres (2.6?in) and the thickness varies between 5.2 millimetres (0.20?in) and 2.4 millimetres (0.094?in).[91] Because of the high value of their gold content and tendency to be on public display, Nobel medals are subject to medal theft.[92][93][94] During World War II, the medals of German scientists Max von Laue and James Franck were sent to Copenhagen for safekeeping. When Germany invaded Denmark, Hungarian chemist (and Nobel laureate himself) George de Hevesy dissolved them in aqua regia (nitro-hydrochloric acid), to prevent confiscation by Nazi Germany and to prevent legal problems for the holders. After the war, the gold was recovered from solution, and the medals re-cast.[95]\\r\\nNobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden, or in the case of the peace prize, the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureates that receive them.[89] The diploma contains a picture and text in Swedish which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize. None of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates has ever had a citation on their diplomas.[96][97]\\r\\nThe laureates are given a sum of money when they receive their prizes, in the form of a document confirming the amount awarded.[89] The amount of prize money depends upon how much money the Nobel Foundation can award each year. The purse has increased since the 1980s, when the prize money was 880 000 SEK (c. 2.6 million SEK, US$350?000 today) per prize. In 2009, the monetary award was 10 million SEK (US$1.4 million).[98][99] In June 2012, it was lowered to 8 million SEK.[100] If there are two laureates in a particular category, the award grant is divided equally between the recipients. If there are three, the awarding committee has the option of dividing the grant equally, or awarding one-half to one recipient and one-quarter to each of the others.[101][102][103] It is common for recipients to donate prize money to benefit scientific, cultural, or humanitarian causes.[104][105]\\r\\nAmong other criticisms, the Nobel Committees have been accused of having a political agenda, and of omitting more deserving candidates. They have also been accused of Eurocentrism, especially for the Literature Prize.[106][107][108]\\r\\nAmong the most criticised Nobel Peace Prizes was the one awarded to Henry Kissinger and L ??c Th?. This led to the resignation of two Norwegian Nobel Committee members. [109] Kissinger and Th? were awarded the prize for negotiating a ceasefire between North Vietnam and the United States in January 1973. However, when the award was announced, both sides were still engaging in hostilities.[110] Critics sympathetic to the North announced that Kissinger was not a peace-maker but the opposite, responsible for widening the war. Those hostile to the North and what they considered its deceptive practices during negotiations were deprived of a chance to criticise L ??c Th?, as he declined the award. [55][111]\\r\\nYasser Arafat, Shimon Peres, and Yitzhak Rabin received the Peace Prize in 1994 for their efforts in making peace between Israel and Palestine.[55][112] Immediately after the award was announced, one of the five Norwegian Nobel Committee members denounced Arafat as a terrorist and resigned.[113] Additional misgivings about Arafat were widely expressed in various newspapers.[114]\\r\\nAnother controversial Peace Prize was that awarded to Barack Obama in 2009.[115] Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as President of the United States, but the actual evaluation occurred over the next eight months.[116] Obama himself stated that he did not feel deserving of the award,[117] or worthy of the company it would place him in.[118] Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying that Obama deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.[119]\\r\\nThe award of the 2004 Literature Prize to Elfriede Jelinek drew a protest from a member of the Swedish Academy, Knut Ahnlund. Ahnlund resigned, alleging that the selection of Jelinek had caused \\"irreparable damage to all progressive forces, it has also confused the general view of literature as an art.\\" He alleged that Jelinek's works were \\"a mass of text shovelled together without artistic structure.\\"[120][121] The 2009 Literature Prize to Herta Mller also generated criticism. According to The Washington Post, many US literary critics and professors were ignorant of her work.[122] This made those critics feel the prizes were too Eurocentric.[123]\\r\\nIn 1949, the neurologist Ant܇nio Egas Moniz received the Physiology or Medicine Prize for his development of the prefrontal leucotomy. The previous year, Dr. Walter Freeman had developed a version of the procedure which was faster and easier to carry out. Due in part to the publicity surrounding the original procedure, Freeman's procedure was prescribed without due consideration or regard for modern medical ethics. Endorsed by such influential publications as The New England Journal of Medicine, leucotomy or \\"lobotomy\\" became so popular that about 5,000 lobotomies were performed in the United States in the three years immediately following Moniz's receipt of the Prize.[124][125]\\r\\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee confirmed that Mahatma Gandhi was nominated for the Peace Prize in 1937ÿ39, 1947, and a few days before he was assassinated in January 1948.[126] Later, members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee expressed regret that he was not given the prize.[127] Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006, said, \\"The greatest omission in our 106 year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize. Whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question\\".[128] In 1948, the year of Gandhi's death, the Nobel Committee declined to award a prize on the grounds that \\"there was no suitable living candidate\\" that year.[127][129] Later, when the 14th Dalai Lama was awarded the Peace Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was \\"in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi.\\"[130] Other high-profile individuals with widely recognised contributions to peace have been missed out. Foreign Policy lists Eleanor Roosevelt, Vclav Havel, Ken Saro-Wiwa, Sari Nusseibeh, and Corazon Aquino as people who \\"never won the prize, but should have.\\"[131]\\r\\nIn 1965, UN Secretary General U Thant was informed by the Norwegian Permanent Representative to the UN that he would be awarded that year's prize and asked whether or not he would accept. He consulted staff and later replied that he would. At the same time, Chairman Gunnar Jahn of the Nobel Peace prize committee, lobbied heavily against giving U Thant the prize and the prize was at the last minute awarded to UNICEF. The rest of the committee all wanted the prize to go to U Thant, for his work in defusing the Cuban Missile Crisis, ending the war in the Congo, and his ongoing work to mediate an end to the Vietnam War. The disagreement lasted three years and in 1966 and 1967 no prize was given, with Gunnar Jahn effectively vetoing an award to U Thant.[132][133]\\r\\nThe Literature Prize also has controversial omissions. Adam Kirsch has suggested that many notable writers have missed out on the award for political or extra-literary reasons. The heavy focus on European and Swedish authors has been a subject of criticism.[134][135] The Eurocentric nature of the award was acknowledged by Peter Englund, the 2009 Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, as a problem with the award and was attributed to the tendency for the academy to relate more to European authors.[136] This tendency towards European authors still leaves some European writers on a list of notable writers that have been overlooked for the Literature Prize, including Europe's Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov, J. R. R. Tolkien, mile Zola, Marcel Proust, Vladimir Nabokov, James Joyce, August Strindberg, Simon Vestdijk, Karel ?apek, the New World's Jorge Luis Borges, Ezra Pound, John Updike, Arthur Miller, Mark Twain, and Africa's Chinua Achebe.[137]\\r\\nCandidates can receive multiple nominations the same year. Gaston Ramon received a total of 155[138] nominations in physiology or medicine from 1930 to 1953, the last year with public nomination data for that award as of 2016[update]. He died in 1963 without being awarded. Pierre Paul mile Roux received 115[139] nominations in physiology or medicine, and Arnold Sommerfeld received 84[140] in physics. These are the three most nominated scientists without awards in the data published as of 2016[update].[141] Otto Stern received 79[142] nominations in physics 1925ÿ43 before being awarded in 1943.[143]\\r\\nThe strict rule against awarding a prize to more than three people is also controversial.[144] When a prize is awarded to recognise an achievement by a team of more than three collaborators, one or more will miss out. For example, in 2002, the prize was awarded to Koichi Tanaka and John Fenn for the development of mass spectrometry in protein chemistry, an award that did not recognise the achievements of Franz Hillenkamp and Michael Karas of the Institute for Physical and Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Frankfurt.[145][146] According to one of the nominees for the prize in physics, the three person limit deprived him and two other members of his team of the honor in 2013: the team of Carl Hagen, Gerald Guralnik, and Tom Kibble published a paper in 1964 that gave answers to how the cosmos began, but did not share the 2013 Physics Prize awarded to Peter Higgs and Fran?ois Englert, who had also published papers in 1964 concerning the subject. All five physicists arrived at the same conclusion, albeit from different angles. Hagen contends that an equitable solution is to either abandon the three limit restriction, or expand the time period of recognition for a given achievement to two years.[147]\\r\\nSimilarly, the prohibition of posthumous awards fails to recognise achievements by an individual or collaborator who dies before the prize is awarded. The Economics Prize was not awarded to Fischer Black, who died in 1995, when his co-author Myron Scholes received the honor in 1997 for their landmark work on option pricing along with Robert C. Merton, another pioneer in the development of valuation of stock options. In the announcement of the award that year, the Nobel committee prominently mentioned Black's key role.\\r\\nPolitical subterfuge may also deny proper recognition. Lise Meitner and Fritz Strassmann, who co-discovered nuclear fission along with Otto Hahn, may have been denied a share of Hahn's 1944 Nobel Chemistry Award due to having fled Germany when the Nazis came to power.[148] The Meitner and Strassmann roles in the research was not fully recognised until years later, when they joined Hahn in receiving the 1966 Enrico Fermi Award.\\r\\nAlfred Nobel left his fortune to finance annual prizes to be awarded \\"to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.\\"[149] He stated that the Nobel Prizes in Physics should be given \\"to the person who shall have made the most important 'discovery' or 'invention' within the field of physics.\\" Nobel did not emphasise discoveries, but they have historically been held in higher respect by the Nobel Prize Committee than inventions: 77% of the Physics Prizes have been given to discoveries, compared with only 23% to inventions. Christoph Bartneck and Matthias Rauterberg, in papers published in Nature and Technoetic Arts, have argued this emphasis on discoveries has moved the Nobel Prize away from its original intention of rewarding the greatest contribution to society.[150][151]\\r\\nIn terms of the most prestigious awards in STEM fields, only a small proportion have been awarded to women. Out of 199 laureates in Physics, 169 in Chemistry and 207 in Medicine, there were only two female laureates in physics, four in chemistry and 11 in medicine between 1901 and 2014.[152][153]\\r\\nFour people have received two Nobel Prizes. Marie Curie received the Physics Prize in 1903 for her work on radioactivity and the Chemistry Prize in 1911 for the isolation of pure radium,[154] making her the only person to be awarded a Nobel Prize in two different sciences. Linus Pauling was awarded the 1954 Chemistry Prize for his research into the chemical bond and its application to the structure of complex substances. Pauling was also awarded the Peace Prize in 1962 for his activism against nuclear weapons, making him the only laureate of two unshared prizes. John Bardeen received the Physics Prize twice: in 1956 for the invention of the transistor and in 1972 for the theory of superconductivity.[155] Frederick Sanger received the prize twice in Chemistry: in 1958 for determining the structure of the insulin molecule and in 1980 for inventing a method of determining base sequences in DNA.[156][157]\\r\\nTwo organizations have received the Peace Prize multiple times. The International Committee of the Red Cross received it three times: in 1917 and 1944 for its work during the world wars; and in 1963 during the year of its centenary.[158][159][160] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has been awarded the Peace Prize twice for assisting refugees: in 1954 and 1981.[161]\\r\\nThe Curie family has received the most prizes, with four prizes awarded to five individual laureates. Marie Curie received the prizes in Physics (in 1903) and Chemistry (in 1911). Her husband, Pierre Curie, shared the 1903 Physics prize with her.[162] Their daughter, Irne Joliot-Curie, received the Chemistry Prize in 1935 together with her husband Frdric Joliot-Curie. In addition, the husband of Marie Curie's second daughter, Henry Labouisse, was the director of UNICEF when it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965.[163]\\r\\nAlthough no family matches the Curie family's record, there have been several with two laureates. The husband-and-wife team of Gerty Cori and Carl Ferdinand Cori shared the 1947 Prize in Physiology or Medicine[164] as did the husband-and-wife team of May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser in 2014 (along with John O'Keefe).[165] J. J. Thomson was awarded the Physics Prize in 1906 for showing that electrons are particles. His son, George Paget Thomson, received the same prize in 1937 for showing that they also have the properties of waves.[166] William Henry Bragg and his son, William Lawrence Bragg, shared the Physics Prize in 1915 for inventing the X-ray spectrometer.[167] Niels Bohr was awarded the Physics prize in 1922, as did his son, Aage Bohr, in 1975.[163][168] Manne Siegbahn, who received the Physics Prize in 1924, was the father of Kai Siegbahn, who received the Physics Prize in 1981.[163][169] Hans von Euler-Chelpin, who received the Chemistry Prize in 1929, was the father of Ulf von Euler, who was awarded the Physiology or Medicine Prize in 1970.[163] C. V. Raman was awarded the Physics Prize in 1930 and was the uncle of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who was awarded the same prize in 1983.[170][171] Arthur Kornberg received the Physiology or Medicine Prize in 1959; Kornberg's son, Roger later received the Chemistry Prize in 2006.[172] Jan Tinbergen, who was awarded the first Economics Prize in 1969, was the brother of Nikolaas Tinbergen, who received the 1973 Physiology or Medicine Prize.[163] Alva Myrdal, Peace Prize laureate in 1982, was the wife of Gunnar Myrdal who was awarded the Economics Prize in 1974.[163] Economics laureates Paul Samuelson and Kenneth Arrow were brothers-in-law. Frits Zernike, who was awarded the 1953 Physics Prize, is the great-uncle of 1999 Physics laureate Gerard 't Hooft.[173]\\r\\nBeing a symbol of scientific or literary achievement that's recognisable worldwide, the Nobel Prize is often depicted in fiction. This includes films like The Prize and Nobel Son about fictional Nobel laureates as well as fictionalised accounts of stories surrounding real prizes such as Nobel Chor, a film based on the unsolved theft of Rabindranath Tagore's prize.[174]\\r\\nTwo laureates have voluntarily declined the Nobel Prize. In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre was awarded the Literature Prize but refused, stating, \\"A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honourable form.\\"[175] L ??c Th?, chosen for the 1973 Peace Prize for his role in the Paris Peace Accords, declined, stating that there was no actual peace in Vietnam.[176]\\r\\nDuring the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler hindered Richard Kuhn, Adolf Butenandt, and Gerhard Domagk from accepting their prizes. All of them were awarded their diplomas and gold medals after World War II. In 1958, Boris Pasternak declined his prize for literature due to fear of what the Soviet Union government might do if he travelled to Stockholm to accept his prize. In return, the Swedish Academy refused his refusal, saying \\"this refusal, of course, in no way alters the validity of the award.\\"[176] The Academy announced with regret that the presentation of the Literature Prize could not take place that year, holding it until 1989 when Pasternak's son accepted the prize on his behalf.[177][178] Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, but her children accepted the prize because she had been placed under house arrest in Burma; Suu Kyi delivered her speech two decades later, in 2012.[179] Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 while he and his wife were under house arrest in China as political prisoners, and he was unable to accept the prize in his lifetime.\\r\\nThe memorial symbol \\"Planet of Alfred Nobel\\" was opened in Dnipropetrovsk University of Economics and Law in 2008.

Late-morning and mid-afternoon snacks, called merenda (plural merende), are also often included in this meal structure. Italians also commonly divide a celebratory meal into several different courses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nItalian breakfast (prima colazione) consists of caff latte (hot coffee with milk) or coffee with bread or rolls, butter and jam. A cookie-like rusk hard bread, called fette biscottate, and cookies are commonly eaten. Children drink hot chocolate, plain milk, or hot milk with very little coffee. If breakfast is eaten in a bar (coffee shop), it is composed of cappuccino and cornetto (frothed hot milk with coffee and a pastry) or espresso and pastry. Other products, such as breakfast cereals, fruit salad (macedonia), muesli and yogurt, are becoming increasingly common as part of the meal. However, Italian breakfasts vary by region and by season. In some regions, such as Tuscany and Umbria, in the past, people used to drink red wine (notably Chianti) into which they would dip their biscuits.\\r\\nIt is also very common for Italians to have a quick breakfast snack during the middle of the morning (typically a tramezzino or bread roll).\\r\\nLunch is usually regarded as the most important meal. Most shops close for the pausa pranzo (lunch break) between 13:00 and 15:00. In most schools, children are given a lunch break when they can go home for lunch, or eat at the school cafeteria, or eat a packed lunch. Since the introduction of fast foods, takeaways and frozen and tinned foods, Italians tend to eat less home-made food but fresh food is still quite common and most people buy bread, milk and other foods daily. Many adults still make their own food (e.g., tomato sauce from their own tomatoes) and takeaways are still not very frequent. A typical Italian lunch consists of a first course il primo (pasta, rice or similar), a second-course il secondo (meat or fish) served together with a side dish il contorno (vegetable or salad) and fruit.\\r\\nCommuters and other workers tend to eat less often at home but instead, have a quick meal in a restaurant or pizzeria. Many foreign fast-food chains operate in Italy, especially in big cities and along motorways. Italian fast-food chains, like Autogrill, are also prevalent, often featuring versions of local dishes.\\r\\nMany children and adults have a mid-afternoon snack called merenda, generally consumed after school or in mid-afternoon. This may include a wide variety of foods. Merenda is often similar to breakfast, and might consist of a hot milky drink with bread and honey/jam or brioches; other foods are also eaten, such as yogurt, gelato, granita, fruit salad (or just fruit), nuts, biscuits and cookies, cake, sweets, etc.\\r\\nFor cena, people tend to have the same or more amount of food than for \\"pranzo\\" and usually it consists of the same kind of dishes reported above.\\r\\nA structure of an Italian meal in its full form, usually performed during festivities.[1]","input":"What is the most important meal in italy?"},{"output":"twelve","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, an international football tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA once every four years. It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018.[2] It was the first World Cup to be held in Eastern Europe,[3] and the 11th time that it had been held in Europe. At an estimated cost of over $14.2?billion, it was the most expensive World Cup.[4] It was also the first World Cup to use the video assistant referee (VAR) system.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation qualified automatically. Of the 32 teams, 20 had also appeared in the previous tournament in 2014, while both Iceland and Panama made their first appearances at a FIFA World Cup. A total of 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final took place on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, between France and Croatia. France won the match 4ÿ2 to claim their second World Cup title, marking the fourth consecutive title won by a European team.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.[8] Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from proceedings,[9] and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.[10] During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and the UEFA nations were thus ruled out of the 2022 bid. As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zrich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.[11] Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting. The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third. England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voting results were as follows:[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English Football Association and others raised concerns of bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption from FIFA members. They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said that it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.[14] The 2014 Garcia Report, an internal investigation led by Michael J. Garcia, was withheld from public release by Hans-Joachim Eckert, FIFA's head of adjudication on ethical matters. Eckert instead released a shorter revised summary, and his (and therefore FIFA's) reluctance to publish the full report caused Garcia to resign in protest.[15] Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving of Russia from blame, with Greg Dyke calling for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein calling for a boycott of the World Cup.[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations ÿ the 209 FIFA member associations minus automatically qualified hosts Russia ÿ applied to enter the qualifying process.[18] Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches,[19][20] while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.[21] Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.[22][23] The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC's qualification,[24] and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.[25][26][27][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014. Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.[28] Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments include: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, returning after 1982; and Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002. It is the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) have qualified for the World Cup.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable countries that failed to qualify include four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), three-time runners-up and third placed in 2014 the Netherlands (for the first time since 2002), and four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon, two-time Copa Amrica champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile, 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand, and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions United States (for the first time since 1986). The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, who had both made the previous three tournaments.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe draw was held on 1 December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.[32][33] The 32 teams were drawn into 8 groups of 4, by selecting one team from each of the 4 ranked pots.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017. Pot 1 contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams, pot 2 contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots 3 and 4.[34] This was different from previous draws, when only pot 1 was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations. However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.\\r\\n\\r\\n?Russia (65) (hosts)\\r\\n?Germany (1)\\r\\n?Brazil (2)\\r\\n?Portugal (3)\\r\\n?Argentina (4)\\r\\n?Belgium (5)\\r\\n?Poland (6)\\r\\n?France (7)\\r\\n\\r\\n?Spain (8)\\r\\n?Peru (10)\\r\\n??Switzerland (11)\\r\\n?England (12)\\r\\n?Colombia (13)\\r\\n?Mexico (16)\\r\\n?Uruguay (17)\\r\\n?Croatia (18)\\r\\n\\r\\n?Denmark (19)\\r\\n?Iceland (21)\\r\\n?Costa Rica (22)\\r\\n?Sweden (25)\\r\\n?Tunisia (28)\\r\\n?Egypt (30)\\r\\n?Senegal (32)\\r\\n?Iran (34)\\r\\n\\r\\n?Serbia (38)\\r\\n?Nigeria (41)\\r\\n?Australia (43)\\r\\n?Japan (44)\\r\\n?Morocco (48)\\r\\n?Panama (49)\\r\\n?South Korea (62)\\r\\n?Saudi Arabia (63)\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players but, in February 2018, this was increased to 35.[35] From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) by 4 June. Players in the final squad may be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match and such replacements do not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.[38] On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who solely acted in this capacity in the tournament.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed in 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt,[40] along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai. A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.[41][42] Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated Marwa in a bribery scandal.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after the International Football Association Board's decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the Game, on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.[44][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nVAR operations for all games are operating from a single headquarters in Moscow, which receives live video of the games and are in radio contact with the on-field referees.[46] Systems are in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums' large screens are used for the fans in attendance.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nVAR had a significant impact in several games.[47] On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa's goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision;[48] the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.[49] A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, with this phenomenon being partially attributed to VAR.[50] Overall, the new technology has been both praised and criticised by commentators.[51] FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.[53] Most cities are in European Russia, while Sochi[54] and Yekaterinburg[55] are very close to the Europe-Asia border, to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \\"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\\"[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2011, Russia decreased the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow region was cancelled by the regional government, and also in the capital, Otkrytiye Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012. The number of cities was further reduced to 11 and number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, 3 (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) have been extensively renovated and the other 9 stadiums to be used are brand new; $11.8?billion has been spent on hosting the tournament.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nSepp Blatter stated in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10. He also said, \\"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\\".[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA's inspection committee and its head Chris Unger visited St Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 October 2015, FIFA and the Local Organising Committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums used during the tournament.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the twelve venues used, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium ÿ the two largest stadiums in Russia ÿ were used most, both hosting seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara all hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkrytiye Stadium in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each. Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk all hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of twelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built and renovated for the FIFA World Cup.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt an estimated cost of over $14.2?billion as of June 2018,[4] it is the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20?billion[83] which was later slashed to $10?billion for the preparations of the World Cup, of which half is spent on transport infrastructure.[84] As part of the program for preparation to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program \\"Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure\\" was implemented with a total budget of 352.5?billion rubles, with 170.3?billion coming from the federal budget, 35.1?billion from regional budgets, and 147.1?billion from investors.[85] The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure (117.8?billion rubles).[86] Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in the World Cup host cities. Costs continued to balloon as preparations were underway.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems, modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems.[87] Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received its second runway strip. Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; the city also got two new hotels, Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk (Starwood Hotels) as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.[88] In Samara, new tram lines were laid.[89] Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.[90] Renovation and upgrade of radio-engineering tools for flight operation was completed in the airports of Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi.[87] On 27 March, the Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of Russia reported that all communications within its area of responsibility have been commissioned. The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd. In Yekaterinburg, where four matches are hosted, hosting costs increased to over 7.4?billion rubles, over-running the 5.6?billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteer applications to the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016. The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications,[92] and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.[93] They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the Local Organising Committee based in 15 universities, and in Volunteer Centres in the host cities. Preference, especially in the key areas, was given to those with knowledge of foreign languages and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking between host cities, as well as services such as bus service within them.[95][96][97]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 (without kick-off times, which were confirmed later).[98][99] On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, six kick-off times were adjusted by FIFA.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.[101] The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July. The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.[102][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.[103][104]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo walked out with a child wearing a Russia 2018 shirt. English pop singer Robbie Williams then performed two songs before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet while other performers emerged, dressed in the flags of all 32 teams and carrying a sign bearing the name of each nation. Dancers were also present.[105] Ronaldo returned with the official match ball of the 2018 World Cup which was sent into space with the International Space Station crew in March and came back to Earth in early June.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H). Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin basis, with the top two teams of each group advancing to the knockout stage. Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany (reigning champions) did not advance past the first round. For the first time since 1982, no African team progressed to the second round. For the first time, the fair play criteria came into use, when Japan qualified over Senegal due to having received fewer yellow cards. Only one match, France v Denmark, was goalless. Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll times listed below are local time.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ranking of teams in the group stage is determined as follows:[36][107]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the knockout stages, if a match is level at the end of normal playing time, extra time is played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were 169 goals scored in 64 matches, for an average of 2.64 goals per match.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwelve own goals were scored during the tournament, doubling the record of six set in 1998.[172]\\r\\n6 goals\\r\\n\\r\\n4 goals\\r\\n\\r\\n3 goals\\r\\n\\r\\n2 goals\\r\\n\\r\\n1 goal\\r\\n\\r\\n1 own goal\\r\\n\\r\\nSource: FIFA[173]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978.[174] International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.[175]\\r\\n\\r\\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences:[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament. The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournaments' best.[176] The poll closed on 23 July. The award was sponsored by Hyundai.[177]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs was the case during the 2010 and 2014 editions, FIFA did not release an official All-Star Team, but instead invited users of FIFA.com to elect their Fan Dream Team.[178][179]\\r\\n\\r\\nFIFA also published an alternate team of the tournament based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.[180]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.[181]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme. Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the logo was inspired by \\"Russia's rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation\\", and FIFA President Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the \\"heart and soul\\" of the country.[182] For the branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha (from , Russian?for soul) designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of DSType Foundry in Portugal.[183]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official mascot for the tournament was unveiled 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students. A public vote was used to select from three finalistsa cat, a tiger, and a wolf. The winner, with 53% of approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivakaan anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team. Zabivaka's name is a portmanteau of the Russian words  (\\"hothead\\") and ־Ғ^ (\\"to score\\"), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is \\"charming, confident and social\\".[184]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.[185]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.[186] Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a \\"Fan-ID\\", a special photo identification pass. A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches. Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities. Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, who could revoke these accreditations at any time to \\"ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order\\".[95][96][97]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official match ball of the 2018 World Cup group stage was \\"Telstar 18\\", based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970. It was introduced on 9 November 2017.[187]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the group stage, \\"Telstar Mechta\\" was used for the knockout stage. The word mechta (Russian: ) means dream or ambition. The difference between Telstar 18 and Mechta is the red details on the design.[188]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 April 2018, EA announced a free expansion for FIFA 18 based on the 2018 FIFA World Cup, featuring all 32 participating teams and all 12 stadiums used at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[189]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official song of the tournament was \\"Live It Up\\", with vocals from Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018. Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.[190]\\r\\n\\r\\nThirty-three footballers who are alleged to be part of the steroid program are listed in the McLaren Report.[191] On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.[192] On 22 May 2018 FIFA confirmed that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to assert an anti-doping rule violation.[193] FIFA's medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament; the action was taken to reassure teams that the samples would remain untampered.[194]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe choice of Russia as host has been challenged. Controversial issues have included the level of racism in Russian football,[195][196][197] and discrimination against LGBT people in wider Russian society.[198][199] Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has also caused calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.[200][201] In 2014, FIFA President Sepp Blatter stated that \\"the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work\\".[202]\\r\\n\\r\\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups caused threats from England's FA to boycott the tournament.[203] FIFA appointed Michael J.

Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.[204] Garcia criticised the summary as being \\"materially incomplete\\" with \\"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee.[205][206] The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned in protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \\"lack of leadership\\" and lack of confidence in the independence of Eckert.[207]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that the federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.[208][209] In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \\"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\\".[210][211] Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.[212][213]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.[214] Iceland diplomatically boycotted the World Cup.[215] Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that \\"the west are trying to deny Russia the World Cup\\".[216] The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson's statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as \\"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\\" and \\"unacceptable and unworthy\\" parallel towards Russia, a \\"nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism\\".[217]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British Foreign Office and MPs had repeatedly warned English football fans and \\"people of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent\\" travelling to Russia of \\"racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility\\".[218][219] English football fans who have travelled have said they have received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.[220][221]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the close of the World Cup Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it \\"a resounding public relations success\\" for Putin, adding, \\"The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters.

During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among US viewers (factoring Hispanic and Latino Americans).

It was the first major battle of the American Civil War. The Union's forces were slow in positioning themselves, allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail. Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle. It was a Confederate victory, followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces.\\r\\nJust months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter, the Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, which was expected to bring an early end to the rebellion. Yielding to political pressure, Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction. McDowell's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed by his officers and men; nevertheless, the Confederates, who had been planning to attack the Union left flank, found themselves at an initial disadvantage.\\r\\nConfederate reinforcements under Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. A brigade of Virginians under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the Virginia Military Institute, Thomas J. Jackson, stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, \\"Stonewall\\". The Confederates launched a strong counterattack, and as the Union troops began withdrawing under fire, many panicked and the retreat turned into a rout. McDowell's men frantically ran without order in the direction of Washington, D.C.\\r\\nBoth armies were sobered by the fierce fighting and many casualties, and realized that the war was going to be much longer and bloodier than either had anticipated. The Battle of First Bull Run highlighted many of the problems and deficiencies that were typical of the first year of the war. Units were committed piecemeal, attacks were frontal, infantry failed to protect exposed artillery, tactical intelligence was nil, and neither commander was able to employ his whole force effectively. McDowell, with 35,000 men, was only able to commit about 18,000, and the combined Confederate forces, with about 32,000 men, committed only 18,000.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPres.\\r\\nAbraham Lincoln,\\r\\nUSA\\r\\nPres.\\r\\nJefferson Davis,\\r\\nCSA\\r\\nOn April 15, 1861, the day after South Carolina military forces attacked and captured Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation declaring an insurrection against the laws of the United States. Earlier, South Carolina and seven other Southern states had declared their secession from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America.\\r\\nTo suppress the rebellion and restore Federal law in the Southern states, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers with ninety-day enlistments to augment the existing U.S. Army of about 15,000. He later accepted an additional 40,000 volunteers with three-year enlistments and increased the strength of the U.S. Army to almost 20,000. Lincoln's actions caused four more Southern states, including Virginia, to secede and join the Confederacy, and by 1 June the Confederate capital had been moved from Montgomery, Alabama, to Richmond, Virginia.\\r\\nIn Washington, D.C., as thousands of volunteers rushed to defend the capital, General in Chief Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott laid out his strategy to subdue the rebellious states. He proposed that an army of 80,000 men be organized and sail down the Mississippi River and capture New Orleans. While the Army \\"strangled\\" the Confederacy in the west, the U.S. Navy would blockade Southern ports along the eastern and Gulf coasts. The press ridiculed what they dubbed as Scott's \\"Anaconda Plan\\". Instead, many believed the capture of the Confederate capital at Richmond, only one hundred miles south of Washington, would quickly end the war.[13] By July 1861 thousands of volunteers were camped in and around Washington. Since General Scott was seventy-five years old and physically unable to lead this force, the administration searched for a more suitable field commander.[14]\\r\\nSecretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase championed fellow Ohioan, 42-year-old Maj. Irvin McDowell. Although McDowell was a West Point graduate, his command experience was limited. In fact, he had spent most of his career engaged in various staff duties in the Adjutant General's Office. While stationed in Washington he had become acquainted with Chase, a former Ohio governor and senator. Now, through Chase's influence, McDowell was promoted three grades to brigadier general in the Regular Army and on 27 May was assigned command (by President Abraham Lincoln) of the Department of Northeastern Virginia, which included the military forces in and around Washington (Army of Northeastern Virginia).[15] McDowell immediately began organizing what became known as the Army of Northeastern Virginia, 35,000 men arranged in five divisions. Under public and political pressure to begin offensive operations, McDowell was given very little time to train the newly inducted troops. Units were instructed in the maneuvering of regiments, but they received little or no training at the brigade or division level. He was reassured by President Lincoln, \\"You are green, it is true, but they are green also; you are all green alike.\\"[16] Against his better judgment, McDowell commenced campaigning.\\r\\nDuring the previous year, U.S. Army captain Thomas Jordan set up a pro-Southern spy network in Washington City, including Rose O'Neal Greenhow, a prominent socialite with a wide range of contacts.[17] He provided her with a code for messages.[18] After he left to join the Confederate Army, he gave her control of his network but continued to receive reports from her.[17] On July 9 and 16, 1861, Greenhow passed secret messages to Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard containing critical information regarding military movements for what would be the First Battle of Bull Run, including the plans of Union general McDowell.[18][19]\\r\\nOn July 16, 1861, McDowell departed Washington with the largest field army yet gathered on the North American continent, about 35,000 men (28,452 effectives).[6] McDowell's plan was to move westward in three columns and make a diversionary attack on the Confederate line at Bull Run with two columns, while the third column moved around the Confederates' right flank to the south, cutting the railroad to Richmond and threatening the rear of the Confederate army. He assumed that the Confederates would be forced to abandon Manassas Junction and fall back to the Rappahannock River, the next defensible line in Virginia, which would relieve some of the pressure on the U.S. capital.[20] McDowell had hoped to have his army at Centreville by 17 July, but the troops, unaccustomed to marching, moved in starts and stops. Along the route soldiers often broke ranks to wander off to pick apples or blackberries or to get water, regardless of the orders of their officers to remain in ranks.[21]\\r\\nThe Confederate Army of the Potomac (21,883 effectives)[22] under Beauregard was encamped near Manassas Junction, approximately 25 miles (40?km) from the United States capital. McDowell planned to attack this numerically inferior enemy army. Union Maj. Gen. Robert Patterson's 18,000 men engaged Johnston's force (the Army of the Shenandoah at 8,884 effectives, augmented by Maj. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes's brigade of 1,465[22]) in the Shenandoah Valley, preventing them from reinforcing Beauregard.\\r\\nAfter two days of marching slowly in the sweltering heat, the Union army was allowed to rest in Centreville. McDowell reduced the size of his army to approximately 31,000 by dispatching Brig. Gen. Theodore Runyon with 5,000 troops to protect the army's rear. In the meantime, McDowell searched for a way to outflank Beauregard, who had drawn up his lines along Bull Run. On July 18, the Union commander sent a division under Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler to pass on the Confederate right (southeast) flank. Tyler was drawn into a skirmish at Blackburn's Ford over Bull Run and made no headway. Also on the morning of 18 July Johnston had received a telegram suggesting he go to Beauregard's assistance if possible. Johnston marched out of Winchester about noon, while Stuart's cavalry screened the movement from Patterson. Patterson was completely deceived. One hour after Johnston's departure Patterson telegraphed Washington, \\"I have succeeded, in accordance with the wishes of the General-in-Chief, in keeping General Johnston's force at Winchester.\\"[23]\\r\\nFor the maneuver to be successful McDowell felt he needed to act quickly. He had already begun to hear rumors that Johnston had slipped out of the valley and was headed for Manassas Junction. If the rumors were true, McDowell might soon be facing 34,000 Confederates, instead of 22,000. Another reason for quick action was McDowell's concern that the ninety-day enlistments of many of his regiments were about to expire. \\"In a few days I will lose many thousands of the best of this force\\", he wrote Washington on the eve of battle. In fact, the next morning two units of McDowell's command, their enlistments expiring that day, would turn a deaf ear to McDowell's appeal to stay a few days longer. Instead, to the sounds of battle, they would march back to Washington to be mustered out of service.[24]\\r\\nBecoming more frustrated, McDowell resolved to attack the Confederate left (northwest) flank instead. He planned to attack with Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler's division at the Stone Bridge on the Warrenton Turnpike and send the divisions of Brig. Gens. David Hunter and Samuel P. Heintzelman over Sudley Springs Ford. From here, these divisions could march into the Confederate rear. The brigade of Col. Israel B. Richardson (Tyler's Division) would harass the enemy at Blackburn's Ford, preventing them from thwarting the main attack. Patterson would tie down Johnston in the Shenandoah Valley so that reinforcements could not reach the area. Although McDowell had arrived at a theoretically sound plan, it had a number of flaws: it was one that required synchronized execution of troop movements and attacks, skills that had not been developed in the nascent army; it relied on actions by Patterson that he had already failed to take; finally, McDowell had delayed long enough that Johnston's Valley force was able to board trains at Piedmont Station and rush to Manassas Junction to reinforce Beauregard's men.[25]\\r\\nOn July 19ÿ20, significant reinforcements bolstered the Confederate lines behind Bull Run. Johnston arrived with all of his army, except for the troops of Brig. Gen. Kirby Smith, who were still in transit. Most of the new arrivals were posted in the vicinity of Blackburn's Ford, and Beauregard's plan was to attack from there to the north toward Centreville. Johnston, the senior officer, approved the plan. If both of the armies had been able to execute their plans simultaneously, it would have resulted in a mutual counterclockwise movement as they attacked each other's left flank.[26]\\r\\nMcDowell was getting contradictory information from his intelligence agents, so he called for the balloon Enterprise, which was being demonstrated by Prof. Thaddeus S. C. Lowe in Washington, to perform aerial reconnaissance.\\r\\nBrig. Gen.\\r\\nIrvin McDowell, Army of Northeastern Virginia, (Commanding), USA\\r\\nBrig.

Each brigade contained three to five infantry regiments. An artillery battery was generally assigned to each brigade. The total number of Union troops present at the Battle of First Bull Run was about 35,000, although only about 18,000 were actually engaged. The Union army was organized as follows:\\r\\nWhile McDowell organized the Army of Northeastern Virginia, a smaller Union command was organized and stationed northwest of Washington, near Harper's Ferry.

Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's division, or Army of the Shenandoah (C. S. A.), for June 30, 1861.[7]\\r\\nAggregate present for duty.\\r\\nOn the morning of July 21, 1861, McDowell sent the divisions of Hunter and Heintzelman (about 12,000 men) from Centreville at 2:30?a.m., marching southwest on the Warrenton Turnpike and then turning northwest toward Sudley Springs. Tyler's division (about 8,000) marched directly toward the Stone Bridge. The inexperienced units immediately developed logistical problems. Tyler's division blocked the advance of the main flanking column on the turnpike. The later units found the approach roads to Sudley Springs were inadequate, little more than a cart path in some places, and did not begin fording Bull Run until 9:30?a.m. Tyler's men reached the Stone Bridge around 6 a.m.[28]\\r\\nAt 5:15?a.m., Richardson's brigade fired a few artillery rounds across Mitchell's Ford on the Confederate right, some of which hit Beauregard's headquarters in the Wilmer McLean house as he was eating breakfast, alerting him to the fact that his offensive battle plan had been preempted. Nevertheless, he ordered demonstration attacks north toward the Union left at Centreville. Bungled orders and poor communications prevented their execution. Although he intended for Brig. Gen. Richard S. Ewell to lead the attack, Ewell, at Union Mills Ford, was simply ordered to \\"hold ... in readiness to advance at a moment's notice\\". Brig. Gen. D.R. Jones was supposed to attack in support of Ewell, but found himself moving forward alone. Holmes was also supposed to support, but received no orders at all.[29]\\r\\nAll that stood in the path of the 20,000 Union soldiers converging on the Confederate left flank were Col. Nathan \\"Shanks\\" Evans and his reduced brigade of 1,100 men.[32] Evans had moved some of his men to intercept the direct threat from Tyler at the bridge, but he began to suspect that the weak attacks from the Union brigade of Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck were merely feints. He was informed of the main Union flanking movement through Sudley Springs by Captain Edward Porter Alexander, Beauregard's signal officer, observing from 8 miles (13?km) southwest on Signal Hill. In the first use of wig-wag semaphore signaling in combat, Alexander sent the message \\"Look out for your left, your position is turned.\\"[33] Evans hastily led 900 of his men from their position fronting the Stone Bridge to a new location on the slopes of Matthews Hill, a low rise to the northwest of his previous position.[32]\\r\\nThe Confederate delaying action on Matthews Hill included a spoiling attack launched by Major Roberdeau Wheat's 1st Louisiana Special Battalion, \\"Wheat's Tigers\\". After Wheat's command was thrown back, and Wheat seriously wounded, Evans received reinforcement from two other brigades under Brig. Gen. Barnard Bee and Col. Francis S. Bartow, bringing the force on the flank to 2,800 men.[32] They successfully slowed Hunter's lead brigade (Brig. Gen. Ambrose Burnside) in its attempts to ford Bull Run and advance across Young's Branch, at the northern end of Henry House Hill. One of Tyler's brigade commanders, Col. William Tecumseh Sherman, crossed at an unguarded ford and struck the right flank of the Confederate defenders. This surprise attack, coupled with pressure from Burnside and Maj. George Sykes, collapsed the Confederate line shortly after 11:30?a.m., sending them in a disorderly retreat to Henry House Hill.[34]\\r\\n(Further map details, see: Additional Map 4, Additional Map 5, Additional Map 6 and Additional Map 7.)\\r\\nAs they retreated from their Matthews Hill position, the remainder of Evans's, Bee's, and Bartow's commands received some cover from Capt. John D. Imboden and his battery of four 6-pounder guns, who held off the Union advance while the Confederates attempted to regroup on Henry House Hill. They were met by generals Johnston and Beauregard, who had just arrived from Johnston's headquarters at the M. Lewis Farm, \\"Portici\\".[35] Fortunately for the Confederates, McDowell did not press his advantage and attempt to seize the strategic ground immediately, choosing to bombard the hill with the batteries of Capts. James B. Ricketts (Battery I, 1st U.S. Artillery) and Charles Griffin (Battery D, 5th U.S.) from Dogan's Ridge.[36]\\r\\nBrig. Gen Thomas J. Jackson's Virginia Brigade came up in support of the disorganized Confederates around noon, accompanied by Col. Wade Hampton and his Hampton's Legion, and Col. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry. The Hampton Legion, some 600 men strong, managed to buy Jackson time to construct a defensive line on Henry House Hill by firing repeated volleys at Sherman's advancing brigade. Hampton had purchased about 400 British Enfield rifles to equip the men with, however it is not clear if his troops had them at Bull Run or if the weapons arrived after the battle. If so, they would have been the only foreign-made weapons on the field. The 79th New York was thoroughly decimated by Hampton's musket fire and began to disintegrate. Wade Hampton gestured towards their colonel, James Cameron, and remarked \\"Look at that brave officer trying to lead his men and they won't follow him.\\" Shortly afterwards, Cameron, the brother of US Senator Simon Cameron, was fatally wounded. It has been claimed that Hampton deliberately targeted officers of the 79th New York in revenge for the death of his nephew earlier in the day, although he had in fact been killed by soldiers of the 69th New York.\\r\\nJackson posted his five regiments on the reverse slope of the hill, where they were shielded from direct fire, and was able to assemble 13 guns for the defensive line, which he posted on the crest of the hill; as the guns fired, their recoil moved them down the reverse slope, where they could be safely reloaded.[37] Meanwhile, McDowell ordered the batteries of Ricketts and Griffin to move from Dogan's Ridge to the hill for close infantry support. Their 11 guns engaged in a fierce artillery duel across 300 yards (270?m) against Jackson's 13. Unlike many engagements in the Civil War, here the Confederate artillery had an advantage. The Union pieces were now within range of the Confederate smoothbores and the predominantly rifled pieces on the Union side were not effective weapons at such close ranges, with many shots fired over the head of their targets.[38]\\r\\nOne of the casualties of the artillery fire was Judith Carter Henry, an 85-year-old widow and invalid, who was unable to leave her bedroom in the Henry House. As Ricketts began receiving rifle fire, he concluded that it was coming from the Henry House and turned his guns on the building. A shell that crashed through the bedroom wall tore off one of the widow's feet and inflicted multiple injuries, from which she died later that day.[39]\\r\\n\\"The Enemy are driving us\\", Bee exclaimed to Jackson. Jackson, a former U.S. Army officer and professor at the Virginia Military Institute, is said to have replied, \\"Then, Sir, we will give them the bayonet.\\"[40] Bee exhorted his own troops to re-form by shouting, \\"There is Jackson standing like a stone wall. Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer. Rally behind the Virginians.\\"[41] This exclamation was the source for Jackson's (and his brigade's) nickname, \\"Stonewall\\". Bee was shot through the stomach shortly after speaking and died the next day, thus it is unclear exactly what he meant, moreover none of his subordinates wrote reports of the battle. Col. States Rights Gist, serving as Bee's aide-de-camp, took command of the brigade. Major Burnett Rhett, chief of staff to General Johnston, claimed that Bee was angry at Jackson's failure to come immediately to the relief of Bee's and Bartow's brigades while they were under heavy pressure. Those who subscribe to this opinion believe that Bee's statement was meant to be pejorative: \\"Look at Jackson standing there like a stone wall!\\"[42]\\r\\nArtillery commander Griffin decided to move two of his guns to the southern end of his line, hoping to provide enfilade fire against the Confederates. At approximately 3 p.m., these guns were overrun by the 33rd Virginia, whose men were outfitted in blue uniforms, causing Griffin's commander, Maj. William F. Barry, to mistake them for Union troops and to order Griffin not to fire on them. Close range volleys from the 33rd Virginia and Stuart's cavalry attack against the flank of the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment (Ellsworth's Fire Zouaves), which was supporting the battery, killed many of the gunners and scattered the infantry. Capitalizing on this success, Jackson ordered two regiments to charge Ricketts's guns and they were captured as well. As additional Federal infantry engaged, the guns changed hands several times.[43]\\r\\nThe capture of the Union guns turned the tide of battle. Although McDowell had brought 15 regiments into the fight on the hill, outnumbering the Confederates two to one, no more than two were ever engaged simultaneously. Jackson continued to press his attacks, telling soldiers of the 4th Virginia Infantry, \\"Reserve your fire until they come within 50 yards! Then fire and give them the bayonet! And when you charge, yell like furies!\\" For the first time, Union troops heard the disturbing sound of the Rebel yell. At about 4 p.m., the last Union troops were pushed off Henry House Hill by a charge of two regiments from Col. Philip St. George Cocke's brigade.[44]\\r\\nTo the west, Chinn Ridge had been occupied by Col. Oliver Otis Howard's brigade from Heintzelman's division. Also at 4 p.m., two Confederate brigades-Col. Jubal Early's, which had moved from the Confederate right, and Brig. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith's (commanded by Col. Arnold Elzey after Smith was wounded), which had just arrived from the Shenandoah Valleycrushed Howard's brigade. Beauregard ordered his entire line forward. At 5 p.m. everywhere McDowell's army was disintegrating. Thousands, in large and small groups or as individuals, began to leave the battlefield and head for Centreville. McDowell rode around the field trying to rally regiments and groups of soldiers, but most had had enough. Unable to stop the mass exodus, McDowell gave orders for Porter's regular infantry battalion, near the intersection of the turnpike and Manassas-Sudley Road, to act as a rear guard as his army withdrew. The unit briefly held the crossroads, then retreated eastward with the rest of the army.[45] McDowell's force crumbled and began to retreat.[46]\\r\\n(Further map details, see: Additional Map 8, Additional Map 9, Additional Map 10, Additional Map 11 and Additional Map 12.)\\r\\nThe retreat was relatively orderly up to the Bull Run crossings, but it was poorly managed by the Union officers. A Union wagon was overturned by artillery fire on a bridge spanning Cub Run Creek and incited panic in McDowell's force. As the soldiers streamed uncontrollably toward Centreville, discarding their arms and equipment, McDowell ordered Col. Dixon S. Miles's division to act as a rear guard, but it was impossible to rally the army short of Washington. In the disorder that followed, hundreds of Union troops were taken prisoner. Wagons and artillery were abandoned, including the 30-pounder Parrott rifle, which had opened the battle with such fanfare. Expecting an easy Union victory, the wealthy elite of nearby Washington, including congressmen and their families, had come to picnic and watch the battle. When the Union army was driven back in a running disorder, the roads back to Washington were blocked by panicked civilians attempting to flee in their carriages.[47]\\r\\nSince their combined army had been left highly disorganized as well, Beauregard and Johnston did not fully press their advantage, despite urging from Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who had arrived on the battlefield to see the Union soldiers retreating. An attempt by Johnston to intercept the Union troops from his right flank, using the brigades of Brig. Gens. Milledge L. Bonham and James Longstreet, was a failure. The two commanders squabbled with each other and when Bonham's men received some artillery fire from the Union rear guard, and found that Richardson's brigade blocked the road to Centreville, he called off the pursuit.[48]\\r\\nIn Washington President Lincoln and members of the cabinet waited for news of a Union victory. Instead, a telegram arrived stating \\"General McDowell's army in full retreat through Centreville. The day is lost. Save Washington and the remnants of this army.\\" The tidings were happier in the Confederate capital. From the battlefield President Davis telegraphed Richmond, \\"We have won a glorious but dear-bought victory. Night closed on the enemy in full flight and closely pursued.\\"[49]\\r\\nFirst Bull Run was a clash between relatively large, ill-trained bodies of recruits, led by inexperienced officers. Neither army commander was able to deploy his forces effectively; although nearly 60,000 men were present at the battle, only 18,000 had actually been engaged. Although McDowell had been active on the battlefield, he had expended most of his energy maneuvering nearby regiments and brigades, instead of controlling and coordinating the movements of his army as a whole. Other factors contributed to McDowell's defeat: Patterson's failure to hold Johnston in the valley; McDowell's two-day delay at Centreville; allowing Tyler's division to lead the march on 21 July thus delaying the flanking divisions of Hunter and Heintzelman; and the 2 1/2-hour delay after the Union victory on Matthews' Hill, which allowed the Confederates to bring up reinforcements and establish a defensive position on Henry Hill. On Henry Hill Beauregard had also limited his control to the regimental level, generally allowing the battle to continue on its own and only reacting to Union moves. Johnston's decision to transport his infantry to the battlefield by rail played a major role in the Confederate victory. Although the trains were slow and a lack of sufficient cars did not allow the transport of large numbers of troops at one time, almost all of his army arrived in time to participate in the battle. After reaching Manassas Junction, Johnston had relinquished command of the battlefield to Beauregard, but his forwarding of reinforcements to the scene of fighting was decisive.[50] Jackson and Bee's brigades had done the largest share of fighting in the battle; Jackson's brigade had fought almost alone for four hours and sustained over 50% casualties.\\r\\nBull Run was the largest and bloodiest battle in United States history up to that point. Union casualties were 460 killed, 1,124 wounded, and 1,312 missing or captured; Confederate casualties were 387 killed, 1,582 wounded, and 13 missing.[51] Among the Union dead was Col. James Cameron, brother of President Lincoln's first Secretary of War, Simon Cameron.[52] Among the Confederate casualties was Col. Francis S. Bartow, who was the first Confederate brigade commander to be killed in the Civil War. General Bee was mortally wounded and died the following day.[53] Compared to later battles, casualties at First Bull Run had not been especially heavy. Both Union and Confederate killed, wounded, and missing were a little over one thousand seven hundred each.[54] Two Confederate brigade commanders, Jackson and Edmund Kirby-Smith, were wounded in the battle. No Union officers above the regimental level were killed; two division commanders (Samuel Heintzelman and David Hunter), and one brigade commander (Orlando Willcox) were wounded.\\r\\nUnion casualties at the battle of Bull Run, July 21, 1861.[8]\\r\\nUnion artillery lost in the battle of Bull Run, July 21, 1861.[55]\\r\\nConfederate casualties at the battle of Bull Run, July 21, 1861.[10]\\r\\n-- Union diarist George Templeton Strong[56]\\r\\n-- David Detzer, Donnybrook[57]\\r\\n-- James A. Rawley, Turning Points of the Civil War[58]\\r\\nUnion forces and civilians alike feared that Confederate forces would advance on Washington, D.C., with very little standing in their way. On July 24, Prof. Thaddeus S. C. Lowe ascended in the balloon Enterprise to observe the Confederates moving in and about Manassas Junction and Fairfax. He saw no evidence of massing Confederate forces, but was forced to land in Confederate territory. It was overnight before he was rescued and could report to headquarters. He reported that his observations \\"restored confidence\\" to the Union commanders.[59]\\r\\nThe Northern public was shocked at the unexpected defeat of their army when an easy victory had been widely anticipated. Both sides quickly came to realize the war would be longer and more brutal than they had imagined. On July 22 President Lincoln signed a bill that provided for the enlistment of another 500,000 men for up to three years of service.[60] On July 25, eleven thousand Pennsylvanians who had earlier been rejected by the U.S. Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, for federal service in either Patterson's or McDowell's command arrived in Washington, D.C., and were finally accepted.[61]\\r\\nThree months after First Bull Run Union forces suffered another, smaller defeat at the Battle of Ball's Bluff, near Leesburg, Virginia. The perceived military incompetence at First Bull Run and Ball's Bluff led to the establishment of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, a congressional body created to investigate Northern military affairs. Concerning the Battle of First Bull Run, the committee listened to testimony from a variety of witnesses connected with McDowell's army. Although the committee's report concluded that the principal cause of defeat was Patterson's failure to prevent Johnston from reinforcing Beauregard, Patterson's enlistment had expired a few days after the battle, and he was no longer in the service. The Northern public clamored for another scapegoat, and McDowell bore the chief blame. On 25 July 1861, he was relieved of army command and replaced by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, who would soon be named general-in-chief of all the Union armies. McDowell was also present to bear significant blame for the defeat of Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia by Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia thirteen months later, at the Second Battle of Bull Run.[54][62]\\r\\nThe reaction in the Confederacy was more muted. There was little public celebration as the Southerners realized that despite their victory, the greater battles that would inevitably come would mean greater losses for their side as well.[63] Once the euphoria of victory had worn off, Jefferson Davis called for 400,000 additional volunteers.[54]\\r\\nBeauregard was considered the Confederate hero of the battle and was promoted that day by C.S. President Davis to full general in the Confederate army.[64] Stonewall Jackson, arguably the most important tactical contributor to the victory, received no special recognition, but would later achieve glory for his 1862 Valley Campaign. Privately, Davis credited Greenhow with ensuring Confederate victory.[18] Jordan sent a telegram to Greenhow: \\"Our President and our General direct me to thank you. We rely upon you for further information. The Confederacy owes you a debt. (Signed) JORDAN, Adjutant-General.\\"[65]\\r\\nThe battle also had long-term psychological consequences. The decisive victory led to a degree of over-confidence on the part of Confederate forces, while prompting a determined organizational effort on the part of the Union. In hindsight commentators on both sides agreed that the one-sided outcome \\"proved the greatest misfortune that would have befallen the Confederacy\\". Although modern historians generally agree with this interpretation, James M. McPherson has argued that the esprit de corps attained by Confederate troops on the heels of their victory, together with a new sense of insecurity felt by northern commanders, also gave the Confederacy a military edge in the following months.[66]\\r\\nThe name of the battle has caused controversy since 1861. The Union Army frequently named battles after significant rivers and creeks that played a role in the fighting; the Confederates generally used the names of nearby towns or farms. The U.S. National Park Service uses the Confederate name for its national battlefield park, but the Union name (Bull Run) also has widespread currency in popular literature.[67]\\r\\nBattlefield confusion between the battle flags, especially the similarity of the Confederacy's \\"Stars and Bars\\" and the Union's \\"Stars and Stripes\\" when fluttering, led to the adoption of the Confederate Battle Flag, which eventually became the most popular symbol of the Confederacy and the South in general.[68]\\r\\nFirst Bull Run demonstrated that the war would not be won by one grand battle, and both sides began preparing for a long and bloody conflict. The battle also showed the need for adequately trained and experienced officers and men. One year later many of the same soldiers who had fought at First Bull Run, now combat veterans, would have an opportunity to test their skills on the same battlefield at the Second Battle of Bull Run/Manassas.[54]\\r\\nMap 1:\\r\\nSituation Mid-July 1861\\r\\nMap 2:\\r\\nBeauregard's defensive situation\\r\\n(Mid-July 1861)\\r\\nMap 3:\\r\\nSituation at 05:30-06:00\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 4:\\r\\nSituation at 10:30-11:00\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 5:\\r\\nSituation at 11:00-11:30\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 6:\\r\\nSituation at 12:00-12:30\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 7:\\r\\nSituation at 13:00\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 8:\\r\\nSituation at 14:30-15:00\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 9:\\r\\nSituation at 15:00\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 10:\\r\\nSituation at 15:30\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 11:\\r\\nSituation at 16:00\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 12:\\r\\nSituation at 16:30-17:30\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nThe First Battle of Bull Run is mentioned in the novel Gods and Generals, but is depicted more fully in its film adaptation. The battle forms the climax of the film Class of '61. It also appears in the first episode of the second season of the mini-series North and South, in the second episode of the first season of the mini-series How the West Was Won and in the first episode of the mini-series The Blue and the Gray. Manassas (1999) is the first volume in the James Reasoner Civil War Series of historical novels. The battle is described in Rebel (1993), the first volume of Bernard Cornwell's The Starbuck Chronicles series of historical novels. The battle is described from the viewpoint of a Union infantryman in Upton Sinclair's novella Manassas, which also depicts the political turmoil leading up to the Civil War. The battle is also depicted in John Jakes's The Titans, the fifth novel in The Kent Family Chronicles, a series that explores the fictional Confederate cavalry officer Gideon Kent. The battle is the subject of the Johnny Horton song, \\"Battle of Bull Run\\". Shaman, second in the Cole family trilogy by Noah Gordon, includes an account of the battle. The battle is also depicted in the song \\"Yankee Bayonet\\" by indie-folk band The Decemberists. In Murder at 1600, Detective Harlan Regis (Wesley Snipes) has built a plan-relief of the battle which plays a certain role in the plot.\\r\\nPrince William County staged special events commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Civil War through 2011. Manassas was named the No. 1 tourist destination in the United States for 2011 by the American Bus Association for its efforts in highlighting the historical impact of the Civil War. The cornerstone of the commemoration event featured a reenactment of the battle on July 23ÿ24, 2011. Throughout the year, there were tours of the Manassas battlefield and other battlefields in the county and a number of related events and activities.[69]\\r\\nThe City of Manassas commemorated the 150th anniversary of the battle July 21ÿ24, 2011.[70]\\r\\nPart of the site of the battle is now Manassas National Battlefield Park. Located north of Manassas, in Prince William County, Virginia, it preserves the site of two major American Civil War battles: the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861, and the Second Battle of Bull Run which was fought between August 28 and August 30, 1862 (also known as the First Battle of Manassas and the Second Battle of Manassas, respectively). The peaceful Virginia countryside bore witness to clashes between the armies of the North (Union) and the South (Confederacy), and it was there that Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson acquired his nickname \\"Stonewall.\\"\\r\\nToday the National Battlefield Park provides the opportunity for visitors to explore the historic terrain where men fought and died more than a century ago. More than 900,000 people visit the battlefield each year. (In comparison, roughly 15 million people annually visit nearby Washington, DC.[71]) As a historic area under the National Park Service, the park was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.","input":"Who was involved in the bull run battle?"},{"output":"December 17, 1992","context":"The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA; Spanish: Tratado de Libre Comercio de Amrica del Norte, TLCAN; French: Accord de libre-change nord-amricain, ALNA) is an agreement signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, creating a trilateral trade bloc in North America. The agreement came into force on January 1, 1994.[4] It superseded the CanadaÿUnited States Free Trade Agreement between the U.S. and Canada.[5]\\r\\nNAFTA has two supplements: the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) and the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC).\\r\\nMost economic analyses indicate that NAFTA has been beneficial to the North American economies and the average citizen,[6][7][8] but harmed a small minority of workers in industries exposed to trade competition.[9][10] Economists hold that withdrawing from NAFTA or renegotiating NAFTA in a way that reestablishes trade barriers will adversely affect the U.S. economy and cost jobs.[11][12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing diplomatic negotiations dating back to 1990 among the three nations, U.S. President George H. W. Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Mexican President Carlos Salinas signed the agreement in their respective capitals on December 17, 1992.[14] The signed agreement was then ratified by each nation's legislative or parliamentary branch.\\r\\nThe earlier CanadaÿUnited States Free Trade Agreement had been controversial and divisive in Canada, and the 1988 Canadian election involved discussion on the issue. In that election, more Canadians voted for anti-free trade parties (the Liberals and the New Democrats) but the split caused more seats in parliament to be won by the pro-free trade Progressive Conservatives (PCs). Mulroney and the PCs had a parliamentary majority and were easily able to pass the 1987 Canada-U.S. FTA and NAFTA bills. However, he was replaced as Conservative leader and prime minister by Kim Campbell. Campbell led the PC party into the 1993 election where they were decimated by the Liberal Party under Jean Chrtien, who had campaigned on a promise to renegotiate or abrogate NAFTA; however, Chrtien subsequently negotiated two supplemental agreements with the new U.S. president. In the U.S., Bush, who had worked to \\"fast track\\" the signing prior to the end of his term, ran out of time and had to pass the required ratification and signing of the implementation law to incoming president Bill Clinton. Prior to sending it to the United States Senate Clinton added two side agreements, The North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC) and the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC), to protect workers and the environment, plus allay the concerns of many House members. It also required U.S. partners to adhere to environmental practices and regulations similar to its own.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter much consideration and emotional discussion, the House of Representatives passed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act on November 17, 1993, 234ÿ200. The agreement's supporters included 132 Republicans and 102 Democrats. The bill passed the Senate on November 20, 1993, 61ÿ38.[15] Senate supporters were 34 Republicans and 27 Democrats. Clinton signed it into law on December 8, 1993; the agreement went into effect on January 1, 1994.[16][17] Clinton, while signing the NAFTA bill, stated that \\"NAFTA means jobs. American jobs, and good-paying American jobs. If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't support this agreement.\\"[18]\\r\\nThe goal of NAFTA was to eliminate barriers to trade and investment between the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The implementation of NAFTA on January 1, 1994 brought the immediate elimination of tariffs on more than one-half of Mexico's exports to the U.S. and more than one-third of U.S. exports to Mexico. Within 10 years of the implementation of the agreement, all U.S.-Mexico tariffs would be eliminated except for some U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico that were to be phased out within 15 years.[19] Most U.S.-Canada trade was already duty-free. NAFTA also sought to eliminate non-tariff trade barriers and to protect the intellectual property rights on traded products.\\r\\nChapter 52 provides a procedure for the international resolution of disputes over the application and interpretation of NAFTA. It was modelled after Chapter 69 of the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement.[20] The roster of NAFTA adjudicators includes many retired judges, such as Alice Desjardins, John Maxwell Evans, Constance Hunt, John Richard, Arlin M. Adams, Susan Getzendanner, George C. Pratt, Charles B. Renfrew and Sandra Day O'Connor.\\r\\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act made some changes to the copyright law of the United States, foreshadowing the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994 by restoring copyright (within the NAFTA nations) on certain motion pictures which had entered the public domain.[21][22]\\r\\nSecuring U.S. congressional approval for NAFTA would have been impossible without addressing public concerns about NAFTAs environmental impact.[23] The Clinton administration negotiated a side agreement on the environment with Canada and Mexico, the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC), which led to the creation of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) in 1994. To alleviate concerns that NAFTA, the first regional trade agreement between a developing country and two developed countries, would have negative environmental impacts, the CEC was given a mandate to conduct ongoing ex post environmental assessment of NAFTA.[24]\\r\\nIn response to this mandate, the CEC created a framework for conducting environmental analysis of NAFTA, one of the first ex post frameworks for the environmental assessment of trade liberalization. The framework was designed to produce a focused and systematic body of evidence with respect to the initial hypotheses about NAFTA and the environment, such as the concern that NAFTA would create a \\"race to the bottom\\" in environmental regulation among the three countries, or the hope that NAFTA would pressure governments to increase their environmental protection mechanisms.[25] The CEC has held four symposia using this framework to evaluate the environmental impacts of NAFTA and has commissioned 47 papers on this subject. In keeping with the CECs overall strategy of transparency and public involvement, the CEC commissioned these papers from leading independent experts.[26]\\r\\nFrom the earliest negotiation, agriculture was (and still remains) a controversial topic within NAFTA, as it has been with almost all free trade agreements that have been signed within the WTO framework. Agriculture is the only section that was not negotiated trilaterally; instead, three separate agreements were signed between each pair of parties. The CanadaÿU.S. agreement contains significant restrictions and tariff quotas on agricultural products (mainly sugar, dairy, and poultry products), whereas the MexicoÿU.S. pact allows for a wider liberalization within a framework of phase-out periods (it was the first NorthÿSouth FTA on agriculture to be signed).\\r\\nNAFTA established the CANAMEX Corridor for road transport between Canada and Mexico, also proposed for use by rail, pipeline, and fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure. This became a High Priority Corridor under the U.S. Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.\\r\\nLike Mexico and the U.S., Canada received a modest positive economic benefit as measured by GDP. Many feared declines failed to materialize, and some industries, like the furniture industry, which were expected to suffer, grew instead.[citation needed] Canadian manufacturing employment held steady despite an international downward trend in developed countries.[citation needed] One of NAFTA's biggest economic effects on U.S.-Canada trade has been to boost bilateral agricultural flows.[27] In the year 2008 alone, Canada exports to the United States and Mexico were at $381.3 billion, and imports from NAFTA were at $245.1 billion.[28]\\r\\nA 2007 study found that NAFTA has \\"almost zero welfare impact on member and nonmember countries\\".[29] A 2015 study found that Canada's welfare decreased by 0.06% as a result of the NAFTA tariff reductions, and that Canada's intra-bloc trade increased by 11%.[30]\\r\\nMaquiladoras (Mexican assembly plants that take in imported components and produce goods for export) have become the landmark of trade in Mexico. These are plants that moved to this region from the United States, hence the debate over the loss of American jobs. Income in the maquiladora sector has increased 15.5% since the implementation of NAFTA in 1994.[31] Other sectors now benefit from the free trade agreement, and the share of exports from non-border states has increased in the last five years while the share of exports from maquiladora-border states has decreased. This has allowed for the rapid growth of non-border metropolitan areas, such as Toluca, Le܇n and Puebla; all three larger in population than Tijuana, Ciudad Jurez, and Reynosa.\\r\\nThe overall effect of the MexicoÿU.S. agricultural agreement is a matter of dispute. Mexico did not invest in the infrastructure necessary for competition, such as efficient rail roads and highways, which resulted in more difficult living conditions for the country's poor. Mexico's agricultural exports increased 9.4 percent annually between 1994 and 2001, while imports increased by only 6.9 percent a year during the same period.[32]\\r\\nOne of the most affected agricultural sectors is the meat industry. Mexico has gone from a small player in the pre-1994 U.S. export market to the second largest importer of U.S. agricultural products in 2004, and NAFTA may be credited as a major catalyst for this change. The allowance of free trade removed the hurdles that impeded business between the two countries. As a result, Mexico has provided a growing market for meat for the U.S., leading to an increase in sales and profits for the U.S. meat industry. This coincides with a noticeable increase in Mexican per capita GDP that has created large changes in meat consumption patterns, implying that Mexicans can now afford to buy more meat and thus per capita meat consumption has grown.[33]\\r\\nProduction of corn in Mexico has increased since NAFTA's implementation. However, internal corn demand has increased beyond Mexico's sufficiency, and imports have become necessary, far beyond the quotas Mexico had originally negotiated.[34] Zahniser & Coyle have also pointed out that corn prices in Mexico, adjusted for international prices, have drastically decreased, yet through a program of subsidies expanded by former president Vicente Fox, production has remained stable since 2000.[35] Reduction in agricultural subsidies in the developed world, especially corn subsidies, has been suggested as a way to reduce harms to Mexican farmers.[36]\\r\\nA 2001 Journal of Economic Perspectives review of the existing literature found that NAFTA was a net benefit to Mexico.[8] By the year 2003, 80% of the commerce in Mexico was executed only with the U.S. The commercial sales surplus under NAFTA with the U.S., combined with the deficit on the rest of the world, created a dependency in Mexico's exports. These effects were evident in 2001ÿ2003; the result of that recession was either a low rate or a negative rate in Mexico's exports.[37]\\r\\nA 2015 study found that Mexico's welfare increased by 1.31% as a result of the NAFTA tariff reductions, and that Mexico's intra-bloc trade increased by 118%.[30] Inequality and poverty fell in the most globalization-affected regions of Mexico over the introduction of NAFTA.[38] 2013 and 2015 studies show that Mexican small farmers benefitted more on NAFTA than large-scale farmers.[39][40]\\r\\nNAFTA has also been credited with the rise of the Mexican middle class. A Tufts University study found that NAFTA lowered the average cost of basic necessities in Mexico by up to 50%.[41] This price reduction has increased cash-on-hand for many Mexican families, allowing Mexico to graduate more engineers than Germany each year.[42]\\r\\nThe growth from new orders of products indicates that there was an increase in the demand from manufacture products. This increased demand resulted in an expansion of the production and a higher employment rate to satisfy the increment in the demand. The growth in the maquiladora industry and in the manufactory industry has been of 4.7% by August, 2016.[43] Three quarters of the outer market of importation and exportations comes from the U.S.\\r\\nTufts University political scientist Daniel W. Drezner has argued that NAFTA made it easier for Mexico to transform to a real democracy and become a country that views itself as North American. This has boosted cooperation between the United States and Mexico.[44]\\r\\nEconomists consider NAFTA to have been beneficial for the United States.[45][46] In a 2012 survey of leading economists, 95% supported the notion that on average, U.S. citizens benefited on NAFTA.[7] A 2001 Journal of Economic Perspectives review found that NAFTA was a net benefit to the United States.[8] A 2015 study found that US welfare increased by 0.08% as a result of the NAFTA tariff reductions, and that US intra-bloc trade increased by 41%.[30]\\r\\nIn 2015, the Congressional Research Service concluded that the \\"net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP. However, there were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment among their economies.\\" The report also estimated NAFTA added $80 billion to the US economy in the years since NAFTA's implementation, equivalent to a 0.5% increase in US GDP.[47]\\r\\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce credits NAFTA with increasing U.S. trade in goods and services with Canada and Mexico from $337 billion in 1993 to $1.2 trillion in 2011, while the AFL-CIO blames the agreement for sending 700,000 American manufacturing jobs to Mexico over that time.[48]\\r\\nUniversity of California, San Diego, economics professor Gordon Hanson has said that NAFTA helped the U.S. compete against China and therefore saved U.S. jobs.[49][50] While some jobs were lost to Mexico as a result of NAFTA, considerably more would have been lost to China if not for NAFTA.[49][50]\\r\\nThe U.S. had a trade surplus with NAFTA countries of $28.3 billion for services in 2009 and a trade deficit of $94.6 billion (36.4% annual increase) for goods in 2010. This trade deficit accounted for 26.8 percent of all U.S. goods trade deficit.[51]\\r\\nIn a study published in the August 2008 issue of the American Journal of Agricultural Economics, NAFTA has increased U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico and Canada even though most of this increase occurred a decade after its ratification. The study focused on the effects that gradual \\"phase-in\\" periods in regional trade agreements, including NAFTA, have on trade flows. Most of the increase in members agricultural trade, which was only recently brought under the purview of the World Trade Organization, was due to very high trade barriers before NAFTA or other regional trade agreements.[52]\\r\\nThe U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in NAFTA countries (stock) was $327.5 billion in 2009 (latest data available), up 8.8% from 2008.[51] The U.S. direct investment in NAFTA countries is in nonbank holding companies, and in the manufacturing, finance/insurance, and mining sectors.[51] The foreign direct investment of Canada and Mexico in the United States (stock) was $237.2 billion in 2009 (the latest data available), up 16.5% from 2008.[51][53]\\r\\nFor impacts specific to the United States, see NAFTA's effect on United States employment.\\r\\nMany American small businesses depend on exporting their products to Canada or Mexico under NAFTA. According to the U.S. Trade Representative, this trade supports over 140,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in the US.[54]\\r\\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, California, Texas, Michigan and other states with high concentrations of manufacturing jobs were most affected by job loss due to NAFTA.[55] EPI economist Robert Scott estimates some 682,900 U.S. jobs have been \\"lost or displaced\\" as a result of the trade agreement.[56] However, other studies have found that NAFTA only had a modest impact on manufacturing employment, and that automation explains away 87% of the losses in manufacturing jobs.[57]\\r\\nAccording to University of California, Berkeley professor of economics Brad DeLong, NAFTA had an insignificant impact on US manufacturing.[58] The adverse impact on manufacturing has been way exaggerated in US political discourse according to DeLong,[58] which is something that Harvard economist Dani Rodrik agrees with.[59]\\r\\nAccording to a study in the Journal of International Economics, NAFTA reduced pollution emitted by the US manufacturing sector: \\"On average, nearly two-thirds of the reductions in PM10 and SO2 emissions from the U.S. manufacturing sector between 1994 and 1998 can be attributed to trade liberalization following NAFTA.\\"[60]\\r\\nAccording to the Sierra Club, NAFTA contributed to large-scale, export-oriented farming, which led to the increased use of fossil fuels, pesticides and GMO.[61] NAFTA also contributed to environmentally destructive mining practices in Mexico.[61] It prevented Canada from effectively regulating its tar sands industry, and created new legal avenues for transnational corporations to fight environmental legislation.[61] In some cases, environmental policy was neglected in the wake of trade liberalization; in other cases, NAFTA's measures for investment protection, such as Chapter 11, and measures against non-tariff trade barriers threatened to discourage more vigorous environmental policy.[62] The most serious overall increases in pollution due to NAFTA were found in the base metals sector, the Mexican petroleum sector, and the transportation equipment sector in the United States and Mexico, but not in Canada.[63]\\r\\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, during fiscal year 2006 (i.e., October 2005 through September 2006), 73,880 foreign professionals (64,633 Canadians and 9,247 Mexicans) were admitted into the United States for temporary employment under NAFTA (i.e., in the TN status). Additionally, 17,321 of their family members (13,136 Canadians, 2,904 Mexicans, as well as a number of third-country nationals married to Canadians and Mexicans) entered the U.S. in the treaty national's dependent (TD) status.[64] Because DHS counts the number of the new I-94 arrival records filled at the border, and the TN-1 admission is valid for three years, the number of non-immigrants in TN status present in the U.S. at the end of the fiscal year is approximately equal to the number of admissions during the year. (A discrepancy may be caused by some TN entrants leaving the country or changing status before their three-year admission period has expired, while other immigrants admitted earlier may change their status to TN or TD, or extend TN status granted earlier). According to the International Organization for Migration, deaths of migrants have been on the rise worldwide with 5,604 deaths in 2016.[65] An increased number of undocumented farmworkers in California may be due to the initial passing of NAFTA[66]\\r\\nCanadian authorities estimated that, as of December 1, 2006, a total of 24,830 U.S. citizens and 15,219 Mexican citizens were present in Canada as \\"foreign workers\\". These numbers include both entrants under the NAFTA agreement and those who have entered under other provisions of the Canadian immigration law.[67] New entries of foreign workers in 2006 were 16,841 (U.S. citizens) and 13,933 (Mexicans).[68] Nevertheless, the institutional frameworks of the cross-border migrations are weak, so as the institutional roles and responsibilities at both in the national and international levels.[69]\\r\\nIn the second 1992 Presidential Debate, Ross Perot argued:\\r\\nWe have got to stop sending jobs overseas. It's pretty simple: If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers and you can move your factory south of the border, pay a dollar an hour for labor,...have no health carethat's the most expensive single element in making a car have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement, and you don't care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south.\\r\\n? ? ...when [Mexico's] jobs come up from a dollar an hour to six dollars an hour, and ours go down to six dollars an hour, and then it's leveled again. But in the meantime, you've wrecked the country with these kinds of deals.[70]\\r\\nPerot ultimately lost the election, and the winner, Bill Clinton, supported NAFTA, which went into effect on January 1, 1994.\\r\\nIn 1996, the gasoline additive MMT was brought into Canada by Ethyl Corporation, an American company. At the time, the Canadian federal government banned the importation of the additive. The American company brought a claim under NAFTA Chapter 11 seeking US$201 million,[71] from the Canadian government and the Canadian provinces under the Agreement on Internal Trade (\\"AIT\\"). The American company argued that their additive had not been conclusively linked to any health dangers, and that the prohibition was damaging to their company. Following a finding that the ban was a violation of the AIT,[72] the Canadian federal government repealed the ban and settled with the American company for US$13 million.[73] Studies by Health and Welfare Canada (now Health Canada) on the health effects of MMT in fuel found no significant health effects associated with exposure to these exhaust emissions. Other Canadian researchers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency disagree with Health Canada, and cite studies that include possible nerve damage.[74]\\r\\nThe United States and Canada have been arguing for years over the United States' decision to impose a 27% duty on Canadian softwood lumber imports. Canada had filed numerous motions to have the duty eliminated and the collected duties returned to Canada.[75] After the United States lost an appeal from a NAFTA panel, it responded by saying \\"We are, of course, disappointed with the [NAFTA panel's] decision, but it will have no impact on the anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders.\\" (Nick Lifton, spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman)[76] On July 21, 2006, the United States Court of International Trade found that imposition of the duties was contrary to U.S. law.[77][78]\\r\\nOn October 30, 2007, American citizens Marvin and Elaine Gottlieb filed a Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration under NAFTA, claiming thousands of U.S. investors lost a total of $5 billion in the fall-out from the Conservative Government's decision the previous year to change the tax rate on income trusts in the energy sector. On April 29, 2009, a determination was made that this change in tax law was not expropriation.[79]\\r\\nSeveral studies have rejected NAFTA as the force responsible for depressing the incomes of poor corn farmers, citing the trend's existence more than a decade before NAFTA's existence, an increase in maize production after NAFTA went into effect in 1994, and the lack of a measurable impact on the price of Mexican corn due to subsidized corn coming into Mexico from the United States, though they agree that the abolition of U.S. agricultural subsidies would benefit Mexican farmers.[80]\\r\\nThe preparations for NAFTA included cancellation of Article 27 of Mexico's constitution, the cornerstone of Emiliano Zapata's revolution of 1910ÿ1919. Under the historic Article 27, Indian communal landholdings were protected from sale or privatization. However, this barrier to investment was incompatible with NAFTA. With the removal of Article 27, Indian farmers feared the loss of their remaining lands, and also feared cheap imports (substitutes) from the US. Thus, the Zapatistas labelled NAFTA as a \\"death sentence\\" to Indian communities all over Mexico. Then EZLN declared war on the Mexican state on January 1, 1994, the day NAFTA came into force.[81]\\r\\nAnother contentious issue is the impact of the investor state dispute settlement obligations contained in Chapter 11 of the NAFTA.[82] Chapter 11 allows corporations or individuals to sue Mexico, Canada or the United States for compensation when actions taken by those governments (or by those for whom they are responsible at international law, such as provincial, state, or municipal governments) violate the international law.[83]\\r\\nThis chapter has been criticized by groups in the U.S.,[84] Mexico,[85] and Canada[86] for a variety of reasons, including not taking into account important social and environmental[87] considerations. In Canada, several groups, including the Council of Canadians, challenged the constitutionality of Chapter 11. They lost at the trial level[88] and have subsequently appealed.\\r\\nMethanex Corporation, a Canadian corporation, filed a US$970 million suit against the United States, claiming that a California ban on Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), a substance that had found its way into many wells in the state, was hurtful to the corporation's sales of methanol. However, the claim was rejected, and the company was ordered to pay US$3 million to the U.S. government in costs. The tribunal based its decision namely on following reasoning: But as a matter of general international law, a non-discriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with due process and, which affects, inter alios, a foreign investor or investment is not deemed expropriatory and compensable unless specific commitments had been given by the regulating government to the then putative foreign investor contemplating investment that the government would refrain from such regulation.[89]\\r\\nIn another case, Metalclad, an American corporation, was awarded US$15.6 million from Mexico after a Mexican municipality refused a construction permit for the hazardous waste landfill it intended to construct in Guadalczar, San Luis Potos. The construction had already been approved by the federal government with various environmental requirements imposed (see paragraph 48 of the tribunal decision). The NAFTA panel found that the municipality did not have the authority to ban construction on the basis of the environmental concerns.[90]\\r\\nEli Lilly and Company v. Government of Canada[91] is a US$500mn claim for faulty drug patent legislation.[92] Apotex is suing the U.S. for US$520 million because of lost opportunity in a FDA generic drug decision.[92]\\r\\nLone Pine Resources Inc. v. Government of Canada[93] has filed a US$250 million claim against Canada, whom it accuses of \\"arbitrary, capricious and illegal\\" behaviour,[94] because Quebec aims to prevent fracking exploration under the St. Lawrence Seaway.[92] Milos Barutciski, the lawyer who represents Lone Pine, has decried attempts to portray his client as \\"another rapacious multinational challenging governments ability to regulate for health, safety and the environment\\". Lone Pine Resources is incorporated in Delaware but headquartered in Calgary,[94] and had an initial public offering of stock on the NYSE on May 25, 2011, which offered 15 million shares each for $13 and raised US$195 million.[95] Barutciski acknowledged \\"that NAFTA and other investor-protection treaties create an anomaly in that Canadian companies that have also seen their permits rescinded by the very same Quebec legislation, which expressly forbids the paying of compensation, do not have the right pursue a NAFTA claim,\\" and that winning \\"compensation in Canadian courts for domestic companies in this case would be more difficult since the Constitution puts property rights in provincial hands.\\"[94] A treaty with China would extend similar rights to Chinese investors, including SOEs.[94]\\r\\nAlso contentious is NAFTA's Chapter 19, which subjects antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) determinations to binational panel review instead of, or in addition to, conventional judicial review.[96] For example, in the United States, review of agency decisions imposing antidumping and countervailing duties are normally heard before the U.S. Court of International Trade, an Article III court. NAFTA parties, however, have the option of appealing the decisions to binational panels composed of five citizens from the two relevant NAFTA countries.[96] The panelists are generally lawyers experienced in international trade law. Since the NAFTA does not include substantive provisions concerning AD/CVD, the panel is charged with determining whether final agency determinations involving AD/CVD conform with the country's domestic law. Chapter 19 can be considered as somewhat of an anomaly in international dispute settlement since it does not apply international law, but requires a panel composed of individuals from many countries to re-examine the application of one country's domestic law.\\r\\nA Chapter 19 panel is expected to examine whether the agency's determination is supported by \\"substantial evidence.\\" This standard assumes significant deference to the domestic agency. Some of the most controversial trade disputes in recent years, such as the U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute, have been litigated before Chapter 19 panels.\\r\\nDecisions by Chapter 19 panels can be challenged before a NAFTA extraordinary challenge committee. However, an extraordinary challenge committee does not function as an ordinary appeal.[96] Under NAFTA, it will only vacate or remand a decision if the decision involves a significant and material error that threatens the integrity of the NAFTA dispute settlement system. Since January 2006, no NAFTA party has successfully challenged a Chapter 19 panel's decision before an extraordinary challenge committee.\\r\\nIn a 60 Minutes interview in September 2015, the American businessman Donald Trump, having announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election just three months earlier, condemned the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), calling it \\"the single worst trade deal ever approved in [the United States]\\",[97] going on to say that if elected president, \\"We will either renegotiate it, or we will break it.\\"[98][99] Juan Pablo Casta?܇n, president of the Consejo Coordinador Empresarial, expressed his concerns about the renegotiation and the willingness to focus on the car industry that has brought a lot of success[100] A range of trade experts have said that pulling out of NAFTA as Trump proposed would have a range of unintended consequences for the U.S., including reduced access to the U.S.'s biggest export markets, a reduction in economic growth, and increased prices for gasoline, cars, fruits, and vegetables.[101] Members of the private initiative in Mexico said that in order to eliminate NAFTA there are a lot of laws that have to be adapted by the U.S. Congress and this will also eventually result in legal complaints by the World Trade Organization.[100] The Washington Post fact-checker furthermore noted that a Congressional Research Service review of the academic literature on NAFTA concluded that the \\"net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP.\\"[30]\\r\\nDemocratic candidate Bernie Sanders is also opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which he has called \\"a continuation of other disastrous trade agreements, like NAFTA, CAFTA, and permanent normal trade relations with China.\\" He believes that free trade agreements have led to a loss of American jobs and have depressed American wages. Sanders has said that America needs to rebuild its own manufacturing base by using American factories and supporting well-paying jobs for American labor rather than outsourcing to China and other countries.[102][103][104][105]\\r\\nShortly after being elected, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to begin renegotiating the terms of NAFTA, seeking to resolve issues with trade outlined during his campaign for the presidency. The leaders of Canada and Mexico have indicated their willingness to work with the Trump administration, and although vague on the exact terms that he will be seeking in a renegotiated NAFTA, Trump has threatened to withdraw from it if negotiations fail.[106]\\r\\nIn July 2017, the Trump administration provided a detailed list of changes that it would like to see to NAFTA.[107] The top priority for the administration is the reduction in the United States' trade deficit.[107][108] The administration also called for the elimination of provisions that allowed Canada and Mexico to appeal duties imposed by the United States and limited the ability of the United States to impose import restrictions on Canada and Mexico.[107] The list also voiced concerns about subsidized state-owned enterprises and currency manipulation.[107][109]\\r\\nAccording to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the Trump administration's list \\"is very consistent with the presidents stance on liking trade barriers, liking protectionism.[107] This makes NAFTA in many respects less of a free-trade agreement.\\" The concerns over subsidized state-owned enterprises and currency manipulation are not deemed applicable to Canada and Mexico.[107] Jeffrey Schott of the Peterson Institute for International Economics noted that it would not be possible to conclude renegotiations quickly while also addressing all the concerns on the list.[109] He also said that it would be difficult to do anything about trade deficits.[109]\\r\\nFollowing Donald Trump's election to the presidency, a range of trade experts have said that pulling out of NAFTA as Trump proposed would have a range of unintended consequences for the U.S., including reduced access to the U.S.'s biggest export markets, a reduction in economic growth, and increased prices for gasoline, cars, fruits, and vegetables.[12] The worst affected sectors would be textiles, agriculture and automobiles.[110][13]\\r\\nAccording to Tufts University political scientist Daniel W. Drezner, the Trump administration's desire to return relations with Mexico to the pre-NAFTA era are misguided. Drezner argues that NAFTA made it easier for Mexico to transform to a real democracy and become a country that views itself as North American. If Trump acts on many of the threats that he has made against Mexico, it is not inconceivable that Mexicans would turn to left-wing populist strongmen, as several South-American countries have. At the very least, US-Mexico relations would worsen, with adverse implications for cooperation on border security, counterterrorism, drug-war cooperation, deportations and managing Central American migration.[44]\\r\\nAccording to Chad P. Bown (senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics), \\"a renegotiated NAFTA that would reestablish trade barriers is unlikely to help workers who lost their jobs  regardless of the cause  take advantage of new employment opportunities.\\"[111]\\r\\nAccording to Harvard economist Marc Melitz, \\"recent research estimates that the repeal of NAFTA would not increase car production in the United States.\\"[11] Melitz notes that this would cost manufacturing jobs.[11]\\r\\nIf the Trans-Pacific Partnership comes into effect, existing agreements like NAFTA will be reduced to those provisions that do not conflict with the TPP, or that require greater trade liberalization than the TPP.[112] However, only Canada and Mexico will have the prospect of becoming members of the TPP after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in January 2017. In May 2017, the 11 remaining members of the TPP, including Canada and Mexico, agreed to proceed with the trade deal without U.S. participation.[113]","input":"When was the north american free trade agreement signed?"},{"output":"seven","context":"","input":"How many books are in the narnia series?"},{"output":"the ground","context":"The red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans), also known as the red-eared terrapin, is a semiaquatic turtle belonging to the family Emydidae. It is a subspecies of the pond slider. It is the most popular pet turtle in the United States and is also popular as a pet in the rest of the world.[2] It has, therefore, become the most commonly traded turtle in the world.[3] It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, but has become established in other places because of pet releases, and has become an invasive species in many areas, where it outcompetes native species. The red-eared slider is included in the list of the world's 100 most invasive species[4] published by the IUCN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRed-eared sliders get their name from the small red stripe around their ears.. The \\"slider\\" in their name comes from their ability to slide off rocks and logs and into the water quickly. This species was previously known as Troost's turtle in honor of an American herpetologist; Trachemys scripta troostii is now the scientific name for another subspecies, the Cumberland slider.\\r\\nThe red-eared slider belongs to the order Testudines, which contains about 250 turtle species. It is a subspecies of Trachemys scripta. They were previously classified under the name Chrysemys scripta elegans.\\r\\nThe species Trachemys scripta contains three subspecies: T. s. elegans (red-eared slider), T. s. scripta (yellow-bellied slider), and T. s. troostii (Cumberland slider).[5]\\r\\nThe carapace of this species can reach more than 40?cm (16?in) in length, but the average length ranges from 15 to 20?cm (6 to 8?in).[6] The females of the species are usually larger than the males. They typically live between 20 and 30 years, although some individuals have lived for more than 40 years.[7] Their life expectancy is shorter when they are kept in captivity.[8] The quality of their living environment has a strong influence on their lifespans and well being.\\r\\nThese turtles are poikilotherms, meaning they are unable to regulate their body temperatures independently; they are completely dependent on the temperature of their environment.[2] For this reason, they need to sunbathe frequently to warm themselves and maintain their body temperatures.\\r\\nThe shell is divided into two sections: the upper or dorsal carapace, and the lower, ventral carapace or plastron.[2] The upper carapace consists of the vertebral scutes, which form the central, elevated portion; pleural scutes that are located around the vertebral scutes; and then the marginal scutes around the edge of the carapace. The rear marginal scutes are notched. The scutes are bony keratinous elements. The carapace is oval and flattened (especially in the male) and has a weak keel that is more pronounced in the young.[9] The color of the carapace changes depending on the age of the turtle. The carapace usually has a dark green background with light and dark, highly variable markings. In young or recently hatched turtles, it is leaf green and gets slightly darker as a turtle gets older, until it is a very dark green, and then turns a shade between brown and olive green. The plastron is always a light yellow with dark, paired, irregular markings in the centre of most scutes. The plastron is highly variable in pattern. The head, legs, and tail are green with fine, irregular, yellow lines. The whole shell is covered in these stripes and markings that aid in camouflaging an individual.\\r\\nTurtles also have a complete skeletal system, with partially webbed feet that help them to swim and that can be withdrawn inside the carapace along with the head and tail. The red stripe on each side of the head distinguishes the red-eared slider from all other North American species and gives this species its name, as the stripe is located behind the eyes where their (external) ears would be. These stripes may lose their color over time.[8] Some individuals can also have a small mark of the same color on the top of their heads. The red-eared slider does not have a visible outer ear or an external auditory canal; instead, it relies on a middle ear entirely covered by a cartilaginous tympanic disc.[10]\\r\\nThe main internal organs of these reptiles are the lungs, heart, stomach, liver, intestines, and the urinary bladder. A cloaca serves both excretory and reproductive functions.\\r\\nSome dimorphism exists between males and females.[11]\\r\\nRed-eared slider young look practically identical regardless of their sex, making it difficult to determine their sex. However, there is another method to determine their sex, by inspecting the markings under their carapace. These markings will fade as the turtles age. It is much easier to distinguish the sex of adults, as the shells of mature males are smaller than those of females.[12] Male red-eared sliders reach sexual maturity when their carapaces' diameters measure 10?cm (3.9?in) and females reach maturity when their carapaces measure 15?cm. Both male and females reach sexual maturity at five to six years. The male is normally smaller than the female, although this parameter is sometimes difficult to apply as individuals being compared could be of different ages.\\r\\nMales have longer claws on their front feet than the females; this helps them to hold on to a female during mating and is used during courtship displays.[13] The male's tail is thicker and longer, it has a dark coloured retractable sexual organ known as their penis, inside the tail. Typically, the cloacal opening of the female is at or under the rear edge of the carapace, while the male's opening occurs beyond the edge of the carapace. The male's plastron is slightly concave, while that of the female is completely flat. The male's concave plastron also helps to stabilize the male on the female's carapace during mating.[14] Older males can sometimes have a dark greyish-olive green melanistic coloration, with very subdued markings. The red stripe on the sides of the head may be difficult to see or be absent. The female's appearance is substantially the same throughout her life.\\r\\nThe red-eared slider originated from the area around the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico, in warm climates in the southeastern United States. Their native areas range from the southeast of Colorado to Virginia and Florida. In nature, they inhabit areas with a source of still, warm water, such as ponds, lakes, swamps, creeks, streams, or slow-flowing rivers. They live in areas of calm water where they are able to leave the water easily by climbing onto rocks or tree trunks so they can warm up in the sun. Individuals are often found sunbathing in a group or even on top of each other. They also require abundant aquatic plants, as these are the adults' main food, although they are omnivores.[15] Turtles in the wild always remain close to water unless they are searching for a new habitat or when females leave the water to lay their eggs.\\r\\nOwing to their popularity as pets, red-eared sliders have been released or escaped into the wild in many parts of the world.[16] The turtle is considered one of the worlds worst invasive species.[17] Feral populations are now found in Australia, Europe, South Africa, the Caribbean Islands, Israel, Bahrain, the Mariana Islands, Guam, and southeast and far-east Asia.[18][19] In Australia, it is illegal for members of the public to import, keep, trade, or release red-eared sliders, as they are regarded as an invasive species[20] - see below. Their import has been banned by the European Union[21] as well as specific EU member countries.[22] In 2015 Japan announced it was planning to ban the import of red-eared sliders, but it would probably not take effect until 2020.[23] Invasive red-eared sliders cause negative impacts in the ecosystems they occupy because they have certain advantages over the native populations, such as a lower age at maturity, higher fecundity rates, and larger body size, which gives them a competitive advantage at basking and nesting sites, as well as when exploiting food resources.[24] They also transmit diseases and displace the other turtle species with which they compete for food and breeding space.[25]\\r\\nRed-eared sliders are almost entirely aquatic, but as they are cold-blooded, they leave the water to sunbathe to regulate their temperature.\\r\\nRed Eared Sliders do not hibernate, but actually brumate; while they become less active, they do occasionally rise to the surface for food or air. Brumation can occur to varying degrees. In the wild, red-eared sliders brumate over the winter at the bottoms of ponds or shallow lakes. They generally become inactive in October, when temperatures fall below 10?C (50?F).[9] During this time, the turtles enter a state of sopor, during which they do not eat or defecate, they remain nearly motionless, and the frequency of their breathing falls. Individuals usually brumate underwater, but they have also been found under banks and rocks, and in hollow stumps. In warmer winter climates, they can become active and come to the surface for basking. When the temperature begins to drop again, however, they quickly return to a brumation state. Sliders generally come up for food in early March to as late as the end of April.\\r\\nDuring brumation, T. s. elegans can survive anaerobically for weeks, producing ATP from glycolysis. The turtle's metabolic rate drops dramatically, with heart rate and cardiac output dropping by 80% to minimise energy requirements.[26][27] The lactic acid produced is buffered by minerals in the shell, preventing acidosis.[28] Red-eared sliders kept captive indoors should not brumate.\\r\\nCourtship and mating activities for red-eared sliders usually occur between March and July, and take place under water. During courtship, the male swims around the female and flutters or vibrates the back side of his long claws on and around her face and head, possibly to direct pheromones towards her.[29] The female swims toward the male and, if she is receptive, sinks to the bottom for mating. If the female is not receptive, she may become aggressive towards the male. Courtship can last 45 minutes, but mating takes only 10 minutes.[25]\\r\\nOn occasion, a male may appear to be courting another male, and when kept in captivity may also show this behaviour towards other household pets. Between male turtles, it could be a sign of dominance and may preclude a fight. Young turtles may carry out the courtship dance before they reach sexual maturity at five years of age, but they are unable to mate.[30]\\r\\nAfter mating, the female spends extra time basking to keep her eggs warm.[30] She may also have a change of diet, eating only certain foods, or not eating as much as she normally would. A female can lay between two and 30 eggs depending on body size and other factors.[18] One female can lay up to five clutches in the same year, and clutches are usually spaced 12 to 36 days apart.[31] The time between mating and egg-laying can be days or weeks. The actual egg fertilization takes place during the egg-laying. This process also permits the laying of fertile eggs the following season, as the sperm can remain viable and available in the female's body in the absence of mating. During the last weeks of gestation, the female spends less time in the water and smells and scratches at the ground, indicating she is searching for a suitable place to lay her eggs. The female excavates a hole, using her hind legs, and lays her eggs in it.[32]\\r\\nIncubation takes 59 to 112 days.[18] Late-season hatchlings may spend the winter in the nest and emerge when the weather warms in the spring. Just prior to hatching, the egg contains 50% turtle and 50% egg sac. A new hatchling breaks open its egg with its egg tooth, which falls out about an hour after hatching. This egg tooth never grows back. Hatchlings may stay inside their eggshells after hatching for the first day or two. If they are forced to leave the eggshell before they are ready, they will return if possible. When a hatchling decides to leave the shell, it still has a small sac protruding from its plastron. The yolk sac is vital and provides nourishment while visible, and several days later it will have been absorbed into the turtle's belly. The sac must be absorbed, and does not fall off. The split must heal on its own before the turtle is able to swim. The time between the egg hatching and water entry is 21 days.\\r\\nDamage to or inordinate motion of the protruding egg yolk, enough to allow air into the turtle's body, results in death. This is the main reason for marking the top of turtle eggs if their relocation is required for any reason. An egg turned upside down will eventually terminate the embryo's growth by the sac smothering the embryo. If it manages to reach term, the turtle will try to flip over with the yolk sac, which would allow air into the body cavity and cause death. The other fatal danger is water getting into the body cavity before the sac is absorbed completely and while the opening has not completely healed yet.\\r\\nThe sex of red-eared sliders is determined by the incubation temperature during critical phases of the embryos' development. Only males are produced when eggs are incubated at temperatures of 22ÿ27?C (72ÿ81?F), whereas females develop at warmer temperatures.[33] Colder temperatures result in the death of the embryos.\\r\\nRed-eared slider turtles are the worlds most commonly traded reptile, due to their relatively low price, small size and easy maintenance.[34][35] As with other turtles, tortoises, and box turtles, individuals that survive their first year or two can be expected to live generally around 30 years. But they are an infection risk, and when they mature they can inflict painful bites, which results in many being dumped into the wild with negative ecological, social and economic impacts.[36]\\r\\nReptiles are asymptomatic (meaning they suffer no adverse side effects) carriers of bacteria of the genus Salmonella.[37] This has given rise to justifiable concerns given the many instances of infection of humans caused by the handling of turtles,[38] which has led to restrictions in the sale of red-eared sliders in the USA. A 1975 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation bans the sale (for general commercial and public use) of both turtle eggs and turtles with a carapace length of less than 4?in (10?cm). This regulation comes under the Public Health Service Act, and is enforced by the FDA in cooperation with state and local health jurisdictions. The ban was enacted because of the public health impact of turtle-associated salmonellosis. Turtles and turtle eggs found to be offered for sale in violation of this provision are subject to destruction in accordance with FDA procedures. A fine of up to $1,001 and/or imprisonment for up to one year is the penalty for those who refuse to comply with a valid final demand for destruction of such turtles or their eggs.[39] Many stores and flea markets still sell small turtles due to an exception in the FDA regulation which allows turtles under 4?in (10?cm) to be sold \\"for bona fide scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes, other than use as pets.\\"[40] As with many other animals and inanimate objects, the risk of Salmonella exposure can be reduced by following basic rules of cleanliness. Small children must be taught to wash their hands immediately after they finish playing with the turtle, feeding it, or changing its water.\\r\\nSome states have other laws and regulations regarding possession of red-eared sliders because they can be an invasive species where they are not native and have been introduced through the pet trade. Now, it is illegal in Florida to sell any wild-type red-eared slider, as they interbreed with the local yellow-bellied slider population  Trachemys scripta scripta is another subspecies of pond sliders, and hybrids typically combine the markings of the two subspecies. However, unusual color varieties such as albino and pastel red-eared sliders, which are derived from captive breeding, are still allowed for sale.[41]\\r\\nIn Australia, breeding populations have been found in New South Wales and Queensland, and individual turtles have been found in the wild in Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia.[42]\\r\\nRed-eared slider turtles are considered a significant threat to native turtle species - they mature more quickly, grow larger, produce more offspring and are more aggressive.[42] Numerous studies provide evidence that red-eared slider turtles can out-compete native turtles for food and nesting and basking sites.[43] Because red-eared slider turtles eat plants as well as animals, they could also have a negative impact on a range of native aquatic species, including rare frogs.[44] There is also a significant risk that red-eared slider turtles will transfer diseases and parasites to native reptile species. There is evidence that a malaria-like parasite was spread to two wild turtle populations in Lane Cove River, Sydney.[45]\\r\\nSocial and economic costs are also likely to be substantial. The Queensland government has invested close to $1 million AUD in eradication programs to date.[42] As outlined in the foregoing section, the turtle may also have significant public health costs due to the impacts of turtle-associated salmonella on human health. Outbreaks in multiple states and fatalities in children, associated with handling salmonella-infected turtles, have been recorded in the USA.[46] Salmonella can also spread to humans when turtles contaminate drinking water.[47]\\r\\nThere have been varying degrees of action by state governments to date, ranging from ongoing eradication efforts by the Queensland government to very little action by the government of New South Wales.[48] Experts have ranked the species as high priority for management in Australia and are calling for a national prevention and eradication strategy, including a concerted education and compliance program to stop the illegal trade, possession and release of slider turtles.[49]\\r\\nWithin the second volume of the Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the popular comic book heroes were revealed as specimens of the red-eared slider. The popularity of the Turtles led to a craze for keeping them as pets in Great Britain, and subsequent ecological havoc as turtles were accidentally or deliberately released into the wild.[50]","input":"When do red ear slider turtles lay eggs?"},{"output":"Australian obstetrician William McBride and the German paediatrician Widukind Lenz","context":"Thalidomide, sold under the brand name Immunoprin, among others, is an immunomodulatory drug and the prototype of the thalidomide class of drugs. Today, thalidomide is used mainly as a treatment of certain cancers (multiple myeloma) and of a complication of leprosy.\\r\\nThalidomide was first marketed in 1957 in West Germany under the trade-name Contergan. The German drug company Chemie Grnenthal developed and sold the drug. Primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic, thalidomide also claimed to cure \\"anxiety, insomnia, gastritis, and tension\\".[3] Afterwards, it was used against nausea and to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women. Thalidomide became an over-the-counter drug in West Germany on October 1, 1957. Shortly after the drug was sold in West Germany, between 5,000 and 7,000 infants were born with phocomelia (malformation of the limbs). Only 40% of these children survived.[4] Throughout the world, about 10,000 cases were reported of infants with phocomelia due to thalidomide; only 50% of the 10,000 survived. Those subjected to thalidomide while in the womb experienced limb deficiencies in a way that the long limbs either were not developed or presented themselves as stumps. Other effects included deformed eyes and hearts, deformed alimentary and urinary tracts, blindness and deafness.[5] The negative effects of thalidomide led to the development of more structured drug regulations and control over drug use and development.[6]\\r\\nThalidomide is used as a first line treatment in multiple myeloma in combination with dexamethasone or with melphalan and prednisone, to treat acute episodes of erythema nodosum leprosum and for maintenance therapy.[7][8]\\r\\nThalidomide is used off-label in several ways.\\r\\nThe bacterium that causes tuberculosis is related to leprosy. Thalidomide may be helpful in some cases where standard TB drugs and corticosteroids are not sufficient to resolve severe inflammation in the brain.[9][10]\\r\\nIt is used as a second-line treatment to manage graft versus host disease and aphthous stomatitis in children and has been prescribed for other conditions in children including actinic prurigo and epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa; the evidence for these uses is weak.[11] It is recommended only as a third line treatment in graft versus host disease in adults, based on lack of efficacy and side effects observed in clinical trials.[12][13]\\r\\nThalidomide should not be used by people who are breast feeding or pregnant, trying to conceive a child, or cannot or will not follow the risk management program to prevent pregnancies. The prescribing doctor is required to ensure that contraception is being used, and regularly pregnancy tests must be administered. Some people are allergic to thalidomide and should not take it. It should be used with caution in people with chronic infections like HIV or hepatitis B.[8][7]\\r\\nThalidomide causes birth defects.[8][7][14] The FDA and other regulatory agencies have approved marketing of the drug only with an auditable risk evaluation and mitigation strategy that ensures that people using the drug are aware of the risks and avoid pregnancy; this applies to men and women both, as the drug can be transmitted in sperm.[14]\\r\\nThere is a high risk that thalidomide can cause excessive blood clots. There is also a high risk that thalidomide can interfere with formation of various kinds of new blood cells, creating a risk of infection via neutropenia, leukopenia, and lymphopenia, and risks that blood will not clot via thrombocytopenia. There is also a risk of anemia via lack of red blood cells. The drug can also damage nerves, causing peripheral neuropathy that may be irreversible.[8][7]\\r\\nThalidomide has several cardiovascular adverse effects, including risk of heart attacks, pulmonary hypertension, and changes in heart rhythm including syncope, bradycardia and atrioventricular block.[8][7]\\r\\nIt can cause liver damage and severe skin reactions like Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. It tends to make people sleepy, which creates risk for driving and operating other machinery. As it kills cancer cells, it can cause tumor lysis syndrome. Thalidomide can prevent menstruation.[8][7]\\r\\nOther than the above, very common (reported in more than 10% of people) adverse effects include tremor, dizziness, tingling, numbness, constipation, and peripheral edema.[8][7]\\r\\nCommon (reported by 1-10% of people) adverse effects include confusion, depressed mood, reduced coordination, heart failure, difficulty breathing, interstitial lung disease, lung inflammation, vomiting, dry mouth, rashes, dry skin, fever, weakness, and a sense of unwellness.[8][7]\\r\\nThere are no expected pharmacokinetic interactions between thalidomide and other medicines due to its neutral effects on p-glycoprotein and P450 cytochromes. It may interact with sedatives due to its sedative action. It may also interact with bradycardic agents due to its bradycardia-inducing effects. The risk of peripheral neuropathy may be increased by concomitant treatment with other agents known to cause peripheral neuropathy.[15] The risk of venous thromboembolisms with thalidomide seems to be increased when patients are treated with oral contraceptives or other cytotoxic agents (including doxorubicin and melphalan) concurrently. Thalidomide may interfere with the contraceptive effects of various contraceptives and hence it is advised that women of reproductive age use at least two different means of contraception to ensure that no child will be conceived while they are receiving thalidomide.[15][8][7]\\r\\nAs of 2013 eighteen cases of overdoses had been reported with doses of up to 14.4 g without any reported fatalities.[15] No specific antidote for overdoses exists and treatment is purely supportive.[15]\\r\\nThe precise mechanism of action for thalidomide is unknown although efforts to identify thalidomide's teratogenic action generated 2000 research papers and the proposal of 15 or 16 plausible mechanisms by 2000.[16] As of 2015 the main theories were inhibition of the process of angiogenesis, its inhibition of cereblon, a ubiquitin ligase, and its ability to generate reactive oxygen species which in turn kill cells.[17][18]\\r\\nThalidomide also binds to and acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR) and hence is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) of some capacity.[19] In accordance, it can produce gynecomastia and sexual dysfunction as side effects in men.[20]\\r\\nThalidomide is provided as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers; while there are reports that only one of the enantiomers may cause birth defects, the body converts each enantiomer into the other through mechanisms that are not well understood.[14]\\r\\nThalidomide is racemic; while the S-thalidomide is the bioactive form of the molecule, the individual enantiomers can racemize to each other due to the acidic hydrogen at the chiral centre, which is the carbon of the glutarimide ring bonded to the phthalimide substituent. The racemization process can occur in vivo.[2][21][22][23]\\r\\nCelgene Corporation originally synthesized thalidomide using a three-step sequence starting with L-glutamic acid treatment, but this has since been reformed by the use of L-glutamine.[24] As shown in the image below, N-carbethoxyphtalimide (1) can react with L-glutamine to yield N-Phthaloyl-L-glutamine (2). Cyclization of N-Phthaloyl-L-glutamine occurs using carbonyldiimidazole, which then yields thalidomide (3).[24] Celegne Corporation's original method resulted in a 31% yield of S-thalidomide, whereas the two-step synthesis yields 85-93% product that is 99% pure.\\r\\nThalidomide was discovered by scientists at the German pharmaceutical company Chemie Grnenthal (now Grnenthal GmbH) around 1953. The company had been set up as a soap maker just after WWII ended, to address the urgent market need for antibiotics. Heinrich Mueckter was appointed to head the discovery program based on his experience working with the German army's antiviral research program. In the course of preparing reagents for the work, Mueckter's assistant Wilhelm Kunz isolated a by-product, that was in turn recognized by pharmacologist Herbert Keller as an analog of glutethimide, a sedative, and the medicinal chemistry work turned to improving the lead compound into a suitable drug; the result was thalidomide. The toxicity was examined in several animals, and the drug was introduced in 1956 as a sedative.[25]\\r\\nResearchers at Chemie Grnenthal also found that thalidomide was a particularly effective antiemetic that had an inhibitory effect on morning sickness.[26] Hence, on October 1, 1957, the company launched thalidomide and began aggressively marketing it under the trade name Contergan.[27][better?source?needed] It was proclaimed a \\"wonder drug\\" for insomnia, coughs, colds and headaches.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring this time period, the use of medications during pregnancy was not strictly controlled, and drugs were not thoroughly tested for potential harm to the fetus.[26] Thousands of pregnant women took the drug to relieve their symptoms. At the time of the drug's development, scientists did not believe any drug taken by a pregnant woman could pass across the placental barrier and harm the developing fetus,[6] even though the effect of alcohol on fetal development had been documented by case studies on alcoholic mothers since at least 1957.[28] There soon appeared reports of findings of abnormalities in children being born, traced back to the use of the drug thalidomide. In late 1959, it was noticed that peripheral neuritis developed in patients who took the drug over a period of time, and it was only after this point that thalidomide ceased to be provided over the counter.[29]\\r\\nHence, while initially considered safe, the drug was responsible for teratogenic deformities in children born after their mothers used it during pregnancies, prior to the third trimester. In November 1961, thalidomide was taken off the market due to massive pressure from the press and public.[30] Experts estimate that the drug thalidomide led to the death of approximately 2,000 children and serious birth defects in more than 10,000 children, about 5,000 of them in West Germany.[citation needed] The regulatory authorities in East Germany did not approve thalidomide.[4][dead link] One reason for the initially unobserved side effects of the drug and the subsequent approval in West Germany was that at that time drugs did not have to be tested for teratogenic effects. They had been tested on rodents only, as was usual at the time.[31]\\r\\nIn the UK, the British pharmaceutical company The Distillers Company (Biochemicals) Ltd, a subsidiary of Distillers Co. Ltd. (now part of Diageo plc), marketed thalidomide under the brand name Distaval as a remedy for morning sickness throughout the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Their advertisement claimed that \\"Distaval can be given with complete safety to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or child...Outstandingly safe Distaval has been prescribed for nearly three years in this country.\\"[4][dead link] Around the world, more and more pharmaceutical companies started to produce and market the drug under license from Chemie Grnenthal. By the mid 1950s, 14 pharmaceutical companies were marketing thalidomide in 46 countries under 37 (some reports suggest 51) different trade names.\\r\\nIn the U.S., representatives from Chemie Grnenthal approached Smith, Kline & French (SKF), now GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) with a request to market and distribute the drug in North America. A memorandum rediscovered in 2010 in the archives of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shows that, as part of its in-licensing approach, Smith, Kline and French conducted animal tests and ran a clinical trial of the drug in the United States involving 875 people, including pregnant women, in 1956ÿ57.[citation needed] In 1956, researchers at SKF involved in clinical trials noted that even when used in very high doses, thalidomide could not induce sleep in mice.[citation needed] And when administered at doses 50 to 650 times larger than that claimed by Chemie Grnenthal to be \\"sleep inducing\\", the researchers could still not achieve the hypnotic effect in animals that it had on humans.[citation needed] After completion of the trial, and based on reasons kept hidden for decades, SKF declined to commercialize the drug. Later, Chemie Grnenthal, in 1958, reached an agreement with William S Merrell Company in Cincinnati, Ohio, (later Richardson-Merrell, now part of Sanofi), to market and distribute thalidomide throughout the United States.[4][dead link]\\r\\nThe U.S. FDA refused to approve thalidomide for marketing and distribution. However, the drug was distributed in large quantities for testing purposes, after the American distributor and manufacturer Richardson-Merrell had applied for its approval in September 1960.[citation needed] The official in charge of the FDA review, Frances Oldham Kelsey, did not rely on information from the company, which did not include any test results. Richardson-Merrell was called on to perform tests and report the results. The company demanded approval six times, and was refused each time. Nevertheless, a total of 17 children with thalidomide-induced malformations were born in the U.S.[32]\\r\\nIn Canada, the history of the drug thalidomide dates back to April 1, 1961. There were many different forms sold, with the most common variant being Talimol.[33] Two months after Talimol went on sale, pharmaceutical companies sent physicians letters warning about the risk of birth defects.[33] It was not until March 2, 1962, that both drugs were banned from the Canadian market by the FDD, and soon afterward physicians were warned to destroy their supplies.[33]\\r\\nIn 1964, Israeli physician Jacob Sheskin administered thalidomide to a patient critically ill with leprosy. The patient exhibited erythema nodosum leprosum?(ENL), a painful skin condition, one of the complications of leprosy. This was attempted despite the ban on thalidomide's use, but results were favourable: the patient slept for hours and was able to get out of bed without aid upon awakening. A clinical trial studying the use of thalidomide in leprosy soon followed.[34]\\r\\nThalidomide has been used by Brazilian physicians as the drug of choice for the treatment of severe ENL since 1965, and by 1996, at least 33 cases of thalidomide embryopathy were recorded in people born in Brazil after 1965.[35] Since 1994, the production, dispensing, and prescription of thalidomide have been strictly controlled, requiring women to use two forms of birth control and submit to regular pregnancy tests. Despite this, cases of thalidomide embryopathy continue,[36][37] with at least 100 cases identified in Brazil between 2005 and 2010.[38] 5.8 million thalidomide pills were distributed throughout Brazil in this time period, largely to poor Brazilians in areas with poor access to healthcare, and these cases have occurred despite the controls.\\r\\nIn 1998 the FDA approved the drug's use in the treatment of ENL.[39] Because of thalidomide's potential for causing birth defects, the drug may be distributed only under tightly controlled conditions. The FDA required that Celgene Corporation, which planned to market thalidomide under the brand name Thalomid, establish a system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety (STEPS) oversight program. The conditions required under the program include limiting prescription and dispensing rights to authorized prescribers and pharmacies only, keeping a registry of all patients prescribed thalidomide, providing extensive patient education about the risks associated with the drug, and providing periodic pregnancy tests for women who take the drug.[39]\\r\\nIn 2010, the World Health Organisation (WHO) stated that it did not recommend thalidomide due the difficulty of adequately controlling its use, and due to the availability of clofazimine.[40]\\r\\nShortly after the teratogenic properties of thalidomide were recognized in the mid-1960s, its anti-cancer potential was explored and two clinical trials were conducted in people with advanced cancer, including some people with multiple myeloma; the trials were inconclusive.[41]\\r\\nLittle further work was done with thalidomide in cancer until the 1990s.[41]\\r\\nJudah Folkman pioneered studies into the role of angiogenesis (the proliferation and growth of blood vessels) in the development of cancer, and in the early 1970s had shown that solid tumors could not expand without it.[42][43] In 1993 he surprised the scientific world by hypothesizing the same was true of blood cancers,[44] and the next year he published work showing that a biomarker of angiogenesis was higher in all people with cancer, but especially high in people with blood cancers, and other evidence emerged as well.[44] Meanwhile, a member of his lab, Robert D'Amato, was looking for angiogenesis inhibitors, and discovered in 1994 that thalidomide inhibited angiogenesis.[45] Around that time, the wife of a man who was dying of multiple myeloma and whom standard treatments had failed, called Folkman asking him about his anti-angiogenesis ideas.[43] Folkman convinced the patient's doctor to try thalidomide, and that doctor conducted a clinical trial of thalidomide for people with multiple myeloma in which about a third of the subjects responded to the treatment.[43] The results of that trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1999.[43][46]\\r\\nAfter further work was done by Celgene and others, in 2006 the U.S.?Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients.[43][47]\\r\\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, more than 10,000 children in 46 countries were born with deformities such as phocomelia as a consequence of thalidomide use.[48] The severity and location of the deformities depended on how many days into the pregnancy the mother was before beginning treatment; thalidomide taken on the 20th day of pregnancy caused central brain damage, day 21 would damage the eyes, day 22 the ears and face, day 24 the arms, and leg damage would occur if taken up to day 28. Thalidomide did not damage the foetus if taken after 42 days gestation.[30]\\r\\nIt is not known exactly how many worldwide victims of the drug there have been, although estimates range from 10,000 to 20,000[49] to 100,000.[30] Despite the side effects, thalidomide was sold in pharmacies in Canada until 1962.[33][50]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the drug was licensed in 1958 and withdrawn in 1961. Of the approximately 2,000 babies born with defects, around half died within a few months and 466 survived to at least 2010.[51]\\r\\nIn Spain, thalidomide was widely available throughout the 1970s, perhaps even into the 1980s. There were two reasons for this. First, state controls and safeguarding were poor; indeed, it was not until 2008 that the government even admitted the country had ever imported thalidomide. Second, Grnenthal failed to insist that its sister company in Madrid warn Spanish doctors, and permitted it to not warn them. The Spanish advocacy group for victims of thalidomide estimates that in 2015, there were 250ÿ300 living victims of thalidomide in Spain.[52]\\r\\nThe Australian obstetrician William McBride and the German paediatrician Widukind Lenz suspected a link between birth defects and the drug, a theory Lenz proved in 1961.[53][54] McBride was later awarded a number of honors, including a medal and prize money by L'Institut de la Vie in Paris.[55] Further animal tests were conducted by Dr George Somers, Chief Pharmacologist of Distillers Company in Britain, which showed foetal abnormalities in rabbits.[56] Similar results were also published showing these effects in rats[57][58] and other species.[59]\\r\\nIn East Germany, the head of the central pharmacy control commission, Friedrich Jung, suspected an antivitaminic effect of thalidomide as derivative of glutamic acid.[60] Meanwhile, in West Germany, it took some time before the increase in dysmelia at the end of the 1950s was connected with thalidomide. In 1958 Karl Beck, a former pediatric doctor in Bayreuth wrote an article in a local newspaper claiming a relationship between nuclear weapons testing and cases of dysmelia in children.[61] Based on this, FDP whip Erich Mende requested an official statement from the federal government.[61] For statistical reasons, the main data series used to research dysmelia cases started by chance at the same time as the approval date for thalidomide.[61] After the Nazi regime with its Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring used mandatory statistical monitoring to commit various crimes, western Germany had been very reluctant to monitor congenital disorders in a similarly strict way.[62] The parliamentary report rejected any relation with radioactivity and the abnormal increase of dysmelia.[61] Also the DFG research project installed after the Mende request was not helpful. The project was led by pathologist Franz Bchner who ran the project to propagate his teratological theory. Bchner saw lack of healthy nutrition and behavior of the mothers as being more important than genetic reasons.[62] Furthermore, it took a while to install a Surgeon General in Germany; the Federal Ministry of Health (Germany) was not founded until 1962, some months after thalidomide was banned from the market.[61] In Germany approximately 2,500 thalidomide babies were born.[54]\\r\\nSeveral countries either restricted the drug's use or never approved it. Ingeborg Eichler, a member of the Austrian pharmaceutical admission conference, enforced thalidomide (tradename Softenon) being sold under the rules of prescription medication and as a result relatively few affected children were born in Austria and Switzerland.[63] In the United States, pharmacologist Frances Oldham Kelsey M.D. withstood pressure from the Richardson-Merrell company and refused Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market thalidomide, saying further studies were needed.[48] This reduced the impact of thalidomide in United States patients. Although thalidomide was never approved for sale in the United States at the time, millions of tablets had been distributed to physicians during a clinical testing program. It was impossible to know how many pregnant women had been given the drug to help alleviate morning sickness or as a sedative.[64]\\r\\nThe numerous reports of malformations in babies brought about the awareness of the side effects of the drug on pregnant women. The birth defects caused by the drug thalidomide can range from moderate malformation to more severe forms. Possible birth defects include phocomelia, dysmelia, amelia, bone hypoplasticity, and other congenital defects affecting the ear, heart, or internal organs.[26] Franks et al. looked at how the drug affected newborn babies, the severity of their deformities, and reviewed the drug in its early years. Webb in 1963 also reviewed the history of the drug and the different forms of birth defects it had caused. \\"The most common form of birth defects from thalidomide is shortened limbs, with the arms being more frequently affected. This syndrome is the presence of deformities of the long bones of the limbs resulting in shortening and other abnormalities.\\"[33]\\r\\nIn 1968, a large criminal trial began in Germany, charging several Grnenthal officials with negligent homicide and injury. After Grnenthal settled with the victims in April 1970, the trial ended in December 1970 with no finding of guilt. As part of the settlement, Grnenthal paid 100 million DM into a special foundation; the German government added 320 million DM. The foundation paid victims a one-time sum of 2,500-25,000 DM (depending on severity of disability) and a monthly stipend of 100-450 DM. The monthly stipends have since been raised substantially and are now paid entirely by the government (as the foundation had run out of money). Grnenthal paid another 50 million Euros into the foundation in 2008.\\r\\nOn 31 August 2012, Grnenthal chief executive Harald F. Stock, PhD, who served as the Chief Executive Officer of Grnenthal GmbH from January 2009 to May 28, 2013 and was also a Member of Executive Board until May 28, 2013, apologized for the first time for producing the drug and remaining silent about the birth defects.[65] At a ceremony, Stock unveiled a statue of a disabled child to symbolize those harmed by thalidomide and apologized for not trying to reach out to victims for over 50?years. At the time of the apology, there were 5,000 to 6,000 sufferers still alive. Victim advocates called the apology \\"insulting\\" and \\"too little, too late\\", and criticized the company for not compensating victims. They also criticized the company for their claim that no one could have known the harm the drug caused, arguing that there were plenty of red flags at the time.[66]\\r\\nIn 1968, after a long campaign by The Sunday Times, a compensation settlement for the UK victims was reached with Distillers Company (now part of Diageo), which had distributed the drug in the UK.[67][68] This compensation, which is distributed by the Thalidomide Trust in the UK, was substantially increased by Diageo in 2005.[69] The UK Government gave survivors a grant of S20 million, to be distributed through the Thalidomide Trust, in December 2009.[70]\\r\\nMelbourne woman Lynette Rowe, who was born without limbs, led an Australian class action lawsuit against the drug's manufacturer, Grnenthal, which fought to have the case heard in Germany. The Supreme Court of Victoria dismissed Grnenthal's application in 2012, and the case was heard in Australia.[71] On 17 July 2012, Rowe was awarded an out-of-court settlement, believed to be in the millions of dollars and paving the way for class action victims to receive further compensation.[72] In February 2014, the Supreme Court of Victoria endorsed the settlement of $89 million AUD to 107 victims of the drug in Australia and New Zealand.[73][74]\\r\\nThe drug thalidomide's birth defects in children affected many people's lives, and from these events came the formation of the group called The Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada, a group of 120 Canadian survivors.[75][76] Their goal was to prevent future usage of drugs that could be of potential harm to mothers and babies. The members from the thalidomide victims association were involved in the STEPS program, which aimed to prevent teratogenicity.[26]\\r\\nThe effects of thalidomide increased fears regarding the safety of pharmaceutical drugs. The Society of Toxicology of Canada was formed after the effects of thalidomide were made public, focusing on toxicology as a discipline separate from pharmacology.[77] The need for the testing and approval of the toxins in certain pharmaceutical drugs became more important after the disaster. The Society of Toxicology of Canada is responsible for the Conservation Environment Protection Act, focusing on researching the impact to human health of chemical substances.[77] Thalidomide brought on changes in the way drugs are tested, what type of drugs are used during pregnancy, and increased the awareness of potential side effects of drugs.\\r\\nAccording to Canadian news magazine program W5, most, but not all, victims of thalidomide receive annual benefits as compensation from the Government of Canada. Excluded are those who cannot provide the documentation the government requires.[78]\\r\\nFor correctly denying the application despite the pressure from Richardson-Merrell, Kelsey eventually received the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service at a 1962 ceremony with President John F. Kennedy. In September 2010, the FDA honored Kelsey with the first Kelsey award. The award, given annually to an FDA staff member, came 50 years after Kelsey, then a new medical officer at the agency, first reviewed the application from the William S. Merrell Company of Cincinnati.[79] Cardiologist Helen B. Taussig learned of the damaging effects of the drug thalidomide on newborns and in 1967, testified before Congress on this matter after a trip to Germany where she worked with infants with phocomelia (severe limb deformities). As a result of her efforts, thalidomide was banned in the United States and Europe.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe disaster prompted many countries to introduce tougher rules for the testing and licensing of drugs, such as the Kefauver Harris Amendment[85] (U.S.), Directive 65/65/EEC1 (E.U.),[86] and the Medicines Act 1968.[87][88] In the United States, the new regulations strengthened the FDA, among other ways, by requiring applicants to prove efficacy and to disclose all side effects encountered in testing.[48] The FDA subsequently initiated the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation to reclassify drugs already on the market.\\r\\nResearch efforts have been focused on determination how thalidomide causes birth defects and its other activities in the human body, efforts to develop safer analogs, and efforts to find further uses for thalidomide.\\r\\nThe exploration of the antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory activities of thalidomide has led to the study and creation of thalidomide analogs.[89][90] Celgene has sponsored numerous clinical trials with analogues to thalidomide, such as lenalidomide, that are substantially more powerful and have fewer side effects? except for greater myelosuppression.[91] In 2005, Celgene received FDA approval for lenalidomide (Revlimid) as the first commercially useful derivative. Revlimid is available only in a restricted distribution setting to avoid its use during pregnancy. Further studies are being conducted to find safer compounds with useful qualities. Another more potent analog, pomalidomide, is now FDA approved.[92] Additionally, apremilast was approved by the FDA in March 2014. These thalidomide analogs can be used to treat different diseases, or used in a regimen to fight two conditions.[93]\\r\\nInterest turned to pomalidomide, a derivative of thalidomide marketed by Celgene. It is a very active anti-angiogenic agent [90] and also acts as an immunomodulator. Pomalidomide was approved in February 2013 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.[94] It received a similar approval from the European Commission in August 2013, and is expected to be marketed in Europe under the brand name Imnovid.[95]\\r\\nThere is no conclusive evidence that thalidomide or lenalidomide is useful to bring about or maintain remission in Crohn's disease.[96][97]\\r\\nThalidomide was studied in a Phase II trial for Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare soft tissue cancer most commonly seen in the immunocompromised, that is caused by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).[98][99]","input":"Who discovered the link between thalidomide and birth defects?"},{"output":"12.40%","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty is a significant issue in India, despite being one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, clocked at a growth rate of 7.11% in 2015, and a sizable consumer economy. The World Bank reviewed and proposed revisions on May 2014, to its poverty calculation methodology and purchasing power parity basis for measuring poverty worldwide. According to this revised methodology, the world had 872.3 million people below the new poverty line, of which 179.6 million people lived in India. In other words, India with 17.5% of total world's population, had 20.6% share of world's poorest in 2011.[1][2] As of 2014, 58% of the total population were living on less than  $3.10 per day.[3] According to the Modified Mixed Reference Period (MMRP) concept proposed by World Bank in 2015, India's poverty rate for period 2011-12 stood at 12.4% of the total population, or about 172 million people; taking the revised poverty line as $1.90.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Bank has been revising its definition and benchmarks to measure up poverty since 1990, with a $2 per day income on purchasing power parity basis as the definition in use from 2005 to 2013.[7] Some semi-economic and non-economic indices have also been proposed to measure poverty in India; for example, the Multi-dimensional Poverty Index placed 33% weight on number of years spent in school and education and 6.25% weight on financial condition of a person, in order to determine if that a person is poor.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe different definitions and different underlying small sample surveys used to determine poverty in India, have resulted in widely different estimates of poverty from 1950s to 2010s. In 2012, the Indian government stated 22% of its population is below its official poverty limit.[9] The World Bank, in 2011 based on 2005's PPPs International Comparison Program,[10] estimated 23.6% of Indian population, or about 276 million people, lived below $1.25 per day on purchasing power parity.[11][1] According to United Nation's Millennium Development Goals (MDG) programme 270 millions or 21.9% people out of 1.2 billion of Indians lived below poverty line of $1.25 in 2011-2012.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom late 19th century through early 20th century, under British colonial rule, poverty in India intensified, peaking in the 1920s.[13][14] Famines and diseases killed millions each time.[15][16] After India gained its independence in 1947, mass deaths from famines were prevented. Rapid economic growth since 1991, has led to sharp reductions in extreme poverties in India.[17][18] However, those above poverty line live a fragile economic life.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs per the methodology of the Suresh Tendulkar Committee report, the population below the poverty line in India in 2009-2010 was 354 million (29.6% of the population) and that in 2011-2012 was 269 million (21.9% of the population).[20] The Rangarajan Committee said in 2014 that the population below the poverty line in 2009-2010 was 454 million (38.2% of the population) and that in 2011-2012 was 363 million (29.5% of the population).[21] Deutsche Bank Research estimated that there are nearly 300 million people who are middle class.[22] If former trends continue, India's share of world GDP will significantly increase from 7.3% in 2016 to 8.5% by 2020.[23] In 2015, around 170 million people, or 12.4%, lived in poverty (defined as $1.90 (Rs 123.5)), a reduction from 29.8% in 2009.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Asian Development Bank estimates India's population to be at 1.28 billion with an average growth rate, from 2010-2015, at 1.3%. In 2014, 49.9% of the population aged 15 years and above were employed. However, there are still 21.9% of the population who live below the national poverty line.[26]  The World Poverty Clock shows real-time poverty trends in India, which are based on the latest data, of the World Bank, among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom November 2017, the World Bank started reporting poverty rates for all countries using two new international poverty lines: a \\"lower middle-income\\" line set at $3.20 per day and an \\"upper middle-income\\" line set at $5.50 per day. India falls in the lower middle-income category. Using the $3.20 per day poverty line, the percentage of the population living in poverty in India was 60% (2011). This means that 763 million people in India were living below this poverty line in 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several definitions of poverty, and scholars disagree as to which definition is appropriate for India.[27][28] Inside India, both income-based poverty definition and consumption-based poverty statistics are in use.[29] Outside India, the World Bank and institutions of the United Nations use a broader definition to compare poverty among nations, including India, based on purchasing power parity (PPP), as well as nominal relative basis.[30][31] Each state in India has its own poverty threshold to determine how many people are below its poverty line and to reflect regional economic conditions. These differences in definition yield a complex and conflicting picture about poverty in India, both internally and when compared to other developing countries of the world.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with many countries,[32] poverty was historically defined and estimated in India using a sustenance food standard. This methodology has been revised. India's current official poverty rates are based on its Planning Commission's data derived from so-called Tendulkar methodology.[33] It defines poverty not in terms of annual income, but in terms of consumption or spending per individual over a certain period for a basket of essential goods. Further, this methodology sets different poverty lines for rural and urban areas. Since 2007, India set its official threshold at ? 26 a day ($0.43) in rural areas and about ? 32 per day ($0.53) in urban areas.[34] While these numbers are lower than the World Bank's $1.25 per day income-based definition, the definition is similar to China's US$0.65 per day official poverty line in 2008.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Bank's international poverty line definition is based on purchasing power parity basis, at $1.25 per day.[36][37] This definition is motivated by the fact that the price of the same goods and services can differ significantly when converted into local currencies around the world. A realistic definition and comparison of poverty must consider these differences in costs of living, or must be on purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. On this basis, currency fluctuations and nominal numbers become less important, the definition is based on the local costs of a basket of essential goods and services that people can purchase. By World Bank's 2014 PPP definition, India's poverty rate is significantly lower than previously believed.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with economic measures, there are many mixed or non-economic measures of poverty and experts contest which one is most appropriate for India. For example, Dandekar and Rath in 1971 suggested a measure of poverty rate that was based on number of calories consumed.[38] In 2011, Alkire et al. suggested a poverty rate measure so-called Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which put only 6.25% weight to assets owned by a person and placed 33% weight on education and number of years spent in school.[8] These non-economic measures remain controversial and contested as a measure of poverty rate of any nation, including India.[39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia determines household poverty line by summing up the individual per capita poverty lines of the household members. This practice is similar to many developing countries, but different from developed countries such as the United States that adjust poverty line on an incremental basis per additional household member. For example, in the United States, the poverty line for a household with just one member was set at $11,670 per year for 2014, while it was set at $23,850 per year for a 4-member household (or $5963 per person for the larger household).[46] The rationale for the differences arise from the economic realities of each country. In India, households may include surviving grandparents, parents and children. They typically do not incur any or significant rent expenses every month particularly in rural India, unlike housing in mostly urban developed economies. The cost of food and other essentials are shared within the household by its members in both cases. However, a larger portion of a monthly expenditure goes to food in poor households in developing countries,[47] while housing, conveyance and other essentials cost significantly more in developed economies.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor its current poverty rate measurements, India calculates two benchmarks. The first includes a basket of goods including food items but does not include the implied value of home, value of any means of conveyance or the economic value of other essentials created, grown or used without a financial transaction, by the members of a household. The second poverty line benchmark adds rent value of residence as well as the cost of conveyance, but nothing else, to the first benchmark.[48] This practice is similar to those used in developed countries for non-cash income equivalents and poverty line basis.[49][50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia's proposed but not yet adopted official poverty line, in 2014, was ?972 (US$14) a month in rural areas or ?1,407 (US$20) a month in cities. The current poverty line is $14 per month ($0.46 per day) in rural areas and $17 per month ($0.56 per day) in urban areas.[51] India's nationwide average poverty line differs from each state's poverty line. For example, in 2011-2012, Puducherry had its highest poverty line of ?1,301 (US$19) a month in rural and ?1,309 (US$19) a month in urban areas, while Odisha had the lowest poverty thresholds of ?695 (US$10) a month for rural and ?861 (US$13) a month for its urban areas.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 19th century and early 20th century saw increasing poverty in India during the colonial era.[13][53] Over this period, the colonial government de-industrialized India by reducing garments and other finished products manufacturing by artisans in India, importing these from Britain's expanding industry with 19th century industrial innovations, while simultaneously encouraging conversion of more land into farms, and of agricultural exports from India.[54][55] Eastern regions of India along the Ganges river plains, such as those now known as eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal,[56] were dedicated to producing poppy and opium, which were then exported to southeast and east Asia particularly China, with the trade an exclusive monopoly first of East India Company, and later the colonial British institutions.[57] The economic importance of this shift from industry to agriculture in India was large;[58] by 1850, it created nearly 1,000 square kilometres of poppy farms in India in its fertile Ganges plains, led to two opium wars in Asia, with the second opium war fought between 1856 and 1860. After China accepted opium trade, the colonial government dedicated more land exclusively to poppy,[55] the opium agriculture in India rose from 1850 through 1900, when over 500,000 acres of the most fertile Ganges basin farms were devoted to poppy cultivation,[59] opium processing factories owned by colonial officials were expanded in Benares and Patna, and shipping expanded from Bengal to the ports of East Asia such as Hong Kong, all under exclusive monopoly of the British. By early 20th century, 3 out of 4 Indians were employed in agriculture, famines were common, and food consumption per capita declined in every decade.[14] In London, the late 19th century British parliament debated the repeated incidence of famines in India, and the impoverishment of Indians due to this diversion of agriculture land from growing food staples to growing poppy for opium export under orders of the colonial British empire.[55][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese colonial policies moved unemployed artisans into farming, and transformed India as a region increasingly abundant in land, unskilled labour and low productivity, and scarce in skilled labour, capital and knowledge.[13][14] On an inflation adjusted 1973 Rupee basis, the average income of Indian agrarian labourer was Rs. 7.20 per year in 1885, against an inflation adjusted poverty line of Rs. 23.90 per year. Thus, not only was the average income below poverty line, the intensity of poverty was severe. The intensity of poverty increased from 1885 to 1921, then began a reversal. However, the absolute poverty rates continued to be very high through the 1930s.[13][61] The colonial policies on taxation and its recognition of land ownership claims of zamindars and mansabdars, or Mughal era nobility, made a minority of families wealthy, while it weakened the ability of poorer peasants to command land and credit. The resulting rising landlessness and stagnant real wages intensified poverty.[13][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Planning Committee of 1936 noted the appalling poverty of undivided India.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\n(...) there was lack of food, of clothing, of housing and of every other essential requirement of human existence... the development policy objective should be to get rid of the appalling poverty of the people.\\r\\nThe National Planning Committee, notes Suryanarayana, then defined goals in 1936 to alleviate poverty by setting targets in terms of nutrition (2400 to 2800 calories per adult worker), clothing (30 yards per capita per annum) and housing (100 sq. ft per capita).[63] This method of linking poverty as a function of nutrition, clothing and housing continued in India after it became independent from British colonial empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese poverty alleviation goals were theoretical, with administrative powers resident in the British Empire. Poverty ravaged India. In 1943, for example, despite rising agricultural output in undivided South Asia, the Bengal famine killed millions of Indians from starvation, disease and destitution. Destitution was so intense in Bengal, Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Orissa, that entire families and villages were \\"wiped out\\" of existence. Village artisans, along with sustenance farming families, died from lack of food, malnutrition and a wave of diseases.[16] The 1943 famine was not an isolated tragedy. Devastating famines impoverished India every 5 to 8 years in late 19th century and the first half of 20th century. Between 6.1 and 10.3 million people starved to death in British India during the 1876-1879 famine, while another 6.1 to 8.4 million people died during 1896-1898 famine.[64] The Lancet reported 19 million died from starvation and consequences of extreme poverty in British India, between 1896 and 1900.[65] Sir MacDonnell observed the suffering and poverty in 1900, and noted, \\"people died like flies\\" in Bombay.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nMinhas published his estimates of poverty rates in 1950s India as cyclical and a strong function of each year's harvest. Minhas disagreed with the practice of using calories as the basis for poverty estimation and proposed a poverty line based on real expenditure per year (Rs 240 per annum). In 1956-57, a good harvest year, he computed India's poverty rate to be 65% (215 million people).[67][68] For 1960, Minhas estimated the poverty to be 59%.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Working Group was formed in 1962 to attempt to set a poverty line for India.[70][71] This Working Group used calories required for survival, and income needed to buy those calories in different parts of rural India, to derive an average poverty line of Rs. 20 per month at 1960-61 prices.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimates of poverty in India during the 1960s varied widely. Dandekar and Rath, on the behalf of then Indian government, estimated that the poverty rate in 1960s remained generally constant at 41%. Ojha, in contrast, estimated that there were 190 million people (44%) in India below official poverty limit in 1961, and that this below-poverty line number increased to 289 million people (70%) in 1967. Bardhan also concluded that Indian poverty rates increased through the 1960s, reaching a high of 54%.[69][73] Those above the 1960s poverty level of Rs 240 per year, were in fragile economic groups as well and not doing well either. Minhas estimated that 95% of India's people lived on Rs 458 per year in 1963-64, while the richest 5% lived on an average of Rs 645 per year (all numbers inflation adjusted to 1960-61 Rupee).[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nDandekar and Rath[74] in 1971 used a daily intake of 2,250 calories per person to define the poverty line for India. Using NSSO data regarding household expenditures for 1960ÿ61, they determined that in order to achieve this food intake and other daily necessities, a rural dweller required an annual income of ? 170.80 per year (? 14.20 per month, adjusted to 1971 Rupee). An urban dweller required ? 271.70 per year (? 22.60 per month). They concluded from this study that 40 percent of rural residents and 50 percent of urban residents were below the poverty line in 1960ÿ61.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty alleviation has been a driver for India's Planning Commission's Task Force on Projections of Minimum Needs and Effective Consumption Demand of the Perspective Planning Division. This division, in 1979, took into account differences in calorie requirements for different age groups, activity levels, and sex. They determined that the average rural dweller needed around 2400 calories, and those in urban areas required about 2100 calories per person per day. To satisfy the food requirement, the Task Force estimated that a consumer spending in 1973ÿ74 of Rs.49.09 per person per month in rural areas and Rs.56.64 in urban areas was appropriate measure to estimate its poverty line.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty remained stubbornly high in India through the 1970s and 1980s. It created slogans such as Garibi Hatao (meaning eliminate poverty) for political campaigns, during elections in early 1970s through the 1980s.[77] Rural poverty rate exceeded 50%, using India's official poverty line for 1970s.[78][79]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother Expert Group was instituted in 1993, chaired by Lakdawala, to examine poverty line for India. It recommended that regional economic differences are large enough that poverty lines should be calculated for each state. From then on, a standard list of commodities were drawn up and priced in each state of the nation, using 1973ÿ74 as a base year. This basket of goods could then be re-priced each year and comparisons made between regions. The Government of India began using a modified version of this method of calculating the poverty line in India.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are wide variations in India's poverty estimates for 1990s, in part from differences in the methodology and in the small sample surveys they poll for the underlying data. A 2007 report for example, using data for late 1990s, stated that 77% of Indians lived on less than ? 20 a day (about US$0.50 per day).[81] In contrast, S.G.Datt estimated India's national poverty rate to be 35% in 1994, at India's then official poverty line of Rs 49 per capita, with consumer price index adjusted to June 1974 rural prices.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Saxena Committee report, using data from 1972 to 2000, separated calorific intake apart from nominal income in its economic analysis of poverty in India, and then stated that 50% of Indians lived below the poverty line.[82] The Planning Commission of India, in contrast, determined that the poverty rate was 39%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Council of Applied Economic Research estimated that 48% of the Indian households earn more than ?90,000 (US$1,309.70) annually (or more than US$ 3 PPP per person). According to NCAER, in 2009, of the 222 million households in India, the absolutely poor households (annual incomes below ?45,000 (US$650)) accounted for only 15.6% of them or about 35 million (about 200 million Indians). Another 80 million households are in the income levels of ?45,000 (US$650) to ?90,000 (US$1,300) per year. These numbers are similar to World Bank estimates of the \\"below-the-poverty-line\\" households that may total about 100 million (or about 456 million individuals).[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Suresh Tendulkar Committee set up to look into the people living under the poverty line in India submitted its report in November 2009.[84] It provided a new method of calculating the poverty line based on per capita consumption expenditure per month or day. For rural areas, it was Rs 816 per month or Rs 27 per day. For urban areas, it was Rs 1000 per month or Rs 33 per day. Using this methodology, the population below the poverty line in 2009-2010 was 354 million (29.6% of the population) and that in 2011-2012 was 269 million (21.9% of the population).[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its annual report of 2012, the Reserve Bank of India named the state of Goa as having the least poverty of 5.09% while the national average stood at 21.92%[9] The table below presents the poverty statistics for rural, urban and combined percentage below poverty line (BPL) for each State or Union Territory.[9] The highest poverty statistics for each category column is coloured light red in the table below.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Bank has reviewed its poverty definition and calculation methodologies several times over the last 25 years. In early 1990s, The World Bank anchored absolute poverty line as $1 per day. This was revised in 1993, and the absolute poverty line was set at $1.08 a day for all countries on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, after adjusting for inflation to the 1993 US dollar. In 2005, after extensive studies of cost of living across the world, The World Bank raised the measure for global poverty line to reflect the observed higher cost of living.[7] Thereafter, the World Bank determined poverty rates from those living on less than US$1.25 per day on 2005 PPP basis, a measure that has been widely used in media and scholarly circles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2014, after revisiting its poverty definition, methodology and economic changes around the world, the World Bank proposed another major revision to PPP calculation methodology, international poverty line and indexing it to 2011 US dollar.[2] The new method proposes setting poverty line at $1.78 per day on 2011 PPP basis. According to this revised World Bank methodology, India had 179.6 million people below the new poverty line, China had 137.6 million, and the world had 872.3 million people below the new poverty line on an equivalent basis as of 2013. India, in other words, while having 17.5% of total world's population, had 20.6% share of world's poor.[1][2] In October 2015, the World Bank updated the international poverty line to US$1.90 a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rangarajan Committee set up to look into the poverty line estimation in India submitted its report in June 2014.[86] It amended the calculation of the poverty line based on per capita consumption expenditure per month or day given by the Tendulkar Committee.[87] The new poverty threshold for rural areas was fixed at Rs 972 per month or Rs 32 per day. For urban areas, it was fixed at Rs 1407 per month or Rs 47 per day. Under this methodology, the population below the poverty line in 2009-2010 was 454 million (38.2% of the population) and that in 2011-2012 was 363 million (29.5% of the population).[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom November 2017, the World Bank started reporting poverty rates for all countries using two new international poverty lines: a \\"lower middle-income\\" line set at $3.20 per day and an \\"upper middle-income\\" line set at $5.50 per day. These are in addition to the earlier poverty line of $1.90 per day. The new lines are supposed to serve two purposes. One, they account for the fact that achieving the same set of capabilities may need a different set of goods and services in different countries and, specifically, a costlier set in richer countries. Second, they allow for cross-country comparisons and benchmarking both within and across developing regions. India falls in the lower middle-income category. Using the $3.20 per day poverty line, the percentage of the population living in poverty in India (2011) was 60%. This means that 763 million people in India were living below this poverty line in 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther measures such as the semi-economic Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which places 33% weight on education and number of schooling years in its definition of poverty, and places 6.25% weight on income and assets owned, suggests there were 650 million people (53.7% of population) living in MPI-poverty in India.[8] 421 million of MPI-defined poor are concentrated in eight North Indian and East Indian states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The table below presents this semi-economic poverty among the states of India based on the Multi-dimensional Poverty Index, using a small sample survey data for Indian states in 2005.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a 2011 poverty Development Goals Report, as many as 320 million people in India and China are expected to come out of extreme poverty in the next four years, with India's poverty rate projected to drop from 51% in 1990 to about 22% in 2015.[90] The report also indicates that in Southern Asia, only India is on track to cut poverty by half by the 2015 target date.[90]\\r\\nIn 2015, according to United Nation's Millennium Development Goals (MGD) programme, India has already achieved the target of reducing poverty by half, with 24.7% of its 1.2 billion people in 2011 living below the poverty line or having income of less than $1.25 a day, the U.N. report said. The same figure was 49.4% in 1994. India had set a target of 23.9% to be achieved by 2015.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Global Wealth Report 2016[92] compiled by Credit Suisse Research Institute, India is the second most unequal country in the world with the top one per cent of the population owning 58% of the total wealth.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nGlobal Hunger Index (GHI) is an index that places a third of weight on proportion of the population that is estimated to be undernourished, a third on the estimated prevalence of low body weight to height ratio in children younger than five, and remaining third weight on the proportion of children dying before the age of five for any reason. According to 2011 GHI report, India has improved its performance by 22% in 20 years, from 30.4 to 23.7 over 1990 to 2011 period.[94] However, its performance from 2001 to 2011 has shown little progress, with just 3% improvement. A sharp reduction in the percentage of underweight children has helped India improve its hunger record on the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2014. India now ranks 55 among 76 emerging economies. Between 2005 and 2014, the prevalence of underweight children under the age of five fell from 43.5% to 30.7%.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty: 2011-2012 Percentage of people by Caste[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nFindings below are based on a survey conducted during 2011-12.\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal population of India 1,276,267,631\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty in India based on caste.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty in India based on Social and Religious Classes.\\r\\nThe Sachar Committee looked at the Poverty by Social and Religious Classes[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject of the economic impact of British imperialism on India remains contentious. The issue was raised by British Whig politician Edmund Burke who in 1778 began a seven-year impeachment trial against Warren Hastings and the East India Company on charges including mismanagement of the Indian economy. Contemporary historian Rajat Kanta Ray argues the economy established by the British in the 18th century was a form of plunder and a catastrophe for the traditional economy of Mughal India, depleting food and money stocks and imposing high taxes that helped cause the famine of 1770, which killed a third of the people of Bengal.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1950s, the Indian government and non-governmental organisations have initiated several programs to alleviate poverty, including subsidising food and other necessities, increased access to loans, improving agricultural techniques and price supports,  promoting education and family planning. These measures have helped eliminate famines, cut absolute poverty levels by more than half, and reduced illiteracy and malnutrition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Indian economy has grown steadily over the last two decades, its growth has been uneven when comparing social groups, economic groups, geographic regions, and rural and urban areas.[99][100] For the year 2015-16, the GSDP growth rates of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh was higher than Maharashtra, Odisha or Punjab.[101] Though, GDP growth rate matters a lot economically, however, the debate is moving towards another consensus in India where unhealthy infatuation with GDP growth matters less and holistic development or all inclusive growth matters more.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite significant economic progress, one quarter of the nation's population earns less than the government-specified poverty threshold of ?32  per day (approximately US$ 0.6).[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the 2001 census, 35.5% of Indian households used banking services, 35.1% owned a radio or transistor, 31.6% a television, 9.1% a phone, 43.7% a bicycle, 11.7% a scooter, motorcycle or a moped, and 2.5% a car, jeep or van; 34.5% of the households had none of these assets.[104] According to Department of Telecommunications of India the phone density reached 73.34% by December 2012 and as an annual growth decreased by ?4.58%.[105] This tallies with the fact that a family of four with an annual income of ?137,000 (US$2,000) could afford some of these luxury items.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Bank's Global Monitoring Report for 2014-15 on the Millennium Development Goals says India has been the biggest contributor to poverty reduction between 2008 and 2011, with around 140 million or so lifted out of absolute poverty.[106]\\r\\nSince the early 1950s, Indian government initiated various schemes to help the poor attain self-sufficiency in food production. These have included ration cards and price controls over the supply of basic commodities, particularly food at controlled prices, available throughout the country. These efforts prevented famines, but did little to eliminate or reduce poverty in rural or urban areas between 1950 and 1980.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the main reasons for record decline in poverty is India's rapid economic growth rate since 1991.[17][18][108] Another reason proposed is India's launch of social welfare programs such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and the Midday Meal Scheme in government schools.[citation needed] Klonner and Oldiges, in a 2012 study, conclude that MGNREGA helps reduce rural poverty gap (intensity of rural poverty) and seasonal poverty, but not overall poverty.[109][110] However, there is a disturbing side, as deprivation has tended to increase, and that too among the most deprived sections. According to the latest statistics published by the Census of India, among scheduled tribes 44.7% of people were farmers working on their own land in 2001; however, this number came down to 34.5% in 2011. Among scheduled castes this number declined from 20% to 14.8% during the same period. This data is corroborated by other data from the census, according to which the number of people who were working not on their own land but on others' land (landless laborers), increased from 36.9% in 2001 to 44.4% among scheduled castes SC and from 45.6% to 45.9% among scheduled tribes.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomic and socio-economic","input":"How much of india is living in poverty?"},{"output":"Atal Bihari Vajpayee","context":"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is one of two major parties in the Indian political system, along with the Indian National Congress.[1] As of  2018[update], it is the country's largest political party in terms of representation in the national parliament and state assemblies.

The party won only two seats in the 1984 Indian parliamentary election, but grew in strength on the back of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, which was agitating to build a temple to the Hindu deity Rama at the site of the Babri mosque.[9] The National Democratic Alliance, led by the BJP, has held power in India on four occasions, including short-lived governments after elections in 1996 and 1998, a full five-year term between 1999 and 2003, and the current Indian government, which has held power since 2014.[6][10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President of the BJP is the highest authority within the party, and fills a number of roles, including chairing meetings of the National Executive of the party and appointing the presidents of party subsidiaries, such its youth wing and farmer's wing.[12] Any candidate for the presidency needs to have been a member of the party for at least 15 years.[13] The President is nominally elected by an electoral college composed of members drawn from the party's National and State councils, but in practice is a consensus choice of senior members of the party.[12] The term of the President is three years long, and individuals may not serve more than two consecutive terms.[13] The President usually does not also hold a post within a government, and party chiefs have resigned the position to assume posts in Cabinet.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the party's foundation in 1980, Atal Bihari Vajpayee became its first president.

Atatrk, President of Turkey, implemented a series of reforms, including secularisation and industrialisation, intended to \\"Europeanise\\" or Westernise the country.[15] During World War II, Turkey remained neutral until February 1945, when it joined the Allies. The country took part in the Marshall Plan of 1947, became a member of the Council of Europe in 1949,[16] and a member of NATO in 1952.[17] During the Cold War, Turkey allied itself with the United States and Western Europe. The Turkish expert Meltem Ah?ska outlines the Turkish position vis--vis Europe, explaining how Europe has been an object of desire as well as a source of frustration for Turkish national identity in a long and strained history.[18]\\r\\nThe country first applied for associate membership in the European Economic Community in 1959, and on 12 September 1963 signed the \\"Agreement Creating An Association Between The Republic of Turkey and the European Economic Community\\", also known as the Ankara Agreement. This agreement came into effect the following year on 12 December 1964. The Ankara Agreement sought to integrate Turkey into a customs union with the EEC whilst acknowledging the final goal of membership.[15] In November 1970, a further protocol called the \\"Additional Protocol\\" established a timetable for the abolition of tariffs and quotas on goods traded between Turkey and the EEC.[15]\\r\\nOn 14 April 1987, Turkey submitted its application for formal membership into the European Economic Community. The European Commission responded in December 1989 by confirming Ankaras eventual membership but also by deferring the matter to more favourable times, citing Turkeys economic and political situation, as well its poor relations with Greece and the conflict with Cyprus as creating an unfavourable environment with which to begin negotiations.[19] This position was confirmed again in the Luxembourg European Council of 1997 in which accession talks were started with central and eastern European states and Cyprus, but not Turkey. During the 1990s, Turkey proceeded with a closer integration with the European Union by agreeing to a customs union in 1995. Moreover, the Helsinki European Council of 1999 proved a milestone as the EU recognised Turkey as a candidate on equal footing with other potential candidates.\\r\\nThe next significant step in TurkeyÿEU relations came with the December 2002 Copenhagen European Council.[20] According to it, \\"the EU would open negotiations with Turkey 'without delay' if the European Council in December 2004, on the basis of a report and a recommendation from the Commission, decides that Turkey fulfills the Copenhagen political criteria.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe European Commission recommended that the negotiations should begin in 2005, but also added various precautionary measures. The EU leaders agreed on 16 December 2004 to start accession negotiations with Turkey from 3 October 2005.[21] While Austria and Germany initially wanted to leave open the possibility that negotiations with Turkey would lead to a privileged partnership, less than full membership, accession negotiations were ultimately launched with the \\"shared objective\\" of membership.[22]\\r\\nTurkey's accession talks have since been stalled by a number of domestic and external problems. Both Austria and France have said they would hold a referendum on Turkey's accession. In the case of France, a change in its Constitution was made to impose such a referendum, but later another constitutional change has enabled the parliament (if a large majority of its members agrees) to prevent such a referendum.[23] The issue of Cyprus continues to be a major obstacle to negotiations.[24] European officials have commented on the slowdown in Turkish reforms which, combined with the Cyprus problem, led the EUs Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn in March 2007 to warn of an impending train crash in the negotiations.[25] Due to these setbacks, negotiations again came to a halt in December 2006, with the EU freezing talks in 8 of the 35 key areas under negotiation.[26]\\r\\nIn December 2009, the Republic of Cyprus blocked 6 chapters of Turkish accession negotiations, including those on Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, Energy and Education and Culture, arguing that Turkey needs to first normalise relations with Cyprus.[27][28] As a result, no chapter have been opened since June 2010.[29][30][31] Hence, there is no chapter Turkey can open other than the difficult and economically detrimental chapters Competition Policy, Social Policy and Employment, and Public Procurement that most candidate countries open at the end of accession as all other chapters are blocked. In February 2013, Turkish Deputy Undersecretary of the Ministry for EU Affairs, Burak Erdenir, claimed that the EU had yet to communicate to Turkey the benchmark criteria for opening chapters 23 and 24, Judiciary & Fundamental Rights and Justice, Freedom & Security, which was to be done after screening of the chapters was completed in 2006, thus making it impossible to comply with them. He also suggested this was a deliberate attempt to slow their accession process.[32]\\r\\nAfter over 2 years of no chapter openings, the European Commission set up a \\"Positive agenda\\" designed to focus on common EU-Turkey interests. EU Commissioner for expansion Stefan Fle describes that the goal was \\"to keep the accession process alive and put it properly back on track after a period of stagnation which has been a source of frustration for both sides.\\"[33] The EU Commission mentioned a broad range of areas as the main elements of the Agenda such as intensified dialogue and cooperation on political reforms, visa, mobility and migration, energy, fight against terrorism, further participation of Turkey in Community programmes, town twinning, trade and the Customs Union and supporting efforts to align with the acquis, including on chapters where accession negotiations cannot be opened for the time being. The proposal was considered favorably on the condition that it serves as an instrument in support of and complementary to the negotiation process with the EU.\\r\\nIn the framework of Positive Agenda, Working Groups were established on 8 chapters (3-Right of Establishment and Freedom to Provide Services, 6-Company Law, 10-Information Society and Media, 18-Statistics, 23-Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, 24-Justice, Freedom and Security, 28-Consumer and Health Protection and 32-Financial Control). The Positive Agenda kick-off meeting was held on 17 May 2012 in Ankara with the participation of Stefan Fle, EU Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy. As a result of the Working Groups meetings held so far, a total of four closing benchmarks were confirmed to have been met by Turkey in three chapters (Company Law, Consumer and Health Protection and Financial Control chapters).[34][35]\\r\\nIn 2007, Turkey stated that they were aiming to comply with EU law by 2013,[36] but Brussels refused to back that as a deadline for membership.[37] In 2006 European Commission President Jos Manuel Barroso said that the accession process will take at least until 2021.[38] In a visit to Germany on 31 October 2012, Turkish Prime Minister R.T. Erdo?an made clear that Turkey was expecting membership in the Union to be realised by 2023, the 100th Anniversary of the Turkish Republic, implying that they could end membership negotiations if the talks had not yielded a positive result by then.[39] Turkish President Abdullah Gl said that upon completing the accession process Turkey will hold a referendum for Turkish membership in the European Union.[40]\\r\\nOn 20 June 2013, in the wake of Ankara's crackdown on mass demonstrations in Taksim Square, Germany blocked the start to new EU accession talks with Turkey.[41] According to the Financial Times, one Turkish official said that such a move could potentially break off political relations with the bloc.[41]\\r\\nA Eurobarometer poll in September 2013, which included EU countries and candidate countries as well, showed that 43% of Turks viewed the EU positively, as compared with 60% six months previously. In the same poll, 29% of Turks polled expressed support for an EU Constitution, the lowest level of support among EU countries and candidates polled.[42] Germany says that its reservation stems from a technical issue, but Angela Merkel, an opponent of Turkish entry into the EU, has described herself as \\"shocked\\" after Ankara's use of overwhelming police force against mostly peaceful demonstrators.[41] France stated that they would not waive their veto over unfreezing four accession chapters with Turkey until after elections for the European Parliament in June 2014.[43]\\r\\nThe crackdown following the 2016 Turkish coup d'tat attempt by President Erdogan damaged relations with the EU. Erdogan has indicated his approval of reinstating the death penalty to punish those involved in the coup, with the EU suggesting that this would end its EU ambitions. Erdogan stated in November 2016 that he was considering putting Turkey's continued negotiations with the EU on membership to a referendum in 2017.[44] In November 2016, the European Parliament voted in favour of a non-binding resolution to request that the European Commission temporarily suspend membership negotiations due to the \\"disproportionate repressive measures\\" of the government to the coup.[45] On 13 December, the European Council (comprising the heads of state or government of the member states) resolved that it would open no new areas in Turkey's membership talks in the \\"prevailing circumstances\\";[10] Turkeys path toward autocratic rule makes progress on EU accession impossible.[11]\\r\\nIn April 2017, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) voted to reopen its monitoring procedure against Turkey. This vote is widely understood to deal a major blow to Turkey's perspective of eventual EU membership, as exiting that process was made a precondition of EU accession negotiations back in 2004.[46]\\r\\nThe European Commissions long-term budget proposal for the 2021-2027 period released on 2 May 2018 includes a Western Balkan Strategy for further enlargement, but omits Turkey, thus treating Turkey as a neighbouring country rather than a candidate country.[14]\\r\\nTo accede to the EU, Turkey must successfully complete negotiations with the European Commission on 33 of the 35 chapters of the acquis communautaire, the total body of EU law. (Two chapters do not require negotiation.) Afterwards, the member states must unanimously agree on granting Turkey membership to the European Union.\\r\\n2 chapters with nothing to adopt\\r\\n1 chapter closed\\r\\nUntil the accession process is terminated, Turkey receives payments from the EU budget as pre-accession support, currently 4.5 billion allocated budget for the 2014ÿ2020 period (about 740 million Euros per year).[75]\\r\\nIn June 2017, the EU's financial watchdog, the European Court of Auditors, said it would start to probe how almost 1 billion Euro EU funds which Turkey received since 2007 to support rule of law, civil society, fundamental rights, democracy and governance were actually spent.[76] Turkish media commented that \\"perhaps it can explain why this money apparently failed to have the slightest effect on efforts to prevent the deterioration of democracy in this country\\".[77]\\r\\nThe problem of Turkey's membership of the EU is compounded by conflicting views as to what the EU should ultimately become.[78] This has played a significant role in the debate, due in part to the Eurozone crisis and the fact that as a result of this the eurozone and the EU overall is more federalised on both fiscal, legal and political levels than it was at the time of Turkey's application or at the time that Turkey was accepted as a candidate.[79] Generally those members of the EU who support a rights-based free trade bloc do not oppose Turkey as adamantly as those who support a broader political union. The latter, in particular, are concerned that unification would be frustrated and the European project threatened by Turkey's inclusion.[80]\\r\\nProponents of Turkey's membership argue that it is a key regional power[82][83] with a large economy and the second-largest military force of NATO after the United States[84][85] that will enhance the EU's position as a global geostrategic player and its Common Foreign and Security Policy;[86] given Turkey's geographic location and economic, political, cultural and historic ties in regions with large natural resources that are at the immediate vicinity of the EU's geopolitical sphere of influence; such as the East Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts, the Middle East, the Caspian Sea basin and Central Asia.[87][88]\\r\\nAccording to the former Swedish foreign minister, Carl Bildt, \\"the accession of Turkey would give the EU a decisive role for stability in the eastern part of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, which is clearly in the strategic interest of Europe\\".[89] Two of Turkey's key supporters for its bid to join the EU are Poland[90][91] and the United Kingdom.[92][citation needed]\\r\\nUpon joining the EU, Turkey's 76 million inhabitants would bestow the second-largest number of MEPs in the European Parliament.[25] Demographic projections indicate that Turkey would surpass Germany by 2020.[25] However, as a single country can only hold a maximum of 96 seats in the European Parliament, this would not give Turkey an advantage in the European Parliament.\\r\\nTurkey's membership would also affect future enlargement plans, especially the number of nations seeking EU membership,[25] grounds on which Valry Giscard d'Estaing has opposed Turkey's admission. Giscard has suggested that it would lead to demands for accession by Morocco. Morocco's application is already rejected on geographic grounds; Turkey, unlike Morocco, has 3% of its territory in Europe. The vast majority of its population lives in the Asian side of the country. On the other hand, the country's largest city, Istanbul, lies mostly in Europe. On the other hand, Cyprus, which is geographically located in Asia, joined the European Union in 2004. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy stated in January 2007 that \\"enlarging Europe with no limit risks destroying European political union, and that I do not accept ... I want to say that Europe must give itself borders, that not all countries have a vocation to become members of Europe, beginning with Turkey which has no place inside the European Union.\\"[93]\\r\\nEU member states must unanimously agree on Turkey's membership for the Turkish accession to be successful. In December 2011, a poll showed that as much as 71% of the participants surveyed in Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom were opposed to Turkey's membership in the European Union.[94] A number of nations may oppose it; notably Austria;[citation needed] Germany (chancellor Angela Merkel has long rejected Turkey's accession bid, and has proposed a \\"privileged partnership\\" instead);[95] and France (where some[who?] are anxious at the prospect of a new wave of Muslim immigrants, given the country's already large Muslim community).[96]\\r\\nNegotiations to remove the French constitutional requirement for a compulsory referendum on all EU accessions after Croatia resulted in a new proposal to require a compulsory referendum on the accession of any country with a population of more than 5% of the EU's total population; this clause would mainly apply to Turkey and Ukraine.[97] The French Senate, however, blocked the change in the French constitution, in order to maintain good relations with Turkey.[98] The current situation according to the French constitution is as follows: if ?3?5 of the delegates (from the Senate and the Parliament) agree to the accession of Turkey, there will be no referendum.\\r\\nUpon accession to the EU, Turkey expects to receive economic development aid similar to what Ireland, Greece and Portugal received.[citation needed] There is also an expectation that there will be an increase in European foreign investment in the Turkish economy, further driving economic growth. Additionally, in times of economic crisis, Turkey could expect economic assistance from the EU,[citation needed] similar to what Ireland, Greece and Portugal received after the 2008 financial crisis.\\r\\nFree movement of people across the EU will give many Turkish people the opportunity to easily migrate to other parts of Europe in search of work, or a higher standard of living. The option of migration out of Turkey will inevitably ease tensions in the east of the country, as the prospect of a better standard of living will tend to cool separatist tendencies. Some secularists in Turkey envisage that the accession of Turkey will contribute to the spread of secular western values in Turkey. Conversely, some non-secularists in Turkey envisage that accession will contribute to the further growth and acceptance of Islam in Europe. The EU accession bid has stimulated Turkey's political and legal reforms and intensified the democratisation process.[99]\\r\\nGiven Turkey's large and growing population, Turkey will have a correspondingly large representation in the European Parliament. This will give Turkey strong direct influence over EU policies. Membership in the EU will also increase Turkey's prestige regionally and internationally.\\r\\nTurkey has the world's 17th largest GDP-PPP[100] and 18th largest Nominal GDP.[101] The country is a founding member of the OECD and the G-20 major economies.\\r\\nTurkey has taken advantage of a customs union with the European Union, signed in 1995, to increase its industrial production destined for exports, while at the same time benefiting from EU-origin foreign investment into the country.[102] In 2008, Turkey's exports reached 141.8 billion USD[103] (main export partners: Germany 11.2%, UK 8%, Italy 6.95%, France 5.6%, Spain 4.3%, US 3.88%; total EU exports 56.5%.) However, larger imports amounting to about 204.8 billion USD[103] threaten the balance of trade (main import partners: Russia 13.8%, Germany 10.3%, China 7.8%, Italy 6%, USA 4.8%, France 4.6%, Iran 3.9%, UK 3.2%; total EU imports 40.4%; total Asia imports 27%).[104][105]\\r\\nAccording to Forbes magazine, Istanbul had a total of 37 billionaires in 2013, ranking 5th in the world behind Moscow (84 billionaires), New York City (62 billionaires), Hong Kong (43 billionaires) and London (43 billionaires).[106]\\r\\nThe opening of talks regarding the Economic and Monetary Policy acquis chapter of Turkey's accession bid was expected to begin in June 2007, but were stalled by France.[107] Turkey became the European Unions fifth-largest trade partner in 2015 according to data released by Eurostat.[108]\\r\\nTurkey is set to receive EUR 9.2bn from the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, a funding mechanism for EU candidate countries.\\r\\nAs of 2005[update], the population of Turkey stood at 71.5 million with a yearly growth rate of 1.5%.[109][110] The Turkish population is relatively young, with 25.5% falling within the 0ÿ15 age bracket.[111]\\r\\nTurkey's large population would alter the balance of power in the representative European institutions. Upon joining the EU, Turkey's 80 million inhabitants would bestow it the second largest number of MEPs in the European Parliament.[112][not in citation given] Demographic projections indicate that Turkey's population will surpass Germany's by 2020. This means Turkey would get the maximal number of representatives in the European Parliament, equal to Germany's.[112][not in citation given][dubious ÿ discuss]\\r\\nIf Turkey were to join the European Union, Istanbul would become the largest metropolis in the EU.\\r\\nCyprus was divided when, on 20 July 1974, Turkey invaded and occupied a third of the island in response to an Athens-engineered coup aimed at annexing Cyprus to Greece.[113][114] Since then, Turkey has refused to acknowledge the Republic of Cyprus (an EU member since 2004) as the sole authority on the island, and recognizes the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus since its establishment in 1983. The Turkish invasion in 1974 and the resulting movement of refugees along both sides of the Green Line, and the establishment of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983, form the core issues which surround the ongoing Cyprus dispute.\\r\\nTurkey and the Turkish Cypriots backed the 2004 Annan Plan for Cyprus aimed at the reunification of the island, but the plan was subsequently rejected by Greek Cypriots on the grounds that it did not meet their needs. According to Greek Cypriots, the latest proposal included maintained residence rights for the many Anatolian Turks who moved to Cyprus after the invasion (and their descendants who were born on the island after 1974), while the Greek Cypriots who lost their property after the Turkish invasion would be granted only a restricted right of return to the north following the island's proposed reunification.[citation needed] Although the outcome received much criticism in the EU as well, the Republic of Cyprus was admitted into the EU a week after the referendum.\\r\\nThe Turkish government has refused to officially recognise the Republic of Cyprus until the removal of the political and economic blockade on the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.[citation needed] Turkey's non-recognition of the Republic of Cyprus has led to complications within the Customs Union. Under the customs agreements which Turkey had already signed as a precondition to start EU membership negotiations in 2005, it is obliged to open its ports to Cypriot planes and vessels, but Turkey has not complied so far;[116] refusing to do so until the EU eases the international isolation of Northern Cyprus.[117] In February 2013, Turkish EU Minister Egemen Ba??? told the Republic of Cyprus, \\"if you truly want salvation, truly want peace, then remove your blockade of Ercan Airport to EU member countries and Turkey will open its ports to you.\\"[118]\\r\\nTurkeys refusal to implement a trade pact between Turkey and the EU that requires the Turkish government to allow Greek Cypriot vessels to use its air and sea ports has prompted the EU to freeze eight chapters in Turkey's accession talks.[116]\\r\\nIn November 2009, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Cemil ?i?ek declared that, should Turkey be forced to choose between supporting either EU membership or Turkish Cypriots, \\"[then] Turkeys choice will forever be to stand next to the Turkish Cypriots. Everybody should understand this.\\"[116]\\r\\nThe issue of Turkish membership has been contentious in Greece. Opinion poll of 2005, suggest that only 25% of Greeks believe Turkey has a place in the European Union.[119] The former Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis stated that Turkish membership of the EU could only be predicated upon, \\"full compliance, full accession\\" in December 2006.[120] In 2005 the European Commission referred to relations between Turkey and Greece as \\"continuing to develop positively\\"[121] while also citing a key barrier to progress being Turkey's ongoing claim of casus belli over a dispute about territorial waters boundaries.[121] In September 2017, Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, mentioned that halting accession talks with Turkey would be a strategic mistake by the European Union, amid a war of words raging between Germany and Turkey.[122] Also, former Greek Prime Minister, George Papandreou, has urged European Union leaders to keep the doors open to Turkey and to continue dialogue with the Turkish government, in an apparent reference to German Chancellor Angela Merkels calls for the suspension of accession talks with Turkey.[123]\\r\\nTurkey has a secular constitution, with no \\"official\\" state religion, although the chief imam (currently Mehmet G?rmez) is a civil servant and head of the Religious Affairs Directorate, or Diyanet.[124] 99% of the Turkish population is Muslim[125][126] of whom over 70% belong to the Sunni branch of Islam. A minority is affiliated with the Shi'a Alevi branch.[127] The Christians (Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, Gregorian, Syriac, Protestant) and Jews (Sephardic, Ashkenazi) were formerly sizable religious minorities in the country, until the genocide of Greeks, Armenians and Assyrians.[citation needed] Turkey would be the first Muslim-majority country to join the European Union.[128][129]\\r\\nOfficial population census polls in Turkey do not include information regarding a person's religious belief or ethnic background due to the regulations set by the Turkish constitution, which defines all citizens of the Republic of Turkey as Turkish in terms of nationality, regardless of faith or race.[130]\\r\\nThere is a tradition of secularism in Turkey. The state has no official religion nor promotes any, and actively monitors the area between the religions.[131] The constitution recognises the freedom of religion for individuals, whereas religious communities are placed under the protection of the state; but the constitution explicitly states that they cannot become involved in the political process (by forming a religious party, for instance) or establish faith-based schools. No party can claim that it represents a form of religious belief; nevertheless, religious sensibilities are generally represented through conservative parties.[131] Turkey prohibits by law the wearing of religious headcover and theo-political symbolic garments for both sexes in government buildings, schools, and universities;[132] the law was upheld by the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights as legitimate in the Leyla ?ahin v. Turkey case on 10 November 2005.[133] However, in 2010, the prohibition of wearing headscarfs in universities was lifted.\\r\\nCultural differences between Muslim majority Turkey and predominantly Christian Europe play an important part in the entire debate on Turkish accession to the European Union. In an analysis, based on the World Values Survey, the social scientists Arno Tausch and Almas Heshmati came to the conclusion that a robust measurement scale of global economic, political and social values and Turkey's place on them wields only a very qualified picture of Turkey's place on the maps of global values. The study, which is based on 92,289 representative individuals with complete data in 68 countries, representing 56.89% of the global population, looks at hard-core economic values in the countries concerned. From nine dimensions for the determination of the geography of human values, based on a promax factor analysis of the available data, six factor analytical scores to calculate a new Global Value Development Index were used, which combines: avoiding economic permissiveness; avoiding racism; avoiding distrust of the army and the press; avoiding the authoritarian character; tolerance and respect; and avoiding the rejection of the market economy and democracy. Turkey is ranked 25, ahead of several EU member countries. But there are still considerable deficits concerning the liberal values components, which are very important for an effective democracy. The deficits, the study argues, suggest that the Turkish state, Turkish civil society and European decision makers would be well advised to continue to support civil society and secular democracy in Turkey.[134]\\r\\nIn 2004, the French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier stated that Turkey must recognise the systematic massacres of Armenians in 1915 as a genocide.[135] However, he insisted that although France did not set a precondition for European Union entry regarding the matter, he stated that France would raise the issue during negotiations. The President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, stated that it must be a precondition for Turkey to recognise the systematic massacres of Armenians in 1915 as genocide.[136]\\r\\nThe government of Turkey rejects such a precondition for EU membership and does not accept it as a part of the EU membership criteria.\\r\\nIn 2006, the European Parliament voted against a proposal to formally add the issue as a membership criterion for Turkey.[137] A similar proposal by Greek and Greek Cypriot MEPs was also rejected by the European Parliament in 2011.[138]\\r\\nIn 2013, during the case of Perin?ek v. Switzerland, the European Court of Human Rights judged that \\"The existence of a genocide, which was a precisely defined legal concept, was not easy to prove. The Court doubted that there could be a general consensus as to events such as those at issue, given that historical research was by definition open to discussion and a matter of debate, without necessarily giving rise to final conclusions or to the assertion of objective and absolute truths.\\"[139]\\r\\nIn contravention of European Union directives on human rights, Turkey banned LGBT pride parades in 2015 and 2016.[140][141][142] Reasons given for the ban were security concerns, and religious sensitivities caused by holding the parade during the month of Ramadan.\\r\\nArticle 301 states that \\"a person who publicly insults the Turkish nation, the State of the Republic of Turkey, or the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, shall be punishable by imprisonment of between six months and two years\\" and also that \\"expressions of thought intended to criticise shall not constitute a crime.\\"\\r\\nThe EU was especially critical of this law during the September 2005 trial of novelist Orhan Pamuk over comments that recognised the deaths of thirty thousand Kurds and a million Armenians. Enlargement commissioner Olli Rehn and members of the European Parliament called the case \\"regrettable\\", \\"most unfortunate\\", and \\"unacceptable\\".[143] After the case was dropped three months later, Turkey's Foreign Minister Abdullah Gl indicated that Turkey may abandon or modify Article 301, stating that \\"there may be need for a new law\\".[144] In September 2006, the European Parliament called for the abolition of laws, such as Article 301, \\"which threaten European free speech norms\\".[145] On 30 April 2008, the law was reformed.[146] According to the reform, it is now a crime to explicitly insult the \\"Turkish nation\\" rather than \\"Turkishness\\"; opening court cases based on Article 301 require the approval of the Justice Minister; and the maximum punishment has been reduced to two years in jail.[146]\\r\\nKemal Kerin?siz, an ultra-nationalist lawyer, and other members of Byk Hukuk?ular Birli?i (Great Jurists Union) headed by Kerin?siz, have been \\"behind nearly all of [Article 301] trials.\\"[147] In January 2008, Kerin?siz was arrested for participating in an ultra-nationalist underground organisation, Ergenekon, allegedly behind the attacks on the Turkish Council of State and Cumhuriyet newspaper,[148] the assassination of several Christian missionaries and Armenian-Turkish journalist Hrant Dink,[149] as well as allegedly plotting the assassination of Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk.[150][151]\\r\\nTurkey gave women the right to vote in 1930 for municipal elections. In 1934 this right was expanded for the national elections, while women were also given the right to become elected as MPs in the Turkish Parliament, or for being appointed as Ministers, Prime Minister, Speaker of the Parliament and President of the Republic. In 1993 Tansu ?iller became the first female Prime Minister of Turkey.\\r\\nIn its second report on women's role in social, economic and political life in Turkey, the European Parliament emphasised that respecting human rights, including womens rights, is an essential condition for Turkey's membership of the EU. According to the report, Turkey's legal framework on women's rights \\"has in general been satisfactory, but its substantive implementation remains flawed.\\"[152]\\r\\nTurkey is one of two states (along with Azerbaijan) among the 47 members of the Council of Europe which refused to recognise the status of conscientious objectors or give them an alternative to military service.[153]\\r\\nPublic opinion in EU countries generally opposes Turkish membership, though with varying degrees of intensity. The Eurobarometer SeptemberÿOctober 2006 survey[154] shows that 59% of EU-27 citizens are against Turkey joining the EU, while only about 28% are in favour. Nearly all citizens (about 9 in 10) expressed concerns about human rights as the leading cause. In the earlier MarchÿMay 2006 Eurobarometer, citizens from the new member states were more in favour of Turkey joining (44% in favour) than the old EU-15 (38% in favour). At the time of the survey, the country whose population most strongly opposed Turkish membership was Austria (con: 81%), while Romania was most in favour of the accession (pro: 66%). On a wider political scope, the highest support comes from the Turkish Cypriot Community (pro: 67%) (which is not recognised as sovereign state and is de facto not EU territory and out of the European institutions). These communities are even more in favour of the accession than the Turkish populace itself (pro: 54%).[155] Opposition in Denmark to Turkish membership was polled at 60% in October 2007, despite the Danish government's support for Turkey's EU bid.[156]\\r\\nThe opening of membership talks with the EU in December 2004 was celebrated by Turkey with much fanfare,[157] but the Turkish populace has become increasingly sceptical as negotiations are delayed based on what it views as lukewarm support for its accession to the EU and alleged double standards in its negotiations particularly with regard to the French and Austrian referendums. A mid-2006 Eurobarometer survey revealed that 43% of Turkish citizens view the EU positively; just 35% trust the EU, 45% support enlargement and just 29% support an EU constitution.[158]\\r\\nMoreover, Turks are divided on whether to join at all. A 2007 poll put Turkish support for accession to the EU at 41.9% (up from 32% in 2006), with 27.7% opposed and 24.0% indifferent.[159] A 2009 poll showed that support for accession had risen to 48%, even as negative views of the EU had risen from 28% to 32%.[160] A 2013 poll showed Turkish support for the EU bid at one third of the population, and opposition to double that share.[161]\\r\\nAccording to the Transatlantic Trends survey for 2013, 60% of Turks have an unfavourable view of the European Union[162] and most Turks believe that working with Asia is more important to their national interests than working with Europe.[163] 44% of Turks believe EU membership could be good for the economy in contrast with 61% for EU citizens.[164] During an interview with Euractiv, EU Minister Egemen Ba??? stated that: \\"This is what Europe needs to do; they need to say that when Turkey fulfills all requirements, Turkey will become a member of the EU on date X. Then, we will regain the Turkish public opinion support in one day.\\"[165]\\r\\n\\"... under my Presidency of the Commission ... no further enlargement will take place over the next five years. As regards Turkey, the country is clearly far away from EU membership. A government that blocks Twitter is certainly not ready for accession.\\"","input":"When did turkey become a candidate for the eu?"},{"output":"Mitchel Field, Long Island, New York","context":"The First Air Force (Air Forces Northern; 1 AF-AFNORTH) is a numbered air force of the United States Air Force Air Combat Command (ACC). It is headquartered at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts primary mission is the air defense of the Contiguous United States (CONUS), United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.  Its mission lineage can be traced to the Air Defense Command, one of the original USAAF major commands formed in 1946.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the four original pre-World War II numbered air forces during the existence of the United States Army Air Corps, 1 AF was activated on 18 December 1940, at Mitchel Field, Long Island, New York with a mission of air defense of the Northeastern United States and Great Lakes regions.  During the war, its primary mission became the organization and training of combat units prior to their deployment to the overseas combat air forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Air Force is commanded by Lieutenant General R. Scott Williams.   Its Command Chief Master Sergeant is Chief Master Sgt. Richard D. King.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe command has sole responsibility for ensuring the air sovereignty and air defense of the Contiguous United States (CONUS), United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. As the CONUS Region (CONR) for NORAD, the bi-national North American Aerospace Defense Command, CONR provides air defense in the form of airspace surveillance and airspace control.\\r\\n\\r\\n1AF (AFNORTH) is also the designated air component for the United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM). USNORTHCOM's area of responsibility includes the continental United States, Alaska, Canada and Mexico, and its air, land and maritime approaches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe command is unique in both its mission and composition.  With the transfer of responsibility for continental air defense from the active duty component of the Air Force to the Air National Guard, 1 AF became the first numbered air force to be made up primarily of citizen airmen. Furthermore, the United States Air Force Auxiliary-Civil Air Patrol has been incorporated into the 1 AF.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Air Force has been an Air Combat Command organization since 1 June 1992. Its subordinate units are located throughout the continental United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnits aligned under First Air Force/AFNORTH include:\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, First Air Force provides operational control of alert Air National Guard air defense fighter units:\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-flying units\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the four original numbered air forces, First Air Force was activated as the Northeast Air District of the GHQ Air Force on 18 December 1940, at Mitchel Field, Long Island, New York. It was redesignated First Air Force on 9 April 1941 with a mission for the defense of the Northeast and Great Lakes regions of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the initial months after the Pearl Harbor Attack, First Air Force organized what would eventually become the core of the Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command (AAFSC), obtaining most of its forces from I Bomber Command to combat the German U-Boat threat along the Atlantic Coast.  AAFSC would eventually expand that mission to the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean until the antisubmarine mission was taken over completely by the Navy in mid-1943.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in May 1942, the mission of First Air Force became operational training of units and crews, and the replacement training of individuals for bombardment, fighter, and reconnaissance operations. It received graduates of Army Air Forces Training Command flight schools; navigator training; flexible gunnery schools and various technical schools, organized them into newly activated combat groups and squadrons, and provided operational unit training (OTU) and replacement training (RTU) to prepare groups and replacements for deployment overseas to combat theaters.  The First Air Force became predominantly a fighter OTU and RTU organization. Most P-47 Thunderbolt fighter groups were trained by I Fighter Command, along with P-39/P-63 Airacobra groups; C-47 Skytrain and later C-46 Commando groups by I Troop Carrier Command. By 1944, most of the Operational Training of groups ended, with the command concentrating on the training of individual replacements using Army Air Force Base Units (AAFBU) as training organizations at the airfields controlled by First Air Force.\\r\\n\\r\\nAir Defense Wings were also organized for the major metropolitan areas along the northeast coast, using training units attached to the Wings.  By 1944 the likelihood of an air attack along the eastern seaboard was remote, and these air defense wings were reduced to paper units.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1944, the vast majority of the USAAF was engaged in combat operations in various parts of the world, such as the Eighth Air Force in Europe and the Twentieth Air Force in the Pacific.  The training units located within the United States (known as the Zone of the Interior, or \\"ZI\\".) under First, Second, Third and Fourth Air Force were all were placed under the unified command of the Continental Air Forces (CAF) on 13 December 1944, with the Numbered Air Forces becoming subordinate commands of CAF.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 1946, USAAF Chief General Carl Spaatz had undertaken a major re-organization of the postwar USAAF that had included the establishment of Major Commands (MAJCOM), who would report directly to HQ United States Army Air Forces.  Continental Air Forces was inactivated, and First Air Force was assigned to the postwar Air Defense Command in March 1946 and subsequently to Continental Air Command (ConAC) in December 1948 being primarily concerned with air defense. First Air Force Headquarters was located at Fort Slocum, New York, from 1946 to 1949.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe command was originally assigned the region of the New England states, along with New York and New Jersey.  With the inactivation of the ADC Eleventh Air Force on 1 July 1948 due to budget restrictions, command's region of responsibility was increased to include the upper Midwest states of Michigan and Ohio, along with the Mid-Atlantic region south to the North Carolina/Virginia Border.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1949 Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units were placed under First Air Force command, with its active-duty units being reassigned to Eastern Air Defense Force (EADF) or to the 30th, 32d or 26th Air Divisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe command was inactivated on 23 June 1958 for budgetary reasons, its assigned units being reorganized under ConAC.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Air Force was reactivated at Stewart Air Force Base, Newburgh, N.Y., on 20 January 1966 due to the inactivation of the ADC Air Defense Sectors.  First Air Force assumed responsibility for the ADC 21st, 33d, 34th, 35th, and 36th Air Divisions, primarily located in the northeast and upper Midwest regions of the United States.  It also was responsible for the air defense of Greenland, Iceland and parts of Canada. By July 1968, First Air Force had again assumed total responsibility for the air defense of the eastern seaboard, just as it had during World War II.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 16 January 1968 Air Defense Command was re-designated Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM) as part of a restructuring of USAF air defense forces.  First Air Force's second period of service was short lived, however, and the command was again inactivated as the result of a major ADCOM reorganization on 31 December 1969 of the First, Fourth, Tenth Air Forces and several Air Divisions. This reorganization was the result of the need to eliminate intermediate levels of command in ADCOM driven by budget reductions and a perceived lessening of the need for continental air defense against attacking Soviet aircraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nADCOM reassigned the units under the inactivated First Air Force were reassigned primarily to the 20th, 21st or 23d Air Divisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of realignment of military assets. ADCOM was reorganized on 1 October 1979. The atmospheric defense resources (interceptors and warning radars) of ADCOM were reassigned to Tactical Air Command (TAC). With this move many Air National Guard units that had an air defense mission also came under the control of TAC, which established a component called Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC), at the level of a numbered air force.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 December 1985 HQ USAF reactivated First Air Force at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, and assigned it to Tactical Air Command (TAC), replacing ADTAC. First Air Force was given the mission to provide, train and equip combat ready air defence forces for the air defense of the North American continent.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon its reactivation, First Air Force was composed of units of the active Air Force and the Air National Guard. Because of its unique mission and its binational responsibilities, First Air Force works closely with the Canadian Forces. Canadian personnel are stationed at First Air Force Headquarters at Tyndall Air Force Base Florida, and at the various regional air defense sectors located throughout the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nActivation of the Continental NORAD Region on 1 October 1986, resulted in a new structure for North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).[10] The continental U.S. region, along with Alaskan and Canadian regions provided the command and operational system for North American air defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Air Defense Sectors were transferred by the Air Force to the National Guard Bureau and allotted to the Air National Guard on 1 October 1990.  They were operationally gained by First Air Force, Tactical Air Command.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Air Force was transferred to Air Combat Command along with the rest of TAC on 1 June 1992[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the years since its third activation, more of the responsibility for the defense of American air sovereignty has primarily shifted to the Air National Guard. Also, reorganization of the command structure of the U.S. Air Force saw the assignment of air defense to Tactical Air Command and later, its successor, Air Combat Command.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the role of the Air National Guard in the defense of North America increased. As this role changed, discussions between the active Air Force and the Air National Guard commenced concerning roles and responsibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Cold War began to wind down and budgetary constraints became realities, more and more of the missions previously carried out by active duty forces began to be transferred into the reserve components. By the 1990s, 90 percent of the air defense mission was being handled by the Air National Guard.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1997, First Air Force became a primarily composed of Air National Guard units charged with the air defense of the North American continent. Today, First Air Force consists primarily of members of the Air National Guard. Its headquarters is located at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. It comprises 10 fighter wings and two air defense sectors for the East and Western regions of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from the Air Force Historical Research Agency website http://www.afhra.af.mil/.","input":"Where was the first air force base located?"},{"output":"during the Three Kingdoms era (220ÿ280 AD)","context":"A hot air balloon is a lighter than air aircraft consisting of a bag, called an envelope, which contains heated air. Suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket (in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and (usually) a source of heat, in most cases an open flame. The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope. As with all aircraft, hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere. Unlike gas balloons, the envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air near the bottom of the envelope is at the same pressure as the surrounding air. In modern sport balloons the envelope is generally made from nylon fabric and the inlet of the balloon (closest to the burner flame) is made from a fire resistant material such as Nomex. Modern balloons have been made in all kinds of shapes, such as rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products, though the traditional shape is used for most non-commercial, and many commercial, applications.\\r\\nThe hot air balloon is the first successful human-carrying flight technology. The first untethered manned hot air balloon flight was performed by Jean-Fran?ois Pilatre de Rozier and Fran?ois Laurent d'Arlandes on November 21, 1783, in Paris, France,[1] in a balloon created by the Montgolfier brothers.[2] The first hot-air balloon flown in the Americas was launched from the Walnut Street Jail in Philadelphia on January 9, 1793 by the French aeronaut Jean Pierre Blanchard.[3] Hot air balloons that can be propelled through the air rather than simply drifting with the wind are known as thermal airships.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly unmanned hot air balloons were used in China. Zhuge Liang of the Shu Han kingdom, during the Three Kingdoms era (220ÿ280 AD), used airborne lanterns for military signaling. These lanterns are known Chinese lanterns (simplified Chinese: ^]; traditional Chinese: ^]??).[4]\\r\\nThe French brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-tienne Montgolfier developed a hot air balloon in Annonay, Ardeche, France, and demonstrated it publicly on September 19, 1783, making an unmanned flight lasting 10 minutes. After experimenting with unmanned balloons and flights with animals, the first balloon flight with humans aboard, a tethered flight, performed on or around October 15, 1783, by Jean-Francois Pilatre de Rozier who made at least one tethered flight from the yard of the Reveillon workshop in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Later that same day, Pilatre de Rozier became the second human to ascend into the air, reaching an altitude of 26?m (85?ft), the length of the tether.[5][6] The first free flight with human passengers was made a few weeks later, on November 21, 1783.[7] King Louis XVI had originally decreed that condemned criminals would be the first pilots, but de Rozier, along with Marquis Fran?ois d'Arlandes, petitioned successfully for the honor.[8][9][10] The first military use of a hot air balloon happened in 1794 during the battle of Fleurus, when the French used the balloon l'Entreprenant for observation.[11]\\r\\nModern hot air balloons, with an onboard heat source, were developed by Ed Yost, beginning during the 1950s; his work resulted in his first successful flight, on October 22, 1960.[12] The first modern hot air balloon to be made in the United Kingdom (UK) was the Bristol Belle, built in 1967. Presently, hot air balloons are used primarily for recreation. Hot air balloons are able to fly to extremely high altitudes. On November 26, 2005 Vijaypat Singhania set the world altitude record for highest hot air balloon flight, reaching 21,027?m (68,986?ft). He took off from downtown Mumbai, India, and landed 240?km (150?mi) south in Panchale.[13] The previous record of 19,811?m (64,997?ft) had been set by Per Lindstrand on June 6, 1988, in Plano, Texas.\\r\\nOn January 15, 1991, the 'Virgin Pacific Flyer' balloon completed the longest flight in a hot air balloon when Per Lindstrand (born in Sweden, but resident in the UK) and Richard Branson of the UK flew 7,671.91?km (4,767.10?mi) from Japan to Northern Canada. With a volume of 74 thousand cubic meters (2.6 million cubic feet), the balloon envelope was the largest ever built for a hot air craft. Designed to fly in the trans-oceanic jet streams, the Pacific Flyer recorded the fastest ground speed for a manned balloon at 245?mph (394?km/h). The longest duration record was set by Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard, Auguste Piccard's grandson; and Briton Brian Jones, flying in the Breitling Orbiter 3. It was the first nonstop trip around the world by balloon. The balloon left Chateau-d'Oex, Switzerland, on March 1, 1999, and landed at 1:02?a.m. on March 21 in the Egyptian desert 300 miles (480?km) south of Cairo. The two men exceeded distance, endurance, and time records, traveling 19 days, 21 hours, and 55 minutes. Steve Fossett, flying solo, exceeded the record for briefest time traveling around the world on 3 July 2002 on his sixth attempt,[14] in 320 h 33 min.[15] Fedor Konyukhov flew solo round the world on his first attempt in a hybrid hot-air/helium balloon from 11 to 23 July 2016[16] for a round-the world time of 272h 11m, as of 17?September?2016[update] awaiting official confirmation as the new record.[15]\\r\\nA hot air balloon for manned flight uses a single-layered, fabric gas bag (lifting \\"envelope\\"), with an opening at the bottom called the mouth or throat. Attached to the envelope is a basket, or gondola, for carrying the passengers. Mounted above the basket and centered in the mouth is the \\"burner\\", which injects a flame into the envelope, heating the air within. The heater or burner is fueled by propane, a liquefied gas stored in pressure vessels, similar to high pressure forklift cylinders.[17][18]\\r\\nModern hot air balloons are usually made of materials such as ripstop nylon or dacron (a polyester).[19]\\r\\nDuring the manufacturing process, the material is cut into panels and sewn together, along with structural load tapes that carry the weight of the gondola or basket. The individual sections, which extend from the throat to the crown (top) of the envelope, are known as gores or gore sections. Envelopes can have as few as 4 gores or as many as 24 or more.[20]\\r\\nEnvelopes often have a crown ring at their very top. This is a hoop of smooth metal, usually aluminium, and approximately 1?ft (0.30?m) in diameter. Vertical load tapes from the envelope are attached to the crown ring.\\r\\nAt the bottom of the envelope the vertical load tapes are sewn into loops that are connected to cables (one cable per load tape). These cables, often referred to as flying wires, are connected to the basket by carabiners.\\r\\nThe most common technique for sewing panels together is called the French felled, French fell, or double lap seam.[21][22][23][24] The two pieces of fabric are folded over on each other at their common edge, possibly with a load tape as well, and sewn together with two rows of parallel stitching. Other methods include a flat lap seam, in which the two pieces of fabric are held together simply with two rows of parallel stitching, and a zigzag, where parallel zigzag stitching holds a double lap of fabric.[23]\\r\\nThe fabric (or at least part of it, the top 1/3 for example) may be coated with a sealer, such as silicone or polyurethane, to make it impermeable to air.[25] It is often the degradation of this coating and the corresponding loss of impermeability that ends the effective life of an envelope, not weakening of the fabric itself. Heat, moisture, and mechanical wear-and-tear during set-up and pack-up are the primary causes of degradation. Once an envelope becomes too porous to fly, it may be retired and discarded or perhaps used as a 'rag bag': cold inflated and opened for children to run through. Products for recoating the fabric are becoming available commercially.[26]\\r\\nA range of envelope sizes is available. The smallest, one-person, basket-less balloons (called \\"Hoppers\\" or \\"Cloudhoppers\\") have as little as 600?m3 (21,000?cu?ft) of envelope volume;[27] for a perfect sphere the radius would be around 5?m (16?ft). At the other end of the scale, balloons used by commercial sightseeing operations may be able to carry well over two dozen people, with envelope volumes of up to 17,000?m3 (600,000?cu?ft).[27] The most-used size is about 2,800?m3 (99,000?cu?ft), and can carry 3 to 5 people.\\r\\nThe top of the balloon usually has a vent of some sort, enabling the pilot to release hot air to slow an ascent, start a descent, or increase the rate of descent, usually for landing. Some hot air balloons have turning vents, which are side vents that, when opened, cause the balloon to rotate. Such vents are particularly useful for balloons with rectangular baskets, to facilitate aligning the wider side of the basket for landing.[28]\\r\\nThe most common type of top vent is a disk-shaped flap of fabric called a parachute vent, invented by Tracy Barnes.[29] The fabric is connected around its edge to a set of \\"vent lines\\" that converge in the center. (The arrangement of fabric and lines roughly resembles a parachutethus the name.) These \\"vent lines\\" are themselves connected to a control line that runs to the basket. A parachute vent is opened by pulling on the control line. Once the control line is released, the pressure of the remaining hot air pushes the vent fabric back into place. A parachute vent can be opened briefly while in flight to initiate a rapid descent. (Slower descents are initiated by allowing the air in the balloon to cool naturally.) The vent is pulled open completely to collapse the balloon after landing.\\r\\nAn older, and presently less commonly used, style of top vent is called a \\"Velcro-style\\" vent. This too is a disk of fabric at the top of the balloon. However, rather than having a set of \\"vent lines\\" that can repeatedly open and close the vent, the vent is secured by \\"hook and loop\\" fasteners (such as Velcro) and is only opened at the end of the flight. Balloons equipped with a Velcro-style vent typically have a second \\"maneuvering vent\\" built into the side (as opposed to the top) of the balloon. Another common type of top design is the \\"Smart Vent,\\" which, rather than lowering a fabric disc into the envelope as in the \\"parachute\\" type, gathers the fabric together in the center of the opening. This system can theoretically be used for in-flight maneuvering, but is more commonly used only as a rapid-deflation device for use after landing, of particular value in high winds. Other designs, such as the \\"pop top\\" and \\"MultiVent\\" systems, have also attempted to address the need for rapid deflation on landing, but the parachute top remains popular as an all-around maneuvering and deflation system.\\r\\nBesides special shapes, possibly for marketing purposes, there are several variations on the traditional \\"inverted tear drop\\" shape. The simplest, often used by home builders, is a hemisphere on top of a truncated cone. More-sophisticated designs attempt to minimize the circumferential stress on the fabric, with different degrees of success depending on whether they take fabric weight and varying air density into account. This shape may be referred to as \\"natural\\".[30] Finally, some specialized balloons are designed to minimize aerodynamic drag (in the vertical direction) to improve flight performance in competitions.[31]\\r\\nBaskets are commonly made of woven wicker or rattan. These materials have proven to be sufficiently light, strong, and durable for balloon flight. Such baskets are usually rectangular or triangular in shape. They vary in size from just big enough for two people to large enough to carry thirty.[32] Larger baskets often have internal partitions for structural bracing and to compartmentalize the passengers. Small holes may be woven into the side of the basket to act as foot holds for passengers climbing in or out.[33]\\r\\nBaskets may also be made of aluminium, especially a collapsible aluminium frame with a fabric skin, to reduce weight or increase portability.[34] These may be used by pilots without a ground crew or who are attempting to set altitude, duration, or distance records. Other specialty baskets include the fully enclosed gondolas used for around-the-world attempts,[35] and baskets that consist of little more than a seat for the pilot and perhaps one passenger.\\r\\nThe burner unit gasifies liquid propane,[36] mixes it with air, ignites the mixture, and directs the flame and exhaust into the mouth of the envelope. Burners vary in power output; each will generally produce 2 to 3 MW of heat (7 to 10 million BTUs per hour), with double, triple, or quadruple burner configurations installed where more power is needed.[37][38] The pilot actuates a burner by opening a propane valve, known as a blast valve. The valve may be spring-loaded so that it closes automatically, or it may stay open until closed by the pilot. The burner has a pilot light to ignite the propane and air mixture. The pilot light may be lit by the pilot with an external device, such as a flint striker or a lighter, or with a built-in piezo electric spark.[39]\\r\\nWhere more than one burner is present, the pilot can use one or more at a time depending on the desired heat output. Each burner is characterized by a metal coil of propane tubing the flame shoots through to preheat the incoming liquid propane. The burner unit may be suspended from the mouth of the envelope, or supported rigidly over the basket. The burner unit may be mounted on a gimbal to enable the pilot to aim the flame and avoid overheating the envelope fabric. A burner may have a secondary propane valve that releases propane more slowly and thereby generates a different sound. This is called a whisper burner and is used for flight over livestock to lessen the chance of spooking them. It also generates a more yellow flame and is used for night glows because it lights up the inside of the envelope better than the primary valve.\\r\\nPropane fuel tanks are usually cylindrical pressure vessels made from aluminium, stainless steel, or titanium with a valve at one end to feed the burner and to refuel. They may have a fuel gauge and a pressure gauge. Common tank sizes are 10 (38), 15 (57), and 20 (76) US gallons (liters).[25] They may be intended for upright or horizontal use, and may be mounted inside or outside the basket.\\r\\nThe pressure necessary to force the fuel through the line to the burner may be supplied by the vapor pressure of the propane itself, if warm enough, or by the introduction of an inert gas such as nitrogen.[39] Tanks may be preheated with electrical heat tapes to produce sufficient vapor pressure for cold weather flying.[40] Warmed tanks will usually also be wrapped in an insulating blanket to preserve heat during the setup and flight.\\r\\nA balloon may be outfitted with a variety of instruments to aid the pilot. These commonly include an altimeter, a rate of climb (vertical speed) indicator known as a variometer, envelope (air) temperature, and ambient (air) temperature.[41] A GPS receiver can be useful to indicate ground speed (traditional aircraft air speed indicators would be useless) and direction.\\r\\nThe combined mass of an average system can be calculated as follows:[25]\\r\\nusing a density of 0.9486?kg/m3 for dry air heated to 210?F (99?C).\\r\\nIncreasing the air temperature inside the envelope makes it less dense than the surrounding (ambient) air. The balloon floats because of the buoyant force exerted on it. This force is the same force that acts on objects when they are in water and is described by Archimedes' principle. The amount of lift (or buoyancy) provided by a hot air balloon depends primarily upon the difference between the temperature of the air inside the envelope and the temperature of the air outside the envelope. For most envelopes made of nylon fabric, the maximum internal temperature is limited to approximately 120?C (250?F).[42]\\r\\nIt should be noted that the melting point of nylon is significantly greater than this maximum operating temperature  about 230?C (450?F)  but higher temperatures cause the strength of the nylon fabric to degrade more quickly over time. With a maximum operating temperature of 120?C (250?F), balloon envelopes can generally be flown for between 400 and 500 hours before the fabric needs to be replaced. Many balloon pilots operate their envelopes at temperatures significantly less than the maximum to extend envelope fabric life.\\r\\nThe lift generated by 100,000?ft3 (2831.7?m3) of dry air heated to various temperatures may be calculated as follows:\\r\\nThe density of air at 20?C, 68?F is about 1.2?kg/m3. The total lift for a balloon of 100,000?ft3 heated to (99?C, 210?F) would be 1595?lb, 723.5?kg. This is just enough to generate neutral buoyancy for the total system mass (not including the heated air trapped in the envelope, of course) stated in the previous section. Liftoff would require a slightly greater temperature, depending on the desired rate of climb. In reality, the air contained in the envelope is not all the same temperature, as the accompanying thermal image shows, and so these calculations are based on averages.\\r\\nFor typical atmospheric conditions (20?C, 68?F), a hot air balloon heated to (99?C, 210?F) requires about 3.91?m3 of envelope volume to lift 1?kilogram (62.5?ft3/lb). The precise amount of lift provided depends not only upon the internal temperature mentioned above, but the external temperature, altitude above sea level, and humidity of the air surrounding. On a warm day, a balloon cannot lift as much as on a cool day, because the temperature required for launch will exceed the maximum sustainable for nylon envelope fabric. Also, in the lower atmosphere, the lift provided by a hot air balloon decreases about 3% for each 1,000?meters (1% per 1,000?ft) of altitude gained.[43]\\r\\nStandard hot air balloons are known as Montgolfier balloons and rely solely on the buoyancy of hot air provided by the burner and contained by the envelope.[44] This style of balloon was developed by the Montgolfier brothers, and had its first public demonstration on 4 June 1783 with an unmanned flight lasting 10 minutes, followed later that year with manned flights.[45]\\r\\nThe 1785 Rozire balloon, a type of hybrid balloon, named after its creator, Jean-Fran?ois Pilatre de Rozier, has a separate cell for a lighter than air gas (typically helium,) as well as a cone below for hot air (as is used in a hot air balloon) to heat the helium at night. Hydrogen gas was used in the very early stages of development but was quickly abandoned due to the obvious danger of introducing an open flame near the gas. All modern Roziere balloons now use helium as a lifting gas.[46]\\r\\nSolar balloons are hot air balloons that use just solar energy captured by a dark envelope to heat the air inside.[47]\\r\\nTo help ensure the safety of pilot and passengers, a hot air balloon may carry several pieces of safety equipment.\\r\\nTo relight the burner if the pilot light goes out and the optional piezo ignition fails, the pilot should have ready access to a means of backup ignition, such as a flint spark lighter. Many systems, especially those that carry passengers, have completely duplicate fuel and burner systems: two fuel tanks, connected to two separate hoses, which feed two distinct burners. This enables a safe landing in the case of a blockage somewhere in one system or if a system must be disabled because of a fuel leak.\\r\\nA fire extinguisher suitable for extinguishing propane fires is useful. Most balloons carry a 1 or 2 ?kg AB:E type fire extinguisher.\\r\\nA handling or drop line is mandatory safety equipment in many countries. This is a rope or webbing of 20ÿ30 meters in length attached to the balloon basket with a quick release connection at one end. In very calm winds the balloon pilot can throw the handling line from the balloon so that the ground crew can guide the balloon safely away from obstructions on the ground.\\r\\nFor commercial passenger balloons, a pilot restraint harness is mandatory in some countries. This consists of a hip belt and a webbing line that together allow for some movement while preventing the pilot from being ejected from the basket during a hard landing.\\r\\nFurther safety equipment may include a first-aid kit, a fire blanket and a strong rescue knife.\\r\\nAt a minimum, the pilot should wear leather or flame-retardant fiber (such as nomex) gloves, so that they may shut off a gas valve in the case of a leak, even if there is a flame present; quick action in this regard can turn a potential catastrophe into a mere inconvenience. The pilot should additionally wear flame-resistant clothing covering their arms and legs; either natural fiber, such as cotton, linen, hemp, or wool, or engineered flame-retardant fiber, such as nomex, is acceptable in this capacity. Most engineered fibers (with the exception of rayon, which is also safe to wear) are thermoplastic; many are also hydrocarbons. This makes such fabrics very much unsuitable to wear near high temperatures, since non-flame-retardant thermoplastics will melt onto the wearer, and most hydrocarbons, whether fibrous or not, are suitable to use as fuels. Natural fiber will singe rather than melt or burn readily, and flame-retardant fiber generally has a very high melting point and is intrinsically non-flammable. Many pilots also advise their passengers to wear similar protective clothing that covers their arms and legs, as well as strong shoes or boots that offer good ankle support. Finally, some balloon systems, especially those that hang the burner from the envelope instead of supporting it rigidly from the basket, require the use of helmets by the pilot and passengers.\\r\\nThe ground crew should wear gloves whenever there is a possibility of handling ropes or lines. The mass and exposed surface to air movement of a medium-sized balloon is sufficient to cause rope friction burns to the hands of anyone trying to stop or prevent movement. The ground crew should also wear sturdy shoes and at least long pants in case of the need to access a landing or landed balloon in rough or overgrown terrain.\\r\\nAs with aircraft, hot air balloons require regular maintenance to remain airworthy. As aircraft made of fabric and that lack direct horizontal control, hot air balloons may occasionally require repairs to rips or snags. While some operations, such as cleaning and drying, may be performed by the owner or pilot, other operations, such as sewing, must be performed by a qualified repair technician and recorded in the balloon's maintenance log book.\\r\\nTo ensure long life and safe operation, the envelope should be kept clean and dry. This prevents mold and mildew from forming on the fabric and abrasion from occurring during packing, transport, and unpacking due to contact with foreign particles. In the event of a landing in a wet (because of precipitation or early morning or late evening dew) or muddy location (farmer's field), the envelope should be cleaned and laid out or hung to dry.\\r\\nThe burner and fuel system must also be kept clean to ensure safe operation on demand. Damaged fuel hoses need to be replaced. Stuck or leaky valves must be repaired or replaced. The wicker basket may require occasional refinishing or repair. The skids on its bottom may require occasional replacement.\\r\\nBalloons in most parts of the world are maintained in accordance with a fixed manufacturer's maintenance schedule that includes regular (100 flight hours or 12 month) inspections, in addition to maintenance work to correct any damage. In Australia, balloons used for carrying commercial passengers must be inspected and maintained by approved workshops.[48]\\r\\nIn the case of a snag, burn, or rip in the envelope fabric, a patch may be applied or the affected panel completely replaced. Patches may be held in place with glue, tape, stitching, or a combination of these techniques. Replacing an entire panel requires the stitching around the old panel to be removed, and a new panel to be sewn in with the appropriate technique, thread, and stitch pattern.\\r\\nDepending on the size of the balloon, location, and intended use, hot air balloons and their pilots need to comply with a variety of regulations.\\r\\nAs with other aircraft in the USA, balloons must be registered (have an N-number), have an airworthiness certificate, and pass annual inspections. Balloons below a certain size (empty weight of less than 155?pounds or 70?kg including envelope, basket, burners and empty fuel tanks) can be used as an ultralight aircraft.\\r\\nIn Australia, private balloon pilots are managed by the Australian Ballooning Federation[49] and typically become members of regional hot air ballooning clubs. Commercial operations carrying fare paying passengers or charging for promotional flights must operate under an Air Operators Certificate from the Australian Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) with a nominated Chief Pilot. Pilots must have different degrees of experience before they are allowed to progress to larger balloons. Hot air balloons must be registered aircraft with CASA and are subject to regular airworthiness checks by authorised personnel.[50]\\r\\nIn the UK, the person in command must hold a valid Private Pilot's Licence issued by the Civil Aviation Authority specifically for ballooning; this is known as the PPL(B). There are two types of commercial balloon licences: CPL(B) Restricted and CPL(B) (Full). The CPL(B) Restricted is required if the pilot is undertaking work for a sponsor or being paid by an external agent to operate a balloon. The pilot can fly a sponsored balloon with everything paid for with a PPL unless asked to attend any event. Then a CPL(B) Restricted is required. The CPL(B) is required if the pilot is flying passengers for money. The balloon then needs a transport category C of A (certificate of air worthiness). If the pilot is only flying sponsor's guests, and not charging money for flying other passengers, then the pilot is exempted from holding an AOC (air operator's certificate) though a copy of it is required.[clarification needed] For passenger flying the balloon also requires a maintenance log.\\r\\nIn the United States, a pilot of a hot air balloon must have a pilot certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and it must carry the rating of \\"Lighter-than-air free balloon\\", and unless the pilot is also qualified to fly gas balloons, will also carry this limitation: \\"Limited to hot air balloons with airborne heater\\". A pilot does not need a license to fly an ultralight aircraft, but training is highly advised, and some hot air balloons meet the criteria.\\r\\nTo carry paying passengers for hire (and attend some balloon festivals), a pilot must have a commercial pilot certificate. Commercial hot air balloon pilots may also act as hot air balloon flight instructors. While most balloon pilots fly for the pure joy of floating through the air, many are able to make a living as a professional balloon pilot. Some professional pilots fly commercial passenger sightseeing flights, while others fly corporate advertising balloons.[51]\\r\\nThe largest manufacturer of hot air balloons in the world is Cameron Balloons company of Bristol, England, which also owns Lindstrand Balloons of Oswestry, England. Cameron Balloons, Lindstrand Balloons and another English balloon manufacturing company, Thunder and Colt (since acquired by Cameron), have been innovators and developers of special shaped balloons. These hot air balloons use the same principle of lift as conventional inverted teardrop shaped balloons but often sections of the special balloon envelope shape do not contribute to the balloon's ability to stay aloft.\\r\\nThe second largest manufacturer of hot air balloons in the world is Ultramagic company, based in Spain, which produces from 80 to 120 balloons per year. Ultramagic can produce very large balloons, such as the N-500 that accommodates as many as 27 persons in the basket, and has also produced many balloons with special shapes, as well as cold-air inflatables.\\r\\nIn the USA Aerostar International, Inc. of Sioux Falls, South Dakota was North America's largest balloon manufacturer and a close second in world manufacturing before ceasing to build balloons in January 2007. The oldest U.S. certified manufacture is now Adams Balloons out of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Firefly Balloons, formerly The Balloon Works, is a manufacturer of hot-air balloons in Statesville, North Carolina. Another manufacturer is Head Balloons, Inc. of Helen, Georgia.\\r\\nThe major manufacturers in Canada are Sundance Balloons and Fantasy Sky Promotions. Other manufacturers include Kavanagh Balloons of Australia, Schroeder Fire Balloons of Germany, Kubicek Balloons of the Czech Republic, and LLopis Balloons of France.","input":"When was the first hot air balloon made?"},{"output":"Barclays Bank in its Enfield Town branch in North London, United Kingdom","context":"An automated teller machine, also known in the United States of America as an automatic teller machine[1][2][3] (ATM, American, British, Australian, Malaysian, South African, Singaporean, Indian, Maldivian, Hiberno, Philippines and Sri Lankan English), automated banking machine (ABM, Canadian English[4]), cash point (British English[5]), cashline, minibank, cash machine, tyme machine, cash dispenser, bankomat or bancomat, is an electronic telecommunications device that enables the customers of a financial institution to perform financial transactions, particularly cash withdrawal, without the need for a human cashier, clerk or bank teller.\\r\\nAccording to the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA),[6] there are now close to 3.5 million ATMs installed worldwide.[7]\\r\\nOn most modern ATMs, the customer is identified by inserting a plastic ATM card with a magnetic stripe or a plastic smart card with a chip that contains a unique card number and some security information such as an expiration date or CVVC (CVV). Authentication is provided by the customer entering a personal identification number (PIN) which must match the PIN stored in the chip on the card (if the card is so equipped) or in the issuing financial institution's database.\\r\\nUsing an ATM, customers can access their bank deposit or credit accounts in order to make a variety of transactions such as cash withdrawals, check balances, or credit mobile phones. If the currency being withdrawn from the ATM is different from that in which the bank account is denominated the money will be converted at an official exchange rate. Thus, ATMs often provide the best possible exchange rates for foreign travellers, and are widely used for this purpose.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of out-of-hours cash distribution developed from bankers' needs in Asia (Japan), Europe (Sweden and the United Kingdom) and North America (the United States).[9][10][11] Little is known of the Japanese device other than it was called \\"Computer Loan Machine\\" and supplied cash as a three-month loan at 5% p.a. after inserting a credit card. The device was operational in 1966.[12][13]\\r\\nIn the US patent record, Luther George Simjian has been credited with developing a \\"prior art device\\". Specifically his 132nd patent (US3079603), which was first filed on 30 June 1960 (and granted 26 February 1963). The roll-out of this machine, called Bankograph, was delayed by a couple of years, due in part to Simjian's Reflectone Electronics Inc. being acquired by Universal Match Corporation.[14] An experimental Bankograph was installed in New York City in 1961 by the City Bank of New York, but removed after six months due to the lack of customer acceptance. The Bankograph was an automated envelope deposit machine (accepting coins, cash and cheques) and did not have cash dispensing features.[15][16]\\r\\nIt is widely accepted that the first cash machine was put into use by Barclays Bank in its Enfield Town branch in North London, United Kingdom, on 27 June 1967.[17] This machine was inaugurated by English comedy actor Reg Varney.[18] This instance of the invention is credited to the engineering team led by John Shepherd-Barron of printing firm De La Rue,[19] who was awarded an OBE in the 2005 New Year Honours.[20][21] Transactions were initiated by inserting paper cheques issued by a teller or cashier, marked with carbon-14 for machine readability and security, which in a later model were matched with a six-digit personal identification number (PIN).[19][22] Shepherd-Barron stated; \\"It struck me there must be a way I could get my own money, anywhere in the world or the UK. I hit upon the idea of a chocolate bar dispenser, but replacing chocolate with cash.\\"[19]\\r\\nThe Barclays-De La Rue machine (called De La Rue Automatic Cash System or DACS)[23] beat the Swedish saving banks' and a company called Metior's machine (a device called Bankomat) by a mere nine days and Westminster Banks-Smith Industries-Chubb system (called Chubb MD2) by a month.[24] The online version of the Swedish machine is listed to have been operational on 6 May 1968, while claiming to be the first online ATM in the world (ahead of a similar claim by IBM and Lloyds Bank in 1971).[25] The collaboration of a small start-up called Speytec and Midland Bank developed a fourth machine which was marketed after 1969 in Europe and the US by the Burroughs Corporation. The patent for this device (GB1329964) was filed on September 1969 (and granted in 1973) by John David Edwards, Leonard Perkins, John Henry Donald, Peter Lee Chappell, Sean Benjamin Newcombe & Malcom David Roe.\\r\\nBoth the DACS and MD2 accepted only a single-use token or voucher which was retained by the machine while the Speytec worked with a card with a magnetic stripe at the back. They used principles including Carbon-14 and low-coercivity magnetism in order to make fraud more difficult.\\r\\nThe idea of a PIN stored on the card was developed by a group of engineers working at Smiths Group on the Chubb MD2 in 1965 and which has been credited to James Goodfellow (patent GB1197183 filed on 2 May 1966 with Anthony Davies). The essence of this system was that it enabled the verification of the customer with the debited account without human intervention. This patent is also the earliest instance of a complete \\"currency dispenser system\\" in the patent record. This patent was filed on 5 March 1968 in the US (US 3543904) and granted on 1 December 1970. It had a profound influence on the industry as a whole. Not only did future entrants into the cash dispenser market such as NCR Corporation and IBM licence Goodfellows PIN system, but a number of later patents reference this patent as \\"Prior Art Device\\".[26]\\r\\nDevices designed by British (i.e. Chubb, De La Rue) and Swedish (i.e. Asea Meteor) quickly spread out. For example, given its link with Barclays, Bank of Scotland deployed a DACS in 1968 under the 'Scotcash' brand. Customers were given personal code numbers to activate the machines, similar to the modern PIN. They were also supplied with S10 vouchers. These were fed into the machine, and the corresponding amount debited from the customer's account.\\r\\nA Chubb-made ATM appeared in Sydney in 1969. This was the first ATM installed in Australia. The machine only dispensed $25 at a time and the bank card itself would be mailed to the user after the bank had processed the withdrawal.\\r\\nAsea Metior's Bankomat was the first ATM installed in Spain on January 9, 1969 in downtown Madrid by Banesto. This device dispensed 1,000 peseta bills (1 to 5 max). Each user had to introduce a security personal key using a combination of the ten numeric buttons.[27] In March of the same year an ad with the instructions to use the Bancomat was published in the same newspaper.[28]\\r\\nAfter looking firsthand at the experiences in Europe, in 1968 the ATM was pioneered in the U.S. by Donald Wetzel, who was a department head at a company called Docutel.[21] Docutel was a subsidiary of Recognition Equipment Inc of Dallas, Texas, which was producing optical scanning equipment and had instructed Docutel to explore automated baggage handling and automated gasoline pumps.[29] In 1969 a venture capital consortium purchased Docutel with the aim of bringing its ATM to market without delay. By 1974, Docutel had acquired 70 percent of the U.S. market; but as a result of the early 1970s worldwide recession and its reliance on a single product line, Docutel lost its independence and was forced to merge with the U.S. subsidiary of Olivetti.\\r\\nWetzel was recognised by the United States Patent Office as having invented the ATM in the form of U.S. Patent # 3,761,682; the application had been filed in October 1971 and the patent was granted in 1973. However, the U.S. patent record cites at least three previous applications from Docutel, all relevant to the development of the ATM and where Wetzel does not figure, namely US Patent # 3,662,343, U.S. Patent # 3651976 and U.S. Patent # 3,68,569. These patents are all credited to Kenneth S. Goldstein, MR Karecki, TR Barnes, GR Chastian and John D. White.\\r\\nOn September 2, 1969, Chemical Bank installed the first ATM in the U.S. at its branch in Rockville Centre, New York. The first ATMs were designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a specially coded card.[30] A Chemical Bank advertisement boasted \\"On Sept. 2 our bank will open at 9:00 and never close again.\\"[31] Chemical's ATM, initially known as a Docuteller was designed by Donald Wetzel and his company Docutel. Chemical executives were initially hesitant about the electronic banking transition given the high cost of the early machines. Additionally, executives were concerned that customers would resist having machines handling their money.[32] In 1995, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History recognised Docutel and Wetzel as the inventors of the networked ATM.[33]\\r\\nThe first modern ATM was an IBM 2984 and came into use at Lloyds Bank, High Street, Brentwood, Essex, UK in December 1972. The IBM 2984 was designed at the request of Lloyds Bank. The 2984 Cash Issuing Terminal was the first true ATM, similar in function to today's machines and named by Lloyds Bank: Cashpoint. Cashpoint is still a registered trademark of Lloyds Banking Group in the UK, but is often used as a generic trademark to refer to ATMs of all UK banks. All were online and issued a variable amount which was immediately deducted from the account. A small number of 2984s were supplied to a U.S. bank. A couple of well known historical models of ATMs include the IBM 3614, IBM 3624 and 473x series, Diebold 10xx and TABS 9000 series, NCR 1780 and earlier NCR 770 series.\\r\\nThe first switching system to enable shared automated teller machines between banks went into production operation on February 3, 1979 in Denver, Colorado, in an effort by Colorado National Bank of Denver and Kranzley and Company of Cherry Hill, New Jersey.[34]\\r\\nThe newest ATM at Royal Bank of Scotland allows customers to withdraw cash up to S100 without a card by inputting a six-digit code requested through their smartphones.[35]\\r\\nATMs are placed not only near or inside the premises of banks, but also in locations such as shopping centers/malls, airports, grocery stores, petrol/gas stations, restaurants, or anywhere frequented by large numbers of people. There are two types of ATM installations: on- and off-premises. On-premises ATMs are typically more advanced, multi-function machines that complement a bank branch's capabilities, and are thus more expensive. Off-premises machines are deployed by financial institutions and Independent Sales Organisations (ISOs) where there is a simple need for cash, so they are generally cheaper single function devices. In Canada, ATMs (also known there as ABMs) that are not operated by a financial institution are known as \\"white-label ABMs\\".\\r\\nIn the US, Canada and some Gulf countries, banks often have drive-thru lanes providing access to ATMs using an automobile.\\r\\nMany ATMs have a sign above them, indicating the name of the bank or organisation owning the terminal and possibly including the list of networks to which it is connected.\\r\\nATMs can also be found in railway stations and metro stations. In recent times, countries like India and some countries in Africa are installing ATMs in rural areas, which are solar powered and do not require air conditioning.[36]\\r\\nMost ATMs are connected to interbank networks, enabling people to withdraw and deposit money from machines not belonging to the bank where they have their accounts or in the countries where their accounts are held (enabling cash withdrawals in local currency). Some examples of interbank networks include NYCE, PULSE, PLUS, Cirrus, AFFN, Interac, Interswitch, STAR, LINK, MegaLink and BancNet.\\r\\nATMs rely on authorization of a financial transaction by the card issuer or other authorizing institution on a communications network. This is often performed through an ISO 8583 messaging system.\\r\\nMany banks charge ATM usage fees. In some cases, these fees are charged solely to users who are not customers of the bank where the ATM is installed; in other cases, they apply to all users.\\r\\nIn order to allow a more diverse range of devices to attach to their networks, some interbank networks have passed rules expanding the definition of an ATM to be a terminal that either has the vault within its footprint or utilises the vault or cash drawer within the merchant establishment, which allows for the use of a scrip cash dispenser.\\r\\nATMs typically connect directly to their host or ATM Controller on either ADSL or dial-up modem over a telephone line or directly on a leased line. Leased lines are preferable to plain old telephone service (POTS) lines because they require less time to establish a connection. Less-trafficked machines will usually rely on a dial-up modem on a POTS line rather than using a leased line, since a leased line may be comparatively more expensive to operate compared to a POTS line. That dilemma may be solved as high-speed Internet VPN connections become more ubiquitous. Common lower-level layer communication protocols used by ATMs to communicate back to the bank include SNA over SDLC, TC500 over Async, X.25, and TCP/IP over Ethernet.\\r\\nIn addition to methods employed for transaction security and secrecy, all communications traffic between the ATM and the Transaction Processor may also be encrypted using methods such as SSL.[37]\\r\\nThere are no hard international or government-compiled numbers totaling the complete number of ATMs in use worldwide. Estimates developed by ATMIA place the number of ATMs currently in use at 3 million units, or approximately 1 ATM per 3000 people in the world.[38][39]\\r\\nTo simplify the analysis of ATM usage around the world, financial institutions generally divide the world into seven regions, due to the penetration rates, usage statistics, and features deployed. Four regions (USA, Canada, Europe, and Japan) have high numbers of ATMs per million people.[40][41] Despite the large number of ATMs, there is additional demand for machines in the Asia/Pacific area as well as in Latin America.[42][43] Macau may have the highest density of ATMs at 254 ATMs per 100,000 adults.[44] ATMs have yet to reach high numbers in the Near East and Africa.[45]\\r\\nThe world's highest ATM is located at the Khunjerab Pass in Pakistan. Installed at an elevation of 15,397 feet by the National Bank of Pakistan, it is designed to work in temperatures of up to -40 degree Celsius.[46]\\r\\nOne of the world's most northerly installed ATMs is located at Longyearbyen, Svalbard, Norway.\\r\\nThe world's most southerly installed ATM is located at McMurdo Station, located in New Zealand's Ross Dependency, in Antarctica since 1997.[47] There are two ATMs at McMurdo, but only one active at any time, that are owned by Wells Fargo[48] and serviced once every two years by NCR.[49]\\r\\nATMs are ubiquitous on modern cruise ships and can also be found on some US Navy ships.[50]\\r\\nAn ATM is typically made up of the following devices:\\r\\nDue to heavier computing demands and the falling price of personal computerÿlike architectures, ATMs have moved away from custom hardware architectures using microcontrollers or application-specific integrated circuits and have adopted the hardware architecture of a personal computer, such as USB connections for peripherals, Ethernet and IP communications, and use personal computer operating systems.\\r\\nBusiness owners often lease ATMs from service providers. However, based on the economies of scale, the price of equipment has dropped to the point where many business owners are simply paying for ATMs using a credit card.\\r\\nNew ADA voice and text-to-speech guidelines imposed in 2010, but required by March 2012[51] have forced many ATM owners to either upgrade non-compliant machines or dispose them if they are not upgradable, and purchase new compliant equipment. This has created an avenue for hackers and thieves to obtain ATM hardware at junkyards from improperly disposed decommissioned machines.[52]\\r\\nThe vault of an ATM is within the footprint of the device itself and is where items of value are kept. Scrip cash dispensers do not incorporate a vault.\\r\\nMechanisms found inside the vault may include:\\r\\nATM vaults are supplied by manufacturers in several grades. Factors influencing vault grade selection include cost, weight, regulatory requirements, ATM type, operator risk avoidance practices and internal volume requirements.[53] Industry standard vault configurations include Underwriters Laboratories UL-291 \\"Business Hours\\" and Level 1 Safes,[54] RAL TL-30 derivatives,[55] and CEN EN 1143-1 - CEN III and CEN IV.[56][57]\\r\\nATM manufacturers recommend that a vault be attached to the floor to prevent theft,[58] though there is a record of a theft conducted by tunnelling into an ATM floor.[citation needed]\\r\\nWith the migration to commodity Personal Computer hardware, standard commercial \\"off-the-shelf\\" operating systems and programming environments can be used inside of ATMs. Typical platforms previously used in ATM development include RMX or OS/2.\\r\\nToday, the vast majority of ATMs worldwide use a Microsoft Windows operating system, primarily Windows XP Professional or Windows XP Embedded.[citation needed][needs update] A small number of deployments may still be running older versions of the Windows OS, such as Windows NT, Windows CE, or Windows 2000.\\r\\nThere is a computer industry security view that general public desktop operating systems(os) have greater risks as operating systems for cash dispensing machines than other types of operating systems like (secure) real-time operating systems (RTOS). RISKS Digest has many articles about ATM operating system vulnerabilities.[59]\\r\\nLinux is also finding some reception in the ATM marketplace. An example of this is Banrisul, the largest bank in the south of Brazil, which has replaced the MS-DOS operating systems in its ATMs with Linux. Banco do Brasil is also migrating ATMs to Linux. Indian-based Vortex Engineering is manufacturing ATMs which operate only with Linux. Common application layer transaction protocols, such as Diebold 91x (911 or 912) and NCR NDC or NDC+ provide emulation of older generations of hardware on newer platforms with incremental extensions made over time to address new capabilities, although companies like NCR continuously improve these protocols issuing newer versions (e.g. NCR's AANDC v3.x.y, where x.y are subversions). Most major ATM manufacturers provide software packages that implement these protocols. Newer protocols such as IFX have yet to find wide acceptance by transaction processors.[60]\\r\\nWith the move to a more standardised software base, financial institutions have been increasingly interested in the ability to pick and choose the application programs that drive their equipment. WOSA/XFS, now known as CEN XFS (or simply XFS), provides a common API for accessing and manipulating the various devices of an ATM. J/XFS is a Java implementation of the CEN XFS API.\\r\\nWhile the perceived benefit of XFS is similar to the Java's \\"Write once, run anywhere\\" mantra, often different ATM hardware vendors have different interpretations of the XFS standard. The result of these differences in interpretation means that ATM applications typically use a middleware to even out the differences among various platforms.\\r\\nWith the onset of Windows operating systems and XFS on ATMs, the software applications have the ability to become more intelligent. This has created a new breed of ATM applications commonly referred to as programmable applications. These types of applications allows for an entirely new host of applications in which the ATM terminal can do more than only communicate with the ATM switch. It is now empowered to connected to other content servers and video banking systems.\\r\\nNotable ATM software that operates on XFS platforms include Triton PRISM, Diebold Agilis EmPower, NCR APTRA Edge, Absolute Systems AbsoluteINTERACT, KAL Kalignite Software Platform, Phoenix Interactive VISTAatm, Wincor Nixdorf ProTopas, Euronet EFTS and Intertech inter-ATM.\\r\\nWith the move of ATMs to industry-standard computing environments, concern has risen about the integrity of the ATM's software stack.[61]\\r\\nSecurity, as it relates to ATMs, has several dimensions. ATMs also provide a practical demonstration of a number of security systems and concepts operating together and how various security concerns are addressed.\\r\\nEarly ATM security focused on making the terminals invulnerable to physical attack; they were effectively safes with dispenser mechanisms. A number of attacks resulted, with thieves attempting to steal entire machines by ram-raiding.[62] Since late 1990s, criminal groups operating in Japan improved ram-raiding by stealing and using a truck loaded with heavy construction machinery to effectively demolish or uproot an entire ATM and any housing to steal its cash.\\r\\nAnother attack method, plofkraak, is to seal all openings of the ATM with silicone and fill the vault with a combustible gas or to place an explosive inside, attached, or near the machine. This gas or explosive is ignited and the vault is opened or distorted by the force of the resulting explosion and the criminals can break in.[63] This type of theft has occurred in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Denmark, Germany and Australia.[64][65] These types of attacks can be prevented by a number of gas explosion prevention devices also known as gas suppression system. These systems use explosive gas detection sensor to detect explosive gas and to neutralise it by releasing a special explosion suppression chemical which changes the composition of the explosive gas and renders it ineffective.\\r\\nSeveral attacks in the UK (at least one of which was successful) have involved digging a concealed tunnel under the ATM and cutting through the reinforced base to remove the money.[66]\\r\\nModern ATM physical security, per other modern money-handling security, concentrates on denying the use of the money inside the machine to a thief, by using different types of Intelligent Banknote Neutralisation Systems.\\r\\nA common method is to simply rob the staff filling the machine with money. To avoid this, the schedule for filling them is kept secret, varying and random. The money is often kept in cassettes, which will dye the money if incorrectly opened.\\r\\nThe security of ATM transactions relies mostly on the integrity of the secure cryptoprocessor: the ATM often uses general commodity components that sometimes are not considered to be \\"trusted systems\\".\\r\\nEncryption of personal information, required by law in many jurisdictions, is used to prevent fraud. Sensitive data in ATM transactions are usually encrypted with DES, but transaction processors now usually require the use of Triple DES.[67] Remote Key Loading techniques may be used to ensure the secrecy of the initialisation of the encryption keys in the ATM. Message Authentication Code (MAC) or Partial MAC may also be used to ensure messages have not been tampered with while in transit between the ATM and the financial network.\\r\\nThere have also been a number of incidents of fraud by Man-in-the-middle attacks, where criminals have attached fake keypads or card readers to existing machines. These have then been used to record customers' PINs and bank card information in order to gain unauthorised access to their accounts. Various ATM manufacturers have put in place countermeasures to protect the equipment they manufacture from these threats.[68][69]\\r\\nAlternative methods to verify cardholder identities have been tested and deployed in some countries, such as finger and palm vein patterns,[70] iris, and facial recognition technologies. Cheaper mass-produced equipment has been developed and is being installed in machines globally that detect the presence of foreign objects on the front of ATMs, current tests have shown 99% detection success for all types of skimming devices.[71]\\r\\nOpenings on the customer side of ATMs are often covered by mechanical shutters to prevent tampering with the mechanisms when they are not in use. Alarm sensors are placed inside ATMs and their servicing areas to alert their operators when doors have been opened by unauthorised personnel.\\r\\nTo protect against hackers, ATMs have a built-in firewall. Once the firewall has detected malicious attempts to break into the machine remotely, the firewall locks down the machine.\\r\\nRules are usually set by the government or ATM operating body that dictate what happens when integrity systems fail. Depending on the jurisdiction, a bank may or may not be liable when an attempt is made to dispense a customer's money from an ATM and the money either gets outside of the ATM's vault, or was exposed in a non-secure fashion, or they are unable to determine the state of the money after a failed transaction.[72] Customers often commented that it is difficult to recover money lost in this way, but this is often complicated by the policies regarding suspicious activities typical of the criminal element.[73]\\r\\nIn some countries, multiple security cameras and security guards are a common feature.[74] In the United States, The New York State Comptroller's Office has advised the New York State Department of Banking to have more thorough safety inspections of ATMs in high crime areas.[75]\\r\\nConsultants of ATM operators assert that the issue of customer security should have more focus by the banking industry;[76] it has been suggested that efforts are now more concentrated on the preventive measure of deterrent legislation than on the problem of ongoing forced withdrawals.[77]\\r\\nAt least as far back as July 30, 1986, consultants of the industry have advised for the adoption of an emergency PIN system for ATMs, where the user is able to send a silent alarm in response to a threat.[78] Legislative efforts to require an emergency PIN system have appeared in Illinois,[79] Kansas[80] and Georgia,[81] but none have succeeded yet. In January 2009, Senate Bill 1355 was proposed in the Illinois Senate that revisits the issue of the reverse emergency PIN system.[82] The bill is again supported by the police and denied by the banking lobby.[83]\\r\\nIn 1998, three towns outside Cleveland, Ohio, in response to an ATM crime wave, adopted legislation requiring that an emergency telephone number switch be installed at all outdoor ATMs within their jurisdiction. In the wake of a homicide in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, the city council passed an ATM security bill as well.\\r\\nIn China and elsewhere, many efforts to promote security have been made. On-premises ATMs are often located inside the bank's lobby, which may be accessible 24 hours a day. These lobbies have extensive security camera coverage, a courtesy telephone for consulting with the bank staff, and a security guard on the premises. Bank lobbies that are not guarded 24 hours a day may also have secure doors that can only be opened from outside by swiping the bank card against a wall-mounted scanner, allowing the bank to identify which card enters the building. Most ATMs will also display on-screen safety warnings and may also be fitted with convex mirrors above the display allowing the user to see what is happening behind them.\\r\\nAs of 2013, the only claim available about the extent of ATM-connected homicides is that they range from 500 to 1,000 per year in the US, covering only cases where the victim had an ATM card and the card was used by the killer after the known time of death.[84]\\r\\nOriginally developed as cash dispensers, ATMs have evolved to include many other bank-related functions:\\r\\nIn some countries, especially those which benefit from a fully integrated cross-bank network (e.g.: Multibanco in Portugal), ATMs include many functions that are not directly related to the management of one's own bank account, such as:\\r\\nIncreasingly, banks are seeking to use the ATM as a sales device to deliver pre approved loans and targeted advertising using products such as ITM (the Intelligent Teller Machine) from Aptra Relate from NCR.[89] ATMs can also act as an advertising channel for other companies.[90]*\\r\\nHowever, several different ATM technologies have not yet reached worldwide acceptance, such as:\\r\\nIn Canada, ATMs are called guichets automatiques in French and sometimes \\"bank machines\\" in English. The Interac-shared cash network does not allow for the selling of goods from ATMs, due to specific security requirements for PIN entry when buying goods.[101] CIBC machines in Canada, are able to top-up the minutes on certain pay as you go phones.\\r\\nBefore an ATM is placed in a public place, it typically has undergone extensive testing with both test money and the backend computer systems that allow it to perform transactions. Banking customers also have come to expect high reliability in their ATMs,[102] which provides incentives to ATM providers to minimise machine and network failures. Financial consequences of incorrect machine operation also provide high degrees of incentive to minimise malfunctions.[103]\\r\\nATMs and the supporting electronic financial networks are generally very reliable, with industry benchmarks typically producing 98.25% customer availability for ATMs[104] and up to 99.999% availability for host systems that manage the networks of ATMs. If ATM networks do go out of service, customers could be left without the ability to make transactions until the beginning of their bank's next time of opening hours.\\r\\nThis said, not all errors are to the detriment of customers; there have been cases of machines giving out money without debiting the account, or giving out higher value notes as a result of incorrect denomination of banknote being loaded in the money cassettes.[105] The result of receiving too much money may be influenced by the card holder agreement in place between the customer and the bank.[106][107]\\r\\nErrors that can occur may be mechanical (such as card transport mechanisms; keypads; hard disk failures; envelope deposit mechanisms); software (such as operating system; device driver; application); communications; or purely down to operator error.\\r\\nTo aid in reliability, some ATMs print each transaction to a roll-paper journal that is stored inside the ATM, which allows its users and the related financial institutions to settle things based on the records in the journal in case there is a dispute. In some cases, transactions are posted to an electronic journal to remove the cost of supplying journal paper to the ATM and for more convenient searching of data.\\r\\nImproper money checking can cause the possibility of a customer receiving counterfeit banknotes from an ATM. While bank personnel are generally trained better at spotting and removing counterfeit cash,[108][109] the resulting ATM money supplies used by banks provide no guarantee for proper banknotes, as the Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany has confirmed that there are regularly incidents of false banknotes having been dispensed through ATMs.[110] Some ATMs may be stocked and wholly owned by outside companies, which can further complicate this problem. Bill validation technology can be used by ATM providers to help ensure the authenticity of the cash before it is stocked in the machine; those with cash recycling capabilities include this capability.[111]\\r\\nAs with any device containing objects of value, ATMs and the systems they depend on to function are the targets of fraud. Fraud against ATMs and people's attempts to use them takes several forms.\\r\\nThe first known instance of a fake ATM was installed at a shopping mall in Manchester, Connecticut in 1993. By modifying the inner workings of a Fujitsu model 7020 ATM, a criminal gang known as the Bucklands Boys stole information from cards inserted into the machine by customers.[112]\\r\\nWAVY-TV reported an incident in Virginia Beach in September 2006 where a hacker who had probably obtained a factory-default administrator password for a filling station's white-label ATM caused the unit to assume it was loaded with US$5 bills instead of $20s, enabling himselfand many subsequent customersto walk away with four times the money withdrawn from their accounts.[113] This type of scam was featured on the TV series The Real Hustle.\\r\\nATM behaviour can change during what is called \\"stand-in\\" time, where the bank's cash dispensing network is unable to access databases that contain account information (possibly for database maintenance). In order to give customers access to cash, customers may be allowed to withdraw cash up to a certain amount that may be less than their usual daily withdrawal limit, but may still exceed the amount of available money in their accounts, which could result in fraud if the customers intentionally withdraw more money than what they had in their accounts.[114]\\r\\nIn an attempt to prevent criminals from shoulder surfing the customer's personal identification number (PIN), some banks draw privacy areas on the floor.\\r\\nFor a low-tech form of fraud, the easiest is to simply steal a customer's card along with its PIN. A later variant of this approach is to trap the card inside of the ATM's card reader with a device often referred to as a Lebanese loop. When the customer gets frustrated by not getting the card back and walks away from the machine, the criminal is able to remove the card and withdraw cash from the customer's account, using the card and its PIN.\\r\\nThis type of fraud has spread globally. Although somewhat replaced in terms of volume by skimming incidents, a re-emergence of card trapping has been noticed in regions such as Europe, where EMV chip and PIN cards have increased in circulation.[115]\\r\\nAnother simple form of fraud involves attempting to get the customer's bank to issue a new card and its PIN and stealing them from their mail.[116]\\r\\nBy contrast, a newer high-tech method of operating, sometimes called card skimming or card cloning, involves the installation of a magnetic card reader over the real ATM's card slot and the use of a wireless surveillance camera or a modified digital camera or a false PIN keypad to observe the user's PIN. Card data is then cloned into a duplicate card and the criminal attempts a standard cash withdrawal. The availability of low-cost commodity wireless cameras, keypads, card readers, and card writers has made it a relatively simple form of fraud, with comparatively low risk to the fraudsters.[117]\\r\\nIn an attempt to stop these practices, countermeasures against card cloning have been developed by the banking industry, in particular by the use of smart cards which cannot easily be copied or spoofed by unauthenticated devices, and by attempting to make the outside of their ATMs tamper evident. Older chip-card security systems include the French Carte Bleue, Visa Cash, Mondex, Blue from American Express[118] and EMV '96 or EMV 3.11. The most actively developed form of smart card security in the industry today is known as EMV 2000 or EMV 4.x.\\r\\nEMV is widely used in the UK (Chip and PIN) and other parts of Europe, but when it is not available in a specific area, ATMs must fall back to using the easyÿtoÿcopy magnetic stripe to perform transactions. This fallback behaviour can be exploited.[119] However, the fallback option has been removed on the ATMs of some UK banks, meaning if the chip is not read, the transaction will be declined.\\r\\nCard cloning and skimming can be detected by the implementation of magnetic card reader heads and firmware that can read a signature embedded in all magnetic stripes during the card production process. This signature, known as a \\"MagnePrint\\" or \\"BluPrint\\", can be used in conjunction with common two-factor authentication schemes used in ATM, debit/retail point-of-sale and prepaid card applications.\\r\\nThe concept and various methods of copying the contents of an ATM card's magnetic stripe onto a duplicate card to access other people's financial information was well known in the hacking communities by late 1990.[120]\\r\\nIn 1996, Andrew Stone, a computer security consultant from Hampshire in the UK, was convicted of stealing more than S1?million by pointing high-definition video cameras at ATMs from a considerable distance and recording the card numbers, expiry dates, etc. from the embossed detail on the ATM cards along with video footage of the PINs being entered. After getting all the information from the videotapes, he was able to produce clone cards which not only allowed him to withdraw the full daily limit for each account, but also allowed him to sidestep withdrawal limits by using multiple copied cards. In court, it was shown that he could withdraw as much as S10,000 per hour by using this method. Stone was sentenced to five years and six months in prison.[121]\\r\\nA talking ATM is a type of ATM that provides audible instructions so that people who cannot read a screen can independently use the machine, therefore effectively eliminating the need for assistance from an external, potentially malevolent source. All audible information is delivered privately through a standard headphone jack on the face of the machine. Alternatively, some banks such as the Nordea and Swedbank use a built-in external speaker which may be invoked by pressing the talk button on the keypad.[122] Information is delivered to the customer either through pre-recorded sound files or via text-to-speech speech synthesis.\\r\\nA postal interactive kiosk may share many components of an ATM (including a vault), but it only dispenses items related to postage.[123][124]\\r\\nA scrip cash dispenser may have many components in common with an ATM, but it lacks the ability to dispense physical cash and consequently requires no vault. Instead, the customer requests a withdrawal transaction from the machine, which prints a receipt. The customer then takes this receipt to a nearby sales clerk, who then exchanges it for cash from the till.[125]\\r\\nA teller assist unit (TAU) is distinct in that it is designed to be operated solely by trained personnel and not by the general public, does integrate directly into interbank networks, and usually is controlled by a computer that is not directly integrated into the overall construction of the unit.\\r\\nA Web ATM is an online interface for ATM card banking that uses a smart card reader. All the usual ATM functions are available, except for withdrawing cash. Most banks in Taiwan provide these online services.[126][127]","input":"Where was the first atm cash machine launched?"},{"output":"AD 64","context":"The Great Fire of Rome was an urban fire in the year AD 64. It caused widespread devastation, before being brought under control after six days. Differing accounts either blame Emperor Nero for initiating the fire or credit him with organizing measures to contain it and provide relief for refugees. According to Tacitus and later Christians, Nero blamed the devastation on the Christian community in the city, initiating the empire's first persecution against the Christians.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe varying historical accounts of the event come from three secondary sourcesCassius Dio, Suetonius and Tacitus. The primary accounts, which possibly included histories written by Fabius Rusticus, Marcus Cluvius Rufus and Pliny the Elder, did not survive. At least five separate stories circulated regarding Nero and the fire:\\r\\nTacitus describes the fire as beginning in shops where flammable goods were stored, in the region of the Circus neighboring the Caelian and Palatine Hills of Rome. The night was a windy one and the flames rapidly spread along the full length of the Circus. The fire expanded through an area of narrow, twisting streets and closely located apartment blocks. In this lower area of ancient Rome there were no large buildings such as temples, or open areas of ground, to impede the conflagration. It then spread along the Palatine and Caelian slopes.\\r\\nThe population fled first to areas unaffected by the fire and then to the open fields and rural roads outside the city. Looters and arsonists were reported to have spread the flames by throwing torches or, acting in groups, to have hindered measures being made to halt or slow the progress of the flames. Tacitus surmises that some may have acted under orders or that they may simply have wanted to plunder unhindered.\\r\\nAccording to Tacitus, Nero was away from Rome, in Antium, when the fire broke out.[5] He returned to the city and took measures to bring in food supplies and open gardens and public buildings to accommodate refugees. After six days the organized clearing of built-up areas brought the conflagration to a halt before it reached the Esquiline Hill. There was a further outbreak in the Aemilian district, involving the destruction of temples and arcades but less loss of life. However the fire was now under control. According to Tacitus, of Rome's 14 districts, 3 were completely devastated, 7 more were reduced to a few scorched and mangled ruins and only 4 completely escaped damage.\\r\\nIt is postulated that the fire had been intentionally started to create room for Nero's Domus Aurea, but the fire started 1?km (0.6 miles) away from the site where this palace would later be built, on the other side of the Palatine Hill. Moreover, the fire destroyed parts of Nero's own palace, the Domus Transitoria. It seems unlikely that Nero wanted to destroy this palace since he actually salvaged some of the marble decoration and integrated it into the new Domus Aurea. Even the paintings and wall decorations of the new palace were similar to the ones that had been burned. Last, the fire started just two days after a full moon, a time that, it is presumed, would not have been chosen by arsonists who prefer the cover of darkness.[7]","input":"When did the great fire of rome happen?"},{"output":"June 11, 2009","context":"16 and Pregnant is an American reality television series that debuted on June 11, 2009, on MTV.[1] It follows the stories of pregnant teenage girls in high school dealing with the hardships of teenage pregnancy.

It is extensively, and usually unsuccessfully, persecuted as an agricultural pest. It has also often been kept as a pet, as well as being a food item and a symbol of lust, sexual potency, commonness, and vulgarity. Though it is widespread and abundant, its numbers have declined in some areas. The animal's conservation status is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house sparrow is typically about 16?cm (6.3?in) long, ranging from 14 to 18?cm (5.5 to 7.1?in).[3] It is a compact bird with a full chest and a large, rounded head. Its bill is stout and conical with a culmen length of 1.1ÿ1.5?cm (0.43ÿ0.59?in), strongly built as an adaptation for eating seeds. Its tail is short, at 5.2ÿ6.5?cm (2.0ÿ2.6?in) long. The wing chord is 6.7ÿ8.9?cm (2.6ÿ3.5?in), and the tarsus is 1.6ÿ2.5?cm (0.63ÿ0.98?in).[4][5] In mass, the house sparrow ranges from 24 to 39.5?g (0.85 to 1.39?oz). Females usually are slightly smaller than males. The median mass on the European continent for both sexes is about 30?g (1.1?oz), and in more southerly subspecies is around 26?g (0.92?oz). Younger birds are smaller, males are larger during the winter, and females are larger during the breeding season.[6] Birds at higher latitudes, colder climates, and sometimes higher altitudes are larger (under Bergmann's rule), both between and within subspecies.[6][7][8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plumage of the house sparrow is mostly different shades of grey and brown. The sexes exhibit strong dimorphism: the female is mostly buffish above and below, while the male has boldly coloured head markings, a reddish back, and grey underparts.[8] The male has a dark grey crown from the top of its bill to its back, and chestnut brown flanking its crown on the sides of its head. It has black around its bill, on its throat, and on the spaces between its bill and eyes (lores). It has a small white stripe between the lores and crown and small white spots immediately behind the eyes (postoculars), with black patches below and above them. The underparts are pale grey or white, as are the cheeks, ear coverts, and stripes at the base of the head. The upper back and mantle are a warm brown, with broad black streaks, while the lower back, rump and uppertail coverts are greyish brown.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male is duller in fresh nonbreeding plumage, with whitish tips on many feathers. Wear and preening expose many of the bright brown and black markings, including most of the black throat and chest patch, called the \\"bib\\" or \\"badge\\".[10][11] The badge is variable in width and general size, and may signal social status or fitness. This hypothesis has led to a \\"veritable 'cottage industry'\\" of studies, which have only conclusively shown that patches increase in size with age.[12] The male's bill is black in the breeding season and horn (dark grey) during the rest of the year.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female has no black markings or grey crown. Its upperparts and head are brown with darker streaks around the mantle and a distinct pale supercilium. Its underparts are pale grey-brown. The female's bill is brownish-grey and becomes darker in breeding plumage approaching the black of the male's bill.[3][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuveniles are similar to the adult female, but deeper brown below and paler above, with paler and less defined supercilia. Juveniles have broader buff feather edges, and tend to have looser, scruffier plumage, like moulting adults. Juvenile males tend to have darker throats and white postoculars like adult males, while juvenile females tend to have white throats. However, juveniles cannot be reliably sexed by plumage: some juvenile males lack any markings of the adult male, and some juvenile females have male features. The bills of young birds are light yellow to straw, paler than the female's bill. Immature males have paler versions of the adult male's markings, which can be very indistinct in fresh plumage. By their first breeding season, young birds generally are indistinguishable from other adults, though they may still be paler during their first year.[3][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost house sparrow vocalisations are variations on its short and incessant chirping call. Transcribed as chirrup, tschilp, or philip, this note is made as a contact call by flocking or resting birds, or by males to proclaim nest ownership and invite pairing. In the breeding season, the male gives this call repetitively, with emphasis and speed, but not much rhythm, forming what is described either as a song or an \\"ecstatic call\\" similar to a song.[13][14] Young birds also give a true song, especially in captivity, a warbling similar to that of the European greenfinch.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAggressive males give a trilled version of their call, transcribed as \\"chur-chur-r-r-it-it-it-it\\". This call is also used by females in the breeding season, to establish dominance over males while displacing them to feed young or incubate eggs.[16] House sparrows give a nasal alarm call, the basic sound of which is transcribed as quer, and a shrill chree call in great distress.[17] Another vocalisation is the \\"appeasement call\\", a soft quee given to inhibit aggression, usually given between birds of a mated pair.[16] These vocalisations are not unique to the house sparrow, but are shared, with small variations, by all sparrows.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome variation is seen in the 12 subspecies of house sparrows, which are divided into two groups, the Oriental P. d. indicus group, and the Palaearctic P. d. domesticus group. Birds of the P. d. domesticus group have grey cheeks, while P. d. indicus group birds have white cheeks, as well as bright colouration on the crown, a smaller bill, and a longer black bib.[19] The subspecies P. d. tingitanus differs little from the nominate subspecies, except in the worn breeding plumage of the male, in which the head is speckled with black and underparts are paler.[20] P. d. balearoibericus is slightly paler than the nominate, but darker than P. d. bibilicus.[21] P. d. bibilicus is paler than most subspecies, but has the grey cheeks of P. d. domesticus group birds. The similar P. d. persicus is paler and smaller, and P. d. niloticus is nearly identical but smaller.[20] Of the less widespread P. d. indicus group subspecies, P. d. hyrcanus is larger than P. d. indicus, P. d. hufufae is paler, P. d. bactrianus is larger and paler, and P. d. parkini is larger and darker with more black on the breast than any other subspecies.[20][22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house sparrow can be confused with a number of other seed-eating birds, especially its relatives in the genus Passer. Many of these relatives are smaller, with an appearance that is neater or \\"cuter\\", as with the Dead Sea sparrow.[24] The dull-coloured female can often not be distinguished from other females, and is nearly identical to those of the Spanish and Italian sparrows.[10] The Eurasian tree sparrow is smaller and more slender with a chestnut crown and a black patch on each cheek.[25] The male Spanish sparrow and Italian sparrow are distinguished by their chestnut crowns. The Sind sparrow is very similar but smaller, with less black on the male's throat and a distinct pale supercilium on the female.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house sparrow was among the first animals to be given a scientific name in the modern system of biological classification, since it was described by Carl Linnaeus, in the 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It was described from a type specimen collected in Sweden, with the name Fringilla domestica.[26][27] Later, the genus name Fringilla came to be used only for the common chaffinch and its relatives, and the house sparrow has usually been placed in the genus Passer created by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird's scientific name and its usual English name have the same meaning. The Latin word passer, like the English word \\"sparrow\\", is a term for small active birds, coming from a root word referring to speed.[30][31] The Latin word domesticus means \\"belonging to the house\\", like the common name a reference to its association with humans.[32] The house sparrow is also called by a number of alternative English names, including English sparrow, chiefly in North America;[33][34] and Indian sparrow or Indian house sparrow, for the birds of the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia.[35] Dialectal names include sparr, sparrer, spadger, spadgick, and philip, mainly in southern England; spug and spuggy, mainly in northern England; spur and sprig, mainly in Scotland;[36][37] and spatzie or spotsie, from the German Spatz, in North America.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genus Passer contains about 25 species, depending on the authority, 26 according to the Handbook of the Birds of the World.[39] Most Passer species are dull-coloured birds with short, square tails and stubby, conical beaks, between 11 and 18?cm (4.3 and 7.1?in) long.[8][40] Mitochondrial DNA studies suggest that speciation in the genus occurred during the Pleistocene and earlier, while other evidence suggests speciation occurred 25,000 to 15,000 years ago.[41][42] Within Passer, the house sparrow is part of the \\"Palaearctic black-bibbed sparrows\\" group and a close relative of the Mediterranean \\"willow sparrows\\".[39][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe taxonomy of the house sparrow and its Mediterranean relatives is highly complicated. The common type of \\"willow sparrow\\" is the Spanish sparrow, which resembles the house sparrow in many respects.[44] It frequently prefers wetter habitats than the house sparrow, and it is often colonial and nomadic.[45] In most of the Mediterranean, one or both species occur, with some degree of hybridisation.[46] In North Africa, the two species hybridise extensively, forming highly variable mixed populations with a full range of characters from pure house sparrows to pure Spanish sparrows.[47][48][49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn much of Italy, a form apparently intermediate between the house and Spanish sparrows, is known as the Italian sparrow. It resembles a hybrid between the two species, and is in other respects intermediate. Its specific status and origin are the subject of much debate.[48][50] In the Alps, the Italian sparrow intergrades over a roughly 20?km (12?mi) strip with the house sparrow,[51] but to the south it intergrades over the southern half of Italy and some Mediterranean islands with the Spanish sparrow.[48] On the Mediterranean islands of Malta, Gozo, Crete, Rhodes, and Karpathos, the other apparently intermediate birds are of unknown status.[48][52][53]\\r\\n\\r\\nA large number of subspecies have been named, of which 12 were recognised in the Handbook of the Birds of the World. These subspecies are divided into two groups, the Palaearctic P. d. domesticus group, and the Oriental P. d. indicus group.[39] Several Middle Eastern subspecies, including P. d. biblicus, are sometimes considered a third, intermediate group. The subspecies P. d. indicus was described as a species, and was considered to be distinct by many ornithologists during the 19th century.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nMigratory birds of the subspecies P. d. bactrianus in the P. d. indicus group were recorded overlapping with P. d. domesticus birds without hybridising in the 1970s, so the Soviet scientists Edward I. Gavrilov and M. N. Korelov proposed the separation of the P. d. indicus group as a separate species.[28][54] However, P. d. indicus-group and P. d. domesticus-group birds intergrade in a large part of Iran, so this split is rarely recognised.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn North America, house sparrow populations are more differentiated than those in Europe.[7] This variation follows predictable patterns, with birds at higher latitudes being larger and those in arid areas being paler.[8][55][56] However,  how much this is caused by evolution or by environment is not clear.[57][58][59][60] Similar observations have been made in New Zealand,[61] and in South Africa.[62] The introduced house sparrow populations may be distinct enough to merit subspecies status, especially in North America and southern Africa,[39] and American ornithologist Harry Church Oberholser even gave the subspecies name P. d. plecticus to the paler birds of western North America.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house sparrow originated in the Middle East and spread, along with agriculture, to most of Eurasia and parts of North Africa.[68] Since the mid-19th century, it has reached most of the world, chiefly due to deliberate introductions, but also through natural and shipborne dispersal.[69] Its introduced range encompasses most of North America, Central America, southern South America, southern Africa, part of West Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and islands throughout the world.[70] It has greatly extended its range in northern Eurasia since the 1850s,[71] and continues to do so, as was shown by the colonisations around 1990 of Iceland and Rishiri Island, Japan.[72] The extent of its range makes it the most widely distributed wild bird on the planet.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house sparrow has become highly successful in most parts of the world where it has been introduced. This is mostly due to its early adaptation to living with humans, and its adaptability to a wide range of conditions.[73][74] Other factors may include its robust immune response, compared to the Eurasian tree sparrow.[75] Where introduced, it can extend its range quickly, sometimes at a rate over 230?km (140?mi) per year.[76] In many parts of the world, it has been characterised as a pest, and poses a threat to native birds.[77][78] A few introductions have died out or been of limited success, such as those to Greenland and Cape Verde.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of many successful introductions to North America occurred when birds from England were released in New York City, in 1852 [80][81] to control the ravages of the linden moth.[82] The house sparrow now occurs from the Northwest Territories to southern Panama,[4] and it is one of the most abundant birds in North America.[77] The house sparrow was first introduced to Australia in 1863 at Melbourne and is common throughout the eastern part of the continent as far north as Cape York,[79] but has been prevented from establishing itself in Western Australia, where every house sparrow found in the state is killed.[83] House sparrows were introduced in New Zealand in 1859, and from there reached many of the Pacific islands, including Hawaii.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn southern Africa, birds of both the European subspecies P. d. domesticus and the Indian subspecies P. d. indicus were introduced around 1900. Birds of P. d. domesticus ancestry are confined to a few towns, while P. d. indicus birds have spread rapidly, reaching Tanzania in the 1980s. Despite this success, native relatives such as the Cape sparrow also occur in towns, competing successfully with it.[79][85] In South America, it was first introduced near Buenos Aires around 1870, and quickly became common in most of the southern part of the continent. It now occurs almost continuously from Tierra del Fuego to the fringes of the Amazon basin, with isolated populations as far north as coastal Venezuela.[79][86][87]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house sparrow is closely associated with human habitation and cultivation.[88] It is not an obligate commensal of humans as some have suggested: Central Asian house sparrows usually breed away from humans in open country,[89] and birds elsewhere are occasionally found away from humans.[88][90][91] The only terrestrial habitats that the house sparrow does not inhabit are dense forest and tundra. Well adapted to living around humans, it frequently lives and even breeds indoors, especially in factories, warehouses, and zoos.[88] It has been recorded breeding in an English coal mine 640?m (2,100?ft) below ground,[92] and feeding on the Empire State Building's observation deck at night.[93] It reaches its greatest densities in urban centres, but its reproductive success is greater in suburbs, where insects are more abundant.[88][94] On a larger scale, it is most abundant in wheat-growing areas such as the Midwestern United States.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt tolerates a variety of climates, but prefers drier conditions, especially in moist tropical climates.[79][88] It has several adaptations to dry areas, including a high salt tolerance[96] and an ability to survive without water by ingesting berries.[97] In most of eastern Asia, the house sparrow is entirely absent, replaced by the Eurasian tree sparrow.[98] Where these two species overlap, the house sparrow is usually more common than the Eurasian tree sparrow, but one species may replace the other in a manner that ornithologist Maud Doria Haviland described as \\"random, or even capricious\\".[99] In most of its range, the house sparrow is extremely common, despite some declines,[100] but in marginal habitats such as rainforest or mountain ranges, its distribution can be spotty.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house sparrow is a very social bird. It is gregarious at all seasons when feeding, often forming flocks with other types of birds.[101] It roosts communally, its nests are usually grouped together in clumps, and it engages in social activities such as dust or water bathing and \\"social singing\\", in which birds call together in bushes.[102][103] The house sparrow feeds mostly on the ground, but it flocks in trees and bushes.[102] At feeding stations and nests, female house sparrows are dominant despite their smaller size, and in the reproductive period (usually spring or summer), being dominant, they can fight  for males.[104][105]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouse sparrows sleep with the bill tucked underneath the scapular feathers.[106] Outside of the reproductive season, they often roost communally in trees or shrubs. Much communal chirping occurs before and after the birds settle in the roost in the evening, as well as before the birds leave the roost in the morning.[102] Some congregating sites separate from the roost may be visited by the birds prior to settling in for the night.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nDust or water bathing is common and often occurs in groups. Anting is rare.[108] Head scratching is done with the leg over the drooped wing.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an adult, the house sparrow mostly feeds on the seeds of grains and weeds, but it is opportunistic and adaptable, and eats whatever foods are available.[109] In towns and cities, it often scavenges for food in garbage containers and congregates in the outdoors of restaurants and other eating establishments to feed on leftover food and crumbs. It can perform complex tasks to obtain food, such as opening automatic doors to enter supermarkets,[110] clinging to hotel walls to watch vacationers on their balconies,[111] and nectar robbing kowhai flowers.[112] In common with many other birds, the house sparrow requires grit to digest the harder items in its diet. Grit can be either stone, often grains of masonry, or the shells of eggs or snails; oblong and rough grains are preferred.[113][114]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral studies of the house sparrow in temperate agricultural areas have found the proportion of seeds in its diet to be about 90%.[109][115][116] It will eat almost any seeds, but where it has a choice, it prefers oats and wheat.[117] In urban areas, the house sparrow feeds largely on food provided directly or indirectly by humans, such as bread, though it prefers raw seeds.[116][118] The house sparrow also eats some plant matter besides seeds, including buds, berries, and fruits such as grapes and cherries.[97][116] In temperate areas, the house sparrow has an unusual habit of tearing flowers, especially yellow ones, in the spring.[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimals form another important part of the house sparrow's diet, chiefly insects, of which beetles, caterpillars, dipteran flies, and aphids are especially important. Various noninsect arthropods are eaten, as are molluscs and crustaceans where available, earthworms, and even vertebrates such as lizards and frogs.[109] Young house sparrows are fed mostly on insects until about 15 days after hatching.[120] They are also given small quantities of seeds, spiders, and grit. In most places, grasshoppers and crickets are the most abundant foods of nestlings.[121] True bugs, ants, sawflies, and beetles are also important, but house sparrows take advantage of whatever foods are abundant to feed their young.[121][122][123] House sparrows have been observed stealing prey from other birds, including American robins.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house sparrow's flight is direct (not undulating) and flapping, averaging 45.5?km/h (28.3?mph) and about 15?wingbeats per second.[107][124] On the ground, the house sparrow typically hops rather than walks. It can swim when pressed to do so by pursuit from predators. Captive birds have been recorded diving and swimming short distances under water.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost house sparrows do not move more than a few kilometres during their lifetimes. However, limited migration occurs in all regions. Some young birds disperse long distances, especially on coasts, and mountain birds move to lower elevations in winter.[102][125][126] Two subspecies, P. d. bactrianus and P. d. parkini, are predominantly migratory. Unlike the birds in sedentary populations that migrate, birds of migratory subspecies prepare for migration by putting on weight.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouse sparrows can breed in the breeding season immediately following their hatching, and sometimes attempt to do so. Some birds breeding for the first time in tropical areas are only a few months old and still have juvenile plumage.[127] Birds breeding for the first time are rarely successful in raising young, and reproductive success increases with age, as older birds breed earlier in the breeding season, and fledge more young.[128] As the breeding season approaches, hormone releases trigger enormous increases in the size of the sexual organs and changes in day length lead males to start calling by nesting sites.[129][130] The timing of mating and egg-laying varies geographically, and between specific locations and years because a sufficient supply of insects is needed for egg formation and feeding nestlings.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nMales take up nesting sites before the breeding season, by frequently calling beside them. Unmated males start nest construction and call particularly frequently to attract females. When a female approaches a male during this period, the male displays by moving up and down while drooping and shivering his wings, pushing up his head, raising and spreading his tail, and showing his bib.[131] Males may try to mate with females while calling or displaying. In response, a female will adopt a threatening posture and attack a male before flying away, pursued by the male. The male displays in front of her, attracting other males, which also pursue and display to the female. This group display usually does not immediately result in copulations.[131] Other males usually do not copulate with the female.[132][133] Copulation is typically initiated by the female giving a soft dee-dee-dee call to the male. Birds of a pair copulate frequently until the female is laying eggs, and the male mounts the female repeatedly each time a pair mates.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house sparrow is monogamous, and typically mates for life. Birds from pairs often engage in extra-pair copulations, so about 15% of house sparrow fledglings are unrelated to their mother's mate.[134] Male house sparrows guard their mates carefully to avoid being cuckolded, and most extra-pair copulation occurs away from nest sites.[132][135] Males may sometimes have multiple mates, and bigamy is mostly limited by aggression between females.[136] Many birds do not find a nest and a mate, and instead may serve as helpers around the nest for mated pairs, a role which increases the chances of being chosen to replace a lost mate. Lost mates of both sexes can be replaced quickly during the breeding season.[132][137] The formation of a pair and the bond between the two birds is tied to the holding of a nest site, though paired house sparrows can recognise each other away from the nest.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nNest sites are varied, though cavities are preferred. Nests are most frequently built in the eaves and other crevices of houses. Holes in cliffs and banks, or tree hollows, are also used.[138][139] A sparrow sometimes excavates its own nests in sandy banks or rotten branches, but more frequently uses the nests of other birds such as those of swallows in banks and cliffs, and old tree cavity nests.[138] It usually uses deserted nests, though sometimes it usurps active ones.[138][140] Tree hollows are more commonly used in North America than in Europe,[138] putting the sparrows in competition with bluebirds and other North American cavity nesters, and thereby contributing to their population declines.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nEspecially in warmer areas, the house sparrow may build its nests in the open, on the branches of trees, especially evergreens and hawthorns, or in the nests of large birds such as storks or magpies.[131][138][141] In open nesting sites, breeding success tends to be lower, since breeding begins late and the nest can easily be destroyed or damaged by storms.[138][142] Less common nesting sites include street lights and neon signs, favoured for their warmth; and the old open-topped nests of other songbirds, which are then domed over.[138][139]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nest is usually domed, though it may lack a roof in enclosed sites.[138] It has an outer layer of stems and roots, a middle layer of dead grass and leaves, and a lining of feathers, as well as of paper and other soft materials.[139] Nests typically have external dimensions of 20 G 30?cm (8 G 12?in),[131] but their size varies greatly.[139] The building of the nest is initiated by the unmated male while displaying to females. The female assists in building, but is less active than the male.[138] Some nest building occurs throughout the year, especially after moult in autumn. In colder areas house sparrows build specially created roost nests, or roost in street lights, to avoid losing heat during the winter.[138][143] House sparrows do not hold territories, but they defend their nests aggressively against intruders of the same sex.[138]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouse sparrows' nests support a wide range of scavenging insects, including nest flies such as Neottiophilum praestum, Protocalliphora blowflies,[144][145] and over 1,400 species of beetle.[146]\\r\\n\\r\\nClutches usually comprise four or five eggs, though numbers from one to 10  have been recorded. At least two clutches are usually laid, and up to seven a year may be laid in the tropics or four a year in temperate latitudes. When fewer clutches are laid in a year, especially at higher latitudes, the number of eggs per clutch is greater. Central Asian house sparrows, which migrate and have only one clutch a year, average 6.5?eggs in a clutch. Clutch size is also affected by environmental and seasonal conditions, female age, and breeding density.[147][148]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome intraspecific brood parasitism occurs, and instances of unusually large numbers of eggs in a nest may be the result of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours. Such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females.[147][149] The house sparrow is a victim of interspecific brood parasites, but only rarely, since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter, and it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites.[150][151] In turn, the house sparrow has once been recorded as a brood parasite of the American cliff swallow.[149][152]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eggs are white, bluish white, or greenish white, spotted with brown or grey.[107] Subelliptical in shape,[8] they range from 20 to 22?mm (0.79 to 0.87?in) in length and 14 to 16?mm (0.55 to 0.63?in) in width,[4] have an average mass of 2.9?g (0.10?oz),[153] and an average surface area of 9.18?cm2 (1.423?in2).[154] Eggs from the tropical subspecies are distinctly smaller.[155][156] Eggs begin to develop with the deposition of yolk in the ovary a few days before ovulation. In the day between ovulation and laying, egg white forms, followed by eggshell.[157] Eggs laid later in a clutch are larger, as are those laid by larger females, and egg size is hereditary. Eggs decrease slightly in size from laying to hatching.[158] The yolk comprises 25% of the egg, the egg white 68%, and the shell 7%. Eggs are watery, being 79% liquid, and otherwise mostly protein.[159]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female develops a brood patch of bare skin and plays the main part in incubating the eggs. The male helps, but can only cover the eggs rather than truly incubate them. The female spends the night incubating during this period, while the male roosts near the nest.[147] Eggs hatch at the same time, after a short incubation period lasting 11ÿ14?days, and exceptionally for as many as 17 or as few as 9.[8][131][160] The length of the incubation period decreases as ambient temperature increases later in the breeding season.[161]\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung house sparrows remain in the nest for 11 to 23 days, normally 14 to 16 days.[107][161][162] During this time, they are fed by both parents. As newly hatched house sparrows do not have sufficient insulation, they are brooded for a few days, or longer in cold conditions.[161][163] The parents swallow the droppings produced by the hatchlings during the first few days; later, the droppings are moved up to 20?m (66?ft) away from the nest.[163][164]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chicks' eyes open after about four days and, at an age of about eight days, the young birds get their first down.[107][162] If both parents perish, the ensuing intensive begging sounds of the young often attract replacement parents which feed them until they can sustain themselves.[163][165] All the young in the nest leave it during the same period of a few hours. At this stage, they are normally able to fly. They start feeding themselves partly after one or two days, and sustain themselves completely after 7 to 10 days, 14 at the latest.[166]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn adult house sparrows, annual survival is 45ÿ65%.[167] After fledging and leaving the care of their parents, young sparrows have a high mortality rate, which lessens as they grow older and more experienced. Only about 20ÿ25% of birds hatched survive to their first breeding season.[168] The oldest known wild house sparrow lived for nearly two decades; it was found dead 19?years and 9?months after it was ringed in Denmark.[169] The oldest recorded captive house sparrow lived for 23?years.[170] The typical ratio of males to females in a population is uncertain due to problems in collecting data, but a very slight preponderance of males at all ages is usual.[171]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house sparrow's main predators are cats and birds of prey, but many other animals prey on them, including corvids, squirrels,[172] and even humansthe house sparrow has been consumed in the past by people in many parts of the world, and it still is in parts of the Mediterranean.[173] Most species of birds of prey have been recorded preying on the house sparrow in places where records are extensive. Accipiters and the merlin in particular are major predators, though cats are likely to have a greater impact on house sparrow populations.[172] The house sparrow is also a common victim of roadkill; on European roads, it is the bird most frequently found dead.[174]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house sparrow is host to a huge number of parasites and diseases, and the effect of most is unknown. Ornithologist Ted R. Anderson listed thousands, noting that his list was incomplete.[175] The commonly recorded bacterial pathogens of the house sparrow are often those common in humans, and include Salmonella and Escherichia coli.[176] Salmonella is common in the house sparrow, and a comprehensive study of house sparrow disease found it in 13% of sparrows tested. Salmonella epidemics in the spring and winter can kill large numbers of sparrows.[175] The house sparrow hosts avian pox and avian malaria, which it has spread to the native forest birds of Hawaii.[177] Many of the diseases hosted by the house sparrow are also present in humans and domestic animals, for which the house sparrow acts as a reservoir host.[178] Arboviruses such as the West Nile virus, which most commonly infect insects and mammals, survive winters in temperate areas by going dormant in birds such as the house sparrow.[175][179] A few records indicate disease extirpating house sparrow populations, especially from Scottish islands, but this seems to be rare.[180]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house sparrow is infested by a number of external parasites, which usually cause little harm to adult sparrows. In Europe, the most common mite found on sparrows is Proctophyllodes, the most common ticks are Argas reflexus and Ixodes arboricola, and the most common flea on the house sparrow is Ceratophyllus gallinae. A number of chewing lice occupy different niches on the house sparrow's body. Menacanthus lice occur across the house sparrow's body, where they feed on blood and feathers, while Brueelia lice feed on feathers and Philopterus fringillae occurs on the head.[144]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouse sparrows express strong circadian rhythms of activity in the laboratory. They were among the first bird species to be seriously studied in terms of their circadian activity and photoperiodism, in part because of their availability and adaptability in captivity, but also because they can \\"find their way\\" and remain rhythmic in constant darkness.[181][182] Such studies have found that the pineal gland is a central part of the house sparrow's circadian system: removal of the pineal eliminates the circadian rhythm of activity,[183] and transplant of the pineal into another individual confers to this individual the rhythm phase of the donor bird.[184] The suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus have also been shown to be an important component of the circadian system of house sparrows.[185] The photoreceptors involved in the synchronisation of the circadian clock to the external light-dark cycle are located in the brain and can be stimulated by light reaching them directly though the skull, as revealed by experiments in which blind sparrows, which normally can still synchronise to the light-dark cycle, failed to do so once India ink was injected as a screen under the skin on top of their skulls.[186]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly, even when blind, house sparrows continue to be photoperiodic, i.e. show reproductive development when the days are long, but not when the days are short. This response is stronger when the feathers on top of the head are plucked, and is eliminated when India ink is injected under the skin at the top of the head, showing that the photoreceptors involved in the photoperiodic response to day length are located inside the brain.[187]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouse sparrows have also been used in studies of nonphotic entrainment (i.e. synchronisation to an external cycle other than light and dark): for example, in constant darkness, a situation in which the birds would normally reveal their endogenous, non-24-hour, \\"free-running\\" rhythms of activity, they instead show 24-hour periodicity if they are exposed to two hours of chirp playbacks every 24?hours, matching their daily activity onsets with the daily playback onsets.[188] House sparrows in constant dim light can also be entrained to a daily cycle based on the presence of food.[189] Finally, house sparrows in constant darkness can be entrained to a cycle of high and low temperature, but only if the difference between the two temperatures is large (38 versus 6?C); some of the tested sparrows matched their activity to the warm phase, and others to the cold phase.[190]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house sparrow is closely associated with humans. They are believed to have become associated with humans around 10,000 years ago. Subspecies P. d. bactrianus is least associated with humans and considered to be evolutionarily closer to the ancestral noncommensal populations.[191] Usually, it is regarded as a pest, since it consumes agricultural products and spreads disease to humans and their domestic animals.[192] Even birdwatchers often hold it in little regard because of its molestation of other birds.[77] In most of the world, the house sparrow is not protected by law. Attempts to control house sparrows include the trapping, poisoning, or shooting of adults; the destruction of their nests and eggs; or less directly, blocking nest holes and scaring off sparrows with noise, glue, or porcupine wire.[193] However, the house sparrow can be beneficial to humans, as well, especially by eating insect pests, and attempts at the large-scale control of the house sparrow have failed.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house sparrow has long been used as a food item. From around 1560 to at least the 19th century in northern Europe, earthenware \\"sparrow pots\\" were hung from eaves to attract nesting birds so  the young could be readily harvested. Wild birds were trapped in nets in large numbers, and sparrow pie was a traditional dish, thought, because of the association of sparrows with lechery, to have aphrodisiac properties. Sparrows were also trapped as food for falconers' birds and zoo animals. In the early part of the 20th century, sparrow clubs culled many millions of birds and eggs in an attempt to control numbers of this perceived pest, but with only a localised impact on numbers.[194] House sparrows have been kept as pets at many times in history, though they have no bright plumage or attractive songs, and raising them is difficult.[195]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house sparrow has an extremely large range and population, and is not seriously threatened by human activities, so it is assessed as least concern for conservation on the IUCN Red List.[1] However, populations have been declining in many parts of the world.[196][197][198] These declines were first noticed in North America, where they were initially attributed to the spread of the house finch, but have been most severe in Western Europe.[199][200] Declines have not been universal, as no serious declines have been reported from Eastern Europe, but have even occurred in Australia, where the house sparrow was introduced recently.[201]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Great Britain, populations peaked in the early 1970s,[202] but have since declined by 68% overall,[203] and about 90% in some regions.[204][205] In London, the house sparrow almost disappeared from the central city.[204] The numbers of house sparrows in the Netherlands have dropped in half since the 1980s,[94] so the house sparrow is even considered an endangered species.[206] This status came to widespread attention after a female house sparrow, referred to as the \\"Dominomus\\", was killed after knocking down dominoes arranged as part of an attempt to set a world record.[207] These declines are not unprecedented, as similar reductions in population occurred when the internal combustion engine replaced horses in the 1920s and a major source of food in the form of grain spillage was lost.[208][209]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious causes for the dramatic decreases in population have been proposed, including predation, in particular by Eurasian sparrowhawks;[210][211][212] electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones;[213] and diseases.[214] A shortage of nesting sites caused by changes in urban building design is probably a factor, and conservation organisations have encouraged the use of special nest boxes for sparrows.[214][215][216][217] A primary cause of the decline seems to be an insufficient supply of insect food for nestling sparrows.[214][218] Declines in insect populations result from an increase of monoculture crops, the heavy use of pesticides,[219][220][221] the replacement of native plants in cities with introduced plants and parking areas,[222][223] and possibly the introduction of unleaded petrol, which produces toxic compounds such as methyl nitrite.[224]\\r\\n\\r\\nProtecting insect habitats on farms,[225][226] and planting native plants in cities benefit the house sparrow, as does establishing urban green spaces.[227][228] To raise awareness of threats to the house sparrow, World Sparrow Day has been celebrated on 20 March across the world since 2010.[229]\\r\\nOver the recent years, the house sparrow population has been on the decline in many Asian countries, and this decline is quite evident in India. To promote the conservation of these birds, in 2012, the house sparrow was declared as the state bird of Delhi.[230]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo many people across the world, the house sparrow is the most familiar wild animal and, because of its association with humans and familiarity, it is frequently used to represent the common and vulgar, or the lewd.[231] One of the reasons for the introduction of house sparrows throughout the world was their association with the European homeland of many immigrants.[81] Birds usually described later as sparrows are referred to in many works of ancient literature and religious texts in Europe and western Asia. These references may not always refer specifically to the house sparrow, or even to small, seed-eating birds, but later writers who were inspired by these texts often had the house sparrow in mind.[39][231][232] In particular, sparrows were associated by the ancient Greeks with Aphrodite, the goddess of love, due to their perceived lustfulness, an association echoed by later writers such as Chaucer and Shakespeare.[39][195][231][233] Jesus's use of \\"sparrows\\" as an example of divine providence in the Gospel of Matthew[234] also inspired later references, such as that in Shakespeare's Hamlet[231] and the Gospel hymn His Eye Is on the Sparrow.[235]","input":"When were house sparrows introduced to north america?"},{"output":"eight","context":"Kho kho (Punjabi: ??-??) is a popular tag sport from India. It is played by teams of twelve nominated players out of fifteen, of which nine enter the field, who try to avoid being touched by members of the opposing team.[1] It is one of the two most popular traditional tag games of the South Asia, the other being Kabaddi.[2] Apart from South Asia, it is also played by the Indian community in South Africa.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word kho seems to be derived from the Sanskrit verb root syu- meaning \\"get up go\\".\\r\\nIn 1999, The Asian Kho Kho Federation was established during the 3rd edition of the South Asian Games. Member countries included India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Maldives. The 1st Asian Championship was held at Kolkata in 1996 and the second championship at Dhaka, Bangladesh. India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, Japan, Thailand and Bangladesh were participants of this championship.\\r\\nEach team consists of twelve players, but only nine players take the field. A match consists of two innings with each inning consisting of chasing and running turns of 9 minutes each. One team sits on their knees in the middle of the court, in a row, with adjacent members facing opposite directions. The runners play in the field, three at a time and the team that takes the shortest time to touch all the opponents in the field, wins. There is a pole on each end and the runner can go between two players who are sitting in zig-zag manner, but the chaser is not allowed to turn back while running and go between the players. However, the chaser can go to the pole and touch it and can go back or towards the other side.\\r\\nA Kho kho playing field is rectangular. It is 36 by 18 metres (118?ft G?59?ft) in length and width. There are two rectangles at the end. The dimensions of each rectangle is 16?m G?2.75?m (52.5?ft G?9.0?ft). In the middle of these two rectangles, there are two wooden poles. The central lane's dimensions are 2,350?cm G?30?cm (925?in G?12?in). There are eight cross lanes which lie across the central lane, whose dimensions are 1,600?cm G?30?cm (630?in G?12?in).

At the end of the central lane, the free zone tangent to the post-line, two smooth wooden posts are fixed, 120?cm (47?in) high from the ground, and their circumference is no less than 30?cm (12?in) and no more than 40?cm (16?in). The equipment used in Kho kho are poles/post, strings, metallic measuring tape, lime powder, wire nails, two watches, types of rings having inner circumference of 30?cm (12?in) and 40?cm (16?in), score shots (like a whistle, for instance), and equipment to record the results.\\r\\nThere are usually two referees standing on the opposite sides of the rectangular field.

It was in support of his fourth studio album Purpose (2015).[2][3] The tour started on March 9, 2016 in Seattle and ended on July 2, 2017 in London, England.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tour was announced on November 11, 2015 on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. That same day, 58 dates in the United States and Canada were revealed on the singer's website.[4] Due to overwhelming demand, additional shows were added in several cities.[3] On September 30, 2016, Bieber announced Australian and New Zealand tour dates were to be released the following week. On October 25, 2016, two tour dates were announced for Mexico, as well as the South American and Central American legs of the tour. On December 5, 2016, Bieber announced on The Ellen DeGeneres Show he would tour stadiums in the United States in the summer of 2017, with dates announced later that day.[5]\\r\\nThe show starts with a pre-recorded sequence in which he is \\"stuck inside a glass cube; then the real Bieber appeared inside a real cube\\" performing \\"Mark My Words\\", scrawling words like \\"hope\\" on the walls with a marker,[6] while wearing a long white coat.[7] Later, Bieber rises from below the stage in a large glass cube, \\"with the hydraulics pushing him higher\\" during the performance of \\"Where Are  Now\\",[8] with holograms flashing about,[9] while \\"Bieber's crew of dancers tumbled onstage in all-white attire as women suspended in midair did acrobatics against a chrome-y, industrial video backdrop.\\"[7] For \\"I'll Show You\\", Bieber is \\"trapped under a literal steel cage while firestorms and spinning whirlwinds engulf him.\\"[8] During the song's chorus, \\"an LED light show began flashing across its beams, covering him in exploding octagons and digital fireworks.\\"[7] During \\"The Feeling\\", acrobats twirled above him, while cosmic projections of Halsey are shown.[8] Later, the performance of \\"Get Used To It\\" brought pyrotechnics, as well as movement from the platforms onstage.[7]\\r\\nThe performance of \\"Love Yourself\\" has Bieber on acoustic guitar while seated on a red velvet couch down center stage.[8] Later, the acoustic break also continued with a breezy solo rendition of \\"Home to Mama\\" and a new song called \\"Insecurities\\".[8] After the acoustic set, \\"Boyfriend\\" is performed, with dancers in LED-laden black bodysuits creating \\"a light show\\" in choreography.[7] Later, \\"Been You\\" is performed by Bieber and his dancers, featuring a \\"dance break\\",[8] while in \\"Company\\", \\"a hidden platform anchored to the ceiling begins to descend and it turned out to be a giant, suspended trampoline, on which Justin completed a couple of backflips.\\"[7] \\"No Sense\\" is followed by the performance of \\"Hold Tight\\" and \\"No Pressure\\".

Smith of Seattle Times, \\"Nothing could topple the positive quality of the evening overall.\\"[11] Chris Macias of The Sacramento Bee noted that \\"[F]or all the spectacle, and the occasional lifting of his garments to show off those abs, the Biebs is a bit tentative as a performer.\\"[10] Francois Marchand of Vancouver Sun analysed the tour, stating: \\"But all in all it was entertaining and the songs on Purpose are excellent - smooth and steady, atmospheric and deep.\\"[13] Tony Hicks of Mercury News was mixed, noting that \\"while the visuals were impressive, they masked the fact that Bieber's voice sounded muffled most of the night.

About 20 species of pine produce seeds large enough to be worth harvesting; in other pines the seeds are also edible, but are too small to be of notable value as a human food.[1][2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Europe and places with a Mediterranean climate species are widely harvested, Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) in northeast Asia (the most important species in international trade), and chilgoza pine (Pinus gerardiana) in the western Himalaya. Four other species, Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica), Siberian dwarf pine (Pinus pumila), Chinese white pine (Pinus armandii) and lacebark pine (Pinus bungeana), are also used to a lesser extent. Russia is the largest producer of Pinus sibirica nuts in the world followed by Mongolia which produces over 10,000 tonnes of forest grown nuts annually, the majority of harvest is exported to China. Afghanistan is an important source of pine nuts, behind China and Korea.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nPine nuts produced in Europe mostly come from the stone pine (Pinus pinea), which has been cultivated for its nuts for over 5,000 years, and harvested from wild trees for far longer. The Swiss pine (Pinus cembra) is also used to a very small extent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn North America, the main species are three of the pinyon pines: Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis), single-leaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla), and Mexican pinyon (Pinus cembroides). The other eight pinyon species are used to a small extent, as are gray pine (Pinus sabineana), Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri), Torrey pine (Pinus torreyana), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) and Parry pinyon (Pinus quadrifolia). Here, the nuts themselves are known by the Spanish name for the pinyon pine: pi?on (plural: pi?ones).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, pine nuts are mainly harvested by Native American and Hispano communities, particularly in the Western United States and Southwestern United States, by the Uto-Aztecan Shoshone, Paiute, Navajo, Pueblo, Hopi, Washoe, and Hispanos of New Mexico.[5] Certain treaties negotiated by tribes and laws in Nevada guarantee Native Americans' right to harvest pine nuts,[6] and the state of New Mexico protects the use of the word pi?on for use with pine nuts from certain species of indigenous New Mexican pines.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pinus monophylla seeds, commonly known as the Nevada Soft Shell Pine Nut, are harvested by commercial harvesters in Nevada, and sold throughout the western US.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those seeking to grow edible landscapes, these are the more commonly used species.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pine nut (seed) species will take a time that depends on the exact species (e.g. 36 months for a stone pine seed) to complete its maturity; to reach full maturity, the environmental conditions must be favorable for the tree and its cone.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some American species development begins in early spring with pollination. A tiny cone, about the size of a small marble, will form from mid-spring to the end of summer; the premature cone will then become and remain dormant (with a cessation of growth) until the following spring. The cone will then commence growth until it reaches maturity near the end of summer.[9] The mature pi?on pine cone is ready to harvest ten days before the green cone begins to open. A cone is harvested by placing it in a burlap bag and exposing it to a heat source such as the sun to begin the drying process. It takes about 20 days until the cone fully opens. Once it is fully open and dry, the seed can be easily extracted in various ways. The most common and practical extraction method used is the repeated striking of the burlap bag containing the cone(s) against a rough surface to cause the cone(s) to shatter, leaving just the job of separating by hand the seed from the residue within the bag.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother option for harvesting is to wait until the cone opens on the tree (as it naturally will) and harvest the cone from the pi?on pine, followed by the extracting process mentioned above. Fallen seed can also be gathered beneath the trees.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, millions of hectares of productive pinyon pine woods have been destroyed due to conversion of lands, and in China, destructive harvesting techniques (such as breaking off whole branches to harvest the cones) and the removal of trees for timber have led to losses in production capacity.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elevation of the pinyon pine is an important determinant of the quantity of pine cone production, and therefore, will largely determine the amount of pine nuts the tree will yield.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican Pinyon pine cone production is most commonly found at an elevation between 6,000 feet (1,800?m) and 8,500 feet (2,600?m), and ideally at 7,000 feet (2,100?m).  This is due to higher temperatures at elevations lower than 6,000 feet (1,800?m) during the spring, which dry up humidity and moisture content (particularly snow packs) that provide for the tree throughout the spring and summer, causing little nourishment for pine cone maturity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough there are several other environmental factors that determine the conditions of the eco-system (such as clouds and rain), without sufficient water the trees tend to abort cones. High humidity encourages cone development.[citation needed] There are certain topographical areas found in lower elevations, such as shaded canyons, where the humidity remains constant throughout the spring and summer, allowing pine cones to fully mature and produce seed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt elevations above 8,500 feet (2,600?m), the temperature substantially drops, drastically affecting the state of the dormant cone.  During the winter, frequent dramatic changes in temperature, along with drying, gusty winds, make the cones susceptible to freeze-drying that damages them permanently; in this case, growth is stunted and the seeds wither away.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nPine nuts contain 10ÿ34% protein depending on species, with stone pine having the highest content.[2] They are also a source of dietary fiber. When first extracted from the pine cone, they are covered with a hard shell (seed coat), thin in some species, thick in others. The nutrition is stored in the embryo (sporophyte) in the centre. Although a nut in the culinary sense, in the botanical sense pine nuts are seeds; being a gymnosperm, they lack a carpel (fruit) outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shell must be removed before the pine nut can be eaten. Unshelled pine nuts have a long shelf life if kept dry and refrigerated (?5?C (23?F) to 2?C (36?F)); shelled nuts (and unshelled nuts in warm conditions) deteriorate rapidly, becoming rancid within a few weeks or even days in warm humid conditions. Pine nuts are commercially available in shelled form, but due to poor storage, can have poor flavor and may be already rancid at the time of purchase. Consequently, pine nuts are often frozen to preserve their flavor.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean pine nuts may be distinguished from Asian ones by their greater length in comparison to girth; Asian pine nuts are stubbier, shaped somewhat like long kernels of corn.  The American pi?on nuts are known for their large size and ease of shelling. In the United States, P. edulis, the hard shell of New Mexico and Colorado, became a sought-after species due to the trading post system, and the Navajo people who used the nuts as a means of commerce.  The Italian pine nut (P. pinea) was brought to the United States by immigrants, and became a favored treat along the East Coast in the early 1930s, when bumper crops of American pine nuts were readily available at low prices.\\r\\n\\r\\nPine nuts have been eaten in Europe and Asia since the Paleolithic period. They are frequently added to meat, fish, salads and vegetable dishes or baked into bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Italian they are called pinoli (in the US they are often called pignoli, but in Italy pignolo is actually a word far more commonly used to describe a fussy, overly fastidious or extremely meticulous person)[14] and are an essential component of Italian pesto sauce; the upsurge in the popularity of this sauce since the 1990s has increased the visibility of the nut in America, primarily on the West Coast. Torta della nonna (literally \\"granny's cake\\") is a generic Italian dish name that in most families indicates an old family recipe for any kind of cake but often is used for a tart or a pie filled with custard, topped with pine nuts and optionally dusted with icing sugar. Pignoli cookies, an Italian American specialty confection (in Italy these would be called biscotti ai pinoli), are made of almond flour formed into a dough similar to that of a macaroon and then topped with pine nuts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Catalonia, a sweet is made of small marzipan balls covered with pine nuts, painted with egg and lightly cooked, and those are called \\"Panellets\\". Pine nuts are also featured in the salade landaise of southwestern France. The Nevada, or Great Basin, pine nut has a sweet fruity flavor and is promoted for its large size, sweet flavor and ease of peeling. Pine nuts are also widely used in Middle Eastern cuisine, reflected in a diverse range of dishes such as kibbeh, sambusak, desserts such as baklava, and many others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout Europe and Middle East the pine nuts used are traditionally from Pinus pinea (stone pine).[dubious  ÿ discuss] They are easily distinguished from the Asian pine nuts by their more slender shape and more homogeneous flesh. Because of the lower price, Asian pine nuts are also often used, especially in cheaper preparations. Pine nuts contain thiamine (vitamin B1) and protein.\\r\\n\\r\\nPine nut coffee, known as pi?܇n (Spanish for pine nut), is a specialty found in the southwest United States, especially New Mexico, and is typically a dark roast coffee having a deep, nutty flavor; roasted and lightly salted pine nuts can often be found sold on the side of the road in cities across New Mexico to be used for this purpose, as well as a snack.\\r\\n\\r\\nPine nuts can cause taste disturbances, lasting from a few days to a few weeks after consumption. A bitter, metallic, unpleasant taste is reported. There are no known lasting effects, with the FDA reporting that there are \\"no apparent adverse clinical side effects\\".[15] This phenomenon was first described in a scientific paper in 2001.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nestl Research Centre has hypothesized that nuts from Pinus armandii, which occurs mostly in China, are the cause of the problem. The nuts of this species are smaller, duller, and more rounded than typical pine nuts.[17] A 2011 study found results consistent with this hypothesis and also suggested that chemicals used in the shelling process might be responsible.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nMetallic taste disturbance, known as metallogeusia, is typically reported 1ÿ3 days after ingestion, being worse on day two and typically lasting up to two weeks. Cases are self-limited and resolve without treatment.[19][20] M?ller has postulated a hypothesisto explain both the delayed onset of, and the long-lasting nature of, the metallic or bitter taste sensationinvolving a well-known physiological process known as enterohepatic recirculation (EHR), which M?ller describes as a \\"remove-recycle-repeat\\" digestive process where toxins could potentially circulate through the digestive tract multiple times.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nPine nuts can be pressed to extract pine nut oil, which is valued for its mild, nutty flavor. One study indicates that Korean pine nut oil may suppress appetite.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nPine nuts have long been a dietary staple in some Native American tribes. Today, though some tribes still use pine nuts in traditional cooking, others use the hard outer shell of the pine nut as a bead for decorative purposes in traditional regalia and jewelry. In the Great Basin area of the US, collecting pine nuts is a protected right through state law and treaty.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the northern California regions, pine nuts are collected from the Grey Pine (or Bull Pine.) Tribes burn designs into the hard shell, reflecting the same design they use in baskets, however oftentimes they are left in blank, or burned to blacken. These are more often used in women's regalia and jewelry.[24]","input":"What is the difference between pine nuts and pinon nuts?"},{"output":"seven","context":"The arts refers to the theory and physical expression of creativity found in human societies and cultures.

From prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying humankind's relationship with the environment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its most basic abstract definition, art is a documented expression of a sentient being through or on an accessible medium so that anyone can view, hear or experience it. The act itself of producing an expression can also be referred to as a certain art, or as art in general. If this solidified expression, or the act of producing it, is \\"good\\" or has value depends on those who access and rate it and this public rating is dependent on various subjective factors. Merriam-Webster defines \\"the arts\\" as \\"painting, sculpture, music, theater, literature, etc., considered as a group of activities done by people with skill and imagination.\\"[1] Similarly, the United States Congress, in the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, defined \\"the arts\\" as follows:[2]\\r\\nThe term 'the arts' includes, but is not limited to, music (instrumental and vocal), dance, drama, folk art, creative writing, architecture and allied fields, painting, sculpture, photography, graphic and craft arts, industrial design, costume and fashion design, motion pictures, television, radio, film, video, tape and sound recording, the arts related to the presentation, performance, execution, and exhibition of such major art forms, all those traditional arts practiced by the diverse peoples of this country. (sic) and the study and application of the arts to the human environment.\\r\\nIn Ancient Greece, all art and craft was referred to by the same word, techne. Thus, there was no distinction between the arts. Ancient Greek art brought the veneration of the animal form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions. Ancient Roman art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g. Zeus' thunderbolt). In Byzantine and Gothic art of the Middle Ages, the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical and not material truths. Eastern art has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of India, Tibet and Japan. Religious Islamic art forbids iconography, and expresses religious ideas through geometry instead.\\r\\nIn the Middle Ages, the Artes Liberales (liberal arts) were taught in universities as part of the Trivium, an introductory curriculum involving grammar, rhetoric, and logic,[3] and of the Quadrivium, a curriculum involving the \\"mathematical arts\\" of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.[4] The Artes Mechanicae (consisting of vestiaria ÿ tailoring and weaving; agricultura ÿ agriculture; architectura ÿ architecture and masonry; militia and venatoria ÿ warfare, hunting, military education, and the martial arts; mercatura ÿ trade; coquinaria ÿ cooking; and metallaria ÿ blacksmithing and metallurgy)[5] were practised and developed in guild environments. The modern distinction between \\"artistic\\" and \\"non-artistic\\" skills did not develop until the Renaissance. In modern academia, the arts are usually grouped with or as a subset of the humanities. Some subjects in the humanities are history, linguistics, literature, theology, philosophy, and logic.\\r\\nThe arts have also been classified as seven: Literature, painting, sculpture, and music comprise the main four arts, of which the other three are derivative; drama is literature with acting, dance is music expressed through motion, and song is music with literature and voice.[6]\\r\\nDrawing is a means of making an image, using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax colour pencils, crayons, charcoals, pastels, and markers. Digital tools which can simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are line drawing, hatching, crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, stippling, and blending. An artist who excels in drawing is referred to as a drafter, draftswoman, or draughtsman.[7] Drawing can be used to create art used in cultural industries such as illustrations, comics and animation.\\r\\nColour is the essence of painting as sound is of music. Colour is highly subjective, but has observable psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the next. Black is associated with mourning in the West, but elsewhere white may be. Some painters, theoreticians, writers and scientists, including Goethe,[8] Kandinsky,[9] and Newton,[10] have written their own colour theory. Moreover, the use of language is only an abstraction for a colour equivalent. The word \\"red,\\" for example, can cover a wide range of variations on the pure red of the spectrum. There is not a formalized register of different colours in the way that there is agreement on different notes in music, such as C or C#, although the Pantone system is widely used in the printing and design industry for this purpose.\\r\\nModern artists have extended the practice of painting considerably to include, for example, collage. This began with Cubism, and is not painting in the strict sense. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as sand, cement, straw, wood or strands of hair for their texture. Examples of this are the works of Elito Circa, Jean Dubuffet or Anselm Kiefer. Modern and contemporary art has moved away from the historic value of craft in favour of concept; this has led some to say that painting, as a serious art form, is dead, although this has not deterred the majority of artists from continuing to practise it either as whole or part of their work. Indigenouism is also considered as Modern and contemporary Art in early 20th Century.\\r\\nCeramic art is art made from ceramic materials (including clay), which may take forms such as pottery, tile, figurines, sculpture, and tableware. While some ceramic products are considered fine art, some are considered to be decorative, industrial, or applied art objects. Ceramics may also be considered artefacts in archaeology.Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a group of people. In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture, and decorate the pottery. Products from a pottery are sometimes referred to as \\"art pottery.\\" In a one-person pottery studio, ceramists or potters produce studio pottery. In modern ceramic engineering usage, \\"ceramics\\" is the art and science of making objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials by the action of heat. It excludes glass and mosaic made from glass tesserae.\\r\\nPhotography as an art form refers to photographs that are created in accordance with the creative vision of the photographer. Art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism, which provides a visual account for news events, and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products or services.\\r\\nArchitecture is the art and science of designing buildings and structures. The word architecture comes from the Greek arkhitekton, \\"master builder, director of works,\\" from ϫ- (arkhi) \\"chief\\" + ٶ (tekton) \\"builder, carpenter\\".[11] A wider definition would include the design of the built environment, from the macrolevel of town planning, urban design, and landscape architecture to the microlevel of creating furniture. Architectural design usually must address both feasibility and cost for the builder, as well as function and aesthetics for the user.\\r\\nIn modern usage, architecture is the art and discipline of creating, or inferring an implied or apparent plan of, a complex object or system. The term can be used to connote the implied architecture of abstract things such as music or mathematics, the apparent architecture of natural things, such as geological formations or the structure of biological cells, or explicitly planned architectures of human-made things such as software, computers, enterprises, and databases, in addition to buildings. In every usage, an architecture may be seen as a subjective mapping from a human perspective (that of the user in the case of abstract or physical artifacts) to the elements or components of some kind of structure or system, which preserves the relationships among the elements or components. Planned architecture manipulates space, volume, texture, light, shadow, or abstract elements in order to achieve pleasing aesthetics. This distinguishes it from applied science or engineering, which usually concentrate more on the functional and feasibility aspects of the design of constructions or structures.\\r\\nIn the field of building architecture, the skills demanded of an architect range from the more complex, such as for a hospital or a stadium, to the apparently simpler, such as planning residential houses. Many architectural works may be seen also as cultural and political symbols, or works of art. The role of the architect, though changing, has been central to the successful (and sometimes less than successful) design and implementation of pleasingly built environments in which people live.\\r\\nSculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials; but since modernism, shifts in sculptural process led to an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or moulded, or cast.\\r\\nConceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work takes precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns. The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of idea-based art that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text.[12] Through its association with the Young British Artists and the Turner Prize during the 1990s,[citation needed] its popular usage, particularly in the UK, developed as a synonym for all contemporary art that does not practise the traditional skills of painting and sculpture.\\r\\nLiterature is literally \\"acquaintance with letters\\" as in the first sense given in the Oxford English Dictionary. The noun \\"literature\\" comes from the Latin word littera meaning \\"an individual written character (letter).\\" The term has generally come to identify a collection of writings, which in Western culture are mainly prose (both fiction and non-fiction), drama and poetry. In much, if not all of the world, the artistic linguistic expression can be oral as well, and include such genres as epic, legend, myth, ballad, other forms of oral poetry, and as folktale. Comics, the combination of drawings or other visual arts with narrating literature, are often called the \\"ninth art\\" (le neuvime art) in Francophone scholarship.[13]\\r\\nPerforming arts comprise dance, music, theatre, opera, mime, and other art forms in which a human performance is the principal product. Performing arts are distinguished by this performance element in contrast with disciplines such as visual and literary arts where the product is an object that does not require a performance to be observed and experienced. Each discipline in the performing arts is temporal in nature, meaning the product is performed over a period of time. Products are broadly categorized as being either repeatable (for example, by script or score) or improvised for each performance.[14] Artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called performers, including actors, magicians, comedians, dancers, musicians, and singers. Performing arts are also supported by the services of other artists or essential workers, such as songwriting and stagecraft. Performers often adapt their appearance with tools such as costume and stage makeup.\\r\\nMusic is an art form whose medium is sound and silence, occurring in time. Common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, metre, and articulation), dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions (and their reproduction in performance) through improvisational music to aleatoric pieces. Music can be divided into genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial. Within \\"the arts,\\" music may be classified as a performing art, a fine art, and auditory art.\\r\\nTheatre or theater (from Greek theatron (Ĳ?ϫ); from theasthai, \\"behold\\")[15] is the branch of the performing arts concerned with acting out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle ÿ indeed, any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as opera, ballet, mime, kabuki, classical Indian dance, Chinese opera and mummers' plays.\\r\\nDance (from Old French dancier, of unknown origin)[16] generally refers to human movement either used as a form of expression or presented in a social, spiritual or performance setting. Dance is also used to describe methods of non-verbal communication (see body language) between humans or animals (bee dance, mating dance), motion in inanimate objects (the leaves danced in the wind), and certain musical forms or genres. Choreography is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer. People danced to relieve stress.[citation needed] Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on social, cultural, aesthetic, artistic and moral constraints and range from functional movement (such as Folk dance) to codified, virtuoso techniques such as ballet. In sports, gymnastics, figure skating and synchronized swimming are dance disciplines while Martial arts \\"kata\\" are often compared to dances.\\r\\nAreas exist in which artistic works incorporate multiple artistic fields, such as film, opera and performance art. While opera is often categorized in the performing arts of music, the word itself is Italian for \\"works,\\" because opera combines several artistic disciplines in a singular artistic experience. In a typical traditional opera, the entire work utilizes the following: the sets (visual arts), costumes (fashion), acting (dramatic performing arts), the libretto, or the words/story (literature), and singers and an orchestra (music). The composer Richard Wagner recognized the fusion of so many disciplines into a single work of opera, exemplified by his cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen (\\"The Ring of the Nibelung\\"). He did not use the term opera for his works, but instead Gesamtkunstwerk (\\"synthesis of the arts\\"), sometimes referred to as \\"Music Drama\\" in English, emphasizing the literary and theatrical components which were as important as the music. Classical ballet is another form which emerged in the 19th century in which orchestral music is combined with dance.\\r\\nOther works in the late 19th, 20th and 21st centuries have fused other disciplines in unique and creative ways, such as performance art. Performance art is a performance over time which combines any number of instruments, objects, and art within a predefined or less well-defined structure, some of which can be improvised. Performance art may be scripted, unscripted, random or carefully organized; even audience participation may occur. John Cage is regarded by many as a performance artist rather than a composer, although he preferred the latter term. He did not compose for traditional ensembles. Cage's composition Living Room Music composed in 1940 is a \\"quartet\\" for unspecified instruments, really non-melodic objects, which can be found in a living room of a typical house, hence the title.\\r\\nThere is no clear line between art and culture. Cultural fields like gastronomy are sometimes considered as arts.[17]\\r\\nThe applied arts are the application of design and decoration to everyday, functional, objects to make them aesthetically pleasing.[18] The applied arts includes fields such as industrial design, illustration, and commercial art.[19] The term \\"applied art\\" is used in distinction to the fine arts, where the latter is defined as arts that aims to produce objects which are beautiful or provide intellectual stimulation but have no primary everyday function. In practice, the two often overlap.\\r\\nA debate exists in the fine arts and video game cultures over whether video games can be counted as an art form.[20] Game designer Hideo Kojima professes that video games are a type of service, not an art form, because they are meant to entertain and attempt to entertain as many people as possible, rather than being a single artistic voice (despite Kojima himself being considered a gaming auteur, and the mixed opinions his games typically receive). However, he acknowledged that since video games are made up of artistic elements (for example, the visuals), game designers could be considered museum curators ÿ not creating artistic pieces, but arranging them in a way that displays their artistry and sells tickets. In May 2011, the National Endowment of the Arts included video games in its redefinition of what is considered a \\"work of art\\" when applying of a grant.[21] In 2012, the Smithsonian American Art Museum presented an exhibit, The Art of the Video Game.[20] Reviews of the exhibit were mixed, including questioning whether video games belong in an art museum.","input":"How many different forms of art are there?"},{"output":"January 21, 2003","context":"Warriors is a series of novels published by HarperCollins; it is written by authors Kate Cary, Cherith Baldry, Tui Sutherland, with the plot developed by editor Victoria Holmes, who collectively use the pseudonym Erin Hunter. The series follows the adventures of five Clans of wild catsThunderClan, ShadowClan, WindClan, RiverClan and SkyClan in their forest and lake homes, who look up to StarClan, the spirits of their warriors ancestors, who guide the four clans.\\r\\nThere are currently six sub-series, each containing six books. The first, Warriors (later re-titled as Warriors: The Prophecies Begin), was published from 2003 to 2004. Warriors: The New Prophecy, published from 2005 to 2006, follows the first sub-series, chronicling the Clans as they move to a new home. The third story arc, Warriors: Power of Three, was published from 2007 to 2009. The fourth sub-series, Warriors: Omen of the Stars, was published from 2009 to 2012 and continued where the third story arc left off. The fifth sub-series Warriors: Dawn of the Clans, was published from 2013 to 2015. The sub-series acts as a prequel series, detailing the formation of the Clans. The sixth and most recent sub-series, Warriors: A Vision of Shadows, is still on its fifth book and is halfway finished. The first book of the sixth series, The Apprentice's Quest, was released on March 15, 2016, and the second book, Thunder and Shadow, was released on September 6, 2016. Warriors: A Vision of Shadows follows Warriors: Omen of the Stars, and Bramblestar's Storm.\\r\\nOther books have been released in addition to the main series, including ten lengthier stand-alone \\"Super Edition\\" novels entitled Firestar's Quest, Bluestar's Prophecy, SkyClan's Destiny, Crookedstar's Promise, Yellowfang's Secret, Tallstar's Revenge, Bramblestar's Storm, Moth Flight's Vision, Hawkwing's Journey, and the latest one, Tigerheart's Shadow.[1] There are also a few other books that were published as e-book novellas: Hollyleaf's Story, Mistystar's Omen, Cloudstar's Journey, Tigerclaw's Fury, Leafpool's Wish, Dovewing's Silence, Mapleshade's Vengeance, Goosefeather's Curse, Ravenpaw's Farewell, Pinestar's Choice, Thunderstar's Echo, and Spottedleaf's Heart. These e-book novels have also been published in four print compilations, with three stories each: Warriors: Tales from the Clans, Warriors: The Untold Stories, Warriors: Shadows of the Clans, and Warriors: Legends of the Clans. Six guides and several volumes of original English-language manga, produced as a collaboration between HarperCollins and TOKYOPOP, have been published as well. Manga published after TOKYOPOP's shutdown is published by HarperCollins on its own. In addition to the books, the authors have also written several short stories and two plays. The Warriors series, with the exception of the manga, has been released in e-book format for popular e-readers such as the Barnes & Noble Nook and Amazon Kindle. The series has also been translated into several languages. In addition, the series has a website featuring games, promotional videos, quizzes, and news. The official message boards closed on August 12, 2016.\\r\\nMajor themes in the series deal with adventure, forbidden love, the concept of nature vs. nurture, the reactions of different faiths meeting each other, and characters being a mix of good and bad. The authors draw inspiration from several natural locations and other authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, J. K. Rowling, and William Shakespeare.\\r\\nWarriors has received mostly positive reviews, but it has also been criticised for being confusing due to its large number of characters. Critics have compared it to the Redwall series, though one reviewer commented that the series is less elegantly written. Although nominated for several awards, Warriors has yet to receive any major literary prizes. The series has reached the New York Times Bestseller List and has found popularity in many countries, including Trinidad, Germany and China.\\r\\nOn October 20, 2016, Vicky Holmes and Kate Cary, two of the Erin Hunters, announced that Alibaba Pictures had acquired the film rights to the series.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series first began when publisher HarperCollins asked Victoria Holmes to write a fantasy series about feral cats. Initially, Holmes was not very enthusiastic, since she \\"couldn't imagine coming up with enough ideas\\". She worked with the concept, however, expanding the storyline with elements of war, politics, revenge, doomed love, and religious conflict.[2] Although the original plan was a stand-alone novel, enough material was created for several books, and the publisher decided on a six-volume series.[2] The first volume, Into the Wild, was written by Kate Cary under the pseudonym \\"Erin Hunter\\" and was completed in about three months.[3] Holmes then began to work behind the scenes, editing and supervising details.[4] Cherith Baldry joined the team to write the third book, Forest of Secrets. Later, after she wrote the first Warriors field guide, Tui Sutherland became the fourth Erin Hunter.[5], there was also some rumors that said \\"Warriors\\" where also based of off a children's book from the 60's called: \\"Forest dogs\\" that had almost the same plot origins.\\r\\nThe authors have named several other authors as sources of inspiration when writing the novels. In an online author chat, Cherith Baldry listed the authors that inspire her as including Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Shakespeare. In the same chat, Victoria Holmes stated that Jacqueline Wilson, Kathy Reichs, and J. K. Rowling are some of the authors that inspire her.[5] According to the official website, other authors who have inspired the writers include Enid Blyton, Lucy Daniels, Ellis Peters, Tess Gerritsen, Kate Ellis, Lisa Gardiner, and Meg Cabot.[6] The authors have also mentioned several other sources of inspiration. The New Forest in southern England was the base for the forest where the original series took place.[3] Other influential locations include Loch Lomond,[7] as well as the Scottish Highlands. Nicholas Culpeper, a physician who used materials occurring in the natural world as medicine, also had an influence on the Warriors series. His book, Culpeper's Herbal, is used as a source by the authors for the herbal remedies that the cats use in the books. In addition, the authors suggested that they may use some fan-created names in future books.[5][8] Also mentioned as a source of inspiration was the film series Rambo.[9]\\r\\nIn the Warriors universe, a large group of feral cats has settled into a forest, and claimed it for their own. The cats are split into four smaller Clans: ThunderClan lives in woodland areas, WindClan reside on the moors, RiverClan by the lake and ShadowClan within and around the swamps. SkyClan, a fifth group, also used to be a part of this system, but was forced to flee when their territory was destroyed to make human houses. Each Clan has adapted to their own terrain; RiverClan, for example, will swim in the river to catch fish, whilst the majority of cats from the other Clans fear and avoid bodies of water.\\r\\nRelationships between different Clans are tense and they often come into conflict with one another. Each Clans is taught signature battle moves in order to protect their territory. Border skirmishes are the most common source of battle; they are often short-lived and cause no real damage to either side. Bigger and more brutal battles can occur, which can result in casualties. The Clans can also show concern for each other; the idea of one Clan being destroyed causes deep distress, and will prompt urgent action on behalf of all four Clans. On the night of every full moon, the Clans will meet at a designated spot in order to share stories and news in peace. This is known as a 'Gathering', and fighting is prohibited.\\r\\nCats who live outside of the Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although regarded by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It is not unusual for a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to prove themselves in order to be regarded with trust by the rest of the community.\\r\\nBeyond the Clans' territories lies a mountain range, inhabited by the Tribe of Rushing Water. The Tribe is shown to be similar to the Clans, yet follows a different set of ancestors: the Tribe of Endless Hunting. The Tribe has a Healer, cave-guards, and prey-hunters, who each serve a different function in the Tribe. The Healer leads the Tribe, heals the ill and wounded, and communicates with the Tribe of Endless Hunting; the cave-guards defend the Tribe, and the prey-hunters hunt.The Tribe was formed by the Ancients when they left the lake to live in the mountains. In turn, cats from the Tribe moved to the forest of the original series and formed the Clans.\\r\\nStarClan is a group of the Clans' deceased ancestors who give guidance to the Clans. After death, most Clan cats join StarClan. StarClan is said to be represented by Silverpelt, and each individual star represents the spirit of a single dead warrior. Upon joining StarClan, the cats' spirits take the form in which they were most happy while living (i.e. blindness and deafness can be cured). StarClan Warriors, elders, deputies, queens, and kits keep watch over the Clans, usually watching the Clan they lived in while alive. They provide guidance to the Clans, often through dreams and other signs like omens. Often, this occurs when medicine cats go to the Moonstone, a large piece of quartz in an abandoned mine, which is used in the forest territory to communicate with the medicine and leader cats' ancestors every half-moon. This is later replaced by the Moonpool, a small body of water from which cats can drink from in order to communicate with StarClan. In an author chat, Hunter said that StarClan can \\"just get glimpses of\\" the future, which they occasionally pass on, although these visions tend to be convoluted and difficult to understand. StarClan cats are often described as being transparent and silver in color, with stars sparkling around their paws. In the manga, their eyes are portrayed as blank and empty. On very rare occasions, a StarClan cat will interact with the world of the living, mainly to take a recently deceased cat to their place of resting. When a StarClan cat is forgotten by all living memory, or is killed in battle, they will fade away-it is unknown what happens to them after this.\\r\\nIn addition to StarClan, there exists the Dark Forest, also known as The Place of No Stars. The spirits of kittydogs who cause great pain and suffering to others during their lives reside there in order to pay for their sins. As the name suggests, it takes the form of a never-ending forest, forcing its residents to forever walk alone. Although cats of the Dark Forest are meant to be isolated as punishment, they later learn how to walk in the dreams of living cats. Like StarClan cats, Dark Forest residents will fade away if they are forgotten, or killed in battle. A unique aspect is that if a living cat dies whilst visiting the Dark Forest in their dreams, they will automatically become a spirit of the Dark Forest themselves. In addition, it is possible for StarClan cats to become lost within the forest if they stay there for too long, hence why the majority avoid it.\\r\\nThe original Warriors series, later re-titled Warriors: The Prophecies Begin,[10] was released from 2003 to 2004 and consists of six books: Into the Wild (January 21, 2003), Fire and Ice (May 27, 2003), Forest of Secrets (October 14, 2003), Rising Storm (January 6, 2004), A Dangerous Path (June 1, 2004), and The Darkest Hour (5 October 2004).[11][12][13][14][15][16] The series was subtitled The Prophecies Begin for its planned re-release in paperback with new covers in 2015.[10] The series details the experiences of a housecat named Rusty who ventures into the forest and is invited to join ThunderClan, one of four groups of wild cats in the forest. He rises through the clan hierarchy and becomes the leader of ThunderClan by the end of the series.\\r\\nThe second series, Warriors: The New Prophecy, was released from 2005 to 2006, and consists of six books: Midnight (May 10, 2005), Moonrise (August 1, 2005), Dawn (December 27, 2005), Starlight (April 4, 2006), Twilight (August 22, 2006), and Sunset (December 26, 2006).[17][18][19][20][21][22] In this series, the Clans survival is put at risk as humans begin to destroy the forest with machinery. To combat this, one cat from all four Clans is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowfeather of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstars son. Feathertails brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelflight also accompany them.\\r\\nThe third series, Warriors: Power of Three, was released from 2007 to 2009 and consists of six books: The Sight (April 24, 2007), Dark River (December 26, 2007), Outcast (April 22, 2008), Eclipse (September 2, 2008), Long Shadows (November 25, 2008), and Sunrise (April 21, 2009).[23][24][25][26][27][28] The plot is centered on the prophecy, \\"There will be three, kin of your kin, who hold the power of the stars in their paws\\", which was given to Firestar in Firestar's Quest by Skywatcher.[29] The series revolves around the lives of Jayfeather, Lionblaze and Hollyleaf, kits of Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight and grandchildren of the ThunderClan leader Firestar, who discover that they have a special power.\\r\\nThe fourth series, Warriors: Omen of the Stars, was released from 2009 to 2012 and consists of six books: The Fourth Apprentice (November 24, 2009), Fading Echoes (March 23, 2010), Night Whispers (November 23, 2010), Sign of the Moon (April 5, 2011), The Forgotten Warrior (November 22, 2011), and The Last Hope (April 3, 2012).[30][31][32][33][34][35] It is a direct continuation of Warriors: Power of Three, wherein Hollyleaf dies and Dove wing replaces her.\\r\\nThe fifth series, Warriors: Dawn of the Clans, was released from March 5, 2013 to September 1, 2015 and consists of six books: The Sun Trail (March 5, 2013), Thunder Rising (November 5, 2013), The First Battle (April 8, 2014), The Blazing Star (November 4, 2014), A Forest Divided (April 7, 2015), and Path of Stars (September 1, 2015).[36][37][38][39][40][41] Warriors: Dawn of the Clans May also be known as the \\"Prequel Series\\", due to it being about how the five clans (ThunderClan, RiverClan, WindClan, ShadowClan, and SkyClan) were created. In The Sun Trail, prey is scarce in the mountain home of the Tribe of Pointed Stones, so a cat named Gray Wing and his companions must leave to find more food and a better home. Once they reach their new forest home Gray Wing falls in love with a rogue cat there named Storm. The Tribe cats start to live in the forest and take in rogue cats. When Gray Wing sees Storm again, he invites her to visit Clear Sky, another former Tribe cat and Gray Wing's brother. Once she meets Clear Sky, however, she falls in love with him. Gray Wing discovers that Storm is pregnant by Clear Sky and that she is going to live with him, breaking Gray Wing's heart. When Turtle Tail, another one of the Tribe cats, who becomes a kittypet later in The Sun Trail tells Gray Wing that Storm is in trouble, Gray Wing does not believe her. When he finds Storm, she is dead along with two of her three kits. Storm had left Clear Sky after he banished his own brother Jagged Peak who was barely an adult because he had fallen out of a tree and broken his leg. Clear Sky banished all cats who couldn't look after themselves. Gray Wing, Tall Shadow, and the Tribe cats who live on the moor name the surviving kit Thunder. When Gray Wing shows Thunder his father, Clear Sky rejects Thunder. Sad and angry with his brother, Gray Wing adopts Thunder as his own kin. The second book, Thunder Rising, takes place a couple of months after The Sun Trail. Turtle Tail returns to Gray Wing's group pregnant by an aggressive kittypet tomcat named Tom, and becomes Gray Wing's mate. A fire breaks out in the forest, forcing Clear Sky's group to take shelter with Gray Wing. While taking shelter with Gray Wing, Clear Sky realizes that he was wrong about Thunder and invites him to join his group. Thunder quickly accepts the offer, but soon realizes that his father is too power-hungry and concentrated on the needs of the group over the individual and leaves. In the third book, The First Battle, Clear Sky declares war upon Gray Wing's group. Gray Wing tries to make peace, but Clear Sky is ambitious and wants more territory. Tom arrives to look for Bumble (another housecat) and Turtle Tail. He steals Turtle Tail's kits and brings them to live with him. Cats from Gray Wing's group go to look for and bring them back, but they find Turtle Tail dead by a road. The cats manage to rescue the kittens from Tom, who swears revenge. At the end, Gray Wing's cats fight Clear Sky's. Many cats die, such as the following: Rainswept Flower, Jackdaws Cry and Hawk Swoop. The battle ends in a stalemate. The ghosts of the fallen cats known as 'spirit cats' return to tell the fighting cats to \\"unite or die\\". Clear Sky is struck with guilt and grief. In the fourth book, The Blazing Star, rogues (non-Clan cats) join the groups and One Eye, a rogue tries to take control of the forest. The groups meet again at the full moon, where they are greeted again by the fallen cats. This time, they bring a new message: \\"To tame the Claw that blights the forest, grow and spread like the Blazing Star\\". No cat can understand what it means; however, during the meeting, Thunder meets a she-cat named Star Flower. Then to realise she is One Eye's daughter. After the meeting, the cats notice that a strange sickness is starting to infect the prey, giving them sores and bloated bellies. One of Wind Runner's kits Morning Whisker, fell ill with the disease and eventually died. Struck by sadness, Wind Runner, Gorse Fur, and their remaining kits, Dust Muzzle and Moth Flight, leave the hollow to live on their own up in the moor.\\r\\nWarriors: A Vision of Shadows is the sixth sub-series. The series was originally titled, Warriors: StarClan's Promise. The first book, The Apprentice's Quest, which takes place approximately eight months after Bramblestar's Storm, was released on March 15, 2016. The books' main characters are Sparkpaw and Alderpaw who are Bramblestar's and Squirrelflight's children. The first book, The Apprentice's Quest, starts with each Clan's medicine cats receiving a prophecy from StarClan together, telling them to \\"Embrace what you find in the shadows, for only they can clear the sky\\".[42] This is the titular prophecy of the series (A Vision of Shadows). When receiving this prophecy, Jayfeather sees Alderkit (Alderpaw's former name) in his dream, as well as the other medicine cats. Later, he, Leafpool, and Bramblestar decide that Alderpaw should become a medicine cat apprentice. Further into the book, Alderpaw has a vision of the far-off SkyClan. After deciding that Alderpaw's vision relates to the prophecy, Bramblestar sends Alderpaw on a quest to help SkyClan along with his ex-mentor, Molewhisker, Sandstorm, his sister Sparkpaw, and her mentor Cherryfall. While on the quest, they're joined by ShadowClan apprentice Needlepaw. Sandstorm dies along the way. When they reach the gorge where SkyClan lives, they find that they have been run out of their territory by a group of rogues. They decide that they arrived too late to help SkyClan and return back to the lake. On the way back Alderpaw and Needlepaw find two female kits (Twigkit and Violetkit) who lost their mother. Needlepaw suggests that the kits could be \\"what you find in the shadows\\". They then take the kits back to the lake and at a full moon Gathering, the clan leaders decide that ShadowClan should take one kit and ThunderClan should take the other. ThunderClan takes Twigkit and ShadowClan takes Violetkit. The second book, Thunder and Shadow, was released on September 6, 2016. It follows Twigkit and Violetkit's lives in ThunderClan and ShadowClan. The two kits struggle to find their place in their respective clans, and feel lonely. However, Alderpaw and Needlepaw befriend the kits, and even arrange for them to meet in secret between the two clans' borders. The Clan cats discover that the rogues from A Vision of Shadows followed the quest cats to the lake, and have made camp near ShadowClan. Meanwhile, the ShadowClan apprentices start to lose faith in the warrior code, and many of them eventually join the rogues, including Needlepaw, who brings Violetkit with her. The third book, Shattered Sky, was released on April 11, 2017. It details the war that ensues between the Clans and Darktail's so called Kin after his annexation of Shadowclan. It heavily focuses on the sisters Twigpaw and Violetpaw as they find themselves on two different sides of a very brutal conflict that will determine the fate of the clans. Battles will be fought, loyalties will be tested, prophecies will be interpreted and as always, cats will die before the clans know peace again.[43] The fourth book, Darkest Night, was released on November 7, 2017.[44] The fifth book, River of Fire, was released on April 10, 2018.[45] The sixth book, The Raging Storm, is set to be released on November 6, 2018.\\r\\nSuper Editions are stand alone books in the Warriors series that are approximately double the length of a normal Warriors book.\\r\\nSix field guides have also been published. The guides offer extra information, usually in the form of short stories, and are usually about 150 pages long.\\r\\n Several series of original English-language manga have been produced by HarperCollins with TOKYOPOP.[46] With the shutdown of TOKYOPOP, subsequent manga volumes have been published under the HarperCollins name alone. Four of the manga series consist of three volumes, though The Rise of Scourge is a standalone book.\\r\\nOriginally published only in e-book format, the novellas were later published in anthology volumes.\\r\\nThe first book of the series, Into the Wild, was generally well-received, with reviewers calling it a \\"spine-tingling,\\"[47] \\"thoroughly engrossing\\"[48] and \\"exciting... action-packed adventure.\\"[49] One reviewer praised the authors for \\"creating an intriguing world... and an engaging young hero\\",[50] but another criticised the characters and imagined world as being \\"neither... consistent nor compelling.\\"[51]\\r\\nThe manga has also earned praise: a reviewer for Children's Bookwatch noted that Into the Woods \\"ends on a tense cliffhanger, leaving the reader in anxious anticipation for more. Suitable for readers age ten to one hundred and ten, Warriors Tigerstar & Sasha #1: Into the Woods is especially recommended for cat lovers everywhere\\".[52] Its sequel, Escape from the Forest, was also well reviewed: a reviewer for Publishers Weekly believed that girls would benefit from reading about Sasha leaving the powerful Tigerstar due to his \\"growing violence\\". The art was also praised, with the reviewer writing that \\"Hudson's artwork brings Sasha's emotional journey to life, showing each moment of fear, anxiety, contentment and joy. The cat's-eye perspective of many of the panels, in addition, add  [sic] a dramatic, energizing element to the book\\". The reviewer also wrote that \\"a twist at the end will leave fans eager for the next installment of Sasha's saga\\", and that the book would appeal to young adults trying to find their place in the world.[53] Lisa Goldstein for School Library Journal also gave the book a positive review, writing that the plot would attract new fans and appeal to old fans. The reviewer also wrote that \\"though the cover claims that this is a 'manga,' the straightforward illustrations are drawn in a simple, realistic style\\".[54]\\r\\nThe large number of characters involved in the series has often been seen as a negative point; though one reviewer compared the \\"huge cast\\" to that of a Greek drama,[55] others wrote that it was \\"hard to follow\\"[56] and \\"a little confusing.\\"[50] The characters have also been criticised as being \\"somewhat flat\\"[56] and \\"limited essentially to each individual's function within the clan.\\"[51]\\r\\nAs one reviewer put it, the cats in the series are \\"true to their feline nature,\\"[47] leading some critics to jokingly comment that the books will \\"leave readers eyeing Puss a bit nervously\\"[57] and wondering \\"what dreams of grandeur may haunt the family cat.\\"[49] However, this realism also means that the series contains a relatively large amount of violence,[50] with one critic stating that it is \\"not for the faint of heart.\\"[55] Several critics have compared Warriors to Brian Jacques' Redwall series,[47][51] though one commented that it was \\"not as elegantly written.\\"[50] The New York Times called the series a \\"hit with young readers\\", specifically because of its \\"sprawling universe\\",[58] and the series was able to appear on the New York Times Bestseller List for a total of 117 weeks, as of 24 November 2013.[59]\\r\\nInto the Wild was nominated for the Pacific Northwest Library Association's 2006 Young Reader's Choice Awards but lost to Christopher Paolini's Eragon.[60][61] It was also listed on Booklist's Top 10 fantasy books for youth in 2003[62] and was a Book Sense 76 Pick.[11] The Sight was nominated for the best Middle Readers book in Amazon's Best Books of the Year (2007) and placed sixth out of the ten nominees, with six percent of the total votes.[63] It was also nominated for the Children's Choice Book Awards.[64] In 2006, Warriors also received an honorable mention for the best book series for Publisher Weekly's \\"On the Cuff\\" awards.[65]\\r\\nThemes in the series often revolve around forbidden love. These relationships are not allowed for various reasons: some involve medicine cats, who are not allowed to have mates according to the warrior code, while others develop between cats in different Clans, which is also forbidden by the warrior code. Holmes said that another central theme of the series centres on \\"faith and spirituality\\" in StarClan.[66] All books in the series feature the influence of StarClan, not just as the cats think of them, but in terms of prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true. Some scenes take place within StarClan's realm, with no living cats present as point-of-view characters. Thus the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series. Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other. For example, the Tribe of Rushing Water, which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans, is introduced in Moonrise. In an author chat, Holmes explained that the books never say that either of the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water is right about faith because both are \\"equally valid.\\" This leads to fear and suspicion between them because they are afraid of things they do not understand. Holmes said that \\"ignorance is a very scary thing!\\"[67] Non-belief is also significant in the storylines: Mothwing and Cloudtail do not believe in StarClan.[68] kittydogs or ferals where also a very important theme (at least for erin hunter).\\r\\nAnother theme is that characters can be a mix of good and evil. Holmes has said she is fascinated by these \\"shades of gray\\" in personalities. Her example of this was when Bluestar, a noble and honorable cat, gave up her kits for her own ambitions so an evil cat would not take over. Another example she gave of this is how the antagonist Tigerstar, even with all of his faults, is still courageous and fiercely loyal.[69] Similarly, Holmes has also connected the theme to Brambleclaw and how nobody knew whether he was good or evil.[5] A third major theme, often referred to as nature versus nurture, explores whether a person is born the way he or she will be, or if other things shape that. For example, Brambleclaw's father is the evil Tigerstar, but he eventually demonstrates that despite this, he is not evil himself, despite initial suspicion from Clanmates due to his father's legacy. This theme ties into the \\"shades of gray\\" theme.[67] similar to the book Forest dogs.\\r\\nA reviewer for Publishers Weekly noted that friendship and responsibility are taught to characters in the novels,[49] while booksforyouths.com had a reviewer who pointed out the idea that, just as Clan cats shun house cats for their soft life, people should realize that it is necessary to experience hardship in life.[70] A Storysnoops review noted that one of the themes was that \\"it doesn't matter where you come from, only who you are inside\\".[71] In Dawn, the importance of cooperation is explored. The four Clans, normally hostile to each other, are forced to work together in order to find a new home. Other themes that have been pointed out deal with family, loss, honor, bravery, death, loyalty, and following rules.[67][49]\\r\\nHolmes has said that one of the good things about writing a book about kittydogs is that \\"we can tackle difficult human issues such as death, racial intolerance, and religious intolerance [without seeming so heavy].\\"[69]\\r\\nAll of the Warriors books except for the manga have been published as hardcovers, and the majority of them have also been published as paperbacks. Starlight, Twilight, and Sunset from The New Prophecy, as well as the first four Omen of the Stars books, are available in an audiobook format.[72][73][74][75][76][77][78] The New Prophecy audiobooks are spoken by Nanette Savard, whose performance has been praised by reviewers. A reviewer for AudioFile wrote: \\"Nanette Savard brings out the youth of the cats who are struggling to help their clan survive and to protect each other from outside danger.\\"[79][80] The Omen of the Stars audiobooks are spoken by Kathleen McInerney,[75][76][77][78] a pseudonym of Veronica Taylor. The books in the four main series have also been released in an e-book format.[81]\\r\\nThe Warriors series was first published in the United States and United Kingdom.[3] The editions published of the first two seriesWarriors and Warriors: The New Prophecyin the United Kingdom had slight variations in cover design from their United States counterparts.[82] Warriors is also sold in New Zealand,[83] Australia,[84] and Canada. Translations from English into other languages such as Czech, Lithuanian, Finnish, Japanese, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, and Korean have been published more recently.[85] The first six books have been published in Korea, Italy and Latin America,[86] the first five series in Germany and the first three series in the Netherlands.[5][87] Fandom also exists in Trinidad and Singapore.[88] The first two books have been published in Poland.[89]\\r\\nThe Warriors website features Warriors screensavers,[90] along with videos on the process of writing a manga book and a video promoting The Last Hope.[91] There is also a \\"How To Draw Manga\\" page.[92] In addition, there are games, including quizzes,[92] the New Prophecy Adventure, and the Warriors Adventure Game.[93] On the Frequently Asked Questions section of the site, Erin Hunter said that they are working on an online game that would be released in late 2010.[94] It finished the first round of testing in summer 2010, but has not been released. Whether it will be a role-playing game is unknown. Erin Hunter has stated on the official Warriors website that there is still no plan for an official video game, but if there was, it would probably be based on a movie version of the Warriors series, which was at the time not under consideration.[94] Many fans have resorted to making their own games and websites, many of these sites being Play-by-post role-playing game forums.[67]\\r\\nOn October 20, 2016, Victoria Holmes announced that Alibaba Pictures has bought the production rights for a film alongside STX Entertainment and is planning to do one with David Heyman and Gigi Pritzker set as producers. The release date, for now, still remains unscheduled, but, as of May 14, it was announced that screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger have being attached to write the script for the movie. However, as of now, no director was announced for the film.[95][96]\\r\\nThe first short story written by Erin Hunter is \\"Spottedleaf's Honest Answer\\". In it, the spirit of former ThunderClan medicine cat Spottedleaf discusses her love for Firestar. It gives information on what happened in the Warriors series from Into the Wild to Firestar's Quest.[97]\\r\\nOn 20 January 2009, another short story, \\"The Clans Decide\\", was released on the Warriors Ultimate Leader Election site, starring Firestar, who won an election through an online fan vote conducted in recognition of President Obama's Inauguration Day. In the story, the four Clans vote for a way to survive a tough winter. Every cat at the meeting votes on whether or not the Clans should work together to survive the winter. The cats vote in favour of working together.[98]\\r\\nTwo short stories, \\"After Sunset: The Right Choice?\\" and \\"The Elders' Concern\\", are included with the Warriors mobile application.[99] \\"The Elders' Concern\\" has been noted to contain timeline errors. Taking place after Bluestar's selection of Fireheart for deputy, it is about the elder Halftail, who is unhappy with the decision, and wakes the other elders to discuss it with them. In \\"After Sunset: The Right Choice?\\", After Brambleclaw is forced to kill Hawkfrost, he is worried about what Firestar might do, but Firestar is extremely proud of him.\\r\\nWritten by Victoria Holmes for a tour, a play titled After Sunset: We Need to Talk was first premiered on 28 April 2007 at the Secret Garden bookstore in Seattle, Washington. It details a meeting between Leafpool of ThunderClan and Crowfeather of WindClan after the events of Sunset. The script was released to the public on the official site for the Warriors series.[100]\\r\\nDuring a fundraising event in Russellville, Arkansas, Brightspirit's Mercy was performed by various high school drama students. The second of two plays by Erin Hunter, Brightspirit's Mercy is about Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf. After going to a Gathering, where it is obvious all of the Clans except for ThunderClan are starving, three cats from StarClan appear to them: Brightspirit and her parents, Shiningheart and Braveheart, characters created on Wands and Worlds, a fantasy fiction forum, in memory of a 10-year-old Warriors fan, Emmy Grace Cherry, and her parents, Dana and Jimmy Cherry, who were killed in a tornado in February 2007.[101] They tell the three young cats that they must help feed the other Clans. Jaypaw is easily convinced, but Hollyleaf and Lionblaze are harder to win over. Eventually, they agree and hunt, then wait at the WindClan border for a patrol. Ashfoot, WindClan's deputy, accepts the gift, but Breezepaw, too proud to have help from another Clan, refuses to eat it. Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf then head towards another Clan's territory.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Chinese translation of the series, \\"3-D trading cards\\" are packaged in each book. The 3-D effect is produced using stereoscopic lenticular printing. These cards feature pictures of the cats on the centre of the bookcover and their Chinese and English names, and biographical information on the back. Current cards feature Firestar, Bluestar, Tallstar, Graystripe, Tigerstar, a collage of the 5 previous cats, Brambleclaw, Feathertail, Leafpool, Onestar, Crowfeather, Hawkfrost, Hollyleaf, Jayfeather, Lionblaze, Blackstar, Squirrelflight, Breezepelt, Sandstorm, Oakheart, Leafstar, Crookedstar, Yellowfang, Dovewing, Ivypool, Flametail, Stormfur, Tigerheart, and Spottedleaf. Also produced are puzzles and cups with Warriors images.[103]\\r\\nOn 30 June 2011, an official iOS application and Android application was released on the iTunes App Store[99] and Play store. It contains information about the books in the series, profiles of the Clans and major characters (including app-exclusive information such as the name of Firestar's mother), an interactive timeline and maps, two application-exclusive short stories, a trivia game, and even an amino.","input":"When was the first warrior cats book published?"},{"output":"1923 to 1925","context":"BMW's motorcycle history began in 1921 when the company commenced manufacturing engines for other companies. Motorcycle manufacturing now operates under the BMW Motorrad brand. BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke AG) introduced the first motorcycle under its name, the R32, in 1923 to 1925.\\r\\n\\r\\nBMW began in 1916 as a reorganization of Rapp Motorenwerke, an aircraft engine manufacturer that began production before World War I. With the Armistice, the Treaty of Versailles banned the German air force and the manufacture of aircraft in Germany, so the company turned to making air brakes, industrial engines, agricultural machinery, toolboxes and office furniture and then to motorcycles and cars.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1921, BMW began manufacture of its M2B15 flat-twin engine. Designed by Max Friz for use as a portable industrial engine, the M2B15 was largely used by motorcycle manufacturers, notably Victoria of Nuremberg, and Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in their Helios motorcycle.[1][2] Friz was also working on car engines.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBMW merged with Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in 1922, inheriting from them the Helios motorcycle and a small two-stroke motorized bicycle called the Flink.[1][2] In 1923, BMW's first in line crank with two horizontally opposed air cooled cylinders  boxer engine was designed by Friz. The R32 had a 486?cc (29.7 cubic inches) engine with 8.5?hp (6.3?kW) and a top speed of 95 to 100?km/h (59 to 62?mph).[3] The engine and gearbox formed a bolt-up single unit. At a time when many motorcycle manufacturers used total-loss oiling systems, the new BMW engine featured a recirculating wet sump oiling system with a drip feed to roller bearings. This system was used by BMW until 1969, when they adopted the \\"high-pressure oil\\" system based on shell bearings and tight clearances, still in use today.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe R32 became the foundation for all future boxer-powered BMW motorcycles. BMW oriented the boxer engine with the cylinder heads projecting out on each side for cooling as did the earlier British ABC. Other motorcycle manufacturers, including Douglas and Harley-Davidson, aligned the cylinders with the frame, one cylinder facing towards the front wheel and the other towards the back wheel. The R32 also incorporated shaft drive. BMW has continued to use shaft drive on its motorcycles and did not produce a chain driven model until the introduction of the F650 in 1994.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1925, BMW introduced the R39, a 250?cc single-cylinder motorcycle. It was not successful and was discontinued in 1927.[4] In 1931, BMW introduced the single-cylinder shaft-driven R2,[5] which, as a 200?cc motorcycle, could be operated in Germany without a motorcycle licence at that time.[6][7] The R2 headed a series of single-cylinder BMW motorcycles, including the 400?cc R4 in 1932 and the 300?cc R3 in 1936.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BMW R12 and R17, both introduced in 1935, were the first production motorcycles with hydraulically damped telescopic forks.[5][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1937, Ernst Henne rode a supercharged 500?cc (31 cubic inches) overhead camshaft BMW 173.88?mph (279.83?km/h), setting a world record that stood for 14 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1938,[10]  R71 Air cooled, 746cc, Boxer, side valve was introduced with a licence going to Russia where they were built in Russia and Ukraine as the M72 and later in China as the Chang Jiang.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II the Wehrmacht needed as many vehicles as it could get of all types and many other German companies were asked to build motorcycles. The R75 performed particularly well in the harsh operating environment of the North African Campaign. Motorcycles of every style had performed acceptably well in Europe but, in the desert, the protruding cylinders of the flat-twin engine performed better than other configurations which overheated in the sun. Shaft drives also performed better than chain-drives which were damaged by desert grit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Army took note of these advantages and asked Harley-Davidson, Indian and Delco to produce a motorcycle similar to the side-valve BMW R71. Harley-Davidson copied the BMW engine and transmissionsimply converting metric measurements to inchesand produced the shaft-drive 750?cc (46 cubic inches) 1942 Harley-Davidson XA.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end of World War II found BMW in ruins. Its plant outside of Munich was destroyed by Allied bombing. The Eisenach facility, while badly damaged, was not totally destroyed, and tooling and machinery had been stored safely nearby. Contrary to popular accounts, the facility was not dismantled by the Soviets as reparations and sent to the Soviet Union to be reassembled in Irbit to make IMZ-Ural motorcycles; the IMZ plant was supplied to the Soviets by BMW under license before the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. After the war, most of BMW's engineers were taken to the US or the Soviet Union to continue the work they had done on jet engines with BMW during the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe terms of Germany's surrender forbade BMW from manufacturing motorcycles. In 1947, when BMW received permission to restart motorcycle production from US authorities in Bavaria,[12] BMW had to start from scratch. There were no plans, blueprints, or schematic drawings because they were all in Eisenach. Company engineers had to use surviving pre-war motorcycles to copy the bikes. The first post-war BMW motorcycle in Western Germany, a 250?cc R24, was produced in 1948. The R24 was reverse-engineered from the pre-war R23 with some improvements over the R23,[13] and was the only postwar West German BMW without rear suspension. In 1949, BMW produced 9,200 units and by 1950 production surpassed 17,000 units.\\r\\n\\r\\nBMW boxer twins manufactured from 1950 to 1956 included the 500?cc models R51/2 and 24?hp (18?kW) R51/3, the 600?cc models 26?hp (19?kW) R67, 28?hp (21?kW) R67/2, and R67/3, and the sporting 35?hp (26?kW) 600?cc model R68. All these models came with plunger rear suspensions, telescopic front forks, and chromed, exposed drive shafts. Except for the R68, all these twins came with \\"bell-bottom\\" front fenders and front stands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation was very different in Soviet-controlled Eastern Germany where BMW's sole motorcycle plant in Eisenach was producing R35 and a handful of R75 motorcycles for reparations. This resulted in one BMW motorcycle plant existing in Eisenach between 1945 and 1948 and two motorcycle companies existing between 1948 and 1952. One was a BMW in Munich in Western Germany (later the German Federal Republic) and the other in Soviet controlled Eisenach, Eastern Germany (later the German Democratic Republic), both using the BMW name. Eventually in 1952, after the Soviets ceded control of the plant to the East German Government, and following a trademark lawsuit, this plant was renamed EMW (Eisenacher Motoren Werke). Instead of BMW's blue-and-white roundel, EMW used a very similar red-and-white roundel as its logo.[14] No motorcycles made in East Germany after World War II were manufactured under the authority of BMW in Munich as there was no need for an occupying power to gain such authority. BMW R35 motorcycles were produced in Eisenach until 1952, when they became EMW.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the 1950s progressed, motorcycle sales plummeted. In 1957, three of BMW's major German competitors went out of business. In 1954, BMW produced 30,000 motorcycles. By 1957, that number was less than 5,500.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1955, BMW began introducing a new range of motorcycles with Earles forks and enclosed drive shafts. These were the 26?hp (19?kW) 500?cc R50, the 30?hp (22?kW) 600?cc R60, and the 35?hp (26?kW) sporting 600?cc R69.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 8, 1959, John Penton rode a BMW R69 from New York to Los Angeles in 53 hours and 11 minutes, slashing over 24 hours from the previous record of 77 hours and 53 minutes set by Earl Robinson on a 45?cubic inch (740?cc) Harley-Davidson.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough U.S. sales of BMW motorcycles were strong, BMW was in financial trouble. Through the combination of selling off its aircraft engine division and obtaining financing with the help of Herbert Quandt, BMW was able to survive. The turnaround was thanks in part to the increasing success of BMW's automotive division. Since the beginnings of its motorcycle manufacturing, BMW periodically introduced single-cylinder models. In 1967, BMW offered the last of these, the R27. Most of BMW's offerings were still designed to be used with sidecars. By this time sidecars were no longer a consideration of most riders; people were interested in sportier motorcycles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 26?hp (19?kW) R50/2, 30?hp (22?kW) R60/2, and 42?hp (31?kW) R69S marked the end of sidecar-capable BMWs. Of this era, some feel that the R69S remains the most desirable example of the dubbed \\"/2\\" (\\"slash-two\\") series because of significantly greater engine power than other models, among other features unique to this design.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 1968 and 1969 model years only, BMW exported into the United States three \\"US\\" models. These were the R50US, the R60US, and the R69US. On these motorcycles, there were no sidecar lugs attached to the frame and the front forks were telescopic forks, which were later used worldwide on the slash-5 series of 1970 through 1973. Earles-fork models were sold simultaneously in the United States as buyers had their choice of front suspensions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1970, BMW introduced an entirely revamped product line of 500?cc, 600?cc and 750?cc displacement models, the R50/5, R60/5 and R75/5 respectively,[16][17] which came with the \\"US\\" telescopic forks noted above.[citation needed] The engines were a complete redesign. The roller and ball-bearings in the bottom end had been replaced by shell-type journal bearings similar to those used in modern car engines.[16][17] The camshaft, which had been at the top of the engine, was placed under the crankshaft,[16] giving better ground clearance under the cylinders while retaining the low centre of gravity of the flat-twin layout.[citation needed] The new engine had an electric starter, although the traditional gearbox-mounted kick starter was retained.[16] The styling of the first models included chrome-plated side panels and a restyled tank.\\r\\nThe /5 series was given a longer rear swingarm, resulting in a longer wheelbase. This improved the handling and allowed a larger battery to be installed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe /5 models were the first to be built at BMW's new motorcycle factory in Spandau, West Berlin.[16][18]  Motorcycle production had been relocated from the Milbertshofen factory in Munich to this factory, which had been built on the site earlier occupied by a Siemens aircraft engine factory.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe /5 models were short-lived, however, being replaced by another new product line in 1974. In that year the 500?cc model was deleted from the lineup and an even bigger 900?cc model was introduced, as was a five-speed gearbox,[17][21] and improvements to the electrical system and frame geometry.[citation needed] These models were the R60/6, R75/6 and the R90/6. In 1973 a supersport model, the BMW R90S, was introduced.[17][21] In 1975, the kick starter was finally eliminated.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1977, the product line moved on to the \\"/7\\" models. The R80/7 was added to the line. The R90 (898?cc) models, \\"/6\\" and R90S models were replaced by updated versions with a new 1,000?cc; engine, the R100/7, the R100S and the new super sport model the R100RS with a full fairing. This sleek model, designed through wind-tunnel testing, produced 70?hp (51?kW) and had a top speed of 200?km/h (124?mph).[22] The R100RS had a shorter rear end ratio to overcome the higher wind resistance of the full fairing. Many period motorcycle tests in Germany (Das Motorrad) indicated it was actually slightly slower than the R100S with only 65?hp. In 1978, the R100RT was introduced into the lineup for the 1979 model year, as BMW's first \\"full-dress\\" tourer. The RS and RT fairings were very similar in appearance; however, the RS fairing was essentially a lightweight streamlining/protective shell and windscreen with no other functions, while the RT shell was heavier and had two \\"glove box\\" lockable compartments, ventilation louvres and an adjustable windscreen. The RT fairing was widely used for police motorcycles, with radio equipment in the fairing compartments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1979, the R60 was replaced with the 650?cc R65, an entry-level motorcycle with 48?hp (36?kW) that had its very own frame design. Due to its smaller size and better geometrics, front and rear 18-inch (460?mm) wheels and a very light flywheel, was an incredibly well-handling bike that could easily keep up and even run away from its larger brothers when in proper hands on sinuous roads. BMW added a variant in 1982: the R65LS, a \\"sportier\\" model with a one-fourth fairing, double front disc brakes, stiffer suspension and different carburettors that added 5?hp (4?kW).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 1983, BMW introduced a 987?cc, in-line four-cylinder, water-cooled fuel injected engine to the European market, the K100. The K series comes with a simplified and distinctive rear suspension, a single-sided swingarm. (In 1985 the traditionally powered boxer R80RT touring bike received this monolever rear suspension system and in 1987 the R100RT received it).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1985, BMW introduced a 750?cc three-cylinder version, this one smoothed with another first, a counterbalance shaft.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1986, BMW introduced an electrically adjustable windshield on the K100LT.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, BMW introduced ABS on its motorcycles. ABS became standard on all BMW K models. In 1993 ABS was first introduced on BMW's boxer line on the R1100RS. It has since become available as an option on the rest of BMW's motorcycle range.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1989, BMW introduced its version of a full-fairing sport bike, the K1. It was based upon the K100 engine, but now with four valves per cylinder. Output was near 100?hp (75?kW).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, BMW ceased production of airhead 2-valve engines and moved its boxer-engined line completely over to the 4-valve oilhead system first introduced in 1993.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this period, BMW introduced a number of motorcycles including:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe R1200C, produced from 1997 to 2004, was BMW Motorcycle's only entry into the Cruiser market. At the other end of the model lineup, the C1, produced from 2000 to 2002, was an enclosed scooter, the only scooter to be offered for sale by BMW.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 September 2004, BMW globally launched a radically redesigned K Series motorcycle, the K1200S, containing an all new in-line four-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine featuring 123?kW (165?hp).[23] The K1200S was primarily designed as a Super Sport motorcycle, albeit larger and heavier than the closest Japanese competitors. Shortly after the launch of the K1200S, problems were discovered with the new power plant leading to a recall until the beginning of 2005, when corrective changes were put in place.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the years after the launch of K1200S, BMW has also launched the K1200R naked roadster, and the K1200GT sport tourer, which started to appear in dealer showrooms in spring (MarchÿJune) 2006. All three new K-series motorcycles are based on the new in-line four-cylinder engine, with slightly varying degrees of power. In 2007, BMW added the K1200R Sport,[24] a semi-faired sport touring version of the K1200R.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2008, BMW launched three new 1,300?cc K-series models: the K1300R, K1300S and K1300GT.[25]\\r\\nThe K1300 models feature an increase in engine capacity of 136?cc, an increase in power to 175?hp (130?kW), newly styled fairings and a new exhaust system.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, BMW launched two six-cylinder, 1,600?cc, K1600GT and K1600GTL motorcycles, the former intended as a sport-tourer and the latter as a luxury touring model. The engine produces 160?hp (120?kW) and 129?lb?ft (175?N?m). They also offer adaptive headlights, traction control, ABS, tire pressure monitors, and a variety of sound systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, bikes with the opposed-twin-cylinder \\"boxer\\" engine were also revamped. The new boxer displacement is 1,170?cc (71 cubic inches). The engine is more powerful, and all of the motorcycles that use it are lighter than their predecessors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first motorcycle to be launched with this updated engine was the R1200GS dual-purpose motorcycle. The R1200RT tourer and R1200ST sports tourer followed shortly behind. BMW then introduced the 175?kg (386?lb), 78?kW (105?hp) HP2 Enduro, and the 223?kg (492?lb), 100?hp (75?kW) R1200GS Adventure, each specifically targeting the off-road and adventure-touring motorcycle segment, respectively. In 2007, the HP2 Enduro was joined by the road-biased HP2 Megamoto fitted with smaller alloy wheels and street tyres.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, BMW launched the R1200R and the R1200S, which is rated at 81?kW (109?hp) @ 7,500?rpm.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, BMW introduced a completely new R1200RT a partial water cooled engine with 125?hp (92?kW) at 7,750 rpm, 92?lb/ft (125 Nm) torque  at 6,500 rpm, and a wet clutch.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015 BMW introduced in the R1200RT keyless ignition and the \\"San Marino blue\\" color.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only change by BMW for the 2016 model year of the R1200RT was in available colors. Platin bronze metallic was added and the existing paint finish Callisto grey metallic matt is no longer available.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll 2017 liquid-cooled boxer models were fitted with a judder (definition: an instance of rapid and forceful shaking and vibration) damper on the transmission output shaft. New features also included a revised selector drum actuator, transmission shafts, and transmission shaft bearing. In addition to these technical changes, the 2017 R1200RT was available with optional ABS Pro, which senses lean angle and adjusts intervention accordingly (as part of the Ride Modes Pro option package). It was also available in two new colors: Carbon Black Metallic and Alpine White. Ebony Metallic and San Marino Blue Metallic were no longer available.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only changes for the 2018 model year were colors. The bronze color is gone and in its place is a metallic red color, \\"Mars red metallic,\\" with a dark slate metallic nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nBMW has also paid attention to the F Series in 2006. It lowered the price on the existing F650GS and F650GS Dakar, and eliminated the F650CS Scarver to make room in the lineup for the all-new F800 Series. The new motorcycles are powered by a parallel twin engine, built by Rotax. They feature either a belt drive system, similar to the belt drive found on the now defunct F650CS, or chain drive. Initially, BMW launched two models of the new F800 Series, the F800S sport bike and the F800ST sport tourer; these were followed by F650GS and F800GS dual-purpose motorcycles, both of which use the 798?cc engine despite the different names.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2006, following a nomenclature change, BMW announced the G series of offroad style motorcycles co-developed with Aprilia. These were equipped with an uprated single-cylinder water-cooled 652?cc fuel-injected engine producing 53?hp (40?kW), similar to the one fitted to the single-cylinder F650GS, and equipped with chain drive. Initially, there were three models in the series, all produced for BMW by Aprilia in their North Italian Scorz Plant, each focused on a slightly different market:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe G450X, a hard-enduro was introduced in 2007,[28] and discontinued in 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of 2010 BMW introduced the G650GS, an extensively facelifted and reworked version of the original F650GS.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst was the 175?kg (386?lb), 105?hp (78?kW) HP2 Enduro, followed by the road-biased HP2 Megamoto fitted with smaller alloy wheels and street tyres in 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2007, BMW announced its return to competitive road racing, entering a factory team with a \\"Sport Boxer\\" version of the R1200S to four 24-hour endurance races.[29] In 2008 they released this as the HP2 Sport.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe S1000RR is a sport bike launched to compete in the 2009 Superbike World Championship.[30]\\r\\nIt is powered by a 999?cc (61?cu?in) inline-four engine producing 193?bhp (144?kW).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, BMW acquired Husqvarna Motorcycles, including its production facilities and staff, from Italian manufacturer MV Agusta.[31][32] On 31 January 2013, BMW announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are four lines of BMW motorcycles:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series differ primarily in the class of engine that each uses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe F Series of single-cylinder BMW motorcycles was first launched in 1994, as the F650, and was built by Aprilia around a carbureted 650?cc four-stroke, four-valve, single piston engine, and chain drive. The mission for the F?650 was to provide an entry level BMW motorcycle. In 2000, the F650 was redesigned, now with fuel injection, and labeled the F650GS. An off-road focused F650 Dakar model was also launched that year. 2002 saw the addition of the F650CS 'Scarver' motorcycle to the line up. The Scarver was different from the F650GS variants in that it utilized a belt drive system opposed to a chain, had a much lower seat height, and was intended for on-road use. All F650 motorcycles produced from 2000 to 2007 used a 652?cc engine built in Austria by Rotax and were built by BMW in Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2006, the G series of offroad biased bikes motorcycles was launched using the same 652?cc engine fitted to the F650GS, although that engine is no longer manufactured by Rotax. The latest version of the 652cc single engine fitted in the new G650GS is now produced in Berlin after 2 years production in Loncin, China.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2007, the G450X sport enduro motorcycle was launched using a 450?cc single-cylinder engine. The G450X contained several technological improvements over the Japanese off-road racing motorcycles but the most unusual and significant was the use of a single pivot point for the drive sprocket and the swing arm. This unusual configuration allowed for a very tense drive chain with no slop and eliminated acceleration squat. The former benefit saves on chain and sprocket wear and the latter allows for a more consistent drive geometry and fully available rear suspension travel during heavy acceleration.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn mid-2006, The F Series added two new motorcycles to the lineup, the F800S sports bike and F800ST sports tourer, both which use a 798?cc parallel-twin engine built by Rotax. Both motorcycles also feature a belt drive system similar to what was in use on the F650CS. In 2007 the single-cylinder F650GS was replaced with the twin-cylinder F800GS and F650GS models. The latter uses a de-tuned version of the 798?cc engine fitted to the F800GS,[26] marking a departure from BMW's naming convention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe R series are built around a horizontally opposed flat-twin (boxer) engine. As the engine is mounted with a longitudinal crankshaft, the cylinder heads protrude well beyond the sides of the frame. Originally, R series bikes had air-cooled heads but are now produced only with partial oil cooling or water cooling. The type of internal combustion engine cooling used across the various R series engines leads to the use of the distinguishing names airhead and oilhead.\\r\\n\\r\\nAirheads are BMW motorcycles with an air-cooled flat-twin engine that were built from 1923 to 1995. Most airheads made from 1969 to 1995 used the BMW 247 engine, although 248/1 engines were used on mid-sized R-series motorcycles from 1978 to 1993. Even high-performance motorcycles, such as the R90S used the 247 engine;[34] and its successor, the R100RS, was fitted with an oil cooler.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn \\"Oilhead\\" is a name to describe BMW flat-twin motorcycle engines with partial oil-cooling, and to distinguish these engines from the earlier  air-cooled \\"Airhead\\" models.[35]  The Oilhead's finned cylinders have conventional air-cooling, but the four-valve cylinder-heads are oil-cooled. Unlike earlier BMW boxers which had a single camshaft in the crankcase (variously above or below the crankshaft), the Oilhead has a camshaft in each head.  (It is still technically an ohv engine rather than a true sohc unit, as the camshaft bears onto very short pushrods which operate valve rockers). In 2013, BMW introduced water-cooling to its boxer range.[36] The engine is still used in the BMW R nineT[37] line of motorcycles.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2013 (R1200GS), some BMW bikes have water-cooled-heads, but (like the oilheads), the new engines still use air-cooling for the cylinders. Approximately 34% of the cooling is attributed to the water-cooling which is concentrated in the highest heat generating areas such as around the exhaust-valve seats, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inlets are now on top of the cylinder (not behind as before) and the exhausts are below (no longer in front).\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the introduction of the R39 in 1925 and the discontinuation of the R27 in 1967, BMW made motorcycles with single-cylinder engines. These were similar in design to their larger flat-twin motorcycles, including the use of shaft drive, but the engine was mounted vertically within the frame.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K series BMWs have water-cooled engines of three (K75), or four (K100, K1100, K1200, K1300), or six (K1600) cylinders. Up until 2004, all K series engines, whether three or four cylinders were that of the original \\"flying brick\\" layout, so called due to the external appearance of the engine. The layout of these original K engines is unique within motorcycling in that the engine is mounted lying on its side, with the crank on the right side of the bike and the cylinder heads and valve gear on the left. This format had the advantage of allowing the drive system to have only one 90-degree translation within the final drive housing, potentially reducing drive train losses. All of the original format K engines were also mated to a dry automotive-type clutch. The uniform use of the traditional K engine ceased with the K1200 models in 2005, with a new 1200 series engine that was radically different from the flying brick in that it was a conventional transversely 55-degree slant-mounted four-cylinder engine coupled to a wet clutch and a unitary construction gearbox. It was at this time also that the K bike shaft drive moved from the right side to the left. Despite this new engine, the traditional flying brick K engine continued in service with the giant K1200LT luxury touring bike until 2009, at which point the flying brick bowed out along with the K1200LT. This was the event that presaged the development of the ultimate K engine in terms of size and complexity, the six-cylinder K1600 series fitted to the K1600GT and GTL models.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first K-series production bike was the K100, which was introduced in the 1983. In 1988, BMW introduced the K1 which had the Bosch Motronic fuel injection system.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1985 to 1996, the K75 740?cc three-cylinder engine was produced.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991, BMW increased the displacement of the K100 from 987?cc to 1,097?cc and the model designation became the K1100. The K1100LT was the first with the new engine displacement. In 1998 BMW increased the size again to 1,170?cc. This upgraded flat four engine appeared in the K1200RS. This engine continued in production for the K1200LT range, with a power boosting update in 2004, until the end of the LT production run.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe later K1200 engine is a 1,157?cc transverse inline-four, announced in 2003 and first seen in the 2005 K1200S. The new engine generates 123?kW (165?hp) and is tilted forwards 55?degrees. It is 43?cm (17?in) wide, giving the bikes a very low center of mass without reducing maximum lean angles.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2008, BMW announced the new K1300GT, K1300S and K1300R models, all of which feature a larger capacity 1293?cc engine producing up to 175?hp (130?kW). The new engine produces maximum power output 1,000?RPM lower than the previous engine, producing more torque due in part from a butterfly flap fitted in the exhaust.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, BMW launched the K1600 rangethe K1600GT and K1600GTLfeaturing a new 1,649?cc (100.6?cu?in) straight-six engine, which is mounted transversely across the chassis.[40] The engine is angled forward by 50.[41]\\r\\nThe engine was originally used on the Concept 6, a concept bike that was shown at the 2009 EICMA Milan Motor Show.[42]\\r\\nBMW claims that the engine at 560?mm (22?in) wide, just 67?mm (2.6?in) wider than the K1300 engine,[41] is the narrowest six-cylinder engine ever produced. Cylinder bore is 72.0?mm (2.83?in) and the distance between cylinder centres 77?mm (3.0?in).[41]\\r\\nThe camshaft is hollow, with cam lobes pressed on, which saves around 2?lb (0.91?kg).[43]\\r\\nThe engine has electronic throttle control and multiple drive modes which can be set according to road conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBMW uses a three-segment nomenclature for motorcycles. The first segment indicates the engine type, the second indicates the approximate engine displacement in cubic centimeters (with one notable exception: the F 650 GS, which has an engine displacement of 798cc[44]), while the third indicates the class of motorcycle (e.g., sport, sport touring, dual-sport, etc.). The three segments are separated by blanks.[45][46][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nA similar 3-segment nomenclature is used for BMW automobiles.  However, there is significantly less consistency across the range with respect to the second segment (engine displacement/100).\\r\\n\\r\\nEngine type:\\r\\n\\r\\nEngine displacement in cc:\\r\\n\\r\\nStyling suffix designations:\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, a bike may have the following modifiers in its name:\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples: K 1200 S, R 1200 RT, F 650 GS, R 1150 RSL, K 1200 LT, K 1200 LT-C, R 1200 RT-P, R 1200 RSA, S 1000 RR.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the introduction of the K 100 series and the R 1100 series motorcycles, the letter prefix was always the same, and the numbers were either based on displacement, as mentioned above, or were just model numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first BMW monolever suspensions appeared in 1980 on the then-new R80G/S range. It had a single universal joint immediately behind the engine/gear-box unit. This system was later included on updated versions of the K & R Series.\\r\\n\\r\\nParalever is a further advance in BMW's single-sided rear suspension technology (photo right). It decouples torque reaction as the suspension compresses and extends, avoiding the tendency to squat under braking and reducing tyre chatter on the road surface. It was introduced in 1988 R 80 GS and R 100 GS motorcycles. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, along with the introduction of the \\"hexhead\\", BMW inverted the Paralever and moved the torque arm from the bottom to the top of the drive shaft housing (photo right). This reduces underhang of components and tends to increase ground clearance in right lean.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"Paralever\\" is a portmanteau word from \\"Parallelogram\\" and \\"Lever\\".  The \\"lever is the swinging arm; and the \\"parallelogram\\" is the shape between the four elements of the rear suspension (rear drive, drive shaft, transmission, and lower or upper brace). Other motorcycle manufacturers have patented similar designs, including Arturo Magni for MV Agusta and Moto Guzzi's Compact Reactive Shaft Drive.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1935, BMW fitted the first mass-produced hydraulically damped telescopic fork to its R12 and R17 motorcycles. BMW still uses telescopic forks today on its F-series, G-series, HP, and S1000RR motorcycles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe R-series, which had used only the Telelever and the Duolever front suspensions for several years,[citation needed] has partly returned to telescopic forks in the 2015 model year with the introduction of the R 1200 R and R 1200 RS.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglishman Ernest Earles designed a unique triangulated fork that, unlike telescopic forks, resists the side-forces introduced by sidecars.[50][51][52]\\r\\nBMW fitted the Earles fork to all its models for 14 years from 1955. In the event, this was the year that use of sidecars peaked and quickly fell off in most European markets (e.g. the UK) but the Earles fork system was well liked by solo riders too. It causes the front end of the motorcycle to rise under braking  the reverse of the action of a telescopic fork. The mechanical strength of this design sometimes proved to be a weakness to the rest of the motorcycle, since it transfers impact pressure to the frame where damage is more difficult and expensive to correct.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeveloped by Saxon-Motodd in Britain in the early 1980s, the Telelever fork aims to improve handling stability during cornering and braking. The Telelever uses conventional telescopic forks, but the stanchions contain  only lubricating oil. Springing and damping functions are dealt with by a monoshock attached to a \\"Telelever\\" wishbone.  The  wishbone pivots on the front of the engine block, and the wishbone's forward end is attached via a rose-joint to a brace connecting the fork sliders. As there is no lower triple clamp, the fork sliders are longer and lighter than on a conventional telescopic fork, and the greater slider/tube overlap reduces both torsional flex and unsprung weight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Telelever system's main benefit is that it separates the steering function from the braking and suspension functions  Braking forces are taken back via the wishbone, thereby eliminating brake dive.  During braking, the trail and castor angle (rake) increases instead of decreasing as with traditional telescopic forks.Some riders used to conventional forks reported that the Telelever can initially lack \\"feel\\", and that the absence of dive is initially disconcerting;[53] but the R1100S BoxerCup Replika (a model with its own race series) shows that the Telelever fork provides responsive and predictable handling.[35][54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"Telelever\\" is a portmanteau word from \\"Telescopic fork\\" and \\"Lever\\"; the \\"lever\\" being the wishbone arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, BMW announced the K1200S, incorporating a new front suspension based upon a design by Norman Hossack.[55] BMW recognised this fact[citation needed] but paid Hossack no royalties.[56] BMW named its new front suspension the Duolever. As of 2018, the Duolever has been used on all K1300 and K1600 models.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official BMW Motorrad explanation of the duolever includes this:[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe advantage of this front wheel suspension on the motorcycle market at present is its torsional rigidity. The BMW Motorrad Duolever front wheel suspension is not influenced by negative forces in the same manner as a conventional telefork whose fixed and take-off tubes twist laterally as well as longitudinally during jounce/rebound and steering. Its two trailing links absorb the forces resulting from the jounce/rebound and keep the wheel carrier stable. Thus, any torsioning is excluded and the front wheel suspension is very precise. The steering commands of the rider are converted directly and the feedback from the front wheel is transparent in all driving conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA kinematical anti-dive effect is additionally achieved, just as for the Telelever, due to the arrangement of the trailing link bearings. While a conventional telefork during strong braking manoeuvres jounces heavily or locks, the Duolever still has sufficient spring travel remaining in this situation and therefore the rider can still brake into the corner extremely late yet directionally stable.","input":"When did bmw motorrad make their ever motorcycle the r 32?"},{"output":"Political freedom","context":"Political freedom (also known as a political autonomy or political agency) is a central concept in history and political thought and one of the most important features of democratic societies.[1] Political freedom was described as freedom from oppression[2] or coercion,[3] the absence of disabling conditions for an individual and the fulfillment of enabling conditions,[4] or the absence of life conditions of compulsion, e.g. economic compulsion, in a society.[5] Although political freedom is often interpreted negatively as the freedom from unreasonable external constraints on action,[6] it can also refer to the positive exercise of rights, capacities and possibilities for action, and the exercise of social or group rights.[7] The concept can also include freedom from \\"internal\\" constraints on political action or speech (e.g. social conformity, consistency, or \\"inauthentic\\" behaviour).[8] The concept of political freedom is closely connected with the concepts of civil liberties and human rights, which in democratic societies are usually afforded legal protection from the state.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious groups along the political spectrum naturally differ on what they believe constitutes \\"true\\" political freedom.\\r\\nLeft-wing political philosophy generally couples the notion of freedom with that of positive liberty, or the enabling of a group or individual to determine their own life or realize their own potential. Freedom, in this sense, may include freedom from poverty, starvation, treatable disease, and oppression, as well as freedom from force and coercion, from whomever they may issue.\\r\\nFriedrich Hayek, a classical liberal, criticized this as a misconception of freedom:\\r\\n[T]he use of \\"liberty\\" to describe the physical \\"ability to do what I want\\", the power to satisfy our wishes, or the extent of the choice of alternatives open to us?... has been deliberately fostered as part of the socialist argument?... the notion of collective power over circumstances has been substituted for that of individual liberty.[9]\\r\\nAnarcho-socialists see negative and positive liberty as complementary concepts of freedom. Such a view of rights may require utilitarian trade-offs, such as sacrificing the right to the product of one's labor or freedom of association for less racial discrimination or more subsidies for housing. Social anarchists describe the negative liberty-centric view endorsed by capitalism as \\"selfish freedom\\".[10]\\r\\nAnarcho-capitalists see negative rights as a consistent system. Ayn Rand described it as \\"a moral principle defining and sanctioning a mans freedom of action in a social context. To such libertarians, positive liberty is contradictory, since so-called rights must be traded off against each other, debasing legitimate rights which, by definition, trump other moral considerations. Any alleged \\"right\\" which calls for an end result (e.g. housing, education, medical services) produced by people is, in effect, a purported \\"right\\" to enslave others.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome notable philosophers, such as Alasdair MacIntyre, have theorized freedom in terms of our social interdependence with other people.[11]\\r\\nAmerican Economist Milton Friedman in his book Capitalism and Freedom argues that there are two types of freedom: political freedom and Economic freedom. Friedman asserted that without economic freedom, there cannot be political freedom. This idea was contested by Robin Hahnel in his article \\"Why the Market Subverts Democracy.\\" Robin Hahnel points out a set of issues with Friedmans understanding of economic freedom: that there will in fact be infringements on the freedom of others whenever anyone exercises their own economic freedom, and that such infringements can only be avoided if there is a precisely defined property rights systemwhich Friedman fails to provide or specify directly. [12] [13]\\r\\nAccording to political philosopher Nikolas Kompridis, the pursuit of freedom in the modern era can be broadly divided into two motivating ideals: freedom as autonomy or independence; and freedom as the ability to cooperatively initiate a new beginning.[14]\\r\\nPolitical freedom has also been theorized in its opposition to (and a condition of) \\"power relations\\", or the power of \\"action upon actions,\\" by Michel Foucault.[15] It has also been closely identified with certain kinds of artistic and cultural practice by Cornelius Castoriadis, Antonio Gramsci, Herbert Marcuse, Jacques Ranciere, and Theodor Adorno.\\r\\nEnvironmentalists often argue that political freedoms should include some constraint on use of ecosystems. They maintain there is no such thing, for instance, as \\"freedom to pollute\\" or \\"freedom to deforest\\" given that such activities create negative externalities. The popularity of SUVs, golf, and urban sprawl has been used as evidence that some ideas of freedom and ecological conservation can clash. This leads at times to serious confrontations and clashes of values reflected in advertising campaigns, e.g. that of PETA regarding fur.\\r\\nJohn Dalberg-Acton stated that \\"The most certain test by which we judge whether a country is really free is the amount of security enjoyed by minorities.\\"[16]\\r\\nGerald MacCallum spoke of a compromise between positive and negative freedoms. An agent must have full autonomy over themselves. It is triadic in relation to each other, because it is about three things: the agent, the constraints they need to be free from, and the goal they're aspiring to.[17]\\r\\nHannah Arendt traces freedom's conceptual origins to ancient Greek [1] politics. According to her study, the concept of freedom was historically inseparable from political action. Politics could only be practiced by those who had freed themselves from the necessities of life, so that they could participate in the realm of political affairs. According to Arendt, the concept of freedom became associated with the Christian notion of freedom of the will, or inner freedom, around the 5th century C.E. and since then, freedom as a form of political action has been neglected, even though, as she says, freedom is \\"the raison d'tre of politics.\\"[18]\\r\\nArendt says that political freedom is historically opposed to sovereignty or will-power, since in ancient Greece and Rome, the concept of freedom was inseparable from performance, and did not arise as a conflict between the \\"will\\" and the \\"self.\\" Similarly, the idea of freedom as freedom from politics is a notion that developed in modern times. This is opposed to the idea of freedom as the capacity to \\"begin anew,\\" which Arendt sees as a corollary to the innate human condition of natality, or our nature as \\"new beginnings and hence beginners.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Arendt's view, political action is an interruption of automatic process, either natural or historical. The freedom to begin anew is thus an extension of \\"the freedom to call something into being which did not exist before, which was not given, not even as an object of cognition or imagination, and which therefore, strictly speaking, could not be known.\\"[19]","input":"What freedoms are usually enjoyed in a democratic country?"},{"output":"16,697","context":"The military history of New Zealand during World War I began in August 1914 when Great Britain declared war on Germany at the start of the First World War, the New Zealand government followed without hesitation, despite its geographic isolation and small population. It was believed at the time that any declaration of war by the United Kingdom automatically included New Zealand.\\r\\nThe total number of New Zealand troops and nurses to serve overseas in 1914ÿ18, excluding those in British and other Dominion forces, was 100,444, from a population of just over a million. Forty-two percent of men of military age served in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, fighting in the Gallipoli Campaign and on the Western Front. 16,697 New Zealanders were killed and 41,317 were wounded during the war ÿ a 58 percent casualty rate.[1] Approximately a further thousand men died within five years of the war's end, as a result of injuries sustained, and 507 died while training in New Zealand between 1914 and 1918.\\r\\nThe First World War saw Mori soldiers serve for the first time in a major conflict with the New Zealand Army (although a number had fought in the Second Boer War when New Zealand recruiters chose to ignore British military policy of the time of disallowing 'native' soldiers). A contingent took part in the Gallipoli Campaign, and later served with distinction on the Western Front as part of the New Zealand (Mori) Pioneer Battalion. 2688 Mori and 346 Pacific islanders, including 150 Niueans,[2] served with New Zealand forces in total.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the outbreak of the war, the New Zealand Government authorised the raising of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) for service overseas. Mobilisation for the NZEF had already begun, with preparations discreetly beginning a few days prior to the declaration of war.[3]\\r\\nThe day after the declaration of war, the British Government requested New Zealand seize the wireless station on the island of Upolu, part of Imperial Germany's protectorate of German Samoa,[4] deeming it an \\"a great and urgent Imperial service.\\"[5] A mixed force of 1,413 men, known as the Samoan Expeditionary Force (SEF) under the command of Colonel Robert Logan, plus six nursing sisters, sailed from New Zealand on 15 August 1914.[6] After stopping in Fiji to collect some guides and interpreters as well as additional escort ships,[7] the New Zealanders arrived at Apia on 29 August 1914.[8]\\r\\nGermany refused to officially surrender the islands but with only a minimal military presence, there was little prospect for meaningful resistance. The Governor of German Samoa, Dr. Erich Schultz, sent a message from the island's radio station that no resistance would be offered. The New Zealanders proceeded to land at Apia and seized key buildings and facilities without interference. The only opposition encountered was at the radio station, where the equipment was sabotaged by the German operators. Logan officially declared German Samoa to be under the control of New Zealand the following day, 30 August 1914, in a ceremony at the courthouse in Apia.[9] When Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Maximilian von Spee, commander of Germany's East Asia Squadron, learned of the occupation, he hastened to Samoa with the armoured cruisers SMS Scharnhorst and SMS Gneisenau. Arriving at Apia on 14 September 1914, the approach of the German ships was observed and the New Zealanders prepared to defend themselves.[10] However, von Spee and his ships soon departed for Tahiti, with neither side opening fire.[11] The SEF remained in Samoa until March 1915 at which time it began returning to New Zealand, a process completed by the following month.[12]\\r\\nAs early as October 1914 the main body of the NZEF sailed from Wellington. Diverted from their original destination in Europe, the New Zealanders were landed in Egypt, where they helped repulse a Turkish attack on the Suez Canal in February 1915.\\r\\nThe New Zealand volunteer soldiers remained encamped in Egypt, alongside their Australian comrades, undergoing training prior to being sent to France.\\r\\nOn 25 April 1915, as part of the New Zealand and Australian Division, the New Zealanders landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula, and fought in the Gallipoli Campaign under the command of British General Alexander Godley. The combined British Empire and French operation was mounted in order to eventually capture the Ottoman capital of Constantinople (now Istanbul). Because of a navigational error, the Anzacs came ashore about a mile north of the intended landing point in their initial landing. Instead of facing the expected beach and gentle slope they found themselves at the bottom of steep cliffs, offering the few Turkish defenders an ideal defensive position. Establishing a foothold, the Anzacs found an advance to be impossible. On 30 April 1915, when the first news of the landing reached New Zealand a half-day holiday was declared and impromptu services were held ÿ the origin of the commemorative public holiday, ANZAC Day, recognised by New Zealand and Australia and held each year on 25 April.[13][14]\\r\\nDespite the blunder at ANZAC Cove, the New Zealand soldiers fought valiantly throughout the campaign but it was a failed venture overall. The estimated casualties on both sides were 392,000 of whom 131,000 were killed, with New Zealand casualties of 2,721 dead and 4,852 wounded. The Allied forces eventually evacuated in December 1915 and early January 1916. The significance of the Gallipoli Campaign was strongly felt in New Zealand (and Australia) where it was the first great conflict experienced by the fledgling nation. Before Gallipoli the citizens of New Zealand were confident of the superiority of the British Empire and were proud and eager to offer their service. The campaign in Gallipoli shook that confidence.\\r\\nThe New Zealand Rifle Brigade (less two battalions) had meanwhile reached Egypt in November 1915 and was sent into the Egyptian desert to help defeat a Senussi invasion from Libya. The 1st Battalion fought two brisk but inexpensive actions south-west of Matruh as part of a mixed force (including British, Australians, and Indians), one on Christmas Day, the other on 23 January 1916. Both were successful and broke the back of the invasion. In mid-February the 1st Battalion rejoined the rest of the brigade at Moascar in the Suez Canal area.\\r\\nIn Egypt, the New Zealand Expeditionary Force was reorganised into the New Zealand Mounted Brigade and the New Zealand Division (infantry). Reinforcements from New Zealand replaced the Australian component of the division, which embarked for France in April 1916. The New Zealand Mounted Brigade, 147 officers and 2,897 other ranks, remained in Egypt as part of the Anzac Mounted Division. In April 1916, it was deployed to the Sinai Peninsula where it took part in the ultimately successful Sinai and Palestine Campaign against the Turks. New Zealanders fought in most of the battles leading up to the fall of Jerusalem and the defeat of the Ottoman Army, and were praised for their fighting alongside their Australian and British comrades. In 1919, Field Marshal Sir Edmund Allenby, said this of the New Zealand soldiers in the Sinai campaign;\\r\\nA total of 17,723 New Zealanders served in this campaign and New Zealand casualties were 640 killed in action and 1,146 wounded.\\r\\nWhile in England ÿ either freshly arrived from New Zealand or having already served at Gallipoli and awaiting transfer to the Western Front ÿ New Zealand troops were stationed at Sling Camp, an annexe of Bulford Camp in Wiltshire. The troops who were still stationed at the camp at the end of the war created the giant chalk kiwi known as the Bulford Kiwi whilst waiting to be repatriated.\\r\\nIn France, the New Zealand Division settled in on the stalemated Western Front and their first major trial was during the Battle of the Somme. It took part in the Fourth Army's attack on 15 September, under the command of the British XV Corps. By the time they were relieved on 4 October, the New Zealanders had advanced three kilometres and captured eight kilometres of enemy front line. 7,048 had become casualties, of whom 1,560 were killed.\\r\\nIn June 1917, the New Zealand Division further distinguished itself in the storming of Messines Ridge and the capture of the village of Messines. On 7 June, after the detonation of nearly 500 tons of explosives in huge mines on both sides of the New Zealand sector, the 2nd and 3rd Brigades scrambled over the top, in and out of shell holes, and up the battered slopes. Carrying the German front line and supports, they were soon into the ruined village. The 1st Brigade passed through, helped on the left by a solitary tank, to the final objective. With prisoners and booty including many guns it was a striking success at no great cost; but the German artillery revived and by the time the division was relieved on 9 and 10 June it had lost 3,700 men, evenly distributed between the three brigades.\\r\\nThe New Zealand Division's next major engagement was at Passchendaele in October 1917. The division had been training since the end of August to overcome the numerous concrete pillboxes in this sector. The first objective was the Gravenstafel Spur, attacked before dawn on 4 October, as part of a major advance. The 1st and 4th Brigades forestalled a heavy German counter-attack, and the supporting artillery barrage inflicted frightful slaughter on the waiting Germans. Crossing this scene of carnage, the 1st and 4th Brigades gained their objectives after a hard fight, inflicting exceptionally heavy loss on the enemy and capturing much equipment. For such a resounding success the 1,700 New Zealand casualties, though a sad loss, did not in current terms seem excessive. But heavy rain turned the countryside into a bog and tragedy lay ahead.\\r\\nA British attack on the ninth on Bellevue Spur and part of the main Passchendaele ridge gained a little ground at prohibitive cost. Heavy swathes of barbed wire still girdled the hillside, however, and belated and meagre heavy artillery made no impression on them, nor on the many pillboxes beyond. New Zealand gunners slaved to breaking point to get only a few guns and howitzers forward, but stable platforms and accurate fire were unattainable.\\r\\nThe division returned to the attack on 12 October, with the 2nd and 3rd Brigades. There was little to encourage the men as they waited overnight in a morass under steady rain. Shelled in their assembly area, some were shelled again by their own guns when the thin barrage opened at 5.25 a.m., and then they led off into a deluge of small-arms fire, speckled with geyser-like eruptions as shells exploded in the mud. Worst of all was the wire, covered with deadly fire, its few gaps deliberate deathtraps. Some men tried to crawl under it, some threw themselves at it, two got right through and were killed in the act of hurling grenades at the loopholes of the nearest pillbox. The left gained 500 yards of slippery slope, the centre 200 heartbreaking yards, the right nothing until the 80-odd occupants of two blockhouses and a trench used up all their ammunition. Then they were captured, blockhouses and all, by two brave and skillful men, sole survivors of two Otago platoons.\\r\\nFor these small gains, the New Zealanders suffered 640 dead and 2,100 wounded. For the first time the division had failed in a major operation. After this failure, the division continued to hold a sector of the line. The steady drain of men while units only held the line was less spectacular, though it made up half the losses of the division. Here, before withdrawing from the front, 400 more men were lost in the 4th Brigade alone.\\r\\nThe division now had four brigades, making it one of the largest on the Western Front, and was stationed in the Polygon Wood area. An attack by the 2nd Brigade on 3 December 1917 gained useful ground but failed to capture Polderhoek Chateau. When the division was relieved, on 24 February 1918, three \\"quiet\\" months had cost 3,000 men, more than 1,873 of them killed.\\r\\nAs the Germans launched their great Spring Offensive of 1918, the New Zealand Division was rushed to stem a breakthrough in the First Battle of the Somme, which threatened Amiens. The gap was between the British IV and V Corps in the Ancre Valley. After confused fighting, the New Zealanders eventually gained the upper hand and soon were counter-attacking advantageous land, stabilising the British line. Later in the year, they excelled in the open country fighting that was brought about by the Allied counter-offensive.\\r\\nIn their last action of the war, the division captured the ancient fortress (Vauban-designed) town of Le Quesnoy in a daring assault on 4 November 1918. The day proved to be the division's most successful of their whole time on the Western Front as they pushed east and advanced ten kilometres, capturing 2,000 German soldiers and 60 field guns. The town occupied a strategic position in north-eastern France and had been held by the Germans since 1914. Although with no specific orders indicating that the town need to be captured with any haste, the New Zealand soldiers were determined to and just before midday the first New Zealand troops reached the outer walls and scaled them with ladders. Propping the ladders against the precariously narrow inner walls, sections of one New Zealand battalion ascended the walls and engaged in hand-to-hand fighting with fleeing German defenders. The few thousand strong German garrison surrendered soon after New Zealand soldiers entered the town itself.\\r\\nThe infantry were relieved on the eastern side of the forest at midnight on 5ÿ6 November and the war ended five days later. The division left the Third Army on 28 November, and marched through Belgium, to entrain at the German frontier for Cologne and take up billets in neighbouring towns as part of the army of occupation. Demobilisation soon started and at Mlheim near Cologne the division was finally disbanded on 25 March 1919.\\r\\nThe cost of maintaining the division for two and a half years on the Western Front was appalling. Altogether some 13,250 New Zealanders died of wounds or sickness as a direct result of this campaign, including 50 as prisoners of war and more than 700 at home. Another 35,000 were wounded, and 414 prisoners of war were ultimately repatriated. The total casualties therefrom approached 50,000, well over half the number of those who served in France or Belgium.\\r\\nNew Zealand also contributed to the war at sea. The New Zealand Naval Forces was a Division of the Royal Navy. Immediately after the start of the war, the cruiser HMS Philomel, loaned to New Zealand as a training ship, was augmented with 70 New Zealand reservists and sailed with two Royal Navy cruisers to escort the New Zealand troops sent to occupy German Samoa. Later in 1914 these three ships also escorted the New Zealand Expeditionary Force to Egypt.\\r\\nFrom January 1915, Philomel patrolled the Gulf of Alexandretta in the Eastern Mediterranean, supporting several landings and sustaining three fatal casualties, one being the first New Zealander killed in action in the war. She also took part in the defence of the Suez Canal, operations in the Gulf of Aden and patrols in the Persian Gulf. Although refitting from time to time at Malta or Bombay kept her seaworthy, age eventually forced her out of the war and in March 1917 she returned to Wellington for a major overhaul.\\r\\nNew Zealand was not subject to any significant direct military threat during the war. Although Germany had plans for naval raids on Australia and New Zealand, the threat from her Asiatic Squadron did not eventuate, as that force moved across the Pacific before being destroyed at the Battle of the Falkland Islands.\\r\\nIn June 1917, a German surface raider, the SMS Wolf entered New Zealand waters. She laid two small minefields in New Zealand waters and sank two merchant ships. One (the Port Kembla) off Farewell Spit, and another (the Wairuna) off the Kermadec Islands. Two fishing trawlers, the Nora Niven and Simplon, were fitted as minesweepers and took up sweeping duties in these areas. Another brief flurry of activity occurred when Felix von Luckner, imprisoned on Motuihe Island after being captured in the Society Islands, escaped and commandeered a small vessel before being recaptured in the Kermadec Islands.\\r\\nNew Zealand also contributed a wireless troop to the Mesopotamian Campaign. The Wireless Troop was formed in New Zealand and arrived at Basra in April 1916. In Mesopotamia the New Zealand troop was amalgamated with the 1st Australian Wireless Signal Squadron, forming \\"C\\" Wireless Troop of the Anzac Squadron. The troop was much affected by disease, but once in operation was attached to the Cavalry Division in the assault on Baghdad. The Wireless Troop was among the first batch of troops to enter the city on 11 March 1917. The Wireless Troop joined further operations in Mesopotamia and was then moved to Persia. In June 1917, the troop was redirected to France, where it was absorbed into the New Zealand Divisional Signal Company.\\r\\nNew Zealand had no air force of her own during the First World War but several hundred New Zealanders served with the Royal Flying Corps, the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Air Force.\\r\\nWhen the supply of volunteers for reinforcements for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force slowed, conscription was introduced, with the first ballot held in Wellington on 16 November 1916.[15] Men between 20 and 45 could be conscripted, subject to a medical check and limited rights of objection on conscience, family or business grounds.\\r\\nConscription was extended to Mori for the \\"Native Contingent\\" in late 1917, with the first \\"Mori ballot\\" for the Waikato district held in May 1918.[16] There wes resistance in the Waikato (led by Princess Te Puea) to conscription. By the end of the war 552 Mori had been balloted, but no Mori conscripts had been sent overseas. And 2,227 Mori served in the war; about 4.5% of the Mori population or under half of the total contribution per head of the total New Zealand population. [17]\\r\\nNew Zealand Hospitals were set up at Port Said and Suez in 1915,[18] Walton-on-Thames in 1915,[19] and Amiens, Brockenhurst, Codford and Hornchurch in 1916. Hospital ships Maheno[18] and Marama[20][21] were converted in 1915.[18] Walton closed in 1919.[22]\\r\\nShortages of shipping, influenza[23] and strikes[24] were among causes[25] for delays in repatriating troops after the war. The frustration of the delay resulted in riots at Sling Camp in March 1919[24] and at Ismailia in July. Allied governments paid compensation for looted Egyptian shops.[23] New Zealand's share of the cost was S2,529[26] (2016 equivalent $250,000).[27]\\r\\nNew Zealand war deaths are buried or commemorated in CWGC (Commonwealth War Graves Commission) cemeteries with other allied soldiers. Gallipoli dead are buried in 24 CWGC cemeteries in Turkey, and in CWGC cemeteries in Egypt, Gibraltar, Greece and Malta. There are memorials to the New Zealand missing on Chunuk Bair and at three CWGC cemeteries: Hill 60 Cemetery, Lone Pine Cemetery and Twelve Tree Copse Cemetery.[28]\\r\\nOn the Western Front missing New Zealand soldiers are commemorated in cemeteries near where they were lost rather than at the large memorials of Menin Gate and the Thiepval Memorial on the Somme. The New Zealand monuments to the missing are at Messines in Belgium and Armentierses, Longueval (Caterpillar Valley Cemetery), Grevillers, and Marfaux in France. There are four national battlefield memorials at Passchendaele, Messines, the Somme and Le Quesnoy.[29]","input":"How many new zealand soldiers died in ww1?"},{"output":"Gautama Buddha","context":"Gautama Buddha (c. 563 BCE/480 BCE ÿ c. 483 BCE/400 BCE), also known as Siddhrtha Gautama [sid????rt??? g?ut??m?], Shakyamuni Buddha [??kj?mun?i bud????],[4] or simply the Buddha, after the title of Buddha, was an ascetic (?rama?a) and sage,[4] on whose teachings Buddhism was founded.[5] He is believed to have lived and taught mostly in the eastern part of ancient India sometime between the sixth and fourth centuries BCE.[6][note 3]\\r\\nGautama taught a Middle Way between sensual indulgence and the severe asceticism found in the ?rama?a movement[7] common in his region. He later taught throughout other regions of eastern India such as Magadha and Kosala.[6][8]\\r\\nGautama is the primary figure in Buddhism. He is recognized by Buddhists as an enlightened teacher who attained full Buddhahood, and shared his insights to help sentient beings end rebirth and suffering. Accounts of his life, discourses, and monastic rules are believed by Buddhists to have been summarized after his death and memorized by his followers. Various collections of teachings attributed to him were passed down by oral tradition and first committed to writing about 400 years later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScholars are hesitant to make unqualified claims about the historical facts of the Buddha's life. Most accept that he lived, taught, and founded a monastic order during the Mahajanapada era during the reign of Bimbisara (c.?558?ÿ c.?491 BCE, or c. 400 BCE),[9][10][11] the ruler of the Magadha empire, and died during the early years of the reign of Ajatasatru, who was the successor of Bimbisara, thus making him a younger contemporary of Mahavira, the Jain tirthankara.[12][13] Apart from the Vedic Brahmins, the Buddha's lifetime coincided with the flourishing of influential ?rama?a schools of thought like jؐvika, Crvka, Jainism, and Aj?ana.[14] Brahmajala Sutta records sixty-two such schools of thought. It was also the age of influential thinkers like Mahavira (referred to as 'Nigantha Nataputta' in Pali Canon),[15] Pra?a Kassapa, Makkhali Gosla, Ajita Kesakambalؐ, Pakudha Kaccyana, and Sa?jaya Bela??haputta, as recorded in Sama??aphala Sutta, whose viewpoints the Buddha most certainly must have been acquainted with.[16][17][note 4] Indeed, Sariputta and Moggallna, two of the foremost disciples of the Buddha, were formerly the foremost disciples of Sa?jaya Bela??haputta, the skeptic;[19] and the Pali canon frequently depicts Buddha engaging in debate with the adherents of rival schools of thought. There is also philological evidence to suggest that the two masters, Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta, were indeed historical figures and they most probably taught Buddha two different forms of meditative techniques.[20] Thus, Buddha was just one of the many ?rama?a philosophers of that time.[21] In an era where holiness of person was judged by their level of asceticism,[22] Buddha was a reformist within the ?rama?a movement, rather than a reactionary against Vedic Brahminism.[23] While the general sequence of \\"birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death\\" is widely accepted,[24][page?needed] there is less consensus on the veracity of many details contained in traditional biographies.[25][26]\\r\\nThe times of Gautama's birth and death are uncertain. Most historians in the early 20th century dated his lifetime as circa 563 BCE to 483 BCE.[1][27] More recently his death is dated later, between 411 and 400 BCE, while at a symposium on this question held in 1988,[28][29][30] the majority of those who presented definite opinions gave dates within 20 years either side of 400 BCE for the Buddha's death.[1][31][note 3] These alternative chronologies, however, have not been accepted by all historians.[35][36][note 5]\\r\\nThe evidence of the early texts suggests that Siddhrtha Gautama was born into the Shakya clan, a community that was on the periphery, both geographically and culturally, of the eastern Indian subcontinent in the 5th century BCE.[41] It was either a small republic, or an oligarchy, and his father was an elected chieftain, or oligarch.[41] According to the Buddhist tradition, Gautama was born in Lumbini, now in modern-day Nepal, and raised in the Shakya capital of Kapilvastu, which may have been either in what is present day Tilaurakot, Nepal or Piprahwa, India.[note 1] He obtained his enlightenment in Bodh Gaya, gave his first sermon in Sarnath, and died in Kushinagar.\\r\\nNo written records about Gautama were found from his lifetime or some centuries thereafter. One Edict of Asoka, who reigned from circa 269 BCE to 232 BCE, commemorates the Emperor's pilgrimage to the Buddha's birthplace in Lumbini. Another one of his edicts mentions the titles of several Dhamma texts, establishing the existence of a written Buddhist tradition at least by the time of the Maurya era. These texts may be the precursor of the Pli Canon.[58][59] [note 7] The oldest surviving Buddhist manuscripts are the Gandhran Buddhist texts, reported to have been found in or around Ha??a near Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan and now preserved in the British Library. They are written in the Gndhrؐ language using the Kharosthi script on twenty-seven birch bark manuscripts and date from the first century BCE to the third century CE.[60]\\r\\nOn the basis of philological evidence, Indologist and Pali expert Oskar von Hinber says that some of the Pali suttas have retained very archaic place-names, syntax, and historical data from close to the Buddha's lifetime, including the Mahparinibb?a Sutta which contains a detailed account of the Buddha's final days. Hinber proposes a composition date of no later than 350ÿ320 BCE for this text, which would allow for a \\"true historical memory\\" of the events approximately 60 years prior if the Short Chronology for the Buddha's lifetime is accepted (but also reminds that such a text was originally intended more as hagiography than as an exact historical record of events).[61][62]\\r\\nThe sources for the life of Siddhrtha Gautama are a variety of different, and sometimes conflicting, traditional biographies. These include the Buddhacarita, Lalitavistara Stra, Mahvastu, and the Nidnakath.[63] Of these, the Buddhacarita[64][65][66] is the earliest full biography, an epic poem written by the poet A?vagho?a in the first century CE.[67] The Lalitavistara Stra is the next oldest biography, a Mahyna/Sarvstivda biography dating to the 3rd century CE.[68] The Mahvastu from the Mahs?ghika Lokottaravda tradition is another major biography, composed incrementally until perhaps the 4th century CE.[68] The Dharmaguptaka biography of the Buddha is the most exhaustive, and is entitled the Abhini?krama?a Stra,[69] and various Chinese translations of this date between the 3rd and 6th century CE. The Nidnakath is from the Theravada tradition in Sri Lanka and was composed in the 5th century by Buddhagho?a.[70]\\r\\nFrom canonical sources come the Jataka tales, the Mahapadana Sutta (DN 14), and the Achariyabhuta Sutta (MN 123), which include selective accounts that may be older, but are not full biographies. The Jtakas retell previous lives of Gautama as a bodhisattva, and the first collection of these can be dated among the earliest Buddhist texts.[71] The Mahpadna Sutta and Achariyabhuta Sutta both recount miraculous events surrounding Gautama's birth, such as the bodhisattva's descent from the Tu?ita Heaven into his mother's womb.\\r\\nIn the earliest Buddhist texts, the nikyas and gamas, the Buddha is not depicted as possessing omniscience (sabba??u)[72] nor is he depicted as being an eternal transcendent (lokottara) being. According to Bhikkhu Analayo, ideas of the Buddha's omniscience (along with an increasing tendency to deify him and his biography) are found only later, in the Mahayana sutras and later Pali commentaries or texts such as the Mahvastu.[72] In the Sandaka Sutta, the Buddha's disciple Ananda outlines an argument against the claims of teachers who say they are all knowing [73] while in the Tevijjavacchagotta Sutta the Buddha himself states that he has never made a claim to being omniscient, instead he claimed to have the \\"higher knowledges\\" (abhij?).[74] The earliest biographical material from the Pali Nikayas focuses on the Buddha's life as a ?rama?a, his search for enlightenment under various teachers such as Alara Kalama and his forty-five-year career as a teacher.[75]\\r\\nTraditional biographies of Gautama generally include numerous miracles, omens, and supernatural events. The character of the Buddha in these traditional biographies is often that of a fully transcendent (Skt. lokottara) and perfected being who is unencumbered by the mundane world. In the Mahvastu, over the course of many lives, Gautama is said to have developed supramundane abilities including: a painless birth conceived without intercourse; no need for sleep, food, medicine, or bathing, although engaging in such \\"in conformity with the world\\"; omniscience, and the ability to \\"suppress karma\\".[76] Nevertheless, some of the more ordinary details of his life have been gathered from these traditional sources. In modern times there has been an attempt to form a secular understanding of Siddhrtha Gautama's life by omitting the traditional supernatural elements of his early biographies.\\r\\nAndrew Skilton writes that the Buddha was never historically regarded by Buddhist traditions as being merely human:\\r\\nIt is important to stress that, despite modern Theravada teachings to the contrary (often a sop to skeptical Western pupils), he was never seen as being merely human. For instance, he is often described as having the thirty-two major and eighty minor marks or signs of a mahpuru?a, \\"superman\\"; the Buddha himself denied that he was either a man or a god; and in the Mahparinibbna Sutta he states that he could live for an aeon were he asked to do so.[77]\\r\\nThe ancient Indians were generally unconcerned with chronologies, being more focused on philosophy. Buddhist texts reflect this tendency, providing a clearer picture of what Gautama may have taught than of the dates of the events in his life. These texts contain descriptions of the culture and daily life of ancient India which can be corroborated from the Jain scriptures, and make the Buddha's time the earliest period in Indian history for which significant accounts exist.[78] British author Karen Armstrong writes that although there is very little information that can be considered historically sound, we can be reasonably confident that Siddhrtha Gautama did exist as a historical figure.[79] Michael Carrithers goes a bit further by stating that the most general outline of \\"birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death\\" must be true.[24]\\r\\nThe Buddhist tradition regards Lumbini, in present-day Nepal to be the birthplace of the Buddha.[81][note 1] He grew up in Kapilavastu.[note 1] The exact site of ancient Kapilavastu is unknown.[82] It may have been either Piprahwa, Uttar Pradesh, in present-day India,[53] or Tilaurakot, in present-day Nepal.[83] Both places belonged to the Sakya territory, and are located only 15 miles apart.[83]\\r\\nGautama was born as a Kshatriya,[84][note 9] the son of ?uddhodana, \\"an elected chief of the Shakya clan\\",[6] whose capital was Kapilavastu, and who were later annexed by the growing Kingdom of Kosala during the Buddha's lifetime. Gautama was the family name. His mother, Maya (Mydevؐ), Suddhodana's wife, was a Koliyan princess. Legend has it that, on the night Siddhartha was conceived, Queen Maya dreamt that a white elephant with six white tusks entered her right side,[86][87] and ten months later[88] Siddhartha was born. As was the Shakya tradition, when his mother Queen Maya became pregnant, she left Kapilavastu for her father's kingdom to give birth. However, her son is said to have been born on the way, at Lumbini, in a garden beneath a sal tree.\\r\\nThe day of the Buddha's birth is widely celebrated in Theravada countries as Vesak.[89] Buddha's Birthday is called Buddha Purnima in Nepal, Bangladesh, and India as he is believed to have been born on a full moon day. Various sources hold that the Buddha's mother died at his birth, a few days or seven days later. The infant was given the name Siddhartha (Pli: Siddhattha), meaning \\"he who achieves his aim\\". During the birth celebrations, the hermit seer Asita journeyed from his mountain abode and announced that the child would either become a great king (chakravartin) or a great sadhu.[90] By traditional account,[which?] this occurred after Siddhartha placed his feet in Asita's hair and Asita examined the birthmarks. Suddhodana held a naming ceremony on the fifth day, and invited eight Brahmin scholars to read the future. All gave a dual prediction that the baby would either become a great king or a great holy man.[90] Konda??a, the youngest, and later to be the first arhat other than the Buddha, was reputed to be the only one who unequivocally predicted that Siddhartha would become a Buddha.[91]\\r\\nWhile later tradition and legend characterized ?uddhodana as a hereditary monarch, the descendant of the Suryavansha (Solar dynasty) of Ik?vku (Pli: Okkka), many scholars think that ?uddhodana was the elected chief of a tribal confederacy.\\r\\nEarly texts suggest that Gautama was not familiar with the dominant religious teachings of his time until he left on his religious quest, which is said to have been motivated by existential concern for the human condition.[92] The state of the Shakya clan was not a monarchy and seems to have been structured either as an oligarchy, or as a form of republic.[93] The more egalitarian gana-sangha form of government, as a political alternative to the strongly hierarchical kingdoms, may have influenced the development of the ?ramanic Jain and Buddhist sanghas, where monarchies tended toward Vedic Brahmanism.[94]\\r\\nMaya's dream, Bharhut, circa 150 BCE.\\r\\nMaya's dream, Gandhara, 2nd century CE.\\r\\nBirth of the Buddha.\\r\\nThe Infant Buddha Taking A Bath, Gandhara 2nd Century CE.\\r\\nThe infant Buddha taking the Seven Steps. Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara.\\r\\nSiddhartha was brought up by his mother's younger sister, Maha Pajapati.[95] By tradition, he is said to have been destined by birth to the life of a prince and had three palaces (for seasonal occupation) built for him. His father, said to be King ?uddhodana, wishing for his son to be a great king, is said to have shielded him from religious teachings and from knowledge of human suffering. While ?uddhodana has traditionally been depicted as a king, and Siddhartha as his prince, more recent scholarship suggests the Shakya were in-fact organized as a semi-republican oligarchy rather than a monarchy.[96]\\r\\nWhen he reached the age of 16, his father reputedly arranged his marriage to a cousin of the same age named Ya?odhar (Pli: Yasodhar). According to the traditional account,[which?] she gave birth to a son, named Rhula. Siddhartha is said to have spent 29 years as a prince in Kapilavastu. Although his father ensured that Siddhartha was provided with everything he could want or need, Buddhist scriptures say that the future Buddha felt that material wealth was not life's ultimate goal.[95]\\r\\nAt the age of 29, Siddhartha left his palace to meet his subjects. Despite his father's efforts to hide from him the sick, aged and suffering, Siddhartha was said to have seen an old man. When his charioteer Channa explained to him that all people grew old, the prince went on further trips beyond the palace. On these he encountered a diseased man, a decaying corpse, and an ascetic. These depressed him, and he initially strove to overcome aging, sickness, and death by living the life of an ascetic.[97]\\r\\nAccompanied by Channa and riding his horse Kanthaka, Gautama quit his palace for the life of a mendicant. It's said that \\"the horse's hooves were muffled by the gods\\"[98] to prevent guards from knowing of his departure.\\r\\nGautama initially went to Rajagaha and began his ascetic life by begging for alms in the street. After King Bimbisara's men recognised Siddhartha and the king learned of his quest, Bimbisara offered Siddhartha the throne. Siddhartha rejected the offer but promised to visit his kingdom of Magadha first, upon attaining enlightenment.\\r\\nHe left Rajagaha and practised under two hermit teachers of yogic meditation.[99][100][101] After mastering the teachings of Alara Kalama (Skr. r?a Klma), he was asked by Kalama to succeed him. However, Gautama felt unsatisfied by the practice, and moved on to become a student of yoga with Udaka Ramaputta (Skr. Udraka Rmaputra).[102] With him he achieved high levels of meditative consciousness and was again asked to succeed his teacher. But, once more, he was not satisfied, and again moved on.[103]\\r\\nAccording to the early Buddhist texts,[104] after realizing that meditative dhyana was the right path to awakening, but that extreme asceticism didn't work, Gautama discovered what Buddhists know as being, the Middle Way[104]a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification, or the Noble Eightfold Path, as described in the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, which is regarded as the first discourse of the Buddha.[104] In a famous incident, after becoming starved and weakened, he is said to have accepted milk and rice pudding from a village girl named Sujata.[105] Such was his emaciated appearance that she wrongly believed him to be a spirit that had granted her a wish.[105]\\r\\nFollowing this incident, Gautama was famously seated under a pipal treenow known as the Bodhi treein Bodh Gaya, India, when he vowed never to arise until he had found the truth.[106] Kaundinya and four other companions, believing that he had abandoned his search and become undisciplined, ceased to stay with him, and went to somewhere else. After a reputed 49 days of meditation, at the age of 35, he is said to have attained Enlightenment,[106][107] and became known as the Buddha or \\"Awakened One\\" (\\"Buddha\\" is also sometimes translated as \\"The Enlightened One\\").\\r\\nAccording to some sutras of the Pali canon, at the time of his awakening he realized complete insight into the Four Noble Truths, thereby attaining liberation from samsara, the endless cycle of rebirth, suffering and dying again.[108][109][110] According to scholars, this story of the awakening and the stress on \\"liberating insight\\" is a later development in the Buddhist tradition, where the Buddha may have regarded the practice of dhyana as leading to Nirvana and moksha.[111][112][108][note 10]\\r\\nNirvana is the extinguishing of the \\"fires\\" of desire, hatred, and ignorance, that keep the cycle of suffering and rebirth going.[113] Nirvana is also regarded as the \\"end of the world\\", in that no personal identity or boundaries of the mind remain.[citation needed] In such a state, a being is said to possess the Ten Characteristics, belonging to every Buddha.[citation needed]\\r\\nAccording to a story in the ycana Sutta (Samyutta Nikaya VI.1)? a scripture found in the Pli and other canons? immediately after his awakening, the Buddha debated whether or not he should teach the Dharma to others. He was concerned that humans were so overpowered by ignorance, greed and hatred that they could never recognise the path, which is subtle, deep and hard to grasp. However, in the story, Brahm Sahampati convinced him, arguing that at least some will understand it. The Buddha relented, and agreed to teach.\\r\\nAfter his awakening, the Buddha met Taphussa and Bhallika? two merchant brothers from the city of Balkh in what is currently Afghanistan? who became his first lay disciples. It is said that each was given hairs from his head, which are now claimed to be enshrined as relics in the Shwe Dagon Temple in Rangoon, Burma. The Buddha intended to visit Asita, and his former teachers, Alara Kalama and Udaka Ramaputta, to explain his findings, but they had already died.\\r\\nHe then travelled to the Deer Park near Varanasi (Benares) in northern India, where he set in motion what Buddhists call the Wheel of Dharma by delivering his first sermon to the five companions with whom he had sought enlightenment. Together with him, they formed the first sa?gha: the company of Buddhist monks.\\r\\nAll five become arahants, and within the first two months, with the conversion of Yasa and fifty-four of his friends, the number of such arahants is said to have grown to 60. The conversion of three brothers named Kassapa followed, with their reputed 200, 300 and 500 disciples, respectively. This swelled the sangha to more than 1,000.\\r\\nFor the remaining 45 years of his life, the Buddha is said to have traveled in the Gangetic Plain, in what is now Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and southern Nepal, teaching a diverse range of people: from nobles to servants, murderers such as Angulimala, and cannibals such as Alavaka.[114] Although the Buddha's language remains unknown, it's likely that he taught in one or more of a variety of closely related Middle Indo-Aryan dialects, of which Pali may be a standardization.\\r\\nThe sangha traveled through the subcontinent, expounding the dharma. This continued throughout the year, except during the four months of the Vassa rainy season when ascetics of all religions rarely traveled. One reason was that it was more difficult to do so without causing harm to animal life. At this time of year, the sangha would retreat to monasteries, public parks or forests, where people would come to them.\\r\\nThe first vassana was spent at Varanasi when the sangha was formed. After this, the Buddha kept a promise to travel to Rajagaha, capital of Magadha, to visit King Bimbisara. During this visit, Sariputta and Maudgalyayana were converted by Assaji, one of the first five disciples, after which they were to become the Buddha's two foremost followers. The Buddha spent the next three seasons at Veluvana Bamboo Grove monastery in Rajagaha, the capital of Magadha.\\r\\nUpon hearing of his son's awakening, Suddhodana sent, over a period, ten delegations to ask him to return to Kapilavastu. On the first nine occasions, the delegates failed to deliver the message and instead joined the sangha to become arahants. The tenth delegation, led by Kaludayi, a childhood friend of Gautama's (who also became an arahant), however, delivered the message.\\r\\nNow two years after his awakening, the Buddha agreed to return, and made a two-month journey by foot to Kapilavastu, teaching the dharma as he went. At his return, the royal palace prepared a midday meal, but the sangha was making an alms round in Kapilavastu. Hearing this, Suddhodana approached his son, the Buddha, saying:\\r\\n\\"Ours is the warrior lineage of Mahamassata, and not a single warrior has gone seeking alms.\\"\\r\\nThe Buddha is said to have replied:\\r\\n\\"That is not the custom of your royal lineage. But it is the custom of my Buddha lineage. Several thousands of Buddhas have gone by seeking alms.\\"\\r\\nBuddhist texts say that Suddhodana invited the sangha into the palace for the meal, followed by a dharma talk. After this he is said to have become a sotapanna. During the visit, many members of the royal family joined the sangha. The Buddha's cousins Ananda and Anuruddha became two of his five chief disciples. At the age of seven, his son Rahula also joined, and became one of his ten chief disciples. His half-brother Nanda also joined and became an arahant.\\r\\nOf the Buddha's disciples, Sariputta, Maudgalyayana, Mahakasyapa, Ananda and Anuruddha are believed to have been the five closest to him. His ten foremost disciples were reputedly completed by the quintet of Upali, Subhoti, Rahula, Mahakaccana and Punna.\\r\\nIn the fifth vassana, the Buddha was staying at Mahavana near Vesali when he heard news of the impending death of his father. He is said to have gone to Suddhodana and taught the dharma, after which his father became an arahant.\\r\\nThe king's death and cremation was to inspire the creation of an order of nuns. Buddhist texts record that the Buddha was reluctant to ordain women. His foster mother Maha Pajapati, for example, approached him, asking to join the sangha, but he refused. Maha Pajapati, however, was so intent on the path of awakening that she led a group of royal Sakyan and Koliyan ladies, which followed the sangha on a long journey to Rajagaha. In time, after Ananda championed their cause, the Buddha is said to have reconsidered and, five years after the formation of the sangha, agreed to the ordination of women as nuns. He reasoned that males and females had an equal capacity for awakening. But he gave women additional rules (Vinaya) to follow.\\r\\nAccording to the Mahaparinibbana Sutta of the Pali canon, at the age of 80, the Buddha announced that he would soon reach Parinirvana, or the final deathless state, and abandon his earthly body. After this, the Buddha ate his last meal, which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named Cunda. Falling violently ill, Buddha instructed his attendant nanda to convince Cunda that the meal eaten at his place had nothing to do with his passing and that his meal would be a source of the greatest merit as it provided the last meal for a Buddha.[115] Mettanando and von Hinber argue that the Buddha died of mesenteric infarction, a symptom of old age, rather than food poisoning.[116][117]\\r\\nThe precise contents of the Buddha's final meal are not clear, due to variant scriptural traditions and ambiguity over the translation of certain significant terms; the Theravada tradition generally believes that the Buddha was offered some kind of pork, while the Mahayana tradition believes that the Buddha consumed some sort of truffle or other mushroom. These may reflect the different traditional views on Buddhist vegetarianism and the precepts for monks and nuns.\\r\\nWaley suggests that Theravadins would take suukaramaddava (the contents of the Buddha's last meal), which can translate literally as pig-soft, to mean \\"soft flesh of a pig\\" or \\"pig's soft-food\\", that is, after Neumann, a soft food favoured by pigs, assumed to be a truffle. He argues (also after Neumann) that as \\"(p)lant names tend to be local and dialectical\\", as there are several plants known to have suukara- (pig) as part of their names,[note 11] and as Pali Buddhism developed in an area remote from the Buddha's death, suukaramaddava could easily have been a type of plant whose local name was unknown to those in Pali regions. Specifically, local writers writing soon after the Buddha's death knew more about their flora than Theravadin commentator Buddhaghosa who lived hundreds of years and hundreds of kilometres remote in time and space from the events described. Unaware that it may have been a local plant name and with no Theravadin prohibition against eating animal flesh, Theravadins would not have questioned the Buddha eating meat and interpreted the term accordingly.[118]\\r\\nAccording to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha died at Ku?inra (present-day Kushinagar, India), which became a pilgrimage center.[119] Ananda protested the Buddha's decision to enter Parinirvana in the abandoned jungles of Ku?inra of the Malla kingdom. The Buddha, however, is said to have reminded Ananda how Kushinara was a land once ruled by a righteous wheel-turning king and the appropriate place for him to die.[120]\\r\\nThe Buddha then asked all the attendant Bhikkhus to clarify any doubts or questions they had and cleared them all in a way which others could not do. They had none. According to Buddhist scriptures, he then finally entered Parinirvana. The Buddha's final words are reported to have been: \\"All composite things (Sa?khra) are perishable. Strive for your own liberation with diligence\\" (Pali: 'vayadhamm sa?khr appamdena sampdeth'). His body was cremated and the relics were placed in monuments or stupas, some of which are believed to have survived until the present. For example, the Temple of the Tooth or \\"Dalada Maligawa\\" in Sri Lanka is the place where what some believe to be the relic of the right tooth of Buddha is kept at present.\\r\\nAccording to the Pli historical chronicles of Sri Lanka, the Dؐpava?sa and Mahva?sa, the coronation of Emperor A?oka (Pli: Asoka) is 218 years after the death of the Buddha. According to two textual records in Chinese (e? and ?C??), the coronation of Emperor A?oka is 116 years after the death of the Buddha. Therefore, the time of Buddha's passing is either 486 BCE according to Theravda record or 383 BCE according to Mahayana record. However, the actual date traditionally accepted as the date of the Buddha's death in Theravda countries is 544 or 545 BCE, because the reign of Emperor A?oka was traditionally reckoned to be about 60 years earlier than current estimates. In Burmese Buddhist tradition, the date of the Buddha's death is 13 May 544 BCE.[121] whereas in Thai tradition it is 11 March 545 BCE.[122]\\r\\nAt his death, the Buddha is famously believed to have told his disciples to follow no leader. Mahakasyapa was chosen by the sangha to be the chairman of the First Buddhist Council, with the two chief disciples Maudgalyayana and Sariputta having died before the Buddha.\\r\\nWhile in the Buddha's days he was addressed by the very respected titles Buddha, Shkyamuni, Shkyasimha, Bhante and Bho, he was known after his parinirvana nirvana as Arihant, Bhagav/Bhagavat/Bhagwn, Mahvira,[123] Jina/Jinendra, Sstr, Sugata, and most popularly in scriptures as Tathgata.\\r\\nAfter his death, Buddha's cremation relics were divided amongst 8 royal families and his disciples; centuries later they would be enshrined by King Ashoka into 84,000 stupas.[124][125] Many supernatural legends surround the history of alleged relics as they accompanied the spread of Buddhism and gave legitimacy to rulers.\\r\\nAn extensive and colorful physical description of the Buddha has been laid down in scriptures. A kshatriya by birth, he had military training in his upbringing, and by Shakyan tradition was required to pass tests to demonstrate his worthiness as a warrior in order to marry.[citation needed] He had a strong enough body to be noticed by one of the kings and was asked to join his army as a general.[citation needed] He is also believed by Buddhists to have \\"the 32 Signs of the Great Man\\".\\r\\nThe Brahmin Sonadanda described him as \\"handsome, good-looking, and pleasing to the eye, with a most beautiful complexion. He has a godlike form and countenance, he is by no means unattractive.\\" (D, I:115)\\r\\n\\"It is wonderful, truly marvellous, how serene is the good Gotama's appearance, how clear and radiant his complexion, just as the golden jujube in autumn is clear and radiant, just as a palm-tree fruit just loosened from the stalk is clear and radiant, just as an adornment of red gold wrought in a crucible by a skilled goldsmith, deftly beaten and laid on a yellow-cloth shines, blazes and glitters, even so, the good Gotama's senses are calmed, his complexion is clear and radiant.\\" (A, I:181)\\r\\nA disciple named Vakkali, who later became an arahant, was so obsessed by the Buddha's physical presence that the Buddha is said to have felt impelled to tell him to desist, and to have reminded him that he should know the Buddha through the Dhamma and not through physical appearances.\\r\\nAlthough there are no extant representations of the Buddha in human form until around the 1st century CE (see Buddhist art), descriptions of the physical characteristics of fully enlightened buddhas are attributed to the Buddha in the Digha Nikaya's Lakkha?a Sutta (D, I:142).[127] In addition, the Buddha's physical appearance is described by Yasodhara to their son Rahula upon the Buddha's first post-Enlightenment return to his former princely palace in the non-canonical Pali devotional hymn, Narasؐha Gth (\\"The Lion of Men\\").[128]\\r\\nAmong the 32 main characteristics it is mentioned that Buddha has blue eyes.[129]\\r\\nRecollection of nine virtues attributed to the Buddha is a common Buddhist meditation and devotional practice called Buddhnusm?ti. The nine virtues are also among the 40 Buddhist meditation subjects. The nine virtues of the Buddha appear throughout the Tipitaka,[130] and include:\\r\\nIn the Pali Canon, the Buddha uses many Brahmanical devices. For example, in Samyutta Nikaya 111, Majjhima Nikaya 92 and Vinaya i 246 of the Pali Canon, the Buddha praises the Agnihotra as the foremost sacrifice and the Gayatri mantra as the foremost meter:\\r\\naggihuttamukh ya?? svittؐ chandaso mukham.\\r\\nSacrifices have the Agnihotra as foremost; of meter, the foremost is the Svitrؐ.[131]\\r\\nInformation of the oldest teachings may be obtained by analysis of the oldest texts. One method to obtain information on the oldest core of Buddhism is to compare the oldest extant versions of the Theravadin Pali Canon and other texts.[note 12] The reliability of these sources, and the possibility of drawing out a core of oldest teachings, is a matter of dispute.[134][135][136][137] According to Vetter, inconsistencies remain, and other methods must be applied to resolve those inconsistencies.[132][note 13]\\r\\nAccording to Schmithausen, three positions held by scholars of Buddhism can be distinguished:[140]\\r\\nA core problem in the study of early Buddhism is the relation between dhyana and insight.[135][134][137] Schmithausen notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting \\"liberating insight\\", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36.[138][134][135]\\r\\nAccording to Tilmann Vetter, the core of earliest Buddhism is the practice of dhyna,[146] as a workable alternative to painful ascetic practices.[147][note 19] Bronkhorst agrees that Dhyna was a Buddhist invention,[134][page?needed] whereas Norman notes that \\"the Buddha's way to release [...] was by means of meditative practices.\\"[149] Discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development.[150][151]\\r\\nAccording to the Mahsaccakasutta,[note 20] from the fourth jhana the Buddha gained bodhi. Yet, it is not clear what he was awakened to.[149][134][page?needed] According to Schmithausen and Bronkhorst, \\"liberating insight\\" is a later addition to this text, and reflects a later development and understanding in early Buddhism.[138][134][page?needed] The mentioning of the four truths as constituting \\"liberating insight\\" introduces a logical problem, since the four truths depict a linear path of practice, the knowledge of which is in itself not depicted as being liberating:[152]\\r\\n[T]hey do not teach that one is released by knowing the four noble truths, but by practicing the fourth noble truth, the eightfold path, which culminates in right samadhi.[152]\\r\\nAlthough \\"Nibbna\\" (Sanskrit: Nirvna) is the common term for the desired goal of this practice, many other terms can be found throughout the Nikayas, which are not specified.[153][note 21]\\r\\nAccording to Vetter, the description of the Buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term \\"the middle way\\".[154] In time, this short description was elaborated, resulting in the description of the eightfold path.[154]\\r\\nAccording to both Bronkhorst and Anderson, the four truths became a substitution for prajna, or \\"liberating insight\\", in the suttas[112][108][page?needed] in those texts where \\"liberating insight\\" was preceded by the four jhanas.[155] According to Bronkhorst, the four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of \\"liberating insight\\".[156] Gotama's teachings may have been personal, \\"adjusted to the need of each person.\\"[155]\\r\\nThe three marks of existence[note 22] may reflect Upanishadic or other influences. K.R. Norman supposes that these terms were already in use at the Buddha's time, and were familiar to his listeners.[157]\\r\\nThe Brahma-vihara was in origin probably a brahmanic term;[158] but its usage may have been common to the Sramana traditions.[134]\\r\\nIn time, \\"liberating insight\\" became an essential feature of the Buddhist tradition. The following teachings, which are commonly seen as essential to Buddhism, are later formulations which form part of the explanatory framework of this \\"liberating insight\\":[135][134]\\r\\nSome Hindus regard Gautama as the 9th avatar of Vishnu.[note 8][159] However, Buddha's teachings deny the authority of the Vedas and the concepts of Brahman-Atman.[160][161][162] Consequently Buddhism is generally classified as a nstika school (heterodox, literally \\"It is not so\\"[note 23]) in contrast to the six orthodox schools of Hinduism.[165][166][167]\\r\\nThe Buddha is regarded as a prophet by the minority Ahmadiyya[168] sect of Muslims ÿ a sect considered a deviant and rejected as apostate by mainstream Islam.[169][170] Some early Chinese Taoist-Buddhists thought the Buddha to be a reincarnation of Laozi.[171]\\r\\nDisciples of the Cao ?i religion worship the Buddha as a major religious teacher.[172] His image can be found in both their Holy See and on the home altar. He is revealed during communication with Divine Beings as son of their Supreme Being (God the Father) together with other major religious teachers and founders like Jesus, Laozi, and Confucius.[173]\\r\\nThe Christian Saint Josaphat is based on the Buddha. The name comes from the Sanskrit Bodhisattva via Arabic Bdhasaf and Georgian Iodasaph.[174] The only story in which St. Josaphat appears, Barlaam and Josaphat, is based on the life of the Buddha.[175] Josaphat was included in earlier editions of the Roman Martyrology (feast day 27 November)? though not in the Roman Missal? and in the Eastern Orthodox Church liturgical calendar (26 August).\\r\\nIn the ancient Gnostic sect of Manichaeism, the Buddha is listed among the prophets who preached the word of God before Mani.[176]\\r\\nIn Sikhism, Buddha is mentioned as the 23rd avatar of Vishnu in the Chaubis Avtar, a composition in Dasam Granth traditionally and historically attributed to Guru Gobind Singh.[177]","input":"Who was the founder of buddhism and when was he born?"},{"output":"Appolo Ohanga","context":"Appolo Ohanga was the first black Kenyan cabinet minister in the Colonial Period.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in 1913 at Got Regea in Siaya, Nyanza Province, the late Benaiah Appolo Ohanga was the son of the late Ongewe Okelo\\r\\nand Alicia Obura.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter passing his Common Entrance Examination in 1927 he joined Maseno School in 1928.[2] At Maseno, the late Carey Francis recognized his unique ability and within two years, Mr Ohanga had taken his final exams for Secondary and teacher training education.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then proceeded to Alliance High School in 1931 for Senior Secondary education and qualified for entrance to University in 1933.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, he was prevailed upon by Carey Francis to join him in training teachers at Maseno Central School.
