The concept of the common good differs significantly among philosophical doctrines . Early conceptions of the common good were set out by Ancient Greek philosophers , including Aristotle and Plato . One understanding of the common good rooted in Aristotle 's philosophy remains in common usage today , referring to what one contemporary scholar calls the \`\` good proper to , and attainable only by , the community , yet individually shared by its members . '' The concept of common good developed through the work of political theorists , moral philosophers , and public economists , including Thomas Aquinas , Niccolò Machiavelli , John Locke , Jean - Jacques Rousseau , James Madison , Adam Smith , Karl Marx , John Stuart Mill , John Rawls , and many other thinkers . In contemporary economic theory , a common good is any good which is rivalrous yet non-excludable , while the common good , by contrast , arises in the subfield of welfare economics and refers to the outcome of a social welfare function . Such a social welfare function , in turn , would be rooted in a moral theory of the good ( such as utilitarianism ) . Social choice theory aims to understand processes by which the common good may or may not be realized in societies through the study of collective decision rules . And public choice theory applies microeconomic methodology to the study of political science in order to explain how private interests affect political activities and outcomes ."},{"query":"what part of alaska is the last frontier filmed","short_answer":"11 miles outside of Homer","abstract":"Alaska : The Last Frontier is an American reality cable television series on the Discovery Channel , currently in its 7th season of broadcast .

The Roman era saw both areas , except Scotland and Northern Ireland , conquered by Rome , whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day , and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas ; however , the language barrier remained . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history , as well as the English language . In the medieval period , the countries were often bitter enemies , with both nations ' monarchs claiming control over France . The Hundred Years ' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory . Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815 . After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better . Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente cordiale , particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II , wherein both countries fought against Germany , and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis . Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO .

Pig iron has a very high carbon content , typically 3.8 -- 4.7 % , along with silica and other constituents of dross , which makes it very brittle , and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications .

The traditional shape of the molds used for pig iron ingots was a branching structure formed in sand , with many individual ingots at right angles to a central channel or runner , resembling a litter of piglets being suckled by a sow . When the metal had cooled and hardened , the smaller ingots ( the pigs ) were simply broken from the runner ( the sow ) , hence the name pig iron .

Nucleic acid molecules which are to be analyzed are set upon a viscous medium , the gel , where an electric field induces the nucleic acids ( which are negatively charged due to their sugar - phosphate backbone ) to migrate toward the anode ( which is positively charged because this is an electrolytic rather than galvanic cell ) . The separation of these fragments is accomplished by exploiting the mobilities with which different sized molecules are able to pass through the gel . Longer molecules migrate more slowly because they experience more resistance within the gel . Because the size of the molecule affects its mobility , smaller fragments end up nearer to the anode than longer ones in a given period . After some time , the voltage is removed and the fragmentation gradient is analyzed . For larger separations between similar sized fragments , either the voltage or run time can be increased . Extended runs across a low voltage gel yield the most accurate resolution . Voltage is , however , not the sole factor in determining electrophoresis of nucleic acids ."},{"query":"when was the last time the dallas cowboys won a superbowl game","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"what was the purpose of the american revolutionary war","short_answer":"revolt against the rule of Great Britain","abstract":""},{"query":"who has qualified for next round world cup","short_answer":"Afghanistan|West Indies","abstract":""},{"query":"what is the smallest island in the caribbean","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a list of islands in the Caribbean by area , but the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands are not in the Caribbean Sea , but rather in the open North Atlantic Ocean .

After the cubic model ( 1902 ) , the plum - pudding model ( 1904 ) , the Saturnian model ( 1904 ) , and the Rutherford model ( 1911 ) came the Rutherford -- Bohr model or just Bohr model for short ( 1913 ) . The improvement to the Rutherford model is mostly a quantum physical interpretation of it . The model 's key success lay in explaining the Rydberg formula for the spectral emission lines of atomic hydrogen . While the Rydberg formula had been known experimentally , it did not gain a theoretical underpinning until the Bohr model was introduced . Not only did the Bohr model explain the reason for the structure of the Rydberg formula , it also provided a justification for its empirical results in terms of fundamental physical constants ."},{"query":"what does the guy say in mortal kombat","short_answer":"","abstract":"Daniel \`\` Dan '' Warner \`\` Toasty '' Forden ( born September 28 , 1963 ) is an American sound programmer and music composer , and was the lead programmer on several high - profile arcade and pinball games .

These conceptions can generally be divided into two categories developed by legal academics , the \`\` thin '' , or formal , conception and the \`\` thick '' , or substantive , conception of the rule of law . The thin conception , often associated with the legal scholars Albert Venn Dicey and Joseph Raz , advocates the view that the rule of law is fulfilled by adhering to formal procedures and requirements , such as the stipulations that all laws be prospective , clear , stable and constitutionally enacted , and that the parties to legal disputes are treated equally and without bias on the part of judges . While people subscribing to the thin conception do not dismiss the importance of the content of the law , they take the view that this is a matter of substantive justice and should not be regarded as part of the concept of the rule of law . On the other hand , the thick conception of the rule of law entails the notion that in addition to the requirements of the thin rule , it is necessary for the law to conform with certain substantive standards of justice and human rights ."},{"query":"where are cannabinoid receptors located in the brain","short_answer":"central nervous system","abstract":"Cannabinoid receptors , located throughout the body , are part of the endocannabinoid system , which is involved in a variety of physiological processes including appetite , pain - sensation , mood , and memory ."},{"query":"who used to say it's a puppet","short_answer":"Nick Frisbee","abstract":""},{"query":"who sang there's a danger in loving somebody too much","short_answer":"Patty Smyth|Don Henley","abstract":"\`\` Sometimes Love Just Ai n't Enough '' is the title of a 1992 rock ballad performed as a duet by the American singers Patty Smyth and Don Henley .

The Duchy had evolved out of the Teutonic Order , a Roman Catholic crusader state and theocracy located along the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea . The Teutonic Knights were under the leadership of a Grand Master , the last of whom , Albert , converted to Protestantism and secularized the lands , which then became the Duchy of Prussia . The Duchy was initially a vassal of the Kingdom of Poland , as a result of the terms of the Prussian Homage whereby Albert was granted the Duchy as part of the terms of peace following the Prussian War . When the main line of Prussian Hohenzollerns died out in 1618 , the Duchy passed to a different branch of the family , who also reigned as Electors of Brandenburg in the Holy Roman Empire . While still nominally two different territories , Prussia under the suzerainty of Poland and Brandenburg under the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Empire , the two states are known together historiographically as Brandenburg - Prussia . Following the Second Northern War , a series of treaties freed the Duchy of Prussia from any vassalage to any other state , making it a fully sovereign Duchy in its own right . This complex situation ( where the Hohenzollern ruler of the independent Duchy of Prussia was also a subject of the Holy Roman Emperor as Elector of Brandenburg ) laid the eventual groundwork for the establishment of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701 . For diplomatic reasons , the rulers of the state were known as the King in Prussia from 1701 to 1772 ; largely because they still owed fealty to the Emperor as Electors of Brandenburg , the \`\` King in Prussia '' title ( as opposed to \`\` King of Prussia '' ) avoided offending the Emperor . As the Prussian state grew through several wars and diplomatic moves throughout the 18th century , it became apparent that Prussia had become a Great Power that did not need to submit meekly to the Holy Roman Empire . By 1772 , the pretense was dropped , and the style \`\` King of Prussia '' was adopted . Thus it remained until 1871 , when in the aftermath of the Franco - Prussian War , the King of Prussia Wilhelm I was crowned German Emperor . From that point forward , though the Kingdom of Prussia retained its status as a constituent state of the German Empire , all remaining Kings of Prussia also served as German Emperor , and that title took precedence ."},{"query":"what is the name of the indian goddess with many arms","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"who is a in pretty little liars first season","short_answer":"","abstract":"The first season of Pretty Little Liars , based on the books of the same name by Sara Shepard , premiered on June 8 , 2010 and concluded on March 21 , 2011 on ABC Family ."},{"query":"when was the bee gees one for all tour","short_answer":"1989","abstract":"One for All Tour is a concert video from The Bee Gees recorded live at the National Tennis Centre in Melbourne , Australia in November 1989 .

However more recent changes , possibly mergers or a stronger showing in the price of oil could mean a few of the oil sands producers are underrepresented ; this is because Canadian companies are increasingly dependent on production from that source , which is hurt severely when oil prices decline below 50 to 60 dollars a barrel since costs per barrel traditionally exceed $28 and non-upgraded bitumen ( < 10 API ) produces 1.7 fewer barrels per metric ton than West Texas Intermediate oil ( according to calculation ) . A few of the larger companies ( Penn West Petroleum and Athabasca Oil Corporation ) do n't show up in the Forbes list because its ranking system takes many different factors into account . Syncrude and Irving Oil are also leaders in the Canadian industry , with Syncrude being the top producer of oil sands crude and Irving Oil operating the largest oil refinery in the country . Also , based on the price paid for a 9 % share in Syncrude Canada Ltd by Sinopec the company could be worth as much as US $50 billion . Canadian oil company profits quickly recovered from the financial crisis ; In 2009 they were down 90 % but in 2010 they reached $8.4 billion ; Helping profits is the smaller price gap between West Texas Intermediate oil ( $85 / bbl ) and Western Canadian heavy crude ( $65 / bbl ) with the price of upgraded synthetic oil surpassing WTI when supply falls ( before being upgraded to synthetic crude , heavier oil produces fewer barrels of oil per metric ton than lighter oil ) .

A statistical hypothesis test is a method of statistical inference . Commonly , two statistical data sets are compared , or a data set obtained by sampling is compared against a synthetic data set from an idealized model . A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets , and this is compared as an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis that proposes no relationship between two data sets . The comparison is deemed statistically significant if the relationship between the data sets would be an unlikely realization of the null hypothesis according to a threshold probability -- the significance level . Hypothesis tests are used in determining what outcomes of a study would lead to a rejection of the null hypothesis for a pre-specified level of significance . The process of distinguishing between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis is aided by identifying two conceptual types of errors , type 1 and type 2 , and by specifying parametric limits on e.g. how much type 1 error will be permitted ."},{"query":"in which state is the mukheshwar temple situated","short_answer":"Punjab","abstract":"Mukteshwar Mahadev Temple ( मुक्तेश्वर महादेव मंदिर ) is a popular shrine of Lord Shiva , it is also known as Mukesaran Mandir - located near Pathankot City on Shahpur Kandi Dam road .

The period of cultivation is usually terminated when the soil shows signs of exhaustion or , more commonly , when the field is overrun by weeds . The length of time that a field is cultivated is usually shorter than the period over which the land is allowed to regenerate by lying fallow . This technique is often used in LEDCs ( Less Economically Developed Countries ) or LICs ( Low Income Countries ) . In some areas , cultivators use a practice of slash - and - burn as one element of their farming cycle . Others employ land clearing without any burning , and some cultivators are purely migratory and do not use any cyclical method on a given plot . Sometimes no slashing at all is needed where regrowth is purely of grasses , an outcome not uncommon when soils are near exhaustion and need to lie fallow . In shifting agriculture , after two or three years of producing vegetable and grain crops on cleared land , the migrants abandon it for another plot . Trees , bushes and forests are cleared by slashing , and the remaining vegetation is burnt . The ashes add potash to the soil . Then the seeds are sown after the rains.It is practised in West Bengal ."},{"query":"who played aragorn son in return of the king","short_answer":"","abstract":"Viggo Peter Mortensen Jr. ( / ˈviːɡoʊ ˈmɔːrtənsən / ; Danish : ( viːɡo ˈmɒːdn̩sn̩ ) ; born October 20 , 1958 ) is a Danish American actor , producer , author , musician , photographer , poet , and painter ."},{"query":"when does ziva come back in season 11","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"who sings the song i ain't missing you at all","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Missing You '' is a song co-written and recorded by English musician John Waite .

This underlying entity can be an asset , index , or interest rate , and is often simply called the \`\` underlying '' . Derivatives can be used for a number of purposes , including insuring against price movements ( hedging ) , increasing exposure to price movements for speculation or getting access to otherwise hard - to - trade assets or markets .

Derivatives are one of the three main categories of financial instruments , the other two being stocks ( i.e. , equities or shares ) and debt ( i.e. , bonds and mortgages ) . The oldest example of a derivative in history is thought to be a contract transaction of olives , entered into by ancient Greek philosopher Thales , and attested to by Aristotle , who made a profit in the exchange .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic ."},{"query":"where is the sodium potassium pump located in the body","short_answer":"","abstract":"Na + / K + - ATPase ( sodium - potassium adenosine triphosphatase , also known as the Na + / K + pump or sodium -- potassium pump ) is an enzyme ( EC 3.6. 3.9 ) ( an electrogenic transmembrane ATPase ) found in the plasma membrane of all animal cells .

Because of its heavy historical and social significance , land is usually seen as the most important part of English property law . Ownership of land has its roots in the feudal system established by William the Conqueror after 1066 , and with a gradually diminishing aristocratic presence , now sees a large number of owners playing in an active market for real estate . The modern law 's sources derive from the old courts of common law and equity which includes legislation such as the Law of Property Act 1925 , the Settled Land Act 1925 , the Land Charges Act 1972 , the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 and the Land Registration Act 2002 , and the European Convention on Human Rights . At its core , English land law involves the acquisition , content and priority of rights and obligations among people with interests in land . Having a property right in land , as opposed to a contractual or some other personal right , matters because it creates privileges over other people 's claims , particularly if the land is sold on , the possessor goes insolvent , or when claiming various remedies , like specific performance , in court ."},{"query":"how many atp are made during the etc of cellular respiration","short_answer":"","abstract":"Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , and then release waste products .

She co-founded , with Ellen Gates Starr , an early settlement house in the United States , Chicago 's Hull House that would later become known as one of the most famous settlement houses in America . In an era when presidents such as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson identified themselves as reformers and social activists , Addams was one of the most prominent reformers of the Progressive Era . She helped America address and focus on issues that were of concern to mothers , such as the needs of children , local public health , and world peace .

She said that if women were to be responsible for cleaning up their communities and making them better places to live , they needed to be able to vote to do so effectively . Addams became a role model for middle - class women who volunteered to uplift their communities .

Unlike a direct free kick , a goal may not be scored directly from the kick ; the ball must first come into contact with another player ( from either team ) . If the ball goes into the goal without touching any other player , a goal kick is awarded . The law was derived from the Sheffield Rules that stated that no goal could be scored from a free kick . This law was absorbed into the Laws of the Game in 1877 and later adapted to allow indirect free kicks as a result of dangerous play . An indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team when a player infringes certain technical requirements of the laws ( e.g. touching the ball a second time following a restart , or the keeper touching the ball with his hands when a teammate has used his foot to pass it back to the keeper ) . An indirect free kick is also awarded to the opposing team when play is stopped to caution or send - off a player when no specific foul has occurred ( e.g. when play is stopped to caution a player for dissenting the decision of the referee ) .
