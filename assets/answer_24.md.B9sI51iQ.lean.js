It is stimulated by decreased O in circulation , which is detected by the kidneys , which then secrete the hormone erythropoietin . This hormone stimulates proliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors , which activates increased erythropoiesis in the hemopoietic tissues , ultimately producing red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) . In postnatal birds and mammals ( including humans ) , this usually occurs within the red bone marrow . In the early fetus , erythropoiesis takes place in the mesodermal cells of the yolk sac . By the third or fourth month , erythropoiesis moves to the liver . After seven months , erythropoiesis occurs in the bone marrow . Increased level of physical activity can cause an increase in erythropoiesis .

In the late 17th century , the Roman Catholic Church , taking up a plea by Lourenço da Silva de Mendouça , officially condemned the slave trade , which was affirmed vehemently by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839 . An abolitionist movement only started in the late 18th century , however , when English and American Quakers began to question the morality of slavery . James Oglethorpe was among the first to articulate the Enlightenment case against slavery , banning it in the Province of Georgia on humanitarian grounds , arguing against it in Parliament , and eventually encouraging his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause .

The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system , yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different . The endocrine system 's effects are slow to initiate , and prolonged in their response , lasting from a few hours up to weeks . The nervous system sends information very quickly , and responses are generally short lived . In vertebrates , the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems . The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology , a branch of internal medicine . Special features of endocrine glands are , in general , their ductless nature , their vascularity , and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones . In contrast , exocrine glands , such as salivary glands , sweat glands , and glands within the gastrointestinal tract , tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen ."},{"query":"teak grows abundantly in which area of india","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"letters of the alphabet in order of usage","short_answer":"ETAON RISHD LFCMU GYPWB VKJXQ Z","abstract":"The frequency of letters in text has been studied for use in cryptanalysis , and frequency analysis in particular , dating back to the Iraqi mathematician Al - Kindi ( c. 801 -- 873 AD ) , who formally developed the method ( the ciphers breakable by this technique go back at least to the Caesar cipher invented by Julius Caesar , so this method could have been explored in classical times ) ."},{"query":"what do you call a female mayors husband","short_answer":"Mayor 's Consort|Lord Mayor 's Consort","abstract":"In England , the offices of mayor and lord mayor have long been ceremonial posts , with few or no duties attached to them .

Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago . In vertebrates it consists of two main parts , the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord . The PNS consists mainly of nerves , which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons , that connect the CNS to every other part of the body . Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves , while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent . Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves . The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems , the somatic , autonomic , and enteric nervous systems . Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement . The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy , while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state . The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system . Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily .

Federal grand juries can force people to take the witness stand , but defendants in those proceedings have Fifth Amendment privileges until they choose to answer any question . To claim the privilege for failure to answer when being interviewed by police , the interviewee must have explicitly invoked the constitutional right when declining to answer questions ."},{"query":"which of the following is not considered a modern change to the modal model of memory","short_answer":"","abstract":"Cognition"},{"query":"what is the purpose of the majority of fha programs","short_answer":"","abstract":"An FHA insured loan is a US Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance backed mortgage loan which is provided by an FHA - approved lender .

Charles Darwin recognized the small number of traits that made domestic species different from their wild ancestors . He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious selective breeding in which humans directly select for desirable traits , and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by - product of natural selection or from selection on other traits . There is a genetic difference between domestic and wild populations . There is also such a difference between the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication , and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations . Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates , and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant , whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates , though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations ."},{"query":"where is el paso texas located in texas","short_answer":"far western corner","abstract":"El Paso ( / ɛl ˈpæsoʊ / el PASS - oh ; from Spanish , \`\` the pass '' ) is a city in and the seat of El Paso County , Texas .

Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family , and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure . The electron has a mass that is approximately 1 / 1836 that of the proton . Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum ( spin ) of a half - integer value , expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant , ħ . As it is a fermion , no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state , in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle . Like all elementary particles , electrons exhibit properties of both particles and waves : they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light . The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer De Broglie wavelength for a given energy ."},{"query":"who has the red dot on their forehead","short_answer":"Hindu|Jain","abstract":"A Bindi ( Hindi : बिंदी , from Sanskrit bindu , meaning \`\` point , drop , dot or small particle '' ) is a red dot worn on the centre of the forehead , commonly by Hindu and Jain women .

The exosphere is above that but is a minor layer of the atmosphere . Within this layer of the atmosphere , ultraviolet radiation causes photoionization / photodissociation of molecules , creating ions in the ionosphere . The radiative properties of UV rays cause an imbalance of positive and negative energy , creating ions . Taking its name from the Greek θερμός ( pronounced thermos ) meaning heat , the thermosphere begins about 85 kilometres ( 53 mi ) above the Earth . At these high altitudes , the residual atmospheric gases sort into strata according to molecular mass ( see turbosphere ) . Thermospheric temperatures increase with altitude due to absorption of highly energetic solar radiation . Temperatures are highly dependent on solar activity , and can rise to 2,000 ° C ( 3,630 ° F ) . Radiation causes the atmosphere particles in this layer to become electrically charged ( see ionosphere ) , enabling radio waves to be refracted and thus be received beyond the horizon . In the exosphere , beginning at 500 to 1,000 kilometres ( 310 to 620 mi ) above the Earth 's surface , the atmosphere turns into space , although by the criteria set for the definition of the Kármán line , the thermosphere itself is part of space ."},{"query":"how do you get a cat to like a dog","short_answer":"","abstract":"Puppy cat ( or puppy - like cat , dog - like cat , etc . ) is a term used to refer to specific breeds of domestic cats that have unusual behavioral tendencies that are reminiscent of young domestic dogs .

This dense water then flows into the ocean basins . While the bulk of it upwells in the Southern Ocean , the oldest waters ( with a transit time of around 1000 years ) upwell in the North Pacific . Extensive mixing therefore takes place between the ocean basins , reducing differences between them and making the Earth 's oceans a global system . On their journey , the water masses transport both energy ( in the form of heat ) and matter ( solids , dissolved substances and gases ) around the globe . As such , the state of the circulation has a large impact on the climate of the Earth ."},{"query":"buffy the vampire slayer season 6 episode 16","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Hell 's Bells '' is the 16th episode of season 6 of the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer ."},{"query":"how many books are in the warriors series by erin hunter","short_answer":"","abstract":"Warriors is a series of novels published by HarperCollins ; it is written by authors Kate Cary , Cherith Baldry , Tui Sutherland , with the plot developed by editor Victoria Holmes , who collectively use the pseudonym Erin Hunter .

Prison building efforts in the United States came in three major waves . The first began during the Jacksonian Era and led to widespread use of imprisonment and rehabilitative labor as the primary penalty for most crimes in nearly all states by the time of the American world war one . The second began after the Civil War and gained momentum during the Progressive Era , bringing a number of new mechanisms -- such as parole , probation , and indeterminate sentencing -- into the mainstream of American penal practice . Finally , since the early 1970s , the United States has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of its imprisonment systems at both the federal and state level . Since 1973 , the number of incarcerated persons in the United States has increased five-fold , and in a given year 7,000,000 people were under the supervision or control of correctional services in the United States . These periods of prison construction and reform produced major changes in the structure of prison systems and their missions , the responsibilities of federal and state agencies for administering and supervising them , as well as the legal and political status of prisoners themselves ."},{"query":"who won the boxing between joshua and klitschko","short_answer":"Joshua","abstract":""},{"query":"what led to the collapse of the han dynasty","short_answer":"","abstract":"The end of the Han dynasty refers to the period of Chinese history from 189 to 220 AD , which roughly coincides with the tumultuous reign of the Han dynasty 's last ruler , Emperor Xian .

Meanwhile , the Han Empire 's institutions were destroyed by the warlord Dong Zhuo , and fractured into regional regimes ruled by various warlords , some of whom were nobles and officials of the Han imperial court . Eventually , one of those warlords , Cao Cao , was able to gradually reunify the empire , ostensibly under Emperor Xian 's rule , but the empire was actually controlled by Cao Cao himself . Cao Cao 's efforts to completely reunite the Han empire were rebuffed at the Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 / 209 , when his armies were defeated by the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei . The Han dynasty formally ended in 220 when Cao Cao 's son and heir , Cao Pi , pressured Emperor Xian into abdicating in his favour . Cao Pi became the emperor of a new state , Cao Wei . A year later , in response to Cao Pi 's usurpation of the Han throne , Liu Bei declared himself emperor of Shu Han ; and in 229 , Sun Quan followed suit , declaring himself emperor of Eastern Wu .

Chinese immigrants in the 19th century worked as laborers , particularly on the transcontinental railroad , such as the Central Pacific Railroad . They also worked as laborers in the mining industry , and suffered racial discrimination at every level of society . While industrial employers were eager to get this new and cheap labor , the ordinary white public was stirred to anger by the presence of this \`\` yellow peril '' . Despite the provisions for equal treatment of Chinese immigrants in the 1868 Burlingame Treaty , political and labor organizations rallied against the immigration of what they regarded as a degraded race and \`\` cheap Chinese labor '' . Newspapers condemned the policies of employers , and even church leaders denounced the entrance of these aliens into what was regarded as a land for whites only . So hostile was the opposition that in 1882 the United States Congress eventually passed the Chinese Exclusion Act , which prohibited immigration from China for the next ten years . This law was then extended by the Geary Act in 1892 . The Chinese Exclusion Act was the only U.S. law ever to prevent immigration and naturalization on the basis of race . These laws not only prevented new immigration but also brought additional suffering as they prevented the reunion of the families of thousands of Chinese men already living in the United States ( that is , men who had left China without their wives and children ) ; anti-miscegenation laws in many states prohibited the Chinese men from marrying white women ."},{"query":"who played the silver surfer in fantastic four","short_answer":"Doug Jones|Laurence Fishburne","abstract":"Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer ( stylized as 4 : Rise of the Silver Surfer ) is a 2007 American superhero film , based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Fantastic Four .

The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history , as well as the English language . In the medieval period , the countries were often bitter enemies , with both nations ' monarchs claiming control over France . The Hundred Years ' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory . Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815 . After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better . Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente cordiale , particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II , wherein both countries fought against Germany , and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis . Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO .

It is based on measurement of the product of the radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium ( K ) into argon ( Ar ) . Potassium is a common element found in many materials , such as micas , clay minerals , tephra , and evaporites . In these materials , the decay product Ar is able to escape the liquid ( molten ) rock , but starts to accumulate when the rock solidifies ( recrystallizes ) . The amount of Argon sublimation that occurs is a function of the purity of the sample , the composition of the mother material , and a number of other factors . These factors introduce error limits on the upper and lower bounds of dating , so that final determination of age is reliant on the environmental factors during formation , melting , and exposure to decreased pressure and / or open - air . Time since recrystallization is calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of Ar accumulated to the amount of K remaining . The long half - life of K allows the method to be used to calculate the absolute age of samples older than a few thousand years ."},{"query":"describe the concept of poetry in your own words","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"when did the united states enter world war ii in europe","short_answer":"11 December 1941","abstract":"The military history of the United States in World War II covers the war against Germany , Italy , Japan and starting with the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor .
