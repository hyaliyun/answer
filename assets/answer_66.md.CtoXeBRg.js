In nature complementarity is the base principle of DNA replication and transcription as it is a property shared between two DNA or RNA sequences , such that when they are aligned antiparallel to each other , the nucleotide bases at each position in the sequences will be complementary , much like looking in the mirror and seeing the reverse of things . This complementary base pairing allows cells to copy information from one generation to another and even find and repair damage to the information stored in the sequences . The degree of complementarity between two nucleic acid strands may vary , from complete complementarity ( each nucleotide is across from its opposite ) to no complementarity ( each nucleotide is not across from its opposite ) and determines the stability of the sequences to be together . Furthermore , various DNA repair functions as well as regulatory functions are based on base pair complementarity . In biotechnology , the principle of base pair complementarity allows the generation of DNA hybrids between RNA and DNA , and opens the door to modern tools such as cDNA libraries . While most complementarity is seen between two separate strings of DNA or RNA , it is also possible for a sequence to have internal complementarity resulting in the sequence binding to itself in a folded configuration ."},{"query":"who has been appointed as the 9th un secretary general","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"difference between fast recovery diode and schottky diode","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Schottky diode ( named after the German physicist Walter H.

They were primarily used to demoralize , injure , and kill entrenched defenders , against whom the indiscriminate and generally very slow - moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective . The types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals , such as tear gas , to lethal agents like phosgene , chlorine , and mustard gas . This chemical warfare was a major component of the first global war and first total war of the 20th century . The killing capacity of gas was limited , with only about ninety thousand fatalities from a total of some 1.3 million casualties caused by gas attacks . Gas was unlike most other weapons of the period because it was possible to develop effective countermeasures , such as gas masks . In the later stages of the war , as the use of gas increased , its overall effectiveness diminished .

A statistical hypothesis test is a method of statistical inference . Commonly , two statistical data sets are compared , or a data set obtained by sampling is compared against a synthetic data set from an idealized model . A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets , and this is compared as an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis that proposes no relationship between two data sets . The comparison is deemed statistically significant if the relationship between the data sets would be an unlikely realization of the null hypothesis according to a threshold probability -- the significance level . Hypothesis tests are used in determining what outcomes of a study would lead to a rejection of the null hypothesis for a pre-specified level of significance . The process of distinguishing between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis is aided by identifying two conceptual types of errors , type 1 and type 2 , and by specifying parametric limits on e.g. how much type 1 error will be permitted ."},{"query":"what elder scrolls game has the biggest map","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Elder Scrolls II : Daggerfall is a fantasy open world action role - playing video game developed and published by Bethesda Softworks and released in 1996 for MS - DOS .

They are far lighter and thinner than traditional cathode ray tube ( CRT ) television sets and video displays and are usually less than 10 centimetres ( 3.9 in ) thick . Flat - panel displays can be divided into two display device categories : volatile and static . Volatile displays require that pixels be periodically electronically refreshed to retain their state ( e.g. , liquid - crystal displays ( LCD ) ) . A volatile display only shows an image when it has battery or AC mains power . Static flat - panel displays rely on materials whose color states are bistable ( e.g. , e-book reader tablets from Sony ) , and as such , flat - panel displays retain the text or images on the screen even when the power is off . As of 2016 , flat - panel displays have almost completely replaced old CRT displays . In many 2010 - era applications , specifically small portable devices such as laptops , mobile phones , smartphones , digital cameras , camcorders , point - and - shoot cameras , and pocket video cameras , any display disadvantages of flat - panels ( as compared with CRTs ) are made up for by portability advantages ( thinness and lightweightness ) ."},{"query":"what are the harry potter's in order","short_answer":"","abstract":"Harry Potter is a British - American film series based on the Harry Potter novels by author J.K.

The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the body , then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond to such events . Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago . In vertebrates it consists of two main parts , the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord . The PNS consists mainly of nerves , which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons , that connect the CNS to every other part of the body . Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves , while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent . Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves . The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems , the somatic , autonomic , and enteric nervous systems . Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement . The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy , while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state . The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system . Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily . Nerves that exit from the cranium are called cranial nerves while those exiting from the spinal cord are called spinal nerves ."},{"query":"the girl who played kate in my sister's keeper","short_answer":"Sofia Vladimirovna Vassilieva","abstract":"Sofia Vladimirovna Vassilieva ( Russian : София Владимировна Васильева ; born October 22 , 1992 ) is an American actress .

The original volumes were published in quarto sections , a common publishing practice of the time . The work covers the history , from 98 to 1590 , of the Roman Empire , the history of early Christianity and then of the Roman State Church , and the history of Europe , and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire in the East and West .

Later in their life cycle , extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems .

These programs included support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly as well as new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and changes to the monetary system . Most programs were enacted between 1933 -- 1938 , though some were later . They included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders , most during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the \`\` 3 Rs '' : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 -- 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and ethnic minorities . The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as an alleged enemy of business and growth and liberals accepting some of it and promising to make it more efficient . The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated most presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress from 1939 -- 1964 ."},{"query":"which of the following is the best description of the fluid mosaic model","short_answer":"","abstract":"The fluid mosaic model explains various observations regarding the structure of functional cell membranes . According to this model , there is a lipid bilayer in which the protein molecules are embedded . The lipid bilayer gives fluidity and elasticity to the membrane . Small amounts of carbohydrates are also found in cell membrane . The model , which was devised by SJ Singer and GL Nicolson in 1972 , describes the cell membrane as a two - dimensional liquid that restricts the lateral diffusion of membrane components . Such domains are defined by the existence of regions within the membrane with special lipid and protein composition that promote the formation of lipid rafts or protein and glycoprotein complexes . Another way to define membrane domains is the association of the lipid membrane with the cytoskeleton filaments and the extracellular matrix through membrane proteins . The current model describes important features relevant to many cellular processes , including : cell - cell signaling , apoptosis , cell division , membrane budding , and cell fusion . The fluid mosaic model is the most acceptable model of plasma membrane ."},{"query":"modern family season 6 episode 9 guest star","short_answer":"","abstract":"The ninth season of Modern Family premiered on September 27 , 2017 on ABC .

These four countries invested heavily in their infrastructure as well as in developing the intellectual abilities of their human talent , fostering and retaining their educated population to help further develop and improve their respective countries . This policy turned out to be so effective that by the late 20th century , all four countries had developed into advanced and high - income industrialized developed countries , developing many different areas of advanced technology that give them a tremendous competitive advantage in the world . For example , all four countries have become top level global education centers with Singapore , Taiwan , South Korea and Hong Kong ( China ) high school students consistently outperforming all other countries in the world and achieving the highest top scores on international math and science exams such as the PISA exam and with Taiwan students winning multiple gold medals every year consistently at the International Biology Olympiad , International Linguistics Olympiad , International Physics Olympiad , International Earth Science Olympiad , International Mathematical Olympiad and International Chemistry Olympiad . Additionally , these four countries are home to some of the most prestigious top ranking universities in the world such as National Taiwan University , Seoul National University , National University of Singapore , Nanyang Technological University and University of Hong Kong .

The domestic mining industry is underdeveloped , leading to Nigeria having to import minerals that it could produce domestically , such as salt or iron ore . Rights to ownership of mineral resources is held by the Federal government of Nigeria , which grants titles to organizations to explore , mine , and sell mineral resources . Organized mining began in 1903 when the Mineral Survey of the Northern Protectorates was created by the British colonial government . A year later , the Mineral Survey of the Southern Protectorates was founded . By the 1940s , Nigeria was a major producer of tin , columbite , and coal . The discovery of oil in 1956 hurt the mineral extraction industries , as government and industry both began to focus on this new resource . The Nigerian Civil War in the late 1960s led many expatriate mining experts to leave the country . Mining regulation is handled by the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development , which oversees the management of all mineral resources . Mining law is codified in the Federal Minerals and Mining Act of 1999 . Historically , Nigeria 's mining industry was monopolized by state - owned public corporations . This led to a decline in productivity in almost all mineral industries .

South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union .

This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea .
