Prison building efforts in the United States came in three major waves . The first began during the Jacksonian Era and led to widespread use of imprisonment and rehabilitative labor as the primary penalty for most crimes in nearly all states by the time of the American Civil War . The second began after the Civil War and gained momentum during the Progressive Era , bringing a number of new mechanisms -- such as parole , probation , and indeterminate sentencing -- into the mainstream of American penal practice . Finally , since the early 1970s , the United States has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of its imprisonment systems at both the federal and state level . Since 1973 , the number of incarcerated persons in the United States has increased five-fold , and in a given year 7,000,000 people were under the supervision or control of correctional services in the United States . These periods of prison construction and reform produced major changes in the structure of prison systems and their missions , the responsibilities of federal and state agencies for administering and supervising them , as well as the legal and political status of prisoners themselves ."},{"query":"who is the first judge mentioned in the old testament","short_answer":"","abstract":"A Biblical judge ( Hebrew : שופט ‎ šōp̄êṭ / shofet , pl . שופטים ‎ šōp̄əṭîm / shoftim ) was \`\` a ruler or a military leader as well as someone who presided over legal hearings .

The speed of downcutting depends on the stream 's base level , the lowest point to which the stream can erode . Sea level is the ultimate base level , but many streams have a higher \`\` temporary '' base level because they empty into another body of water that is above sea level or encounter bedrock that resists erosion . A concurrent process called lateral erosion refers to the widening of a stream channel or valley . When a stream is high above its base level , downcutting will take place faster than lateral erosion ; but as the level of the stream approaches its base level , the rate of lateral erosion increases . This is why streams in mountainous areas tend to be narrow and swift , forming V - shaped valleys , while streams in lowland areas tend to be wide and slow - moving , with valleys that are correspondingly wide and flat - bottomed . The term gradient refers to the elevation of a stream relative to its base level . The steeper the gradient , the faster the stream flows . Sometimes geological uplift will increase the gradient of a stream even while the stream downcuts toward its base level , a process called \`\` rejuvenation . '' This happened in the case of the Colorado River in the western United States , resulting in the process that created the Grand Canyon ."},{"query":"who played the wives in mad max fury road","short_answer":"","abstract":"Mad Max : Fury Road is a 2015 action film co-written , co-produced and directed by George Miller .

It requires \`\` reasonable '' governmental searches and seizures to be conducted only upon issuance of a warrant , judicially sanctioned by probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized . Under the Fourth Amendment , search and seizure ( including arrest ) should be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court , usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it . Fourth Amendment case law deals with three issues : what government activities constitute \`\` search '' and \`\` seizure '' ; what constitutes probable cause for these actions ; and how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed . Early court decisions limited the amendment 's scope to a law enforcement officer 's physical intrusion onto private property , but with Katz v.

It is often tested with two sharp points during a neurological examination and is assumed to reflect how finely innervated an area of skin is . In clinical settings , two - point discrimination is a widely used technique for assessing tactile perception . It relies on the ability and / or willingness of the patient to subjectively report what they are feeling and should be completed with the patient 's eyes closed . The therapist may use calipers or simply a reshaped paperclip to do the testing . The therapist may alternate randomly between touching the patient with one point or with two points on the area being tested ( e.g. finger , arm , leg , toe ) . The patient is asked to report whether one or two points was felt . The smallest distance between two points that still results in the perception of two distinct stimuli is recorded as the patient 's two - point threshold . Performance on the two extremities can be compared for discrepancies . Although the test is still commonly used clinically , it has been roundly criticized by many researchers as providing an invalid measure of tactile spatial acuity , and several highly regarded alternative tests have been proposed to replace it ."},{"query":"where did the saying rule of thumb come from","short_answer":"","abstract":"The English phrase rule of thumb refers to a principle with broad application that is not intended to be strictly accurate or reliable for every situation .

Some lichens grow on rocks without soil , so may be among the first of life forms , and break down the rocks into soil for plants . Since some uncolonized land may have thin , poor quality soils with few nutrients , pioneer species are often hardy plants with adaptations such as long roots , root nodes containing nitrogen - fixing bacteria , and leaves that employ transpiration . Note that they are often photosynthetic plants , as no other source of energy ( such as other species ) except light energy is often available in the early stages of succession , thus making it less likely for a pioneer species to be non-photosynthetic . The plants that are often pioneer species also tend to be wind - pollinated rather than insect - pollinated , as insects are unlikely to be present in the usually barren conditions in which pioneer species grow ; however , pioneer species tend to reproduce asexually altogether , as the extreme or barren conditions present make it more favourable to reproduce asexually in order to increase reproductive success rather than invest energy into sexual reproduction . Pioneer species will die creating plant litter , and break down as \`\` leaf mold '' after some time , making new soil for secondary succession ( see below ) , and nutrients for small fish and aquatic plants in adjacent bodies of water ."},{"query":"who is the first captain of sri lanka cricket team","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a list of all men , boys and women who have captained a Sri Lankan national cricket team at official international level .

They are far lighter and thinner than traditional cathode ray tube ( CRT ) television sets and video displays and are usually less than 10 centimetres ( 3.9 in ) thick . Flat - panel displays can be divided into two display device categories : volatile and static . Volatile displays require that pixels be periodically electronically refreshed to retain their state ( e.g. , liquid - crystal displays ( LCD ) ) . A volatile display only shows an image when it has battery or AC mains power . Static flat - panel displays rely on materials whose color states are bistable ( e.g. , e-book reader tablets from Sony ) , and as such , flat - panel displays retain the text or images on the screen even when the power is off . As of 2016 , flat - panel displays have almost completely replaced old CRT displays . In many 2010 - era applications , specifically small portable devices such as laptops , mobile phones , smartphones , digital cameras , camcorders , point - and - shoot cameras , and pocket video cameras , any display disadvantages of flat - panels ( as compared with CRTs ) are made up for by portability advantages ( thinness and lightweightness ) ."},{"query":"when did thomas the tank engine became cgi","short_answer":"in 2009","abstract":"Thomas & Friends ( originally known as Thomas The Tank Engine & Friends or Thomas the Tank Engine ; also known as Thomas & Friends : Big World !

This increase in membrane potential is what causes the cell membrane , which typically maintains a resting membrane potential of - 70 mV , to reach the threshold potential and consequently fire the next action potential ; thus , the pacemaker potential is what drives the self - generated rhythmic firing ( automaticity ) of pacemaker cells , and the rate of change ( i.e. , the slope ) of the pacemaker potential is what determines the timing of the next action potential and thus the intrinsic firing rate of the cell . In a healthy sinoatrial node ( SAN , a complex tissue within the right atrium containing pacemaker cells that normally determine the intrinsic firing rate for the entire heart ) , the pacemaker potential is the main determinant of the heart rate . Because the pacemaker potential represents the non-contracting time between heart beats ( diastole ) , it is also called the diastolic depolarization . The amount of net inward current required to move the cell membrane potential during the pacemaker phase is extremely small , in the order of few pAs , but this net flux arises from time to time changing contribution of several currents that flow with different voltage and time dependence . Evidence in support of the active presence of K , Ca , Na channels and Na / K exchanger during the pacemaker phase have been variously reported in the literature , but several indications point to the \`\` funny '' ( I ) current as one of the most important. ( see funny current ) . There is now substantial evidence that also sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) Ca - transients participate to the generation of the diastolic depolarization via a process involving the Na -- Ca exchanger ."},{"query":"funeral march for the obsequies of a deaf man","short_answer":"","abstract":"Alphonse Allais ( 20 October 1854 -- 28 October 1905 ) was a French writer and humorist , who was born in Honfleur , Calvados , and who died in Paris ."},{"query":"who played the father in leave it to beaver","short_answer":"Eugene Hugh Beaumont","abstract":"Eugene Hugh Beaumont ( February 16 , 1909 -- May 14 , 1982 ) was an American actor and television director .

The laws also regulated England 's fisheries and restricted foreigners ' participation in its colonial trade . While based on earlier precedents , they were first enacted in 1651 under the Commonwealth . The system was reenacted and broadened with the restoration by the Act of 1660 , and further developed and tightened by the Navigation Acts of 1663 , 1673 , and 1696 . Upon this basis during the 18th century , the acts were modified by subsequent amendments , changes , and the addition of enforcement mechanisms and staff . Additionally , a major change in the very purpose of the acts in the 1760s -- that of generating a colonial revenue , rather than only regulating the Empire 's trade -- would help lead to revolutionary events , and major changes in implementation of the acts themselves . The Acts generally prohibited the use of foreign ships , required the employment of English and colonial mariners for three quarters of the crews , including East India Company ships . The acts prohibited the colonies from exporting specific , enumerated , products to countries and colonies other than those British , and mandated that imports be sourced only through Britain . Overall , the Acts formed the basis for English ( and later ) British overseas trade for nearly 200 years , but with the development and gradual acceptance of free trade , the acts were eventually repealed in 1849 . The laws reflected the European economic theory of mercantilism which sought to keep all the benefits of trade inside their respective Empires , and to minimize the loss of gold and silver , or profits , to foreigners through purchases and trade . The system would develop with the colonies supplying raw materials for British industry , and in exchange for this guaranteed market , the colonies would purchase manufactured from or through Britain ."},{"query":"when did england's monarchy lose its power","short_answer":"","abstract":"The monarchy of the United Kingdom , commonly referred to as the British monarchy , is the constitutional monarchy of the United Kingdom , its dependencies and its overseas territories .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord .

Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands .

Mounted police may be employed for specialized duties ranging from patrol of parks and wilderness areas , where police cars would be impractical or noisy , to riot duty , where the horse serves to intimidate those whom it is desired to disperse through its larger size , or may be sent in to detain trouble makers or offenders from the crowd . For example , in the UK , mounted police are most often seen at football matches , although they are also a common sight on the streets of many towns and cities as a visible police presence and crime deterrent during the day and night .

Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year . Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4 -- 9 cm / year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm / year ."},{"query":"all i really want for christmas original version","short_answer":"","abstract":"All I Really Want for Christmas is the third Christmas album by Steven Curtis Chapman , released on September 27 , 2005 .

They were primarily used to demoralize , injure , and kill entrenched defenders , against whom the indiscriminate and generally very slow - moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective . The types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals , such as tear gas , to lethal agents like phosgene , chlorine , and mustard gas . This chemical warfare was a major component of the first global war and first total war of the 20th century .

In the later stages of the war , as the use of gas increased , its overall effectiveness diminished . The widespread use of these agents of chemical warfare , and wartime advances in the composition of high explosives , gave rise to an occasionally expressed view of World War I as \`\` the chemist 's war '' and also the era where weapons of mass destruction were created ."},{"query":"where is atp produced in citric acid cycle","short_answer":"","abstract":"The citric acid cycle ( CAC ) -- also known as the tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle or the Krebs cycle -- is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to release stored energy through the oxidation of acetyl - CoA derived from carbohydrates , fats , and proteins into carbon dioxide and chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) .

These cells serve a variety of functions such as serving as a response to stress , monitoring carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations in the body , maintenance of respiration and the regulation of blood pressure . They are in close proximity to pre-synaptic sympathetic ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system , with which they communicate , and structurally they are similar to post-synaptic sympathetic neurons . In order to activate chromaffin cells , the splanchnic nerve of the sympathetic nervous system releases acetylcholine , which then binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the adrenal medulla . This causes the release of catecholamines . The chromaffin cells release catecholamines : ~ 80 % of Adrenaline ( Epinephrine ) and ~ 20 % of Noradrenaline ( Norepinephrine ) into systemic circulation for systemic effects on multiple organs ( similarly to secretory neurones of the hypothalamus ) , and can also send paracrine signals .

Coronary arteries supply oxygenated blood to the heart muscle , and cardiac veins drain away the blood once it has been deoxygenated . Because the rest of the body , and most especially the brain , needs a steady supply of oxygenated blood that is free of all but the slightest interruptions , the heart works constantly and sometimes works quite hard . Therefore its circulation is of major importance not only to its own tissues but to the entire body and even the level of consciousness of the brain from moment to moment . Interruptions of coronary circulation quickly cause heart attacks ( myocardial infarctions ) , in which the heart muscle is damaged by oxygen starvation . Such interruptions are usually caused by ischemic heart disease ( coronary artery disease ) and sometimes by embolism from other causes ."},{"query":"what happened to the cat in breakfast at tiffany","short_answer":"","abstract":"Orangey , a male marmalade tabby cat , was an animal actor owned and trained by the cinematic animal handler Frank Inn ."},{"query":"who was in the remake of the postman always rings twice","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Postman Always Rings Twice is the fourth film adaptation of the 1934 novel of the same name by James M.
