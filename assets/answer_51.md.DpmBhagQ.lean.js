A thermoconforming organism , by contrast , simply adopts the surrounding temperature as its own body temperature , thus avoiding the need for internal thermoregulation . The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of homeostasis : a state of dynamic stability in an organism 's internal conditions , maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment ( the study of such processes in zoology has been called physiological ecology ) . If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal , a condition known as hyperthermia occurs . For humans , this occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately 55 ° C ( 131 ° F ) , and with prolonged exposure ( longer than a few hours ) at this temperature and up to around 75 ° C ( 167 ° F ) death is almost inevitable . Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is sustained above 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) for six hours . The opposite condition , when body temperature decreases below normal levels , is known as hypothermia . It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction , causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it . Normal body temperature is around 37 ° C ( 99 ° F ) , and hypothermia sets in when the core body temperature gets lower than 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) . Usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures , hypothermia is usually treated by methods that attempt to raise the body temperature back to a normal range ."},{"query":"what us state forms the western boundary of montana","short_answer":"States","abstract":"Montana / mɒnˈtænə / ( listen ) is a state in the northwestern region of the United States .

A central bank uses OMO as the primary means of implementing monetary policy . The usual aim of open market operations is -- aside from supplying commercial banks with liquidity and sometimes taking surplus liquidity from commercial banks -- to manipulate the short - term interest rate and the supply of base money in an economy , and thus indirectly control the total money supply , in effect expanding money or contracting the money supply . This involves meeting the demand of base money at the target interest rate by buying and selling government securities , or other financial instruments .

The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole . The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon . Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it , no locally detectable features appear to be observed . In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body , as it reflects no light . Moreover , quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation , with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass . This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass , making it essentially impossible to observe ."},{"query":"when do the kansas city chiefs play their first game","short_answer":"","abstract":"American Football League ( 1960 -- 1969 )"},{"query":"in the archie comics who does archie end up with","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Archie Marries Veronica / Archie Marries Betty '' is an American comic book story by writer Michael Uslan and artists Stan Goldberg and Bob Smith that was originally presented in Archie # 600 -- 606 .

Proteins are polymers -- specifically polypeptides -- formed from sequences of amino acids , the monomers of the polymer . A single amino acid monomer may also be called a residue indicating a repeating unit of a polymer . Proteins form by amino acids undergoing condensation reactions , in which the amino acids lose one water molecule per reaction in order to attach to one another with a peptide bond . By convention , a chain under 30 amino acids is often identified as a peptide , rather than a protein . To be able to perform their biological function , proteins fold into one or more specific spatial conformations driven by a number of non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding , ionic interactions , Van der Waals forces , and hydrophobic packing . To understand the functions of proteins at a molecular level , it is often necessary to determine their three - dimensional structure . This is the topic of the scientific field of structural biology , which employs techniques such as X-ray crystallography , NMR spectroscopy , and dual polarisation interferometry to determine the structure of proteins ."},{"query":"when is the last time the jaguars won a playoff game","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a list of current National Football League ( NFL ) franchise post-season and Super Bowl droughts ( multiple consecutive seasons of not winning ) .

The method was developed in 1993 by several groups independently . The peptide masses are compared to either a database containing known protein sequences or even the genome . This is achieved by using computer programs that translate the known genome of the organism into proteins , then theoretically cut the proteins into peptides , and calculate the absolute masses of the peptides from each protein . They then compare the masses of the peptides of the unknown protein to the theoretical peptide masses of each protein encoded in the genome . The results are statistically analyzed to find the best match . The advantage of this method is that only the masses of the peptides have to be known . Time - consuming de novo peptide sequencing is then unnecessary . A disadvantage is that the protein sequence has to be present in the database of interest . Additionally most PMF algorithms assume that the peptides come from a single protein . The presence of a mixture can significantly complicate the analysis and potentially compromise the results . Typical for the PMF based protein identification is the requirement for an isolated protein . Mixtures exceeding a number of 2 - 3 proteins typically require the additional use of MS / MS based protein identification to achieve sufficient specificity of identification ( 6 ) . Therefore , the typical PMF samples are isolated proteins from two - dimensional gel electrophoresis ( 2D gels ) or isolated SDS - PAGE bands . Additional analyses by MS / MS can either be direct , e.g. , MALDI - TOF / TOF analysis or downstream nanoLC - ESI - MS / MS analysis of gel spot eluates ."},{"query":"who won last year's grand national 2017","short_answer":"","abstract":"The 2017 Grand National ( officially known as the 2017 Randox Health Grand National for sponsorship reasons ) was the 170th official running of the Grand National horse race at Aintree Racecourse near Liverpool , England .
