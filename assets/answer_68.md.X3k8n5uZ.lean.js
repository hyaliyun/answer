The rule is based on the fact that the valence shells of transition metals consist of nine valence orbitals ( one s orbital , three p orbitals and five d orbitals ) , which collectively can accommodate 18 electrons as either bonding or nonbonding electron pairs . This means that , the combination of these nine atomic orbitals with ligand orbitals creates nine molecular orbitals that are either metal - ligand bonding or non-bonding . When a metal complex has 18 valence electrons , it is said to have achieved the same electron configuration as the noble gas in the period . The rule and its exceptions are similar to the application of the octet rule to main group elements . The rule is not helpful for complexes of metals that are not transition metals , and interesting or useful transition metal complexes will violate the rule because of the consequences deviating from the rule bears on reactivity .

The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole . The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon . Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it , no locally detectable features appear to be observed . In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body , as it reflects no light . Moreover , quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation , with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass . This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass , making it essentially impossible to observe ."},{"query":"when does the new doctor who series start 2018","short_answer":"October","abstract":"The eleventh series of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who is set to premiere in October 2018 , and will consist of ten episodes .

At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action . The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era .

Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support . South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union . The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea 's request for weapons and troops .

The defining characteristic of \`\` common law '' is that it arises as precedent . In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is , a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts , and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts . If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past , the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision ( a principle known as stare decisis ) . If , however , the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases ( called a \`\` matter of first impression '' ) , and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question , judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue ( one party or the other has to win , and on disagreements of law , judges make that decision ) . The court states an opinion that gives reasons for the decision , and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as precedent to bind future judges and litigants . Common law , as the body of law made by judges , stands in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process , and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch ( the interactions are explained later in this article ) .

During the forced molt , the birds cease producing eggs for at least two weeks , which allows the bird 's reproductive tracts to regress and rejuvenate . After the molt , the hen 's egg production rate usually peaks slightly lower than the previous peak , but egg quality is improved . The purpose of forced molting is therefore to increase egg production , egg quality , and profitability of flocks in their second or subsequent laying phases , by not allowing the hen 's body the necessary time to rejuvenate during the natural cycle of feather replenishment ."},{"query":"what's the relevance of applying control in communication","short_answer":"","abstract":"In telecommunication , control communications is the branch of technology devoted to the design , development , and application of communications facilities used specifically for control purposes , such as for controlling ( a ) industrial processes , ( b ) movement of resources , ( c ) electric power generation , distribution , and utilization , ( d ) communications networks , and ( e ) transportation systems ."},{"query":"when does the new season of gravity falls come on","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"who took over leeds and holbeck building society","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Leeds Permanent Building Society was a building society founded in Leeds , England in 1846 and was commonly known in a shortened form as The Leeds .

A thermoconforming organism , by contrast , simply adopts the surrounding temperature as its own body temperature , thus avoiding the need for internal thermoregulation . The internal thermoreegulation process is one aspect of homeostasis : a state of dynamic stability in an organism 's internal conditions , maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment ( the study of such processes in zoology has been called physiological ecology ) . If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal , a condition known as hyperthermia occurs . For humans , this occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately 55 ° C ( 131 ° F ) , and with prolonged exposure ( longer than a few hours ) at this temperature and up to around 75 ° C ( 167 ° F ) death is almost inevitable . Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is sustained above 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) for six hours . The opposite condition , when body temperature decreases below normal levels , is known as hypothermia . It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction , causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it . Normal body temperature is around 37 ° C ( 99 ° F ) , and hypothermia sets in when the core body temperature gets lower than 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) . Usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures , hypothermia is usually treated by methods that attempt to raise the body temperature back to a normal range ."},{"query":"documents written by the uk department for transport","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Department for Transport ( DfT ) is the government department responsible for the English transport network and a limited number of transport matters in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland that have not been devolved .

They form the building blocks of the DNA double helix , and contribute to the folded structure of both DNA and RNA . Dictated by specific hydrogen bonding patterns , Watson - Crick base pairs ( guanine - cytosine and adenine - thymine ) allow the DNA helix to maintain a regular helical structure that is subtly dependent on its nucleotide sequence . The complementary nature of this based - paired structure provides a backup copy of all genetic information encoded within double - stranded DNA . The regular structure and data redundancy provided by the DNA double helix make DNA well suited to the storage of genetic information , while base - pairing between DNA and incoming nucleotides provides the mechanism through which DNA polymerase replicates DNA , and RNA polymerase transcribes DNA into RNA .

Babbling begins shortly after birth and progresses through several stages as the infant 's repertoire of sounds expands and vocalizations become more speech - like . Infants typically begin to produce recognizable words when they are around 12 months of age , though babbling may continue for some time afterward .

Abnormal developments such as certain medical conditions , developmental delays , and hearing impairments may interfere with a child 's ability to babble normally .

It has moderately long floppy ears set high on the head . Its muzzle is long , broad , and strong , allowing it to retrieve even heavy game .

The docked tail should not be too long or too short but should balance the appearance of the head and body . The GSP tail is carried at a jaunty angle , not curled under . When the GSP is in classic point stance , the tail should be held straight out from the body , forming a line with the pointing head and body . Like all German pointers , GSPs have webbed feet .

They are far lighter and thinner than traditional cathode ray tube ( CRT ) television sets and video displays and are usually less than 10 centimetres ( 3.9 in ) thick . Flat - panel displays can be divided into two display device categories : volatile and static . Volatile displays require that pixels be periodically electronically refreshed to retain their state ( e.g. , liquid - crystal displays ( LCD ) ) . A volatile display only shows an image when it has battery or AC mains power .

As of 2016 , flat - panel displays have almost completely replaced old CRT displays . In many 2010 - era applications , specifically small portable devices such as laptops , mobile phones , smartphones , digital cameras , camcorders , point - and - shoot cameras , and pocket video cameras , any display disadvantages of flat - panels ( as compared with CRTs ) are made up for by portability advantages ( thinness and lightweightness ) ."},{"query":"who is the owner of infinix and tecno phone","short_answer":"","abstract":"Tecno Mobile is a Chinese mobile phone manufacturer which is based in Hong Kong .

In 285 , the emperor Diocletian ( r . 284 -- 305 ) partitioned the Roman Empire 's administration into eastern and western halves . Between 324 and 330 , Constantine I ( r . 306 -- 337 ) transferred the main capital from Rome to Byzantium , later known as Constantinople ( \`\` City of Constantine '' ) and Nova Roma ( \`\` New Rome '' ) . Under Theodosius I ( r . 379 -- 395 ) , Christianity became the Empire 's official state religion and others such as Roman polytheism were proscribed . And finally , under the reign of Heraclius ( r . 610 -- 641 ) , the Empire 's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use instead of Latin . Thus , although it continued the Roman state and maintained Roman state traditions , modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture , and characterised by Orthodox Christianity rather than Roman polytheism ."},{"query":"where is bauxite found in the united states","short_answer":"","abstract":"Bauxite mining in the United States produced an estimated 128,000 metric tonnes of bauxite in 2013 .

Similarly , it is not possible to see any object without light hitting the object , and causing it to reflect that light .

It occurs in several fisheries worldwide , such as in the Florida stone crab ( Menippe mercenaria ) fishery , the north - east Atlantic deep - water red crab ( Chaceon affinis ) fishery and in southern Iberia , where the major claws of the fiddler crab Uca tangeri are harvested .
