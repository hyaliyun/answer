They are often used to represent the magnitude of a loss or deficiency . A debt that is owed may be thought of as a negative asset , a decrease in some quantity may be thought of as a negative increase . If a quantity may have either of two opposite senses , then one may choose to distinguish between those senses -- perhaps arbitrarily -- as positive and negative . In the medical context of fighting a tumor , an expansion could be thought of as a negative shrinkage . Negative numbers are used to describe values on a scale that goes below zero , such as the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales for temperature . The laws of arithmetic for negative numbers ensure that the common sense idea of an opposite is reflected in arithmetic .

The measure of the amount of acidity in wine is known as the \`\` titratable acidity '' or \`\` total acidity '' , which refers to the test that yields the total of all acids present , while strength of acidity is measured according to pH , with most wines having a pH between 2.9 and 3.9 . Generally , the lower the pH , the higher the acidity in the wine . However , there is no direct connection between total acidity and pH ( it is possible to find wines with a high pH for wine and high acidity ) .

Three primary acids are found in wine grapes : tartaric , malic and citric acids .

They are produced in pairs with a gap between them that forms a stomatal pore . The stomatal pores are largest when water is freely available and the guard cells turgid , and closed when water availability is critically low and the guard cells become flaccid . Photosynthesis depends on the diffusion of carbon dioxide ( CO ) from the air through the stomata into the mesophyll tissues . Oxygen ( O ) , produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis , exits the plant via the stomata . When the stomata are open , water is lost by evaporation and must be replaced via the transpiration stream , with water taken up by the roots .

To prevent hyperglycemia and noticeable organ damage over time , the body produces insulin when glucose starts to be released into the bloodstream from the digestion of carbohydrates ( primarily ) in the diet . Under normal conditions of insulin reactivity , this insulin response triggers glucose being taken into body cells , to be used for energy , and inhibits the body from using fat for energy , thereby causing the concentration of glucose in the blood to decrease as a result , staying within the normal range even when a large amount of carbohydrates is consumed . A habitually high intake of carbohydrates , simple sugars , and particularly fructose , e.g. with sweetened beverages , contributes to insulin resistance and has been linked to weight gain and obesity . If high and excess blood sugar from the digestion of primarily carbohydrates in the diet is not sufficiently absorbed by cells even in the presence of insulin , the increase in the level of blood sugar can result in the classic hyperglycemic triad of polyphagia ( increased appetite ) , polydipsia ( increased thirst ) , and polyuria ( increased urination ) . Avoiding carbohydrates and sugars , a no - carbohydrate diet or fasting can reverse insulin resistance ."},{"query":"where was the first model of the cotton gin made","short_answer":"","abstract":"A cotton gin is a machine that quickly and easily separates cotton fibers from their seeds , allowing for much greater productivity than manual cotton separation .

It has the highest concentration of organic matter and microorganisms and is where most of the Earth 's biological soil activity occurs . Four elements constitute the composition of soil .

The strength of soil structure decreases with the presence of organic matter , creating weak bearing capacities .

According to this model , there is a lipid bilayer in which the protein molecules are embedded . The lipid bilayer gives fluidity and elasticity to the membrane . Small amounts of carbohydrates are also found in cell membrane . The model , which was devised by SJ Singer and GL Nicolson in 1972 , describes the cell membrane as a two - dimensional liquid that restricts the lateral diffusion of membrane components . Such domains are defined by the existence of regions within the membrane with special lipid and protein composition that promote the formation of lipid rafts or protein and glycoprotein complexes . Another way to define membrane domains is the association of the lipid membrane with the cytoskeleton filaments and the extracellular matrix through membrane proteins . The current model describes important features relevant to many cellular processes , including : cell - cell signaling , apoptosis , cell division , membrane budding , and cell fusion .

They were primarily used to demoralize , injure , and kill entrenched defenders , against whom the indiscriminate and generally very slow - moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective . The types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals , such as tear gas , to lethal agents like phosgene , chlorine , and mustard gas . This chemical warfare was a major component of the first global war and first total war of the 20th century . The killing capacity of gas was limited , with about ninety thousand fatalities from a total of some 1.3 million casualties caused by gas attacks . Gas was unlike most other weapons of the period because it was possible to develop countermeasures , such as gas masks . In the later stages of the war , as the use of gas increased , its overall effectiveness diminished . The widespread use of these agents of chemical warfare , and wartime advances in the composition of high explosives , gave rise to an occasionally expressed view of World War I as \`\` the chemist 's war '' and also the era where weapons of mass destruction were created ."},{"query":"which two ions move in and out of a neuron during an action potential","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"number of vertices of odd degree in a graph","short_answer":"","abstract":"In graph theory , a branch of mathematics , the handshaking lemma is the statement that every finite undirected graph has an even number of vertices with odd degree ( the number of edges touching the vertex ) .

Named after the 1950s United States working - class youth subculture known as greasers , the musical is set in 1959 at fictional Rydell High School ( based on William Howard Taft School in Chicago , Illinois ) and follows ten working - class teenagers as they navigate the complexities of peer pressure , politics , personal core values , and love . The score borrows heavily from the sounds of early rock and roll . In its original production in Chicago , Grease was a raunchy , raw , aggressive , vulgar show . Subsequent productions sanitized it and tamed it down . The show mentions social issues such as teenage pregnancy , peer pressure and gang violence ; its themes include love , friendship , teenage rebellion , sexual exploration during adolescence , and , to some extent , class consciousness / class conflict . Jacobs described the show 's basic plot as a subversion of common tropes of 1950s cinema , since the female lead , who in many 1950s films transformed the alpha male into a more sensitive and sympathetic character , is instead drawn into the man 's influence and transforms into his fantasy ."},{"query":"where was the movie the cure for wellness filmed","short_answer":"","abstract":"A Cure for Wellness is a 2016 science fiction psychological horror thriller film directed by Gore Verbinski and written by Justin Haythe .

The U.S. involvement in South Vietnam stemmed from 20 long years of political and economic action . These had the common incentive of ending the growing communist domination in Vietnam . At the time , French forces , allies of the U.S. , were backed by America -- President Harry S. Truman provided progressively increasing amounts of financial and military assistance to French forces fighting in Vietnam . From the spring of 1950 , their involvement increased from just assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states ( Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia ) . Eventually , U.S. missions was carried out at a more constant rate by sending out increasing number of military assistance from the United States . Their main intent was to restrict the Communist domination that was present in the government of Vietnam as it would soon lead to a chain of neighbouring countries adopting the same . This would have resulted in a change in balance of power throughout Southeast Asia . Essentially , the U.S. saw their major security interests being disturbed due to the rise of the communist expansion and strived to take any measure to end it . Estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000 to 3,812,000 .

She co-founded , with Ellen Gates Starr , an early settlement house in the United States , Chicago 's Hull House that would later become known as one of the most famous settlement houses in America . In an era when presidents such as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson identified themselves as reformers and social activists , Addams was one of the most prominent reformers of the Progressive Era . She helped America address and focus on issues that were of concern to mothers , such as the needs of children , local public health , and world peace . In her essay \`\` Utilization of Women in City Government , '' Jane Addams noted the connection between the workings of government and the household , stating that many departments of government , such as sanitation and the schooling of children , could be traced back to traditional women 's roles in the private sphere . Thus , these were matters of which women would have more knowledge than men , so women needed the vote to best voice their opinions . She said that if women were to be responsible for cleaning up their communities and making them better places to live , they needed to be able to vote to do so effectively . Addams became a role model for middle - class women who volunteered to uplift their communities . She is increasingly being recognized as a member of the American pragmatist school of philosophy , and is known by many as the first woman \`\` public philosopher in the history of the United States . In 1889 she co-founded Hull House , and in 1920 she was a co-founder for the ACLU .

Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist . Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of 10 kilometres ( 6.2 mi ) , they can have masses of about twice that of the Sun . They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star , combined with gravitational collapse , that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei . Once formed , they no longer actively generate heat , and cool over time ; however , they may still evolve further through collision or accretion . Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons ( subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons ) ; the electrons and protons present in normal matter combine to produce neutrons at the conditions in a neutron star . Neutron stars are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure , a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle , just as white dwarfs are supported against collapse by electron degeneracy pressure . If the remnant star has a mass greater than about 3 solar masses , it continues collapsing to form a black hole ."},{"query":"what purpose do villi serve in the small intestine","short_answer":"increase the internal surface area of the intestinal walls","abstract":"Intestinal villi ( singular : villus ) are small , finger - like projections that extend into the lumen of the small intestine .

The theory , developed as a result of Enlightenment rationalism , is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will ; an action can only be good if its maxim -- the principle behind it -- is duty to the moral law . Central to Kant 's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative , which acts on all people , regardless of their interests or desires . Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways . His principle of universalizability requires that , for an action to be permissible , it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring . If a contradiction occurs the act violates Aristotle 's \`\` Non-contradiction '' concept which states that just actions can not lead to contradictions . Kant 's formulation of humanity , the second section of the Categorical Imperative , states that as an end in itself humans are required never to treat others merely as a means to an end , but always , additionally , as ends in themselves . The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will , while Kant 's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom . Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties . A perfect duty , such as the duty not to lie , always holds true ; an imperfect duty , such as the duty to give to charity , can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place ."},{"query":"crystal gayle it feels just like we never said goodbye","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"where does the last name cheek come from","short_answer":"Anglo - Saxon England that predates the Norman invasion","abstract":"Cheek is an old family surname from Anglo - Saxon England that predates the Norman invasion .

To prevent hyperglycemia and noticeable organ damage over time , the body produces insulin when glucose starts to be released into the bloodstream from the digestion of carbohydrates ( primarily ) in the diet . Under normal conditions of insulin reactivity , this insulin response triggers glucose being taken into body cells , to be used for energy , and inhibits the body from using fat for energy , thereby causing the concentration of glucose in the blood to decrease as a result , staying within the normal range even when a large amount of carbohydrates is consumed . A habitually high intake of carbohydrates , simple sugars , and particularly fructose , e.g. with sweetened beverages , contributes to insulin resistance and has been linked to weight gain and obesity . If high and excess blood sugar from the digestion of primarily carbohydrates in the diet is not sufficiently absorbed by cells even in the presence of insulin , the increase in the level of blood sugar can result in the classic hyperglycemic triad of polyphagia ( increased appetite ) , polydipsia ( increased thirst ) , and polyuria ( increased urination ) . Avoiding carbohydrates and sugars , a no - carbohydrate diet or fasting can reverse insulin resistance ."},{"query":"who was heading indian army in bangladesh in 1971","short_answer":"Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw","abstract":"Western Front :"},{"query":"what episode do michael and holly get married","short_answer":"","abstract":"Hollis \`\` Holly '' Partridge Scott ( née Flax ) is a fictional character from the US television series The Office played by Amy Ryan .

Fatty acids are a family of molecules classified within the lipid macronutrient class . One role of fatty acids in animal metabolism is energy production , captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . When compared to other macronutrient classes ( carbohydrates and protein ) , fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis , when they are completely oxidized to CO and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle . Fatty acids ( mainly in the form of triglycerides ) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals , and to a lesser extent in plants . In addition , fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed ( the cell wall , and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells , such as the nucleus , the mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , and the Golgi apparatus ) . Fatty acids can also be cleaved , or partially cleaved , from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell , and local hormones in the immediate vicinity of the cell . The prostaglandins made from arachidonic acid stored in the cell membrane , are probably the most well known group of these local hormones ."},{"query":"what is the record for wins in major league baseball","short_answer":"116","abstract":"Listed below are the Major League Baseball teams with the best season win - loss records in history , as determined by winning percentage (. 700 or better ) , minimum 120 games played ."},{"query":"what's the biggest stadium in the us","short_answer":"","abstract":"The following is a list of stadiums in the United States .
