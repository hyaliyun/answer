For instance , chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy when a stick of dynamite explodes . If one adds up all the chemical energy that is expended in the explosion , one will get the exact amount of kinetic energy that is generated .

The name is needed because there are operations , such as division and subtraction , that do not have it ( for example , \`\` 3 − 5 ≠ 5 − 3 '' ) ; such operations are not commutative , and so are referred to as noncommutative operations .

Management by objectives is the process of defining specific objectives within an organization that management can convey to organization members , then deciding on how to achieve each objective in sequence . This process allows managers to take work that needs to be done one step at a time to allow for a calm , yet productive work environment . This process also helps organization members to see their accomplishments as they achieve each objective , which reinforces a positive work environment and a sense of achievement . An important part of MBO is the measurement and comparison of an employee 's actual performance with the standards set . Ideally , when employees themselves have been involved with the goal - setting and choosing the course of action to be followed by them , they are more likely to fulfill their responsibilities . According to George S. Odiorne , the system of management by objectives can be described as a process whereby the superior and subordinate jointly identify common goals , define each individual 's major areas of responsibility in terms of the results expected of him or her , and use these measures as guides for operating the unit and assessing the contribution of each of its members ."},{"query":"where are the kjolen mountains located on a map","short_answer":"border region of Norway and Sweden","abstract":"The Scandinavian Mountains or the Scandes is a mountain range that runs through the Scandinavian Peninsula .

It is one of the core concepts of management leadership . However , the person who delegated the work remains accountable for the outcome of the delegated work .

Delegation , if properly done , is not abdication . The opposite of effective delegation is micromanagement , where a manager provides too much input , direction , and review of delegated work . In general , delegation is good and can save money and time , help in building skills , and motivate people . On the other hand , poor delegation might cause frustration and confusion to all the involved parties .

In 1945 , the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north . At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action . The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era . Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country ; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea . Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system . Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support . South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union . The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea 's request for weapons and troops . North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested . This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea .

Formally , a wider study includes water falling as ice crystals , i.e. hail , sleet , snow ( parts of the hydrological cycle known as precipitation ) . The aim of rainfall climatology is to measure , understand and predict rain distribution across different regions of planet Earth , a factor of air pressure , humidity , topography , cloud type and raindrop size , via direct measurement and remote sensing data acquisition . Current technologies accurately predict rainfall 3 -- 4 days in advance using numerical weather prediction . Geostationary orbiting satellites gather IR and visual wavelength data to measure realtime localised rainfall by estimating cloud albedo , water content , and the corresponding probability of rain . Geographic distribution of rain is largely governed by climate type , topography and habitat humidity . In mountainous areas , heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation . On the leeward side of mountains , desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by compressional heating . The movement of the monsoon trough , or intertropical convergence zone , brings rainy seasons to savannah climes . The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall , both in amounts and intensity , downwind of cities . Global warming may also cause changes in the precipitation pattern globally , including wetter conditions at high latitudes and in some wet tropical areas , and drier conditions in parts of the subtropics and middle latitudes . Precipitation is a major component of the water cycle , and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the planet . Approximately 505,000 cubic kilometres ( 121,000 cu mi ) of water falls as precipitation each year ; 398,000 cubic kilometres ( 95,000 cu mi ) of it over the oceans . Given the Earth 's surface area , that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is 990 millimetres ( 39 in ) . Climate classification systems such as the Köppen climate classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes ."},{"query":"who is boxer in animal farm based on","short_answer":"","abstract":"Boxer is described as a hardworking , but naive and ignorant horse in George Orwell 's Animal Farm .

The membrane potential alters the conformation of the channel proteins , regulating their opening and closing . Cell membranes are generally impermeable to ions , thus they must diffuse through the membrane through transmembrane protein channels . They have a crucial role in excitable cells such as neuronal and muscle tissues , allowing a rapid and co-ordinated depolarization in response to triggering voltage change . Found along the axon and at the synapse , voltage - gated ion channels directionally propagate electrical signals .

During the engine 's first decade of production , when overhead - valve engines were rare , it was usually known simply as the Ford V ‐ 8 , and the first car model in which it was installed , the Model 18 , was ( and still is ) often called simply the \`\` Ford V ‐ 8 '' , after its new engine . Although the V8 configuration was not new when the Ford V8 was introduced in 1932 , the latter was a market first in the respect that it made an 8 - cylinder affordable and a V engine affordable to the emerging mass market consumer for the first time . It was the first independently designed and built V8 engine produced by Ford for mass production , and it ranks as one of the company 's most important developments . A fascination with ever - more - powerful engines was perhaps the most salient aspect of the American car and truck market for a half century , from 1923 until 1973 . The Ford flathead V8 was perfectly in tune with the cultural moment of its introduction , leading the way into a future of which the Ford company was a principal architect . Thus it became a phenomenal success . The engine design , with various changes but no major ones , was installed in Ford passenger cars and trucks until 1953 , making the engine 's 21 - year production run for the U.S. consumer market longer than the 19 - year run of the Ford Model T engine for that market . The engine was on Ward 's list of the 10 best engines of the 20th century .

The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen , called an antigen , via the Fab 's variable region . Each tip of the \`\` Y '' of an antibody contains a paratope ( analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( similarly analogous to a key ) on an antigen , allowing these two structures to bind together with precision . Using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival ) . Depending on the antigen , the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activate macrophages to destroy the foreign substance . The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its Fc region ( located at the base of the \`\` Y '' ) , which contains a conserved glycosylation site involved in these interactions . The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system ."},{"query":"when is this is us on in australia","short_answer":"","abstract":"Australia -- United States relations are the international relations between the Commonwealth of Australia and the United States of America .

For example , if , in response to a 10 % increase in the price of fuel , the demand for new cars that are fuel inefficient decreased by 20 % , the cross elasticity of demand would be : cross body − 20 % 10 % = − 2 ( \\\\ displaystyle ( \\\\ frac ( - 20 \\\\ % ) ( 10 \\\\ % ) ) = - 2 ) . A negative cross elasticity denotes two products that are complements , while a positive cross elasticity denotes two substitute products .

Therefore , if the price of product B decreases , the demand curve for product A shifts to the right reflecting an increase in A 's demand , resulting in a negative value for the cross elasticity of demand . The exact opposite reasoning holds for substitutes ."},{"query":"when did the philadelphia athletics become the phillies","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Oakland Athletics , a current Major League Baseball franchise , originated in Philadelphia .

Typically , such lamps use a noble gas ( argon , neon , krypton , and xenon ) or a mixture of these gases . Some include additional substances , like mercury , sodium , and metal halides , which are vaporized during startup to become part of the gas mixture . In operation , some of the electrons are forced to leave the atoms of the gas near the anode by the electric field applied between the two electrodes , leaving these atoms positively ionized . The free electrons thus released flowing onto the anode , while the cations thus formed are accelerated by the electric field and flow towards the cathode . Typically , after traveling a very short distance , the ions collide with neutral gas atoms , which transfer their electrons to the ions . The atoms , having lost an electron during the collisions , ionize and speed toward the cathode while the ions , having gained an electron during the collisions , return to a lower energy state while releasing energy in the form of photons . Light of a characteristic frequency is thus emitted . In this way , electrons are relayed through the gas from the cathode to the anode . The color of the light produced depends on the emission spectra of the atoms making up the gas , as well as the pressure of the gas , current density , and other variables . Gas discharge lamps can produce a wide range of colors . Some lamps produce ultraviolet radiation which is converted to visible light by a fluorescent coating on the inside of the lamp 's glass surface . The fluorescent lamp is perhaps the best known gas - discharge lamp ."},{"query":"nicky ricky dicky and dawn ages in real life","short_answer":"","abstract":"Nicky , Ricky , Dicky & Dawn is an American comedy television series developed by Michael Feldman and created by Matt Fleckenstein that premiered on Nickelodeon on September 13 , 2014 .

Thermohaline circulation of the world 's oceans involves the flow of warm surface waters from the southern hemisphere into the North Atlantic . Water flowing northward becomes modified through evaporation and mixing with other water masses , leading to increased salinity . When this water reaches the North Atlantic it cools and sinks through convection , due to its decreased temperature and increased salinity resulting in increased density . NADW is the outflow of this thick deep layer , which can be detected by its high salinity , high oxygen content , nutrient minima , high C / C , and chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) . CFCs are anthropogenic substances that enter the surface of the ocean from gas exchange with the atmosphere . This distinct composition allows its path to be traced as it mixes with Circumpolar Deep Water ( CDW ) , which in turn fills the deep Indian Ocean and part of the South Pacific . NADW and its formation is essential to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation ( AMOC ) , which is responsible for transporting large amounts of water , heat , salt , carbon , nutrients and other substances from the Tropical Atlantic to the Mid and High Latitude Atlantic . In the conveyor belt model of thermohaline circulation of the world 's oceans , the sinking of NADW pulls the waters of the North Atlantic drift northward ; however , this is almost certainly an oversimplification of the actual relationship between NADW formation and the strength of the Gulf Stream / North Atlantic drift ."},{"query":"who was punished for the my lai massacre","short_answer":"William Laws Calley Jr.","abstract":"Vietnam War"},{"query":"who is the first person to reach the top of mount everest","short_answer":"Sir Edmund Percival \`\` Ed '' Hillary|Tenzing Norgay","abstract":"Sir Edmund Percival \`\` Ed '' Hillary KG ONZ KBE ( 20 July 1919 -- 11 January 2008 ) was a New Zealand mountaineer , explorer , and philanthropist .

The work covers the history , from 98 to 1590 , of the Roman Empire , the history of early Christianity and then of the Roman State Church , and the history of Europe , and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire in the East and West .

They are far lighter and thinner than traditional cathode ray tube ( CRT ) television sets and video displays and are usually less than 10 centimetres ( 3.9 in ) thick . Flat - panel displays can be divided into two display device categories : volatile and static . Volatile displays require that pixels be periodically electronically refreshed to retain their state ( e.g. , liquid - crystal displays ( LCD ) ) . A volatile display only shows an image when it has battery or AC mains power . Static flat - panel displays rely on materials whose color states are bistable ( e.g. , e-book reader tablets from Sony ) , and as such , flat - panel displays retain the text or images on the screen even when the power is off . As of 2016 , flat - panel displays have almost completely replaced old CRT displays . In many 2010 - era applications , specifically small portable devices such as laptops , mobile phones , smartphones , digital cameras , camcorders , point - and - shoot cameras , and pocket video cameras , any display disadvantages of flat - panels ( as compared with CRTs ) are made up for by portability advantages ( thinness and lightweightness ) ."},{"query":"when did china change the one child policy","short_answer":"","abstract":"The one - child policy , a part of the family planning policy , was a population planning policy of China .

They were primarily used to demoralize , injure , and kill entrenched defenders , against whom the indiscriminate and generally very slow - moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective . The types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals , such as tear gas , to lethal agents like phosgene , chlorine , and mustard gas . This chemical warfare was a major component of the first global war and first total war of the 20th century . The killing capacity of gas was limited , with only about ninety thousand fatalities from a total of some 1.3 million casualties caused by gas attacks . Gas was unlike most other weapons of the period because it was possible to develop effective countermeasures , such as gas masks . In the later stages of the war , as the use of gas increased , its overall effectiveness diminished . The widespread use of these agents of chemical warfare , and wartime advances in the composition of high explosives , gave rise to an occasionally expressed view of World War I as \`\` the chemist 's war '' and also the era where \`\` weapons of mass destruction '' were created ."},{"query":"when does the 2nd season of the ranch come out","short_answer":"June 16 , 2017","abstract":"The Ranch is an American comedy web television series starring Ashton Kutcher , Danny Masterson , Debra Winger , Elisha Cuthbert , and Sam Elliott that debuted in 2016 on Netflix .

Ernest Hogan ( 1865 -- 1909 ) was a pioneer of ragtime and was the first composer to have his ragtime pieces ( or \`\` rags '' ) published as sheet music , beginning with the song \`\` LA Pas Ma LA , '' published in 1895 .

Ragtime composer Scott Joplin ( ca . 1868 -- 1917 ) became famous through the publication of the \`\` Maple Leaf Rag '' ( 1899 ) and a string of ragtime hits such as \`\` The Entertainer '' ( 1902 ) , although he was later forgotten by all but a small , dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s .

Fatty acids are a family of molecules classified within the lipid macronutrient class . One role of fatty acids in animal metabolism is energy production , captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . When compared to other macronutrient classes ( carbohydrates and protein ) , fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis , when they are completely oxidized to CO and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle . Fatty acids ( mainly in the form of triglycerides ) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals , and to a lesser extent in plants . In addition , fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed ( the cell wall , and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells , such as the nucleus , the mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , and the Golgi apparatus ) . Fatty acids can also be cleaved , or partially cleaved , from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell , and local hormones in the immediate vicinity of the cell .
