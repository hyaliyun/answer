Fatty acids are a family of molecules classified within the lipid macronutrient class . One role of fatty acids in animal metabolism is energy production , captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . When compared to other macronutrient classes ( carbohydrates and protein ) , fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis , when they are completely oxidized to CO and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle . Fatty acids ( mainly in the form of triglycerides ) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals , and to a lesser extent in plants . In addition , fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed ( the cell wall , and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells , such as the nucleus , the mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , and the Golgi apparatus ) . Fatty acids can also be cleaved , or partially cleaved , from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell , and local hormones in the immediate vicinity of the cell . The prostaglandins made from arachidonic acid stored in the cell membrane , are probably the most well known group of these local hormones ."},{"query":"where is berlin on the map of europe","short_answer":"","abstract":"Berlin ( / bɜːrˈlɪn , ˌbɜːr - / , German : ( bɛɐ̯ˈliːn ) ( listen ) ) is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its 16 constituent states .

The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurised fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system . The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined set pressure to protect pressure vessels and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits . When the set pressure is exceeded , the relief valve becomes the \`\` path of least resistance '' as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route . The diverted fluid ( liquid , gas or liquid -- gas mixture ) is usually routed through a piping system known as a flare header or relief header to a central , elevated gas flare where it is usually burned and the resulting combustion gases are released to the atmosphere . As the fluid is diverted , the pressure inside the vessel will stop rising . Once it reaches the valve 's reseating pressure , the valve will close . The blowdown is usually stated as a percentage of set pressure and refers to how much the pressure needs to drop before the valve reseats . The blowdown can vary from roughly 2 -- 20 % , and some valves have adjustable blowdowns ."},{"query":"when does power rangers super ninja steel return","short_answer":"August 25","abstract":"Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel is an American television series created by Haim Saban and Toei Company .

Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the \`\` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the façade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power princeps senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the princeps . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire ."},{"query":"who has more championship rings than michael jordan","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a list of NBA players with most championships won as a player .

A simple example of what a runner would do during a fartlek run is \`\` sprint all out from one light pole to the next , jog to the corner , give a medium effort for a couple of blocks , jog between four light poles and sprint to a stop sign , and so on , for a set total time or distance . '' The variable intensity and continuous nature of the exercise places stress on both the aerobic and anaerobic systems . It differs from traditional interval training in that it is unstructured ; intensity and / or speed varies , as the athlete wishes . Fartlek training is generally associated with running , but can include almost any kind of exercise ."},{"query":"shahrukh khan and saif ali khan movie list","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"who are the characters of diary of a wimpy kid","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a list of characters in Jeff Kinney 's book series Diary of a Wimpy Kid as well as the film versions of the first , second , and third book .

Normally , coral polyps live in an endosymbiotic relationship with the algae and that relationship is crucial for the coral and hence for the health of the whole reef .

After bleaching , some corals may recover , while some die . Above - average sea water temperatures caused by global warming have been identified as a leading cause for coral bleaching worldwide . Between 2014 and 2016 , the longest global bleaching events ever were recorded .

The concept of the common good differs significantly among philosophical doctrines . Early conceptions of the common good were set out by Ancient Greek philosophers , including Aristotle and Plato . One understanding of the common good rooted in Aristotle 's philosophy remains in common usage today , referring to what one contemporary scholar calls the \`\` good proper to , and attainable only by , the community , yet individually shared by its members . '' The concept of common good developed through the work of political theorists , moral philosophers , and public economists , including Thomas Aquinas , Niccolò Machiavelli , John Locke , Jean - Jacques Rousseau , James Madison , Adam Smith , Karl Marx , John Stuart Mill , John Rawls , and many other thinkers . In contemporary economic theory , a common good is any good which is rivalrous yet non-excludable , while the common good , by contrast , arises in the subfield of welfare economics and refers to the outcome of a social welfare function . Such a social welfare function , in turn , would be rooted in a moral theory of the good ( such as utilitarianism ) . Social choice theory aims to understand processes by which the common good may or may not be realized in societies through the study of collective decision rules . And public choice theory applies microeconomic methodology to the study of political science in order to explain how private interests affect political activities and outcomes ."},{"query":"when do cells differentiate during the development of a fetus","short_answer":"","abstract":"Human embryogenesis is the process of cell division and cellular differentiation of the embryo that occurs during the early stages of development .

The sample is placed in a magnetic field and the NMR signal is produced by excitation of the nuclei sample with radio waves into nuclear magnetic resonance , which is detected with sensitive radio receivers . The intramolecular magnetic field around an atom in a molecule changes the resonance frequency , thus giving access to details of the electronic structure of a molecule and its individual functional groups . As the fields are unique or highly characteristic to individual compounds , in modern organic chemistry practice , NMR spectroscopy is the definitive method to identify monomolecular organic compounds . Similarly , biochemists use NMR to identify proteins and other complex molecules . Besides identification , NMR spectroscopy provides detailed information about the structure , dynamics , reaction state , and chemical environment of molecules . The most common types of NMR are proton and carbon - 13 NMR spectroscopy , but it is applicable to any kind of sample that contains nuclei possessing spin ."},{"query":"when does the worst case of quick sort occur","short_answer":"","abstract":"Quicksort ( sometimes called partition - exchange sort ) is an efficient sorting algorithm , serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order .

It is also less commonly known as a balanced parliament or a legislature under no overall control . If the legislature is bicameral , and the government is responsible only to the lower house , then \`\` hung parliament '' is used only with respect to that chamber . It is the objective of parliamentary systems for the parliament to be able to form a stable government , preferably one that lasts until the next election . This requires the government to be able to muster up sufficient votes in parliament to pass important legislation , especially the government 's budget . It also needs sufficient votes to defeat votes of no - confidence in the government . If the state of the parliament is such that a majority government can not be formed , the government may be referred to as a \`\` minority government '' . The term hung parliament is used mainly in systems with two parties or two party blocs . Most general elections in such a system will result in one or other party having an absolute majority and thus quickly forming a new government ; a \`\` hung parliament '' is an exception to this pattern , and may by some be considered anomalous or undesirable , and by others ideal as it blocks the dangers of absolute power . One or both main parties may seek to form a coalition government with smaller third parties , or a minority government relying on confidence and supply support from third parties or independents .

A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T and T , enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre . The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine ( T ) , which has a longer half - life than T. In humans , the ratio of T to T released into the blood is sometimes claimed to be quite high , but thyroid removal patient data suggests it to vary between 4 : 1 to 2 : 1 , the average being 100 : 36 ( roughly 2.8 : 1 ) . T is converted to the active T ( three to four times more potent than T ) within cells by deiodinases ( 5 ' - iodinase ) . These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine ( T a ) and thyronamine ( T a ) .

Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history . In the short - term , France lost thousands of her countrymen in the form of émigrés , or emigrants who wished to escape political tensions and save their lives . A number of individuals settled in the neighboring countries ( chiefly Great Britain , Germany , Austria , and Prussia ) , however quite a few also went to the United States . The displacement of these Frenchmen led to a spread of French culture , policies regulating immigration , and a safe haven for Royalists and other counterrevolutionaries to outlast the violence of the French Revolution . The long - term impact on France was profound , shaping politics , society , religion and ideas , and polarizing politics for more than a century . The closer other countries were , the greater and deeper was the French impact , bringing liberalism and the end of many feudal or traditional laws and practices . However , there was also a conservative counter-reaction that defeated Napoleon , reinstalled the Bourbon kings , and in some ways reversed the new reforms ."},{"query":"which german company built the first aircraft to fly under turbojet power","short_answer":"Heinkel","abstract":"The Heinkel He 178 was the world 's first aircraft to fly under turbojet power , and the first practical jet aircraft .

Formally , a wider study includes water falling as ice crystals , i.e. hail , sleet , snow ( parts of the hydrological cycle known as precipitation ) . The aim of rainfall climatology is to measure , understand and predict rain distribution across different regions of planet Earth , a factor of air pressure , humidity , topography , cloud type and raindrop size , via direct measurement and remote sensing data acquisition . Current technologies accurately predict rainfall 3 -- 4 days in advance using numerical weather prediction . Geostationary orbiting satellites gather IR and visual wavelength data to measure realtime localised rainfall by estimating cloud albedo , water content , and the corresponding probability of rain . Geographic distribution of rain is largely governed by climate type , topography and habitat humidity . In mountainous areas , heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation . On the leeward side of mountains , desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by compressional heating . The movement of the monsoon trough , or intertropical convergence zone , brings rainy seasons to savannah climes . The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall , both in amounts and intensity , downwind of cities . Global warming may also cause changes in the precipitation pattern globally , including wetter conditions at high latitudes and in some wet tropical areas , and drier conditions in parts of the subtropics and middle latitudes . Precipitation is a major component of the water cycle , and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the planet . Approximately 505,000 cubic kilometres ( 121,000 cu mi ) of water falls as precipitation each year ; 398,000 cubic kilometres ( 95,000 cu mi ) of it over the oceans . Given the Earth 's surface area , that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is 990 millimetres ( 39 in ) . Climate classification systems such as the Köppen climate classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes ."},{"query":"list of martial arts and what they teach","short_answer":"","abstract":"There are a large number of distinct styles and schools of martial arts .
