It ensures that information is not lost due to dropped packets and that packets are received in the correct order . It is the simplest automatic repeat - request ( ARQ ) mechanism . A stop - and - wait ARQ sender sends one frame at a time ; it is a special case of the general sliding window protocol with transmit and receive window sizes equal to one and greater than one respectively . After sending each frame , the sender does n't send any further frames until it receives an acknowledgement ( ACK ) signal . After receiving a valid frame , the receiver sends an ACK . If the ACK does not reach the sender before a certain time , known as the timeout , the sender sends the same frame again . The timeout countdown is reset after each frame transmission . The above behavior is a basic example of Stop - and - Wait . However , real - life implementations vary to address certain issues of design ."},{"query":"where would you expect to find new oceanic crust being created","short_answer":"","abstract":"Oceanic crust is the uppermost layer of the oceanic portion of a tectonic plate .

It was proposed by Ernst Munch , a German plant physiologist in 1930 . A high concentration of organic substances , particularly sugar , inside cells of the phloem at a source , such as a leaf , creates a diffusion gradient ( osmotic gradient ) that draws water into the cells from the adjacent xylem . This creates turgor pressure , also known as hydrostatic pressure , in the phloem . Movement of phloem sap occurs by bulk flow ( mass flow ) from sugar sources to sugar sinks . The movement in phloem is bidirectional , whereas , in xylem cells , it is unidirectional ( upward ) .

A rift valley is formed on a divergent plate boundary , a crustal extension or spreading apart of the surface , which is subsequently further deepened by the forces of erosion . When the tensional forces are strong enough to cause the plate to split apart , a center block drops between the two blocks at its flanks , forming a graben . The drop of the center creates the nearly parallel steeply dipping walls of a rift valley when it is new . That feature is the beginning of the rift valley , but as the process continues , the valley widens , until it becomes a large basin that fills with sediment from the rift walls and the surrounding area . One of the best known examples of this process is the East African Rift . On Earth , rifts can occur at all elevations , from the sea floor to plateaus and mountain ranges in continental crust or in oceanic crust . They are often associated with a number of adjoining subsidiary or co-extensive valleys , which are typically considered part of the principal rift valley geologically ."},{"query":"who played the christmas tree salesman in a christmas story","short_answer":"","abstract":"Love Actually is a 2003 Christmas - themed romantic comedy film written and directed by Richard Curtis .

It encourages the growth of a group of certain bacteria while inhibiting the growth of others . This medium is important in medical laboratories by distinguishing pathogenic microbes in a short period of time . It contains a high concentration ( about 7.5 % - 10 % ) of salt ( NaCl ) , making it selective for Gram - positive bacteria ( Staphylococcus and Micrococcaceae ) since this level of salt is inhibitory to most other bacteria . It is also a differential medium for mannitol - fermenting staphylococci , containing carbohydrate mannitol and the indicator phenol red , a pH indicator for detecting acid produced by mannitol - fermenting staphylococci . Staphylococcus aureus produces yellow colonies with yellow zones , whereas other coagulase - negative staphylococci produce small pink or red colonies with no colour change to the medium . If an organism can ferment mannitol , an acidic byproduct is formed that causes the phenol red in the agar to turn yellow .

Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year . Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4 -- 9 cm / year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm / year ."},{"query":"short story ghost walker by ian mackenzie jeffers","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Grey is a 2011 British - American survival thriller film co-written , produced and directed by Joe Carnahan and starring Liam Neeson , Frank Grillo and Dermot Mulroney .

Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist . Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of 10 kilometres ( 6.2 mi ) , they can have masses of about twice that of the Sun . They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star , combined with gravitational collapse , that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei . Once formed , they no longer actively generate heat and cool over time ; however , they may still evolve further through collision or accretion . Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons , which are subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons . Neutron stars are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure , a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle , just as white dwarfs are supported against collapse by electron degeneracy pressure .

The British government acted in expectation of that , especially in the southern campaigns in 1780 - 81 . In practice , the number of Loyalists in military service was far lower than expected since Britain could not effectively protect them except in those areas where Britain had military control . The British were often suspicious of them , not knowing whom they could fully trust in such a conflicted situation ; they were often looked down upon . Patriots watched suspected Loyalists very closely and would not tolerate any organized Loyalist opposition . Many outspoken or militarily active Loyalists were forced to flee , especially to their stronghold of New York City . William Franklin , the royal governor of New Jersey and son of Patriot leader Benjamin Franklin , became the leader of the Loyalists after his release from a Patriot prison in 1778 . He worked to build Loyalist military units to fight in the war , but the number of volunteers was much fewer than London expected ."},{"query":"where did daniel and the lions den take place","short_answer":"Babylon and Mesopotamia","abstract":"The story of Daniel in the lions ' den ( chapter 6 in the Book of Daniel ) tells how Daniel is raised to high office by his royal master Darius the Mede , but jealous rivals trick Darius into issuing a decree which condemns Daniel to death .

From this position , the team can either select a player or trade their position to another team for other draft positions , a player or players , or any combination thereof . The round is complete when each team has either selected a player or traded its draft position . Certain aspects of the draft , including team positioning and the number of rounds in the draft , have seen revisions since its first creation in 1936 , but the fundamental methodology has remained the same .

In eukaryotes , there are two distinct types of cell division : a vegetative division , whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell ( mitosis ) , and a reproductive cell division , whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half to produce haploid gametes ( meiosis ) . Meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions . Homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division , and sister chromatids are separated in the second division . Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual reproduction at some point in their life cycle . Both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor . Prokaryotes undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary fission , where their genetic material is segregated equally into two daughter cells . All cell divisions , regardless of organism , are preceded by a single round of DNA replication ."},{"query":"where does the hill country start in texas","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Texas Hill Country is a geographical region located in the Edwards Plateau at the crossroads of West Texas , Central Texas , and South Texas .

Another name for food web is consumer - resource system . Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels : 1 ) the autotrophs , and 2 ) the heterotrophs . To maintain their bodies , grow , develop , and to reproduce , autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances , including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide . These chemical reactions require energy , which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis , although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs . A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere , to mixotrophs ( such as carnivorous plants ) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere , and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter . The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways , such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs . The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange . There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory , carnivory , scavenging and parasitism . Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs , such as sugars , provides energy . Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes , from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods , and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales ."},{"query":"what is a pl tone on a radio","short_answer":"","abstract":"In telecommunications , Continuous Tone - Coded Squelch System or CTCSS is a circuit that is used to reduce the annoyance of listening to other users on a shared two - way radio communications channel .

The ability of an organism or organ to respond to external stimuli is called sensitivity . When a stimulus is applied to a sensory receptor , it normally elicits or influences a reflex via stimulus transduction . These sensory receptors can receive information from outside the body , as in touch receptors found in the skin or light receptors in the eye , as well as from inside the body , as in chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors . An internal stimulus is often the first component of a homeostatic control system . External stimuli are capable of producing systemic responses throughout the body , as in the fight - or - flight response . In order for a stimulus to be detected with high probability , its level must exceed the absolute threshold ; if a signal does reach threshold , the information is transmitted to the central nervous system ( CNS ) , where it is integrated and a decision on how to react is made . Although stimuli commonly cause the body to respond , it is the CNS that finally determines whether a signal causes a reaction or not ."},{"query":"when was star wars a new hope called episode 4","short_answer":"1975","abstract":"Star Wars ( later retitled Star Wars : Episode IV -- A New Hope ) is a 1977 American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas .

Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases . In the first phase , the Archidamian War , Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica , while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire . This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese . In 415 BC , Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily ; the attack failed disastrously , with the destruction of the entire force , in 413 BC . This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy . The destruction of Athens ' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war , and Athens surrendered in the following year .

The Roman era saw both areas , except Scotland and Northern Ireland , conquered by Rome , whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day , and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas ; however , the language barrier remained . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history , as well as the English language . In the medieval period , the countries were often bitter enemies , with both nations ' monarchs claiming control over France . The Hundred Years ' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory . Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815 . After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better . Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente cordiale , particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II , wherein both countries fought against Germany , and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis . Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO . In recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship , especially on defence and foreign policy issues ; the two countries tend , however , to disagree on a range of other matters , most notably the European Union .
