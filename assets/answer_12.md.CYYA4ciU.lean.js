Kant conceives his investigation as a work of foundational ethics -- one that clears the ground for future research by explaining the core concepts and principles of moral theory and showing that they are normative for rational agents . Kant aspires to nothing less than this : to lay bare the fundamental principle of morality and show that it applies to us . In the text , Kant provides a groundbreaking argument that the rightness of an action is determined by the character of the principle that a person chooses to act upon . Kant thus stands in stark contrast to the moral sense theories and teleological moral theories that dominated moral philosophy at the time he was writing . Central to the work is the role of what Kant refers to as the categorical imperative , the concept that one must act only according to that precept which he or she would will to become a universal law ."},{"query":"when was the last time mexico lost in the azteca","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Estadio Azteca ( Spanish pronunciation : ( esˈtaðjo asˈteka ) ) is a football stadium located in the suburb of Santa Úrsula in Mexico City , Mexico .

The descriptive \`\` milky '' is derived from the appearance from Earth of the galaxy -- a band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that can not be individually distinguished by the naked eye . The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea , from the Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος ( galaxías kýklos , \`\` milky circle '' ) .

Originally published anonymously , partly because Montesquieu 's works were subject to censorship , its influence outside France was aided by its rapid translation into other languages . In 1750 Thomas Nugent published the first English translation . In 1751 the Roman Catholic Church added De l'esprit des lois to its Index Librorum Prohibitorum ( \`\` List of Prohibited Books '' ) . Yet Montesquieu 's treatise had an enormous influence on the work of many others , most notably : Catherine the Great , who produced Nakaz ( Instruction ) ; the Founding Fathers of the United States Constitution ; and Alexis de Tocqueville , who applied Montesquieu 's methods to a study of American society , in Democracy in America .

Other cells in the stomach produce bicarbonate , a base , to buffer the fluid , ensuring that it does not become too acidic . These cells also produce mucus , which forms a viscous physical barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach .

The defining characteristic of \`\` common law '' is that it arises as precedent . In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is , a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts , and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts . If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past , the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision ( a principle known as stare decisis ) . If , however , the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases ( called a \`\` matter of first impression '' ) , and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question , judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue ( one party or the other has to win , and on disagreements of law , judges make that decision ) . The court states an opinion that gives reasons for the decision , and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as precedent to bind future judges and litigants . Common law , as the body of law made by judges , stands in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process , and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch ( the interactions are explained later in this article ) .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic ."},{"query":"fox news girl who was on little house on the prairie","short_answer":"","abstract":"Melissa Ann Francis ( born December 12 , 1972 ) is an American actress and current television journalist for the Fox Business Network ( FBN ) and Fox News Channel ( FNC ) ."},{"query":"how many 50 shades of grey movies is there","short_answer":"","abstract":"Fifty Shades of Grey is a 2011 erotic romance novel by British author E.L.

The social welfare function used is typically a function of individuals ' utilities , most commonly a utilitarian function , so the tax system is chosen to maximise the sum of individual utilities . Tax revenue is required to fund the provision of public goods and other government services , as well as for redistribution from rich to poor individuals . However , most taxes distort individual behaviour , because the activity that was being taxed becomes relatively less desirable ; for instance , taxes on labour income reduce the incentive to work . The optimization problem involves minimizing these distortions away from the efficient state , caused by taxation , while achieving desired levels of redistribution and provision of public services . Exceptions to this trade - off include non-distortionary taxes , such as lump - sum taxes , where individuals can not change their behaviour to reduce their tax burden , and Pigouvian taxes , where the market consumption of a good is inefficient and a tax brings consumption closer to the efficient level ."},{"query":"analyse the reasons for decline of bahamani kingdom","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"when did scotland qualify for the world cup","short_answer":"1998","abstract":"This article is a record of Scotland 's results at the FIFA World Cup :"},{"query":"godavari river flows through which districts in telangana","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Godavari is India 's second longest river after the Ganga .

A statistical hypothesis test is a method of statistical inference . Commonly , two statistical data sets are compared , or a data set obtained by sampling is compared against a synthetic data set from an idealized model . A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets , and this is compared as an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis that proposes no relationship between two data sets . The comparison is deemed statistically significant if the relationship between the data sets would be an unlikely realization of the null hypothesis according to a threshold probability -- the significance level . Hypothesis tests are used in determining what outcomes of a study would lead to a rejection of the null hypothesis for a pre-specified level of significance . The process of distinguishing between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis is aided by identifying two conceptual types of errors ( type 1 & type 2 ) , and by specifying parametric limits on e.g. how much type 1 error will be permitted ."},{"query":"where does the seven deadly sins leave off in the manga","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Seven Deadly Sins is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Nakaba Suzuki .

These two forces compete , leading to some combinations of neutrons and protons being more stable than others . Neutrons stabilize the nucleus , because they attract protons , which helps offset the electrical repulsion between protons .

Scientists and conservationists need a species definition which allows them to work , regardless of the theoretical difficulties . If as Linnaeus thought , species were fixed , there would be no problem , but evolutionary processes cause species to change continually , and to grade into one another . A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring , typically by sexual reproduction . While this definition is often adequate , when looked at more closely it is problematic . For example , with hybridisation , in a species complex of hundreds of similar microspecies , or in a ring species , the boundaries between closely related species become unclear . Among organisms that reproduce only asexually , the concept of a reproductive species breaks down , and each clone is potentially a microspecies . Problems also arise when dealing with fossils , since reproduction can not be examined ; the concept of the chronospecies is therefore used in palaeontology .

Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved latent variables . The observed variables are modelled as linear combinations of the potential factors , plus \`\` error '' terms . Factor analysis aims to find independent latent variables . The theory behind factor analytic methods is that the information gained about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset . Factor analysis is commonly used in biology , psychometrics personality theories , marketing , product management , operations research , and finance . Proponents of factor analysis believe that it helps to deal with data sets where there are large numbers of observed variables that are thought to reflect a smaller number of underlying / latent variables . It is one of the most commonly used inter-dependency techniques and is used when the relevant set of variables shows a systematic inter-dependence and the objective is to find out the latent factors that create a commonality ."},{"query":"how do governments gather support for a war effort on the home front ww2","short_answer":"","abstract":"The home front covers the activities of the civilians in a nation at war .

They are far lighter and thinner than traditional cathode ray tube ( CRT ) television sets and video displays and are usually less than 10 centimetres ( 3.9 in ) thick . Flat - panel displays can be divided into two display device categories : volatile and static . Volatile displays require that pixels be periodically electronically refreshed to retain their state ( e.g. , liquid - crystal displays ( LCD ) ) . A volatile display only shows an image when it has battery or AC mains power . Static flat - panel displays rely on materials whose color states are bistable ( e.g. , e-book reader tablets from Sony ) , and as such , flat - panel displays retain the text or images on the screen even when the power is off . As of 2016 , flat - panel displays have almost completely replaced old CRT displays . In many 2010 - era applications , specifically small portable devices such as laptops , mobile phones , smartphones , digital cameras , camcorders , point - and - shoot cameras , and pocket video cameras , any display disadvantages of flat - panels ( as compared with CRTs ) are made up for by portability advantages ( thinness and lightweightness ) ."},{"query":"who was the first gordon on sesame street","short_answer":"Matthew Thomas \`\` Matt '' Robinson Jr .

This can range from the uncontroversial change of a street name to a highly disputed change to the name of a country . Some names are changed locally but the new names are not recognised by other countries , especially when there is a difference in language . Other names may not be officially recognised but remain in common use . Many places have different names in different languages , and a change of language in official or general use has often resulted in what is arguably a change of name . There are many reasons to undertake renaming , with political motivation being the primary cause ; for example many places in the former Soviet Union and its satellites were renamed to honour Stalin . Sometimes a place reverts to its former name ( see for example de-Stalinization ) . One of the most common reasons for a country changing its name is newly acquired independence . When borders are changed , sometimes due to a country splitting or two countries joining together , the names of the relevant areas can change . This , however , is more the creation of a different entity than an act of geographical renaming ."},{"query":"march comes in like a lion rei confession","short_answer":"","abstract":"March Comes in Like a Lion ( Japanese : 3 月 の ライオン , Hepburn : Sangatsu no Raion , lit . \`\` The Lion of March '' ) , is an ongoing manga series by Chica Umino , best known for Honey and Clover .

Water is necessary for plants but only a small amount of water taken up by the roots is used for growth and metabolism . The remaining 97 -- 99.5 % is lost by transpiration and guttation . Leaf surfaces are dotted with pores called stomata , and in most plants they are more numerous on the undersides of the foliage . The stomata are bordered by guard cells and their stomatal accessory cells ( together known as stomatal complex ) that open and close the pore . Transpiration occurs through the stomatal apertures , and can be thought of as a necessary \`\` cost '' associated with the opening of the stomata to allow the diffusion of carbon dioxide gas from the air for photosynthesis . Transpiration also cools plants , changes osmotic pressure of cells , and enables mass flow of mineral nutrients and water from roots to shoots . Two major factors influence the rate of water flow from the soil to the roots : the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the magnitude of the pressure gradient through the soil . Both of these factors influence the rate of bulk flow of water moving from the roots to the stomatal pores in the leaves via the xylem ."},{"query":"how many chapters are in the book pride and prejudice","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"where is the port side of a vessel","short_answer":"","abstract":"Port and starboard are nautical and aeronautical terms of orientation that deal unambiguously with the structure of vessels and aircraft .

When DNA synthesis is impaired , the cell cycle can not progress from the G2 growth stage to the mitosis ( M ) stage .

The defect in red cell DNA synthesis is most often due to hypovitaminosis , specifically a deficiency of vitamin B and / or folic acid . Vitamin B deficiency alone will not cause the syndrome in the presence of sufficient folate , as the mechanism is loss of B dependent folate recycling , followed by folate - deficiency loss of nucleic acid synthesis ( specifically thymine ) , leading to defects in DNA synthesis .

The S.E. of the effect size is used to weigh effect sizes when combining studies , so that large studies are considered more important than small studies in the analysis .

In land animals the respiratory surface is internalized as linings of the lungs . Gas exchange in the lungs occurs in millions of small air sacs called alveoli in mammals and reptiles , but atria in birds . These microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply , thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood . These air sacs communicate with the external environment via a system of airways , or hollow tubes , of which the largest is the trachea , which branches in the middle of the chest into the two main bronchi . These enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous smaller tubes , the bronchioles . In birds the bronchioles are termed parabronchi . It is the bronchioles , or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic alveoli in mammals and atria in birds .

Nucleic acid molecules which are to be analyzed are set upon a viscous medium , the gel , where an electric field induces the nucleic acids ( which are negatively charged due to their sugar - phosphate backbone ) to migrate toward the anode ( which is positively charged because this is an electrolytic rather than galvanic cell ) . The separation of these fragments is accomplished by exploiting the mobilities with which different sized molecules are able to pass through the gel . Longer molecules migrate more slowly because they experience more resistance within the gel . Because the size of the molecule affects its mobility , smaller fragments end up nearer to the anode than longer ones in a given period . After some time , the voltage is removed and the fragmentation gradient is analyzed . For larger separations between similar sized fragments , either the voltage or run time can be increased . Extended runs across a low voltage gel yield the most accurate resolution . Voltage is , however , not the sole factor in determining electrophoresis of nucleic acids ."},{"query":"who has the most national championships ncaa football","short_answer":"","abstract":"A national championship in the highest level of college football in the United States , currently the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) , is a designation awarded annually by various organizations to their selection of the best college football team .

At the heart of the conflict was the question of whether Kansas would allow or outlaw slavery , and thus enter the Union as a slave state or a free state . The Kansas -- Nebraska Act of 1854 called for \`\` popular sovereignty '' -- that is , the decision about slavery was to be made by the settlers ( rather than outsiders ) . It would be decided by votes -- or more exactly which side had more votes counted by officials . Pro-slavery forces said every settler had the right to bring his own property , including slaves , into the territory .
