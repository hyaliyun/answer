This is in contrast to a constructive plate boundary (also known as a mid-ocean ridge or spreading center). As a result of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle, earthquakes and volcanoes are common near destructive boundaries, where subduction zones or an area of continental collision (depending on the nature of the plates involved) occurs. The subducting plate in a subduction zone is normally oceanic crust, and moves beneath the other plate, which can be made of either oceanic or continental crust. During collisions between two continental plates, large mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas are formed. In other regions, a divergent boundary or transform faults may be present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason for the existence of convergent boundaries are the mid-ocean ridges that were only beginning to be understood with the acceptance of the theory of plate tectonics in the mid-1960s. The radioactive decay of elements within the rocks in the interior of the earth generates large amounts of heat that moves magma to the surface of the crust in a process called mantle convection. This results in a new oceanic crust or sea floor being formed that slowly moves away from the ridges (sometimes called spreading centers) towards the subduction zones. In other words, new seafloor originates from the upwelling rock as it emerges from the depths of the mantle and it slowly cools as it is transported over the millennia to the collision or subduction zones where it is consumed or recycled.[1]\\r\\nLarge, shallow earthquakes on subduction zone interfaces are the largest types of earthquakes. They accounted for 90% of the total seismic moment released for the period 1900ÿ1989, but these events usually occur offshore and far from population centers. Non-subduction interface earthquakes also occur in the region of the trench including shallow upper plate shocks, deeper events within the downgoing slab, and events that are related to outer trench swell.[2]\\r\\nA volcanic arc is formed on the continental plate, above the location of the downgoing oceanic slab. The volcanic arc is the surface expression of the magma that is generated by hydrous melting of the mantle above the downgoing slab. Hydrated minerals (e.g., phlogopite, lawsonite, amphibole) within the oceanic lithosphere become unstable at certain depths due to increased temperature and pressure, causing the crystal structure of the hydrated minerals break down and release water. The buoyant fluids then rise into the asthenosphere, where they lower the melting temperature of the mantle and cause partial melting. These melts rise to the surface and are the source of some of the most explosive volcanism on Earth because of their high volumes of extremely pressurized gases.\\r\\nWhen two plates with oceanic crust converge, they typically create an island arc as one plate is subducted below the other. The arc is formed from volcanoes which erupt through the overriding plate as the descending plate melts below it. The arc shape occurs because of the spherical surface of the earth (nick the peel of an orange with a knife and note the arc formed by the straight-edge of the knife). A deep oceanic trench is located in front of such arcs where the descending slab dips downward, such as the Mariana Trench near the Mariana Islands.\\r\\nSome convergent margins have zones of active seafloor spreading behind the island arc, known as back-arc basins. When one plate is composed of oceanic lithosphere and the other is composed of continental lithosphere, the denser oceanic plate is subducted, often forming an orogenic belt and associated mountain range. This type of convergent boundary is similar to the Andes or the Cascade Range in North America.\\r\\nAn oceanic trench is found where the denser plate is subducted underneath the other plate. There is water in the rocks of the oceanic plate (because they are underwater), and as this plate moves further down into the subduction zone, much of the water contained in the plate is squeezed out when the plate begins to subduct. However, the recrystallization of ocean floor rocks, such as serpentinite, which are unstable in the upper mantle, recrystallize into olivine, causing dehydration through loss of hydroxyl groups. This addition of water to the mantle causes partial melting of the mantle, generating magma, which then rises, and which normally results in volcanoes. This normally happens at a certain depth, about 70 to 80 miles below the Earth's surface, and so volcanoes are formed fairly close to, but not right next to, the trench.","input":"What kind of plate boundary is the himalayan mountains?"},{"output":"the Moon","context":"","input":"What is the name for earth's moon?"},{"output":"particularly in basic commodities including cotton, silk, indigo dye, salt, saltpetre, tea, and opium","context":"The East India Company (EIC), also known as the Honourable East India Company (HEIC) or the British East India Company and informally as John Company,[1] was an English and later British joint-stock company,[2] which was formed to pursue trade with the \\"East Indies\\" (in present-day terms, Maritime Southeast Asia), but ended up trading mainly with Qing China and seizing control of the Indian subcontinent.\\r\\nOriginally chartered as the \\"Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies\\", the company rose to account for half of the world's trade, particularly in basic commodities including cotton, silk, indigo dye, salt, saltpetre, tea, and opium.

The Battle of Plassey and Battle of Buxar, in which the British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the Indian powers, left the company in control of Bengal and a major military and political power in India. In the following decades it gradually increased the extent of the territories under its control, ruling the whole Indian subcontinent either directly or indirectly via local puppet rulers under the threat of force by its Presidency armies, much of which were composed of native Indian sepoys.\\r\\nBy 1803, at the height of its rule in India, the British East India company had a private army of about 260,000twice the size of the British Army.[5] The company eventually came to rule large areas of India with its private armies, exercising military power and assuming administrative functions.[6] Company rule in India effectively began in 1757 and lasted until 1858, when, following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led to the British Crown's assuming direct control of the Indian subcontinent in the form of the new British Raj.\\r\\nDespite frequent government intervention, the company had recurring problems with its finances. It was dissolved in 1874 as a result of the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act passed one year earlier, as the Government of India Act had by then rendered it vestigial, powerless, and obsolete. The official government machinery of British India had assumed its governmental functions and absorbed its armies.\\r\\nSoon after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, London merchants presented a petition to Queen Elizabeth I for permission to sail to the Indian Ocean.[7] Permission was granted, and on 10 April 1591 three ships sailed from Torbay around the Cape of Good Hope to the Arabian Sea on one of the earliest English overseas Indian expeditions. One of them, Edward Bonaventure, then sailed around Cape Comorin to the Malay Peninsula and returned to England in 1594.[7]\\r\\nIn 1596, three more ships sailed east but were all lost at sea.[7] Three years later, on 22 September 1599,[8] another group of merchants met and stated their intention \\"to venture in the pretended voyage to the East Indies (the which it may please the Lord to prosper), and the sums that they will adventure\\", committing S30,133.[9] Two days later, on 24 September, \\"the Adventurers\\" reconvened and resolved to apply to the Queen for support of the project.[9] Although their first attempt had not been completely successful, they, nonetheless, sought the Queen's unofficial approval to continue, bought ships for their venture and increased their capital to S68,373.\\r\\nThe Adventurers convened, again, a year later.[7] This time they succeeded, and on 31 December 1600, the Queen granted a Royal Charter to \\"George, Earl of Cumberland, and 215 Knights, Aldermen, and Burgesses\\" under the name, Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading with the East Indies.[10] For a period of fifteen years, the charter awarded the newly formed company a monopoly on trade with all countries east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the Straits of Magellan.[10] Any traders, in breach of the charter without a licence from the company, were liable to forfeiture of their ships and cargo (half of which went to the Crown and the other half to the company), as well as imprisonment at the \\"royal pleasure\\".[11]\\r\\nThe governance of the company was in the hands of one governor and 24 directors or \\"committees\\", who made up the Court of Directors. They, in turn, reported to the Court of Proprietors, which appointed them. Ten committees reported to the Court of Directors. According to tradition, business was initially transacted at the Nags Head Inn, opposite St Botolph's church in Bishopsgate, before moving to India House in Leadenhall Street.[12]\\r\\nSir James Lancaster commanded the first East India Company voyage in 1601[13] and returned in 1603.[14] In March 1604 Sir Henry Middleton commanded the second voyage. General William Keeling, a captain during the second voyage, led the third voyage aboard the Red Dragon from 1607 to 1610 along with the Hector under Captain William Hawkins and the Consent under Captain David Middleton.[15]\\r\\nEarly in 1608 Alexander Sharpeigh was appointed captain of the company's Ascension, and general or commander of the fourth voyage. Thereafter two ships, Ascension and Union (captained by Richard Rowles) sailed from Woolwich on 14 March 1607ÿ08.[15]\\r\\nInitially, the company struggled in the spice trade because of the competition from the already well-established Dutch East India Company. The company opened a factory in Bantam on the first voyage, and imports of pepper from Java comprised an important part of the company's trade for twenty years. The factory in Bantam was closed in 1683. During this time ships belonging to the company arriving in India docked at Surat, which was established as a trade transit point in 1608.\\r\\nIn the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of Machilipatnam on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted King James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.\\r\\nEnglish traders frequently engaged in hostilities with their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major victory over the Portuguese in the Battle of Swally in 1612, at Suvali in Surat. The company decided to explore the feasibility of gaining a territorial foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the Mughal Empire, and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.[16]\\r\\nIn 1612, James I instructed Sir Thomas Roe to visit the Mughal Emperor Nuruddin Salim Jahangir (r.?1605ÿ1627) to arrange for a commercial treaty that would give the company exclusive rights to reside and establish factories in Surat and other areas. In return, the company offered to provide the Emperor with goods and rarities from the European market. This mission was highly successful, and Jahangir sent a letter to James through Sir Thomas Roe:[16]\\r\\nUpon which assurance of your royal love I have given my general command to all the kingdoms and ports of my dominions to receive all the merchants of the English nation as the subjects of my friend; that in what place soever they choose to live, they may have free liberty without any restraint; and at what port soever they shall arrive, that neither Portugal nor any other shall dare to molest their quiet; and in what city soever they shall have residence, I have commanded all my governors and captains to give them freedom answerable to their own desires; to sell, buy, and to transport into their country at their pleasure. For confirmation of our love and friendship, I desire your Majesty to command your merchants to bring in their ships of all sorts of rarities and rich goods fit for my palace; and that you be pleased to send me your royal letters by every opportunity, that I may rejoice in your health and prosperous affairs; that our friendship may be interchanged and eternal.\\r\\nThe company, which benefited from the imperial patronage, soon expanded its commercial trading operations. It eclipsed the Portuguese Estado da ndia, which had established bases in Goa, Chittagong, and Bombay, which Portugal later ceded to England as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza on her marriage to King Charles II. The East India Company also launched a joint attack with the Dutch United East India Company (VOC) on Portuguese and Spanish ships off the coast of China, which helped secure EIC ports in China.[17] The company established trading posts in Surat (1619), Madras (1639), Bombay (1668), and Calcutta (1690). By 1647, the company had 23 factories, each under the command of a factor or master merchant and governor, and 90 employees[clarification needed] in India. The major factories became the walled forts of Fort William in Bengal, Fort St George in Madras, and Bombay Castle.\\r\\nIn 1634, the Mughal emperor extended his hospitality to the English traders to the region of Bengal, and in 1717 completely waived customs duties for their trade. The company's mainstay businesses were by then cotton, silk, indigo dye, saltpetre, and tea. The Dutch were aggressive competitors and had meanwhile expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the Straits of Malacca by ousting the Portuguese in 1640ÿ41. With reduced Portuguese and Spanish influence in the region, the EIC and VOC entered a period of intense competition, resulting in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th and 18th centuries.\\r\\nCompetition arose in 1635 when Charles I granted a trading licence to Sir William Courteen, which permitted the rival Courteen association to trade with the east at any location in which the EIC had no presence.[18]\\r\\nIn 1657, Oliver Cromwell renewed the charter of 1609, and brought about minor changes in the holding of the company. The restoration of monarchy in England further enhanced the EIC's status.\\r\\nIn an act aimed at strengthening the power of the EIC, King Charles II granted the EIC (in a series of five acts around 1670) the rights to autonomous territorial acquisitions, to mint money, to command fortresses and troops and form alliances, to make war and peace, and to exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction over the acquired areas.[19]\\r\\nWilliam Hedges was sent in 1682 to Shaista Khan, the Mughal governor of Bengal, to obtain a firman, an imperial directive that would grant England regular trading privileges throughout the Mughal Empire. However, the company's governor in London, Sir Josiah Child, interfered with Hedges's mission, causing Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb to break off the negotiations.\\r\\nIn 1689 a Mughal fleet commanded by Sidi Yaqub attacked Bombay. After a year of resistance the EIC surrendered in 1690, and the company sent envoys to Aurangzeb's camp to plead for a pardon. The company's envoys had to prostrate themselves before the emperor, pay a large indemnity, and promise better behaviour in the future. The emperor withdrew his troops, and the company subsequently re-established itself in Bombay and set up a new base in Calcutta.[20]\\r\\nEventually, the East India Company seized control of Bengal and slowly the whole Indian subcontinent with its private armies, composed primarily of Indian sepoys. As historian William Dalrymple observes,\\r\\nWe still talk about the British conquering India, but that phrase disguises a more sinister reality. It was not the British government that seized India at the end of the 18th century, but a dangerously unregulated private company headquartered in one small office, five windows wide, in London, and managed in India by an unstable sociopath ÿ [Robert] Clive.[5]\\r\\nIn 1613, during the rule of Tokugawa Hidetada of the Tokugawa shogunate, the British ship Clove, under the command of Captain John Saris, was the first British ship to call on Japan. Saris was the chief factor of the EIC's trading post in Java, and with the assistance of William Adams, a British sailor who had arrived in Japan in 1600, he was able to gain permission from the ruler to establish a commercial house in Hirado on the Japanese island of Kyushu:\\r\\nWe give free license to the subjects of the King of Great Britaine, Sir Thomas Smythe, Governor and Company of the East Indian Merchants and Adventurers forever safely come into any of our ports of our Empire of Japan with their shippes and merchandise, without any hindrance to them or their goods, and to abide, buy, sell and barter according to their own manner with all nations, to tarry here as long as they think good, and to depart at their pleasure.[21]\\r\\nHowever, unable to obtain Japanese raw silk for import to China and with their trading area reduced to Hirado and Nagasaki from 1616 onwards, the company closed its factory in 1623.[22]\\r\\nIn September 1695, Captain Henry Every, an English pirate on board the Fancy, reached the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, where he teamed up with five other pirate captains to make an attack on the Indian fleet on return from the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. The Mughal convoy included the treasure-laden Ganj-i-Sawai, reported to be the greatest in the Mughal fleet and the largest ship operational in the Indian Ocean, and its escort, the Fateh Muhammed. They were spotted passing the straits en route to Surat. The pirates gave chase and caught up with Fateh Muhammed some days later, and meeting little resistance, took some S50,000 to S60,000 worth of treasure.[23]\\r\\nEvery continued in pursuit and managed to overhaul Ganj-i-Sawai, which resisted strongly before eventually striking. Ganj-i-Sawai carried enormous wealth and, according to contemporary East India Company sources, was carrying a relative of the Grand Mughal, though there is no evidence to suggest that it was his daughter and her retinue. The loot from the Ganj-i-Sawai had a total value between S325,000 and S600,000, including 500,000 gold and silver pieces, and has become known as the richest ship ever taken by pirates.\\r\\nIn a letter sent to the Privy Council by Sir John Gayer, then governor of Bombay and head of the East India Company, Gayer claims that \\"it is certain the Pirates ... did do very barbarously by the People of the Ganj-i-Sawai and Abdul Ghaffar's ship, to make them confess where their money was.\\" The pirates set free the survivors who were left aboard their emptied ships, to continue their voyage back to India.\\r\\nWhen the news arrived in England it caused an outcry. To appease Aurangzeb, the East India Company promised to pay all financial reparations, while Parliament declared the pirates hostis humani generis (\\"enemies of the human race\\"). In mid-1696 the government issued a S500 bounty on Every's head and offered a free pardon to any informer who disclosed his whereabouts. When the East India Company later doubled that reward, the first worldwide manhunt in recorded history was underway.[24]\\r\\nThe plunder of Aurangzeb's treasure ship had serious consequences for the English East India Company. The furious Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb ordered Sidi Yaqub and Nawab Daud Khan to attack and close four of the company's factories in India and imprison their officers, who were almost lynched by a mob of angry Mughals, blaming them for their countryman's depredations, and threatened to put an end to all English trading in India. To appease Emperor Aurangzeb and particularly his Grand Vizier Asad Khan, Parliament exempted Every from all of the Acts of Grace (pardons) and amnesties it would subsequently issue to other pirates.[25]\\r\\nAn 18th-century depiction of Henry Every, with the Fancy shown engaging its prey in the background\\r\\nBritish pirates that fought during the Child's War engaging the Ganj-i-Sawai\\r\\nDepiction of Captain Every's encounter with the Mughal Emperor's granddaughter after his September 1695 capture of the Mughal trader Ganj-i-Sawai\\r\\nThe prosperity that the officers of the company enjoyed allowed them to return to Britain and establish sprawling estates and businesses, and to obtain political power. The company developed a lobby in the English parliament. Under pressure from ambitious tradesmen and former associates of the company (pejoratively termed Interlopers by the company), who wanted to establish private trading firms in India, a deregulating act was passed in 1694.[26]\\r\\nThis allowed any English firm to trade with India, unless specifically prohibited by act of parliament, thereby annulling the charter that had been in force for almost 100 years. By an act that was passed in 1698, a new \\"parallel\\" East India Company (officially titled the English Company Trading to the East Indies) was floated under a state-backed indemnity of S2?million. The powerful stockholders of the old company quickly subscribed a sum of S315,000 in the new concern, and dominated the new body. The two companies wrestled with each other for some time, both in England and in India, for a dominant share of the trade.[26]\\r\\nIt quickly became evident that, in practice, the original company faced scarcely any measurable competition. The companies merged in 1708, by a tripartite indenture involving both companies and the state. Under this arrangement, the merged company lent to the Treasury a sum of S3,200,000, in return for exclusive privileges for the next three years, after which the situation was to be reviewed. The amalgamated company became the United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies.[26]\\r\\nIn the following decades there was a constant battle between the company lobby and the Parliament. The company sought a permanent establishment, while the Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\\r\\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of S1?million. Between 1756 and 1763, the Seven Years' War diverted the state's attention towards consolidation and defence of its territorial possessions in Europe and its colonies in North America.[27]\\r\\nThe war took place on Indian soil, between the company troops and the French forces. In 1757, the Law Officers of the Crown delivered the Pratt-Yorke opinion distinguishing overseas territories acquired by right of conquest from those acquired by private treaty. The opinion asserted that, while the Crown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the former was vested in the Crown.[27]\\r\\nWith the advent of the Industrial Revolution, Britain surged ahead of its European rivals. Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade. The company became the single largest player in the British global market. William Henry Pyne notes in his book The Microcosm of London (1808) that:\\r\\nOn the?1 March 1801, the debts of the East India Company to S5,393,989 their effects to S15,404,736 and their sales increased since February 1793, from S4,988,300 to S7,602,041.\\r\\nSir John Banks, a businessman from Kent who negotiated an agreement between the king and the company, began his career in a syndicate arranging contracts for victualling the navy, an interest he kept up for most of his life. He knew that Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn had amassed a substantial fortune from the Levant and Indian trades.\\r\\nHe became a Director and later, as Governor of the East India Company in 1672, he arranged a contract which included a loan of S20,000 and S30,000 worth of saltpetrealso known as potassium nitrate, a primary ingredient in gunpowderfor the King \\"at the price it shall sell by the candle\\"that is by auctionwhere bidding could continue as long as an inch-long candle remained alight.[28]\\r\\nOutstanding debts were also agreed and the company permitted to export 250 tons of saltpetre. Again in 1673, Banks successfully negotiated another contract for 700 tons of saltpetre at S37,000 between the king and the company. So urgent was the need to supply the armed forces in the United Kingdom, America and elsewhere that the authorities sometimes turned a blind eye on the untaxed sales. One governor of the company was even reported as saying in 1864 that he would rather have the saltpetre made than the tax on salt.[29]\\r\\nThe Seven Years' War (1756ÿ63) resulted in the defeat of the French forces, limited French imperial ambitions, and stunted the influence of the Industrial Revolution in French territories. Robert Clive, the Governor General, led the company to a victory against Joseph Fran?ois Dupleix, the commander of the French forces in India, and recaptured Fort St George from the French. The company took this respite to seize Manila in 1762.[30][better?source?needed]\\r\\nBy the Treaty of Paris, France regained the five establishments captured by the British during the war (Pondichry, Mahe, Karikal, Yanam and Chandernagar) but was prevented from erecting fortifications and keeping troops in Bengal (art. XI). Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondichry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\\r\\nIn its first century and half, the EIC used a few hundred soldiers as guards. The great expansion came after 1750, when it had 3,000 regular troops. By 1763, it had 26,000; by 1778, it had 67,000. It recruited largely Indian troops, and trained them along European lines.[31] The military arm of the East India Company quickly developed to become a private corporate armed force, and was used as an instrument of geo-political power and expansion, rather than its original purpose as a guard force, and became the most powerful military force in the Indian sub-continent. As it increased in size the army was broken into the Presidency Armies of Bengal, Madras and Bombay each recruiting their own integral infantry, cavalry, artillery and horse artillery units. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its fleet and although made up predominantly of heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, it also included warships.\\r\\nThe company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of its own private well-disciplined and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the Carnatic region from its base at Madras and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.[32]\\r\\nIt continued to experience resistance from local rulers during its expansion. Robert Clive led company forces against Siraj Ud Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, Bihar, and Midnapore district in Odisha to victory at the Battle of Plassey in 1757, resulting in the conquest of Bengal. This victory estranged the British and the Mughals, since Siraj Ud Daulah was a Mughal feudatory ally.\\r\\nWith the gradual weakening of the Marathas in the aftermath of the three Anglo-Maratha wars, the British also secured the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat, the fort of Ahmmadnagar, province of Cuttack (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of Odisha, Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, Balasore Port, parts of Midnapore district of West Bengal), Bombay (Mumbai) and the surrounding areas, leading to a formal end of the Maratha empire and firm establishment of the British East India Company in India.\\r\\nHyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, the rulers of the Kingdom of Mysore, offered much resistance to the British forces. Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four Anglo-Mysore Wars. Mysore finally fell to the company forces in 1799, in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war during which Tipu Sultan was killed.\\r\\nThe last vestiges of local administration were restricted to the northern regions of Delhi, Oudh, Rajputana, and Punjab, where the company's presence was ever increasing amidst infighting and offers of protection among the remaining princes. The hundred years from the Battle of Plassey in 1757 to the Indian Rebellion of 1857 were a period of consolidation for the company, during which it seized control of the entire Indian subcontinent and functioned more as an administrator and less as a trading concern.\\r\\nA cholera pandemic began in Bengal, then spread across India by 1820. 10,000 British troops and countless Indians died during this pandemic.[34] Between 1760 and 1834 only some 10% of the East India Company's officers survived to take the final voyage home.[35]\\r\\nIn the early 19th century the Indian question of geopolitical dominance and empire holding remained with the East India Company.[36] The three independent armies of the company's Presidencies, with some locally raised irregular forces, expanded to a total of 280,000 men by 1857.[37] First recruited from mercenaries and low-caste volunteers, the Bengal Army especially eventually became composed largely of high-caste Hindus and landowning Muslims.\\r\\nWithin the Army, British officers who initially trained at the company's own academy at the Addiscombe Military Seminary, always outranked Indians, no matter how long their service. The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Rissaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior subaltern equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.\\r\\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of Runion and Mauritius.\\r\\nThere was a systemic disrespect in the company for the spreading of Protestantism although it fostered respect for Hindu and Muslim, castes and ethnic groups. The growth of tensions between the EIC and the local religious and cultural groups grew in the 19th century as the Protestant revival grew in Great Britain. These tensions erupted at the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the company ceased to exist when the company dissolved through the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873.[38]\\r\\nIn the 18th century, Britain had a huge trade deficit with Qing dynasty China and so, in 1773, the company created a British monopoly on opium buying in Bengal, India by prohibiting the licensing of opium farmers and private cultivation. The monopoly system established in 1799 continued with minimal changes until 1947.[39] As the opium trade was illegal in China, Company ships could not carry opium to China. So the opium produced in Bengal was sold in Calcutta on condition that it be sent to China.[40]\\r\\nDespite the Chinese ban on opium imports, reaffirmed in 1799 by the Jiaqing Emperor, the drug was smuggled into China from Bengal by traffickers and agency houses such as Jardine, Matheson & Co and Dent & Co. in amounts averaging 900 tons a year. The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at Lintin Island were paid into the company's factory at Canton and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\\r\\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the Straits Settlements in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.\\r\\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, Lin Zexu, to curb smuggling. This resulted in the First Opium War (1839ÿ42). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Nanking and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations.[39] The Jardines and Apcar and Company dominated the trade, although P&O also tried to take a share.[41] A Second Opium War fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the Treaty of Tientsin, which legalised the importation of opium. Legalisation stimulated domestic Chinese opium production and increased the importation of opium from Turkey and Persia. This increased competition for the Chinese market led to India's reducing its opium output and diversifying its exports.[39]\\r\\nThe company employed many junior clerks, known as \\"writers\\", to record the details of accounting, managerial decisions, and activities related to the company, such as minutes of meetings, copies of Company orders and contracts, and filings of reports and copies of ship's logs. Several well-known British scholars and literary men had Company writerships, such as Henry Thomas Colebrooke in India and Charles Lamb in England.\\r\\nThough the company was becoming increasingly bold and ambitious in putting down resisting states, it was becoming clearer that the company was incapable of governing the vast expanse of the captured territories. The Bengal famine of 1770, in which one-third of the local population died, caused distress in Britain. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.\\r\\nAt the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the Tea Act in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.\\r\\nWhen the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the Townshend Acts, setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the Boston Tea Party in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, one of the major events leading up to the American Revolution.\\r\\nBy the Regulating Act of 1773 (later known as the East India Company Act 1773), the Parliament of Great Britain imposed a series of administrative and economic reforms; this clearly established Parliament's sovereignty and ultimate control over the company. The Act recognised the company's political functions and clearly established that the \\"acquisition of sovereignty by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own right\\".\\r\\nDespite stiff resistance from the East India lobby in parliament and from the company's shareholders, the Act passed. It introduced substantial governmental control and allowed British India to be formally under the control of the Crown, but leased back to the company at S40,000 for two years. Under the Act's most important provision, a governing Council composed of five members was created in Calcutta. The three members nominated by Parliament and representing the Government's interest could, and invariably would, outvote the two Company members. The Council was headed by Warren Hastings, the incumbent Governor, who became the first Governor-General of Bengal, with an ill-defined authority over the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.[42] His nomination, made by the Court of Directors, would in future be subject to the approval of a Council of Four appointed by the Crown. Initially, the Council consisted of Lt. General Sir John Clavering, The Honourable Sir George Monson, Sir Richard Barwell, and Sir Philip Francis.[43]\\r\\nHastings was entrusted with the power of peace and war. British judges and magistrates would also be sent to India to administer the legal system. The Governor General and the council would have complete legislative powers. The company was allowed to maintain its virtual monopoly over trade in exchange for the biennial sum and was obligated to export a minimum quantity of goods yearly to Britain. The costs of administration were to be met by the company. The company initially welcomed these provisions, but the annual burden of the payment contributed to the steady decline of its finances.[43]\\r\\nThe East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act) had two key aspects:\\r\\nPitt's Act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company's powers were nebulous and highly subjective. The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories. Edmund Burke, a former East India Company shareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a new Regulating Bill in 1783. The bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill's recommendations for the appointment of councillors.\\r\\nThe Act of 1786 (26 Geo. 3 c. 16) enacted the demand of Earl Cornwallis that the powers of the Governor-General be enlarged to empower him, in special cases, to override the majority of his Council and act on his own special responsibility. The Act enabled the offices of the Governor-General and the Commander-in-Chief to be jointly held by the same official.\\r\\nThis Act clearly demarcated borders between the Crown and the company. After this point, the company functioned as a regularised subsidiary of the Crown, with greater accountability for its actions and reached a stable stage of expansion and consolidation. Having temporarily achieved a state of truce with the Crown, the company continued to expand its influence to nearby territories through threats and coercive actions. By the middle of the 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, Burma, Malaya, Singapore, and British Hong Kong, and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence. In addition, Penang, one of the states in Malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's Indian territories.[44]\\r\\nThe company's charter was renewed for a further 20 years by the Charter Act of 1793. In contrast with the legislative proposals of the previous two decades, the 1793 Act was not a particularly controversial measure, and made only minimal changes to the system of government in India and to British oversight of the company's activities.\\r\\nThe aggressive policies of Lord Wellesley and the Marquess of Hastings led to the company's gaining control of all India (except for the Punjab and Sindh), and some part of the then kingdom of Nepal under the Sugauli Treaty. The Indian Princes had become vassals of the company. But the expense of wars leading to the total control of India strained the company's finances. The company was forced to petition Parliament for assistance. This was the background to the Charter Act of 1813 which, among other things:\\r\\nThe Industrial Revolution in Britain, the consequent search for markets, and the rise of laissez-faire economic ideology form the background to the Government of India Act 1833 (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85). The Act:\\r\\nBritish influence continued to expand; in 1845, Great Britain purchased the Danish colony of Tranquebar. The company had at various stages extended its influence to China, the Philippines, and Java. It had solved its critical lack of cash needed to buy tea by exporting Indian-grown opium to China. China's efforts to end the trade led to the First Opium War (1839ÿ1842).\\r\\nThe English Education Act by the Council of India in 1835 reallocated funds from the East India Company to spend on education and literature in India.\\r\\nThis Act (16 & 17 Vict. c. 95) provided that British India would remain under the administration of the company in trust for the Crown until Parliament should decide otherwise. It also introduced a system of open competition as the basis of recruitment for civil servants of the company and thus deprived the Directors of their patronage system.[47]\\r\\nUnder the act, for the first time the legislative and executive powers of the governor general's council were separated. It also added six additional members to the governor general's executive committee.[48]\\r\\nThe Indian Rebellion of 1857 (also known as the Indian Mutiny) resulted in widespread devastation in India: many condemned the East India Company for permitting the events to occur.[49] In the aftermath of the Rebellion, under the provisions of the Government of India Act 1858, the British Government nationalised the company. The Crown took over its Indian possessions, its administrative powers and machinery, and its armed forces.\\r\\nThe company remained in existence in vestigial form, continuing to manage the tea trade on behalf of the British Government (and the supply of Saint Helena) until the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873 came into effect, on 1 January 1874. This Act provided for the formal dissolution of the company on 1 June 1874, after a final dividend payment and the commutation or redemption of its stock.[50] The Times commented on 8 April 1873:[51]\\r\\nIt accomplished a work such as in the whole history of the human race no other trading Company ever attempted, and such as none, surely, is likely to attempt in the years to come.\\r\\nThe company's headquarters in London, from which much of India was governed, was East India House in Leadenhall Street. After occupying premises in Philpot Lane from 1600 to 1621; in Crosby House, Bishopsgate, from 1621 to 1638; and in Leadenhall Street from 1638 to 1648, the company moved into Craven House, an Elizabethan mansion in Leadenhall Street. The building had become known as East India House by 1661. It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726ÿ9; and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796ÿ1800. It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861ÿ62. The site is now occupied by the Lloyd's building.\\r\\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the River Thames at Deptford. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at Blackwall: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\\r\\nIn 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the East India Docks) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the West India Dock Company. The docks were taken over by the Port of London Authority in 1909, and closed in 1967.\\r\\nThe East India College was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \\"writers\\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service. It was initially located in Hertford Castle, but moved in 1809 to purpose-built premises at Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire. In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a public school, now Haileybury and Imperial Service College.\\r\\nThe East India Company Military Seminary was founded in 1809 at Addiscombe, near Croydon, Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India. It was based in Addiscombe Place, an early 18th-century mansion. The government took it over in 1858, and renamed it the Royal Indian Military College. In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.\\r\\nIn 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, Hackney, London, a private lunatic asylum run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams. The arrangement outlasted the company itself, continuing until 1870, when the India Office opened its own asylum, the Royal India Asylum, at Hanwell, Middlesex.[52]\\r\\nThe East India Club in London was formed in 1849 for officers of the company. The Club still exists today as a private gentlemen's club with its club house situated at 16 St. James's Square, London.[53]\\r\\nThe East India Company had a long lasting impact on the Indian Subcontinent, with both positive and harmful effects. Although dissolved following the rebellion of 1857, it stimulated the growth of the British Empire. Its armies were to become the armies of British India after 1857, and it played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India. This also led to Macaulayism in the Indian subcontinent.\\r\\nThe East India Company was the first company to record the Chinese usage of orange-flavoured tea, which led to the development of Earl Grey tea.[54]\\r\\nThe East India Company introduced a system of merit-based appointments that provided a model for the British and Indian civil service.[55]\\r\\nWidespread corruption and looting of Bengal resources and treasures during its rule resulted in poverty.[5] Famines, such as the Great Bengal famine of 1770 and subsequent famines during the 18th and 19th centuries, became more widespread, chiefly because of exploitative agriculture promulgated by the policies of the East India company and the forced cultivation of opium in place of grain.[56][57]\\r\\nDownman (1685)\\r\\nLens (1700)\\r\\nNational Geographic (1917)\\r\\nRees (1820)\\r\\nLaurie (1842)\\r\\n1600ÿ1707\\r\\n1707ÿ1801\\r\\n1801ÿ1874\\r\\nThe English East India Company flag changed with history, with a canton based on the current flag of the Kingdom, and a field of 9 to 13 alternating red and white stripes.\\r\\nFrom the period of 1600, the canton consisted of a St George's Cross representing the Kingdom of England. With the Acts of Union 1707, the canton was updated to be the new Union Flagconsisting of an English St George's Cross combined with a Scottish St Andrew's crossrepresenting the Kingdom of Great Britain. After the Acts of Union 1800 that joined Ireland with Great Britain to form the United Kingdom, the canton of the East India Company flag was altered accordingly to include a Saint Patrick's Saltire replicating the updated Union Flag representing the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\\r\\nRegarding the field of the flag, there has been much debate and discussion regarding the number and order of the stripes. Historical documents and paintings show many variations from 9 to 13 stripes, with some images showing the top stripe's being red and others showing the top stripe being white.\\r\\nAt the time of the American Revolution the East India Company flag was nearly identical to the Grand Union Flag. Historian Charles Fawcett argued that the East India Company Flag inspired the Stars and Stripes.[58]\\r\\nThe East India Company's original coat of arms was granted in 1600. The blazon of the arms is as follows:\\r\\n\\"Azure, three ships with three masts, rigged and under full sail, the sails, pennants and ensigns Argent, each charged with a cross Gules; on a chief of the second a pale quarterly Azure and Gules, on the 1st and 4th a fleur-de-lis or, on the 2nd and 3rd a leopard or, between two roses Gules seeded Or barbed Vert.\\" The shield had as a crest: \\"A sphere without a frame, bounded with the Zodiac in bend Or, between two pennants flottant Argent, each charged with a cross Gules, over the sphere the words DEUS INDICAT\\" (Latin: God Indicates). The supporters were two sea lions (lions with fishes' tails) and the motto was DEO DUCENTE NIL NOCET (Latin: Where God Leads, Nothing Harms).[59]\\r\\nThe East India Company's arms, granted in 1698, were: \\"Argent a cross Gules; in the dexter chief quarter an escutcheon of the arms of France and England quarterly, the shield ornamentally and regally crowned Or.\\" The crest was: \\"A lion rampant guardant Or holding between the forepaws a regal crown proper.\\" The supporters were: \\"Two lions rampant guardant Or, each supporting a banner erect Argent, charged with a cross Gules.\\" The motto was AUSPICIO REGIS ET SENATUS ANGLI? (Latin: Under the auspices of the King and the Senate of England).[59]\\r\\nHEIC Merchant's mark on East India Company Coin: 1791 Half Pice\\r\\nHEIC Merchant's mark on a Blue Scinde Dawk postage stamp (1852)\\r\\nWhen the East India Company was chartered in 1600, it was still customary for individual merchants or members of companies such as the Company of Merchant Adventurers to have a distinguishing merchant's mark which often included the mystical \\"Sign of Four\\" and served as a trademark. The East India Company's merchant mark consisted of a \\"Sign of Four\\" atop a heart within which was a saltire between the lower arms of which were the initials \\"EIC\\". This mark was a central motif of the East India Company's coinage[60] and forms the central emblem displayed on the Scinde Dawk postage stamps.[61]\\r\\nShips of the East India Company were called East Indiamen or simply \\"Indiamen\\".[62]\\r\\nDuring the period of the Napoleonic Wars, the East India Company arranged for letters of marque for its vessels such as the Lord Nelson. This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the Earl of Mornington, an East India Company packet ship of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\\r\\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the Bombay Marine, equipped with warships such as Grappler. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the Invasion of Java.\\r\\nAt the Battle of Pulo Aura, which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, Nathaniel Dance, Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the Warley, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, the Woodford, under Captain Charles Lennox, the Taunton-Castle, Captain Edward Studd, Canton, Captain Abel Vyvyan, Boddam, Captain George Palmer, and Ocean, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral de Sercey and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, the General Goddard played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off St Helena.\\r\\nEast India Company (EIC) ships were well built, with the result that the Royal Navy bought several of them to convert to warships and transports. The Earl of Mornington became HMS Drake. Other examples include:\\r\\nUnlike all other British Government records, the records from the East India Company (and its successor the India Office) are not in The National Archives at Kew, London, but are held by the British Library in London as part of the Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections. The catalogue is searchable online in the Access to Archives catalogues.[63] Many of the East India Company records are freely available online under an agreement that the Families in British India Society has with the British Library. Published catalogues exist of East India Company ships' journals and logs, 1600ÿ1834;[64] and of some of the company's daughter institutions, including the East India Company College, Haileybury, and Addiscombe Military Seminary.[65]\\r\\nEast India Company:\\r\\nGeneral:","input":"What did the east india trading company trade?"},{"output":"14,700 years ago","context":"","input":"When did the first dog become a pet?"},{"output":"195 UNFCCC members","context":"The Paris Agreement (French: Accord de Paris), Paris climate accord or Paris climate agreement is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) dealing with greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation and finance starting in the year 2020. The language of the agreement was negotiated by representatives of 196 parties at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC in Paris and adopted by consensus on 12 December 2015.[3][4] As of November 2017, 195 UNFCCC members have signed the agreement, and 172 have become party to it.[1] The Agreement aims to respond to the global climate change threat by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.[5]\\r\\nIn the Paris Agreement, each country determines, plans and regularly reports its own contribution it should make in order to mitigate global warming.[6] There is no mechanism to force[7] a country to set a specific target by a specific date,[8] but each target should go beyond previously set targets.\\r\\nIn June 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the agreement, causing widespread condemnation both internationally and domestically. Under the agreement, the earliest effective date of withdrawal for the U.S. is November 2020, shortly before the end of President Trump's first term.\\r\\nIn July 2017, Frances environment minister Nicolas Hulot announced Frances five-year plan to ban all petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040 as part of the Paris Agreement. Hulot also stated that France would no longer use coal to produce electricity after 2022 and that up to ?4?billion will be invested in boosting energy efficiency.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of the convention is described in Article 2, \\"enhancing the implementation\\" of the UNFCCC through:[10]\\r\\nCountries furthermore aim to reach \\"global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible\\". The agreement has been described as an incentive for and driver of fossil fuel divestment.[11][12]\\r\\nThe Paris deal is the world's first comprehensive climate agreement.[13]\\r\\nThe contributions that each individual country should make in order to achieve the worldwide goal are determined by all countries individually and called \\"nationally determined contributions\\" (NDCs).[6] Article 3 requires them to be \\"ambitious\\", \\"represent a progression over time\\" and set \\"with the view to achieving the purpose of this Agreement\\". The contributions should be reported every five years and are to be registered by the UNFCCC Secretariat.[14] Each further ambition should be more ambitious than the previous one, known as the principle of 'progression'.[15] Countries can cooperate and pool their nationally determined contributions. The Intended Nationally Determined Contributions pledged during the 2015 Climate Change Conference serveunless provided otherwiseas the initial Nationally determined contribution.\\r\\nThe level of NDCs set by each country[8] will set that country's targets. However the 'contributions' themselves are not binding as a matter of international law, as they lack the specificity, normative character, or obligatory language necessary to create binding norms.[16] Furthermore, there will be no mechanism to force[7] a country to set a target in their NDC by a specific date and no enforcement if a set target in an NDC is not met.[8][17] There will be only a \\"name and shame\\" system[18] or as Jnos Psztor, the U.N. assistant secretary-general on climate change, told CBS News (US), a \\"name and encourage\\" plan.[19] As the agreement provides no consequences if countries do not meet their commitments, consensus of this kind is fragile. A trickle of nations exiting the agreement may trigger the withdrawal of more governments, bringing about a total collapse of the agreement.[20]\\r\\nThe NDC Partnership was launched at COP22 in Marrakesh to enhance cooperation so that countries have access to the technical knowledge and financial support they need to achieve large-scale climate and sustainable development targets. The NDC Partnership is?guided by a Steering Committee?composed of developed and developing nations and international institutions, and?facilitated by a Support Unit?hosted by World Resources Institute and?based in Washington, DC and Bonn, Germany. The NDC Partnership is co-chaired by the governments of Germany and Morocco and includes 66 countries and 13 institutional partners.\\r\\nThe negotiators of the Agreement, however, stated that the NDCs and the 2?C reduction target were insufficient; instead, a 1.5?C target is required, noting \\"with concern that the estimated aggregate greenhouse gas emission levels in 2025 and 2030 resulting from the intended nationally determined contributions do not fall within least-cost 2?C scenarios but rather lead to a projected level of 55 gigatonnes in 2030\\", and recognizing furthermore \\"that much greater emission reduction efforts will be required in order to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2?C by reducing emissions to 40 gigatonnes or to 1.5?C\\".[21]\\r\\nAlthough not the sustained temperatures over the long term which the Agreement addresses, in the first half of 2016 average temperatures were about 1.3?C (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the average in 1880, when global record-keeping began.[22]\\r\\nWhen the agreement achieved enough signatures to cross the threshold on 5 October 2016, US President Barack Obama claimed that \\"Even if we meet every target ... we will only get to part of where we need to go.\\" He also said that \\"this agreement will help delay or avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change. It will help other nations ratchet down their emissions over time, and set bolder targets as technology advances, all under a strong system of transparency that allows each nation to evaluate the progress of all other nations.\\"[23][24]\\r\\nThe global stocktake will kick off with a \\"facilitative dialogue\\" in 2018. At this convening, parties will evaluate how their NDCs stack up to the nearer-term goal of peaking global emissions and the long-term goal of achieving net zero emissions by the second half of this century.[25]\\r\\nThe implementation of the agreement by all member countries together will be evaluated every 5 years, with the first evaluation in 2023. The outcome is to be used as input for new nationally determined contributions of member states.[26] The stocktake will not be of contributions/achievements of individual countries but a collective analysis of what has been achieved and what more needs to be done.\\r\\nThe stocktake works as part of the Paris Agreement's effort to create a \\"ratcheting up\\" of ambition in emissions cuts. Because analysts have agreed that the current NDCs will not limit rising temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius, the global stocktake reconvenes parties to assess how their new NDCs must evolve so that they continually reflect a country's \\"highest possible ambition\\".[25]\\r\\nWhile ratcheting up the ambition of NDCs is a major aim of the global stocktake, it assesses efforts beyond mitigation. The 5 year reviews will also evaluate adaptation, climate finance provisions, and technology development and transfer.[25]\\r\\nThe Paris Agreement has a 'bottom up' structure in contrast to most international environmental law treaties which are 'top down', characterised by standards and targets set internationally, for states to implement.[27] Unlike its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, with its emphasis on consensus-building, allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets.[28] The specific climate goals are thus politically encouraged, rather than legally bound. Only the processes governing the reporting and review of these goals are mandated under international law. This structure is especially notable for the United Statesbecause there are no legal mitigation or finance targets, the agreement is considered an \\"executive agreement rather than a treaty\\". Because the UNFCCC treaty of 1992 received the consent of the Senate, this new agreement does not require further legislation from Congress for it to take effect.[28]\\r\\nAnother key difference between the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol is their scopes. While the Kyoto Protocol differentiated between Annex-1 and non-Annex-1 countries, this bifurcation is blurred in the Paris Agreement, as all parties will be required to submit emissions reductions plans.[29] While the Paris Agreement still emphasizes the principle of \\"Common but Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities\\"the acknowledgement that different nations have different capacities and duties to climate actionit does not provide a specific division between developed and developing nations.[29] It therefore appears that negotiators will have to continue to deal with this issue in future negotiation rounds, even though the discussion on differentiation may take on a new dynamic.[30]\\r\\nArticle 6 has been flagged as containing some of the key provisions of the Paris Agreement.[31] Broadly, it outlines the cooperative approaches that parties can take in achieving their nationally determined carbon emissions reductions. In doing so, it helps establish the Paris Agreement as a framework for a global carbon market.[32]\\r\\nParagraphs 6.2 and 6.3 establish a framework to govern the international transfer of mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). The Agreement recognizes the rights of Parties to use emissions reductions outside of their own jurisdiction toward their NDC, in a system of carbon accounting and trading.[32]\\r\\nThis provision requires the \\"linkage\\" of various carbon emissions trading systemsbecause measured emissions reductions must avoid \\"double counting\\", transferred mitigation outcomes must be recorded as a gain of emission units for one party and a reduction of emission units for the other.[31] Because the NDCs, and domestic carbon trading schemes, are heterogeneous, the ITMOs will provide a format for global linkage under the auspices of the UNFCCC.[33] The provision thus also creates a pressure for countries to adopt emissions management systemsif a country wants to use more cost-effective cooperative approaches to achieve their NDCs, they will need to monitor carbon units for their economies.[34]\\r\\nParagraphs 6.4-6.7 establish a mechanism \\"to contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gases and support sustainable development\\".[35] Though there is no specific name for the mechanism as yet, many Parties and observers have informally coalesced around the name \\"Sustainable Development Mechanism\\" or \\"SDM\\".[36][37] The SDM is considered to be the successor to the Clean Development Mechanism, a flexible mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol, by which parties could collaboratively pursue emissions reductions for their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. The Sustainable Development Mechanism lays the framework for the future of the Clean Development Mechanism post-Kyoto (in 2020).\\r\\nIn its basic aim, the SDM will largely resemble the Clean Development Mechanism, with the dual mission to 1. contribute to global GHG emissions reductions and 2. support sustainable development.[38] Though the structure and processes governing the SDM are not yet determined, certain similarities and differences from the Clean Development Mechanism can already be seen. Notably, the SDM, unlike the Clean Development Mechanism, will be available to all parties as opposed to only Annex-1 parties, making it much wider in scope.[39]\\r\\nSince the Kyoto Protocol went into force, the Clean Development Mechanism has been criticized for failing to produce either meaningful emissions reductions or sustainable development benefits in most instances.[40] It has also suffered from the low price of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs), creating less demand for projects. These criticisms have motivated the recommendations of various stakeholders, who have provided through working groups and reports, new elements they hope to see in SDM that will bolster its success.[33] The specifics of the governance structure, project proposal modalities, and overall design are expected to come during the next[when?] Conference of the Parties in Marrakesh.\\r\\nAdaptation issues garnered more focus in the formation of the Paris Agreement. Collective, long-term adaptation goals are included in the Agreement, and countries must report on their adaptation actions, making adaptation a parallel component of the agreement with mitigation.[41] The adaptation goals focus on enhancing adaptive capacity, increasing resilience, and limiting vulnerability.[42]\\r\\nAt the Paris Conference in 2015 where the Agreement was negotiated, the developed countries reaffirmed the commitment to mobilize $100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020, and agreed to continue mobilizing finance at the level of $100 billion a year until 2025.[43] The commitment refers to the pre-existing plan to provide US$100 billion a year in aid to developing countries for actions on climate change adaptation and mitigation.[44]\\r\\nThough both mitigation and adaptation require increased climate financing, adaptation has typically received lower levels of support and has mobilised less action from the private sector.[41] A 2014 report by the OECD found that just 16 percent of global finance was directed toward climate adaptation in 2014.[45] The Paris Agreement called for a balance of climate finance between adaptation and mitigation, and specifically underscoring the need to increase adaptation support for parties most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States. The agreement also reminds parties of the importance of public grants, because adaptation measures receive less investment from the public sector.[41] John Kerry, as Secretary of State, announced that the U.S. would double its grant-based adaptation finance by 2020.[28]\\r\\nSome specific outcomes of the elevated attention to adaptation financing in Paris include the G7 countries' announcement to provide US $420 million for Climate Risk Insurance, and the launching of a Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Initiative.[46] In early March 2016, the Obama administration gave a $500 million grant to the \\"Green Climate Fund\\" as \\"the first chunk of a $3?billion commitment made at the Paris climate talks.\\"[47][48][49] So far, the Green Climate Fund has now received over $10 billion in pledges. Notably, the pledges come from developed nations like France, the US, and Japan, but also from developing countries such as Mexico, Indonesia, and Vietnam.[28]\\r\\nA new issue that emerged[citation needed] as a focal point in the Paris negotiations rose from the fact that many of the worst effects of climate change will be too severe or come too quickly to be avoided by adaptation measures. The Paris Agreement specifically acknowledges the need to address loss and damage of this kind, and aims to find appropriate responses.[50] It specifies that loss and damage can take various formsboth as immediate impacts from extreme weather events, and slow onset impacts, such as the loss of land to sea-level rise for low-lying islands.[28]\\r\\nThe push to address loss and damage as a distinct issue in the Paris Agreement came from the Alliance of Small Island States and the Least Developed Countries, whose economies and livelihoods are most vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change.[28] Developed countries, however, worried that classifying the issue as one separate and beyond adaptation measures would create yet another climate finance provision, or might imply legal liability for catastrophic climate events.\\r\\nIn the end, all parties acknowledged the need for \\"averting, minimizing, and addressing loss and damage\\" but notably, any mention of compensation or liability is excluded.[10] The agreement also adopts the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, an institution that will attempt to address questions about how to classify, address, and share responsibility for loss and damage.[50]\\r\\nWhile each Party's NDC is not legally binding, the Parties are legally bound to have their progress tracked by technical expert review to assess achievement toward the NDC, and to determine ways to strengthen ambition.[51] Article 13 of the Paris Agreement articulates an \\"enhanced transparency framework for action and support\\" that establishes harmonized monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) requirements. Thus, both developed and developing nations must report every two years on their mitigation efforts, and all parties will be subject to both technical and peer review.[51]\\r\\nWhile the enhanced transparency framework is universal, along with the global stocktaking to occur every 5 years, the framework is meant to provide \\"built-in flexibility\\" to distinguish between developed and developing countries' capacities. In conjunction with this, the Paris Agreement has provisions for an enhanced framework for capacity building.[52] The agreement recognizes the varying circumstances of some countries, and specifically notes that the technical expert review for each country consider that country's specific capacity for reporting.[52] The agreement also develops a Capacity-Building Initiative for Transparency to assist developing countries in building the necessary institutions and processes for complying with the transparency framework.[52]\\r\\nThere are several ways in which flexibility mechanisms can be incorporated into the enhanced transparency framework. The scope, level of detail, or frequency of reporting may all be adjusted and tiered based on a country's capacity. The requirement for in-country technical reviews could be lifted for some less developed or small island developing countries. Ways to assess capacity include financial and human resources in a country necessary for NDC review.[52]\\r\\nThe Paris Agreement was opened for signature on 22 April 2016 (Earth Day) at a ceremony in New York.[53] After several European Union states ratified the agreement in October 2016, there were enough countries that had ratified the agreement that produce enough of the world's greenhouse gases for the agreement to enter into force.[54] The agreement went into effect on 4 November 2016.[2]\\r\\nWithin the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, legal instruments may be adopted to reach the goals of the convention. For the period from 2008 to 2012, greenhouse gas reduction measures were agreed in the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. The scope of the protocol was extended until 2020 with the Doha Amendment to that protocol in 2012.[55]\\r\\nDuring the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference, the Durban Platform (and the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action) was established with the aim to negotiate a legal instrument governing climate change mitigation measures from 2020. The resulting agreement was to be adopted in 2015.[56]\\r\\nAt the conclusion of COP 21 (the 21st meeting of the Conference of the Parties, which guides the Conference), on 12 December 2015, the final wording of the Paris Agreement was adopted by consensus by all of the 195 UNFCCC participating member states and the European Union[3] to reduce emissions as part of the method for reducing greenhouse gas. In the 12 page Agreement,[49] the members promised to reduce their carbon output \\"as soon as possible\\" and to do their best to keep global warming \\"to well below 2 degrees C\\" [3.6 degrees F].[57]\\r\\nThe Paris Agreement was open for signature by states and regional economic integration organizations that are parties to the UNFCCC (the Convention) from 22 April 2016 to 21 April 2017 at the UN Headquarters in New York.[58]\\r\\nThe agreement stated that it would enter into force (and thus become fully effective) only if 55 countries that produce at least 55% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions (according to a list produced in 2015)[59] ratify, accept, approve or accede to the agreement.[60][61] On 1 April 2016, the United States and China, which together represent almost 40% of global emissions, issued a joint statement confirming that both countries would sign the Paris Climate Agreement.[62][63] 175 Parties (174 states and the European Union) signed the agreement on the first date it was open for signature.[53][64] On the same day, more than 20 countries issued a statement of their intent to join as soon as possible with a view to joining in 2016. With ratification by the European Union, the Agreement obtained enough parties to enter into effect as of 4 November 2016.\\r\\nBoth the EU and its member states are individually responsible for ratifying the Paris Agreement. A strong preference was reported that the EU and its 28 member states deposit their instruments of ratification at the same time to ensure that neither the EU nor its member states engage themselves to fulfilling obligations that strictly belong to the other,[65] and there were fears that disagreement over each individual member state's share of the EU-wide reduction target, as well as Britain's vote to leave the EU might delay the Paris pact.[66] However, the European Parliament approved ratification of the Paris Agreement on 4 October 2016,[54] and the EU deposited its instruments of ratification on 5 October 2016, along with several individual EU member states.[66]\\r\\nThe process of translating the Paris Agreement into national agendas and implementation has started. One example is the commitment of the least developed countries (LDCs). The LDC Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Initiative for Sustainable Development, known as LDC REEEI, is set to bring sustainable, clean energy to millions of energy-starved people in LDCs, facilitating improved energy access, the creation of jobs and contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.[67]\\r\\nPer analysis from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) a carbon \\"budget\\" based upon total carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere (versus the rate of annual emission) to limit global warming to 1.5C was estimated to be was 2.25 trillion tonnes of overall emitted carbon dioxide from the period since 1870. This number is a notable increase from the number estimated by the original Paris Climate accord estimates (of around 2 trillion tonnes total) total carbon emission limit to meet the 1.5C global warming target, a target that would be met in the year 2020 at current rates of emission. Additionally, the annual emission of carbon is estimated to be currently at 40 billion tonnes emitted per year. The revised IPCC budget for this was based upon CMIP5 climate model. Estimate models using different base-years also provide other slightly adjusted estimates of a carbon \\"budget\\".[68]\\r\\nAs of November 2017, 194 states and the European Union have signed the Agreement. 171 states and the EU, representing more than 87% of global greenhouse gas emissions, have ratified or acceded to the Agreement, including China, the United States (who is intent on leaving) and India, the countries with three of the four largest greenhouse gas emissions of the UNFCC members total (about 42% together).[1][69][70]\\r\\nArticle 28 of the agreement enables parties to withdraw from the agreement after sending a withdrawal notification to the depositary, but notice can be given no earlier than three years after the agreement goes into force for the country. Withdrawal is effective one year after the depositary is notified. Alternatively, the Agreement stipulates that withdrawal from the UNFCCC, under which the Paris Agreement was adopted, would also withdraw the state from the Paris Agreement. The conditions for withdrawal from the UNFCCC are the same as for the Paris Agreement. The agreement does not specify provisions for noncompliance.\\r\\nOn August 4, 2017, the Trump Administration delivered an official notice to the United Nations that the U.S. intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement as soon as it is legally eligible to do so.[71] The formal notice of withdrawal cannot be submitted until the agreement is in force for 3 years for the US, in 2019.[72][73] In accordance with Article 28, as the agreement entered into force in the United States on 4 November 2016, the earliest possible effective withdrawal date for the United States is 4 November 2020. If it chooses to withdraw by way of withdrawing from the UNFCCC, notice could be given immediately (the UNFCCC entered into force for the US in 1994), and be effective one year later.\\r\\nAccording to UNEP the emission cut targets in November 2016 will result in temperature rise by 3?C above preindustrial levels, far above the 2?C of the Paris climate agreement.[74] Twenty years after the Kyoto Protocol fossil fuels are still humanity's primary energy source and energy consumption continues to grow.[75]\\r\\nAccording to a study published in Nature in June 2016, current country pledges are insufficient to meet the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global temperature rise \\"well below 2 C\\".[76][77]\\r\\nA study published in the August 1, 2017, Nature found that all major industrialized nations are failing to meet the pledges they made in the Paris Agreement. In addition to failing to meet their reduction pledge amounts, the countries are not even enacting all the policies that they planned to do in order to meet their pledged reduction of CO2 output.[78]\\r\\nIn addition, an MIT News article written on April 22 , 2016 discussed recent MIT studies on the true impact that the Paris Agreement had on global temperature increase. Using their Integrated Global System Modeling (IGSM) to predict temperature increase results in 2100, they used a wide range of scenarios that included no effort towards climate change past 2030, and full extension of the Paris Agreement past 2030. They concluded that the Paris Agreement would cause temperature decrease by about 0.6 to 1.1 degrees Celsius, with only a 0.1 C change in 2050 for all scenarios. They concluded that, although beneficial, there was strong evidence that the goal provided by the Paris Agreement could not be met in the future under the current circumstances. [79]\\r\\nAlthough the agreement was lauded by many, including French President Fran?ois Hollande and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon,[61] criticism has also surfaced. For example, James Hansen, a former NASA scientist and a climate change expert, voiced anger that most of the agreement consists of \\"promises\\" or aims and not firm commitments.[80] He called the Paris talks a fraud with 'no action, just promises' and feels that only an across the board tax on CO2 emissions, something not part of the Paris Agreement, would force CO2 emissions down fast enough to avoid the worst effects of global warming.[80]\\r\\nInstitutional asset owners associations and think-tanks have also observed that the stated objectives of the Paris Agreement are implicitly \\"predicated upon an assumption ÿ that member states of the United Nations, including high polluters such as China, the US, India, Japan, Brazil, Canada, Russia, Indonesia and Australia, which generate more than half the worlds greenhouse gas emissions, will somehow drive down their carbon pollution voluntarily and assiduously without any binding enforcement mechanism to measure and control CO2 emissions at any level from factory to state, and without any specific penalty gradation or fiscal pressure (for example a carbon tax) to discourage bad behaviour.\\"[81]\\r\\nWorld Pensions Council Director-General Nicolas J. Firzli insisted that, in reality, the role of government signatories would be limited in most instances, and that private sector asset owners would take the lead by expanding massively their investment in \\"clean tech, low-carbon ventures\\" and innovative companies which pursue socially and environmentally sound corporate strategies, regardless of whether the new US administration or other governments renege on their commitments.[81]\\r\\nThe inevitable nature of the secular trend towards divestment from polluting fossil fuels was reconfirmed at 6th annual World Pensions Forum held in Greenwich in February 2017, with all institutional investors in attendance, including U.S. and Canadian pension funds, agreeing that climate-change conscious, responsible investments \\"constitute a [real, ] rising trend: [theyre] here to stay\\".[82]","input":"How many countries are involved in the paris agreement?"},{"output":"Carolyn Rafaelian","context":"Carolyn Rafaelian (born 1966/67) is an American-Armenian entrepreneur and businesswoman.

It was the twelfth-most visited theme park in North America in 2015.[2] The park features 35 rides including roller coasters, family rides, children's rides, water rides, and historical rides, and it employs about 10,000 seasonal and full-time employees.[3]\\r\\nThe theme park sits on the site of a former berry farm established by Walter Knott, Cordelia Knott, and their family. Beginning around 1920, the Knott family sold berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along State Route 39. In 1934, the Knotts began selling fried chicken dinners in a tea room on the property, and the Knotts built several shops and other attractions to entertain visitors. Cordelia Knott's efforts in the Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant were essential to putting Knott's Berry Farm on the map, and the ensuing crowds prompted the creation of even more tourist attractions. In 1940, Walter Knott began constructing a replica ghost town on the property. Knott added several other attractions over the years, and began charging admission to the attractions in 1968. In 1983, Knott's Berry Farm added Camp Snoopy, which began the park's present-day association with the Peanuts characters.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, following the deaths of Walter and Cordelia Knott, their children sold the theme park to Cedar Fair and the family's food business to ConAgra Foods, which subsequently sold it to J. M. Smucker. Cedar Fair has continued to expand the theme park, adding Knott's Soak City in 1999 and adding new rides to the original park.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme park sits on the site of a former berry farm established by Walter Knott and his family. Beginning around 1920, the Knott family sold berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along State Route 39. In 1934, the Knotts began selling fried chicken dinners in a tea room on the property, later called \\"Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant\\". The dinners soon became a major tourist draw, and the Knotts built several shops and other attractions to entertain visitors while waiting for a seat in the restaurant. In 1940, Walter Knott began constructing a replica Ghost Town on the property, the beginning of the present-day theme park. The idea of an amusement park really picked up in the 1950s when Walter Knott opened a \\"summer-long county fair\\".\\r\\nIn 1968, for the first time, an admission price was required to get into the park, originally set at 25 cents. The Calico log ride was added in 1969. The park became a popular destination for conservative college students in the 1960s, especially as conservative organizations like the California Free Enterprise Association, the Libres Foundation, and the Americanism Educational League were based there.[4] According to Assistant Professor Caroline Rolland-Diamond of the Paris West University Nanterre La Dfense:\\r\\nit also appealed to conservative Americans, young and old, because the idealized representation of a past devoid of social and racial tensions that it offered stood in sharp contrast with the political and social upheavals affecting California since the Free Speech Movement erupted at the University of California at Berkeley in 1964.\\r\\nOn April 12, 1974, Cordelia Knott died. Walter turned his attention toward political causes,[6][7] Roaring Twenties[8] re-themed Gypsy Camp in the 1970s with the addition of a nostalgic traditional amusement area, Wheeler Dealer Bumper Cars, Knott's Bear-y Tales.

Parachute Sky Jump boarded one or two standing riders anticipating the thrill of the drop into baskets beneath a faux parachute canopy. From the top, eight arms supported the vertical cable tracks of wire rope which lifted the baskets. The Sky Cabin ringed the support pole with a single floor of seats that are enclosed behind windows. The Sky Cabin ring revolves slowly as it rises to the top and back offering a pleasantly changing vista. Sky Cabin is very sensitive to weather and passenger motion, such as walking, which is prohibited during the trip. During winds 25+?mph or rain it is closed. When built, Sky Tower was the tallest structure in Orange County (a distinction briefly held by WindSeeker before its relocation to Worlds of Fun in 2012.)\\r\\nMotorcycle Chase, modernized steeplechase rollercoaster built in 1976 by Arrow Development, featured single motorbike themed vehicles racing side-by-side, each on one of four parallel tracks, launched together.[9] One or two riders straddled each \\"Indian motorcycle\\" attraction vehicle. The tubular steel monorail track closely followed dips and bumps in \\"the road\\" and tilted to lean riders about the curves. Gasoline Alley, an electric steel-guiderail car ride below, was built together and intimately intertwined, which enhanced ride-to-ride interaction thrill value.[10] Rider safety concerns of the high center of gravity coupled with the method of rider restraints caused it to be re-themed Wacky Soap Box Racers with vehicles now attached in four car trains, each car seated two riders, strapped in low (nearly straddling the track), surrounded by the close fitting car sides, and the dips and bumps of the track were straightened flat in 1980. Motorcycle Chase/Wacky Soap Box Racers was removed 1996 for a dueling loop coaster Windjammer Surf Racers and now Xcelerator, a vertical launch coaster, takes its place.\\r\\nOn December 3, 1981, Walter Knott died, survived by his children who would continue to operate Knott's as a family business for another fourteen years.\\r\\nIn the 1980s, Knott's built the Barn Dance featured Bobbi & Clyde as the house band. It was during the height of the \\"Urban Cowboy\\" era. The \\"Barn Dance\\" was featured in Knott's TV Commercials.\\r\\nDuring the 1980s, Knott's met the competition in Southern California theme parks by theming a new land and building two massive attractions:\\r\\nThe Boomerang roller coaster replaced the Corkscrew[8] in 1990 with a lift shuttle train passing to and fro through a cobra roll and a vertical loop for six inversions each trip.\\r\\nMystery Lodge (1994),[11] inspired by General Motors \\"Spirit Lodge\\" pavilion, was a live show augmented with Pepper's ghost and other special effects, which was among the most popular exhibits at Expo 86 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which was produced by Bob Rogers of BRC Imagination Arts[12] and created with the assistance of the Kwagulth Native reserve in the village of Alert Bay, British Columbia.[13] Mystery Lodge recreates a quiet summer night in Alert Bay, then guests \\"move inside\\" the longhouse and listen to the storyteller weave a tale of the importance of family from the smoke of the bonfire.\\r\\nThe Jaguar! was opened June 17, 1995, to add another roller coaster to the mix of Fiesta Village alongside Montezooma's Revenge.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, after Walter and Cordelia died, their children decided to sell off their businesses:\\r\\nIn the late 1990s Cedar Fair acquired the Buena Park Hotel at the corner of Grand Ave. and Crescent. It was then brought up to Radisson standards and branded Radisson Resort Hotel as a franchise. In 2004, the park renamed the Radisson Resort Hotel the Knott's Berry Farm Resort Hotel.\\r\\nIn 1995, the Knott family sold the food specialty business to ConAgra Foods, which later re-sold the brand to The J.M. Smucker Company in 2008.\\r\\nIn 1997, the Knott family sold the amusement park operations to Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Initially, the Knotts were given an opportunity to sell the park to The Walt Disney Company. The park would have been amalgamated into the Disneyland Resort and converted into Disney's America, which had previously failed to be built near Washington, D.C. The Knotts refused to sell the park to Disney out of fear most of what Walter Knott had built would be eliminated.\\r\\nSince being acquired by Cedar Fair, the park has seen an aggressive shift towards thrill rides, with the construction of a number of large roller coasters and the addition of a high-performance Shoot-the-Chutes ride Perilous Plunge. Perilous Plunge had the record of being the tallest and steepest water ride in the world until September 2012 when it was closed and removed.[14] Also, in 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced that the most popular ride at the park, the Timber Mountain Log Ride, would be closed for a major five-month refurbishment, led by Garner Holt Productions, Inc.[15]\\r\\nOn May 25, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm added three new family rides on the site of former Perilous Plunge. They include: Coast Rider (wild mouse roller coaster), Pacific Scrambler (Scrambler ride) and Surfside Gilders. All three of the rides added to the Boardwalk theme. The old bridge which connected the exit of Perlious Plunge and the boardwalk is now used as the entrance to Surfside Gilders and Pacific Scrambler. The Boomerang roller coaster was also repainted a lime-green color as part of the Boardwalk expansion.\\r\\nOn September 2, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced that Windseeker would be removed from the park. The ride was removed and sent to Worlds of Fun for the 2014 season.\\r\\nOn November 22, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm made a major announcement for the 2014 operating season; the famous and historical Calico Mine Ride would be closed for a major six-month refurbishment beginning in January 2014.[16]\\r\\nThe park's annual Knott's Scary Farm has drawn crowds since 1973. The idea for this event was presented at one of the regularly scheduled round table meetings for managers by Patricia Pawson. The actual event was created by Bill Hollingshead, Gary Salisbury, Martha Boyd and Gene Witham, along with other members of the Knott's Berry Farm Entertainment Department as documented in the DVD Season of Screams. Initially fake corpses and other static figures were rented from Hollywood prop house, but Bud Hurlbut, the creator/concessionaire of the Mine Ride, Log Ride and other rides at Knott's, decided that this wasn't enough.[25] He dressed up in a gorilla suit, and started scaring guests on the Mine Ride. Halloween Haunt was an instant hit, and by the next year, the event sold out nightly.[26] During this special ticketed event, the entire park (or major portions of it) re-themes itself into a \\"haunted house\\" style attraction in the form of mazes and \\"scare zones\\" in the evening. Over a thousand specially employed monsters are also scatteredoften hidden out of viewthroughout the park at this time. Some of the characters have become well-known, such as the green witch, which has been portrayed by Charlene Parker since 1983, the longest of any performer.[27][28][29][30][31][32][33] Several attractions are decorated for the event including the Timber Mountain Log Ride and Calico Mine Train and there are 13 mazes of various themes. Elvira (actress Cassandra Peterson) was introduced into the Halloween Event in 1982 and was prominently featured in many Halloween Haunt events until 2001. According to postings on her My Space page, Cassandra was released from her contract by the park's new owners due to their wanting a more family friendly appeal,[34] although she returned for one night in 2012 for the 40th anniversary of the event and has returned as a regular performer throughout the run of the event for the last several years.[35] During the month of October, Knott's Scary Farm generates half the revenue for Knott's Berry Farm's fiscal year.[citation needed]\\r\\nSeason of Screams is a DVD produced by an independent company which traces the beginnings of Halloween Haunt and the story behind how it all got started back in 1973. Season of Screams also highlights recent Halloween Haunts.\\r\\nWinter Coaster Solace is an event that takes place in the first or second weekend of March every year when roller coaster enthusiasts can come before the park opens and stay after the park closes to ride the rides and eat at the Chicken Dinner Restaurant. It is intended to provide \\"solace\\" to visitors from other parts of the country where theme parks and roller coasters are seasonal, not year-round operations like the Southern California parks. Knott's Berry Farm also used to give attendees behind the scenes tours of the rides.\\r\\nEvery year since 1991, Knott's has offered free admission to veterans and their families during the month of November. Though this was originally started as a tribute to returning Gulf War veterans, they subsequently expanded it to include all veterans and have run it every year since.\\r\\nA Christmas event known as \\"Knott's Merry Farm\\" also happens annually. Previous Merry Farm events have included manufactured snow, handcrafts exhibits, and a visit with Santa Claus. This event was originally created by Gary Salisbury in the Fall of 1985.\\r\\nPraise (festival) has been a Christian themed celebration presented many years as a mix-in special event of music and comedy on New Year's Eve.\\r\\nThe park consists of five themed areas:\\r\\nCraftsmen in Ghost Town demonstrate the arts of the blacksmith, woodcarver, glass-blower, sign cutter, and spinner. Demonstrations of narrow gauge railroading and farm equipment hobbyists accompany additional merchant stalls of cottage-craft fairs seasonally at discounted admission which is restricted to Ghost Town only.\\r\\nWestern Trails Museum, relocated between the candy store and the General Store to accommodate Bigfoot Rapids, still features historical western artifacts large and small, from a hand powered horse-drawn fire engine to miniature replica of a borax hauling \\"Twenty Mule Team\\" and utensils necessary to survive the prairie and wilderness.\\r\\nThe Ghost Town area has a few other notable attractions. The Bird Cage Theatre only hosts two seasonal entertainmentsduring \\"Knott's Merry Farm,\\" two small productions of \\"The Gift of the Magi\\" and \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" and a Halloween Haunt thrill show. The Calico Stage, a large open-air stage in Calico Square, hosts a variety of shows and acts, big and small, from those of elementary school students, Gallagher, a local band, and the summer-spectacular All Wheels Extreme stunt show featuring youthful performers demonstrating aerial tricks with acrobatics, trampolines, and riding ramps with skates, scooters, skateboards, and freestyle bikes to popular music. Calico Saloon recreates the revelry of music, singing and dancing, with Cameo Kate hosting a variety of acts. Jersey Lily, Judge Roy Bean's combination courthouse/saloon, offers certified comical \\"genuine illegal hitchin'\\" alongside pickles, candy, and sports/soft drinks.\\r\\nMany parts of Ghost Town are forever lost to progress. The conversion of the Silver Dollar Saloon to a shooting gallery, Hunters Paradise shooting gallery to Panda Express and the original Berry Stand, moved several times with its last location now occupied by the Silver Bullet station.\\r\\nWhat is left of Ghost Town today was based on Calico ghost town and other real ghost towns in the Western United States such as Prescott, Arizona. Walter Knott inherited his uncle's silver mill and land, then bought more of the actual Calico ghost town in 1951 and developed it. In 1966, he donated that property to the corporate-municipal County of San Bernardino which then made the town of Calico, California into a public historic park, for which it charged an entrance/parking fee. See 'History?ÿ Ghost Town?ÿ Calico' section above.\\r\\nWild Water Wilderness is a section of Ghost Town that features two major rides: the Bigfoot Rapids river rafting adventure, and Pony Express, a horse themed family roller coaster installed in 2008. Nearby Bigfoot Rapids is Rapids Trader, a small merchandise stand. It is also home to Mystery Lodge, a multimedia show based on an Expo 86 pavilion featuring a Native American storyteller.\\r\\nFiesta Village was built in 1969 with a pop-culture Mexican theme. It was the second area constructed after the completion of Ghost Town. Stores like Casa California, restaurants like Pancho's Tacos, La Papa Loca, and La Victoria Cantina, games like Shoot If Yucan, and the themed rides like La Revoluci܇n, Jaguar!, and Montezooma's Revenge, along with the former attraction Tampico Tumbler, all contribute to the Mexican and Aztec theme of the area. In 2013 colorful string lights were added for the summer season.\\r\\nOriginally themed as Gypsy Camp, and later re-themed to the \\"Roaring '20s\\", \\"Knott's Airfield\\", then \\"The Boardwalk\\", this area is home to the most of Knott's major thrill rides.\\r\\nBoardwalk Games include physical challenges such as a rock wall, soccer, basketball and a rope ladder crawl. A variety of traditional pitch three balls and win a prize type games, such as squirt gun into clowns mouth, knock off milk bottles, pitch a quarter onto a plate are pitched by hawkers along the Boardwalk Games midway. In September 2012, Perilous Plunge closed for an expansion of the Boardwalk. Perilous Plunge was noticeably known as one of Knott's major thrill rides. The boardwalk reopened after a year transformation with two flat rides and a new family roller coaster taking the spot of Perilous Plunge. The Boomerang roller coaster also got repainted with a new vibrant green and yellow color scheme.\\r\\nThe world's largest Johnny Rockets restaurant franchise is located at Knott's Boardwalk, featuring over 5,900 square feet (550?m2) of indoor dining space for more than 260 guests.\\r\\nCamp Snoopy is home to the park's family and children's rides, with many of the rides and attractions being built specifically for children and guests who cannot ride the park's more aggressive attractions. Its theme is Charles M. Schulz' \\"Peanuts\\" comic strip characters. Snoopy has been the mascot of Knott's Berry Farm since 1983, and the characters can now be seen at all of Cedar Fair's parks, except Gilroy Gardens, which is managed by Cedar Fair and owned by the city of Gilroy. The 14 rides include a mini roller coaster called the Timberline Twister, a mini-scrambler called the Log Peeler, a Zamperla Rockin' Tug called Lucy's Tugboat, and a steel spinning roller coaster called Sierra Sidewinder. Snoopy Bounce is a small attraction for kids. However, it is not considered a ride at the park. For guests who cannot ride the park's more aggressive and thrilled rides, Camp Snoopy contains a good number of rides for guests of all ages including infants, children, and seniors. With the exception of Sierra Sidewinder and Timberline Twister, the rides are relativity tame and not aggressive.\\r\\nKnott's Berry Farm also built the Mall of America's indoor theme park, which itself was originally called Camp Snoopy. (In fact, Charles M. Schulz hailed from St. Paul.) However, today the park is no longer affiliated with Knott's or Cedar Fair, and is now called Nickelodeon Universe.\\r\\nOn November 22, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced major improvements in the area of Camp Snoopy. Camp Snoopy will receive a makeover as the section is approaching its 30th anniversary. In summer 2014, Knott's Berry Farm will open up new rides in Camp Snoopy.[16]\\r\\nThe 2?ft (610?mm) narrow gauge[42] Grand Sierra Scenic Railroad takes guest on a four-minute train ride through the reflection lake. The ride was made shorter with the construction of Silver Bullet.\\r\\nLocated next to the Bottle House in Ghost Town, Indian Trails is a small area sandwiched between Camp Snoopy, Ghost Town, and Fiesta Village, showcasing Native American art, crafts, and dance. One ride is located in this area. It is called Butterfield Stagecoach which is a family ride where an actual stagecoach take guest on a circular ride through Fiesta Village and Camp Snoopy. It is one of the original rides at the park. The ride was developed directly by the park and it opened in 1949.\\r\\nMany of the original attractions are outside the gates of the current-day theme park along Grand Ave. at the California Marketplace, mostly things which would no longer be considered interesting to today's audience, or things which were merely there for decoration. Near the restrooms behind Berry Place are the waterfall overshooting the water wheel and historic gristmill grindstone, a replica of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate fireplace hearth, and what remains of the visible beehive.

The backlash was focused on Cedar Fair's use of painful experiences suffered by those dealing with mental illness and to have it \\"transmogrified into spooky entertainment\\".[45] In response, Cedar Fair removed \\"5150\\" from the name, and after continued opposition, permanently closed the attraction on September 28, 2016, only six days after its debut.[47][48] A petition was signed by more than 2,000 people hoping Cedar Fair would bring it back, with the petition's organizer stating that Cedar Fair shouldn't be \\"forced to shut down an attraction based on the words of people who had not even experienced the attraction\\".[49]\\r\\nKnott's Soak City is Knott's Berry Farm's water park.

By 1924, Charles had become familiar with the Springfield area, having traveled by train to sell auto parts throughout the territory. By 1932, he had become manager of Link Motor Supply in Springfield, and one of his sons, Charles H. (Chub) OReilly, joined the company. Together they provided the leadership and management that made Link the predominant auto parts store in the area.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1957, Link planned a reorganization, which would have included the retirement of 72-year-old Charles F. OReilly, and the transfer of Chub OReilly to Kansas City. Since neither agreed with these plans, they made the decision to form their own company, OReilly Automotive, Inc. They opened for business on December 2, 1957, with one store and 13 employees at 403 Sherman in Springfield. Their sales totaled $700,000 in 1958, their first full year of business. By 1961, the companys volume had reached $1.3 million  the combined volume of OReilly Automotive and Ozark Automotive Distributors, a division formed to serve independent automotive jobbers in the area. In March 1975, annual sales volume rose to $7 million and a 52,000 square-foot facility at 233 S. Patterson was built for the OReilly/Ozark warehouse operation.

The film explores the life and imagination of  Ishaan, an 8-year-old  dyslexic child. Although he excels in art, his poor academic performance leads his parents to send him to a boarding school. Ishaan's new art teacher suspects that he is dyslexic and helps him to overcome his disability. Darsheel Safary stars as 8-year-old Ishaan, and Khan plays his art teacher. Creative director and writer Amole Gupte initially developed the idea with his wife Deepa Bhatia, who served as the film's editor.  ShankarÿEhsaanÿLoy composed the film's score, and Prasoon Joshi wrote the lyrics for many of the songs. Principal photography took place in Mumbai and in Panchgani's New Era High School, and some of the school's students make appearances.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film made its theatrical debut in India on 21 December 2007, and UTV Home Entertainment released a DVD for Indian audiences in 2008. Disney's later release of the international edition DVD marked the first purchase of distribution rights for an Indian film by a global company.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaare Zameen Par has received numerous awards, including the Filmfare Award for Best Film for 2008 and the 2008 National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare. It was India's official entry for the 2009 Academy Awards Best Foreign Film, but did not progress to the short-list.\\r\\n\\r\\nEight-year old Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi dislikes school and fails every test or exam. He finds all subjects difficult, and is belittled and berated by his teachers and classmates. However, Ishaan's internal world is full of wonders that he is unable to convey to others, magical lands filled with colour and animated animals. He is also an artist whose talent is unrecognised.\\r\\n\\r\\nIshaan's father, Nandkishore Awasthi, is a successful executive who expects his children to excel. Ishaan's mother, housewife Maya Awasthi, is frustrated by her inability to educate her son. Ishaan's elder brother, Yohaan, is an exemplary scholar and athlete, which Ishaan is frequently reminded of.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter receiving a particularly poor academic report, Ishaan's parents send him to a boarding school. There he sinks into a state of fear and depression, despite being befriended by Rajan Damodharan, a physically disabled boy and one of the top students in the class. He even contemplates suicide by climbing up the fence in a terrace, which Rajan manages to save him from.\\r\\n\\r\\nIshaan's situation changes when a new art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh, joins the school's faculty. An instructor at the Tulips School for young children with developmental disabilities, Nikumbh's teaching style is markedly different from that of his strict predecessor, and he quickly observes that Ishaan is unhappy and contributes little to class activities. He reviews Ishaan's work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of dyslexia.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his day off, Nikumbh sets off to Mumbai, to visit Ishaan's parents. Nikumbh is surprised to learn that Ishaan is passionate about painting, and shows great talent in art. Nikumbh then asks Awasthi as to why he sent Ishaan to a boarding school. Awasthi replies that Ishaan was an ill-mannered boy and was a poor student. Nikumbh shows Ishaan's mother her son's notebooks and gives an analysis of the script. Nikumbh deduces that Ishaan has severe difficulty in understanding letters and words. Awasthi tries to dismiss it as a mere excuse for Ishaan's laziness. Nikumbh demonstrates what Ishaan experiences every day at school. He states that Ishaan has dyslexia and may well be having other conditions, which make him a difficult child.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill unsatisfied with Nikumbh's interpretation, Awasthi bluntly dismisses Ishaan's disability as mental retardation, which frustrates Nikumbh, who criticises Awasthi for his crude and inaccurate explanation of Ishaan's condition. Nikumbh argues that Ishaan is an above-average child whose condition suppresses his artistic and mental talent, leading Awasthi to feel regret for his treatment of Ishaan.\\r\\n\\r\\nNikumbh returns, and subsequently brings up the topic of dyslexia in class, and offers a list of famous people who were dyslexic. Later, Nikumbh reveals to Ishaan, that he too is a dyslexic and faced problems similar to Ishaan. Nikumbh then visits the school's principal and obtains his permission to become Ishaan's tutor. He attempts to improve Ishaan's reading and writing by using remedial techniques developed by dyslexia specialists; Ishaan soon develops an interest in language and mathematics, and his grades improve.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the end of the school year, Nikumbh organises an art fair for the staff and students. The competition is judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Ishaan's father thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan gets into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh, who gives him a hug and tells him to return next year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe husband and wife team of Amole Gupte and Deepa Bhatia developed the story that would eventually become Taare Zameen Par as a way of understanding why some children cannot conform to a conventional educational system. Their initial work began as a short story that evolved into a screenplay over seven years. Deepa Bhatia later stated in an interview with The Hindu that her original inspiration was not dyslexia but rather the childhood of Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who performed poorly in school. Her goal was thus to explore the story of \\"a child who did not fit into the school stream.\\" She referenced a specific moment in Kurosawa's biography where he began to excel after meeting an attentive art teacher, and noted that this scene \\"became the inspiration for how a teacher could transform the life of a student\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn developing the character of a young boy based on Kurosawa, Bhatia and Gupte explored some possible reasons why he failed in school. Their research led them to groups such as the Maharashtra Dyslexia Association and Parents for a Better Curriculum for the Child (PACE). Dyslexia eventually became the central topic and theme of the film. The pair worked with dyslexic children to research and develop the screenplay, basing characters and situations on their observations. Bhatia and Gupte carefully concealed the children's identities in the final version of the script.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n Aamir Khan[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nKhan and Gupte first met in college. Khan has said that he admired Gupte's abilities as an actor, writer, and painter. Three years before the film's release Gupte brought Khan to the project as a producer and actor. Gupte himself was to direct,[12] but the first week's dailies were a great disappointment to Khan, who \\"lost faith in Amol and his capability of translating on screen what he had so beautifully written on paper\\".[13] Khan was on the verge of withdrawing his participation in the film because of these \\"creative differences\\",[13][14] but Gupte kept him onboard by stepping down as director. Contrary to Khan's claim, Gupte lashed out saying that after the wrap-up party, Khan announced that he was the director of the film, despite Gupte acting as director.[15] Had it been necessary to hire a third party, production would have been postponed for 6ÿ8?months as the new director prepared for the film. Keen to keep Safary as Ishaanthe actor might have aged too much for the part had production been delayedKhan took over the role of director.[13] Taare Zameen Par was Khan's first experience in the dual role of actor and director. He has admitted that the transition was challenging, stating that while he had always wanted to direct a film, it was unknown territory for him.[16] Gupte remained on set, \\"guiding [Khan] and, at times, even correcting [him]\\".[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially the film was to retain the short story's title of \\"High Jump\\", because of Ishaan's inability to achieve the high jump in gym class. This subplotfilmed but later cuttied into the original ending for the movie. In this rendition, a \\"ghost image\\" separates from Ishaan after the art competition and runs to the sports field; the film would end on a freeze frame of Ishaan successfully making the leap. Khan, however, was unhappy with that proposed ending and convinced Gupte to rewrite it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the working title no longer relevant,[17] Khan, Gupte, and Bhatia discussed several alternatives,[18] eventually deciding on Taare Zameen Par. Possible translations of this title include Stars on the Ground[19] and Stars on Earth.[20] According to Khan:\\r\\n\\r\\nTaare Zameen Par is a film about children and it is a film which celebrates the abilities of children. Taare Zameen Par is a title which denotes that aspect. It is a title with a very positive feel to it. All the kids are special and wonderful. They are like stars on earth. This particular aspect gave birth to the title.[18]\\r\\nPrincipal photography for the film took place in India over five months.[21] Khan spent his first two days as director blocking the first scene to be filmedIshaan returning home from school and putting away his recently collected fishand becoming comfortable with his new responsibilities.[22] Believing that the audience should not be aware of the camera, he chose a simple shooting style for the film that involved relatively little camera movement.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, Khan also made use of illusory camera tricks. For example, the opening scene of Ishaan collecting fish outside his school was shot on location and at Film City. Shots focusing on Ishaan took place at the former, while those involving the gutter terrarium were filmed at a water tank at the latter. The tank's water often became murky because the mud would rise to the top, forcing production to constantly empty and refill it. Due to this hindrance, the scene took eight hours to film.[24] The film's next sequence involved Ishaan playing with two dogs. To compensate for the \\"absolutely petrified\\" Safary, most joint shots used a body double, though other portions integrated close-up shots of the actor.[25] Ishaan's nightmarehe becomes separated from his mother at a train station and she departs on a train while he is trapped in a crowdwas filmed in Mumbai on a permanent railway-station set. To work around the train set piece's immobility, production placed the camera on a moving trolley to create the illusion of a departing train. For the sequences related from the mother's point of viewshot from behind the actressChopra stood on a trolley next to a recreated section of the train's door.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the school sequences were filmed on location. The production team searched for a Mumbai school with an \\"oppressive\\" feel to establish the \\"heaviness of being in a metropolitan school\\",[27] and eventually chose St. Xavier's School.[28] As the school is situated along a main road filming took place on weekends, to minimise the background noise, but an early scene in which Ishaan is sent out of the classroom was filmed on the day of the Mumbai Marathon. The production staff placed acrylic sheets invisible to the naked eye on the classroom windows to mask the sounds of nearby crowds and helicopters.[29] New Era High School served as Ishaan's boarding school. The change of setting was a \\"breath of fresh air\\" for the production crew, who moved from Ishaan's small house in Mysore Colony, Chembur to the \\"vast, beautiful environs\\" of Panchgani.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction relied on stock footage for the brief scene of a bird feeding its babies. Khan carefully selected a clip to his liking, but learned three weeks before the film's release that the footage was not available in the proper format. With three days to replace it or else risk delaying the release, Khan made do with what he could find. He says that he \\"cringes\\" every time he sees it.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nReal schoolchildren participated throughout the movie's filming. Khan credited them with the film's success, and was reportedly very popular with them.[16] Furthermore, Khan placed a high priority on the day-to-day needs of his child actors, and went to great lengths to attend to them.[18] The production staff made sure that the students were never idle, and always kept them occupied outside of filming.[32] New Era Faculty Coordinator Douglas Lee thought the experience not only helped the children to learn patience and co-operation, but also gave them a better understanding of how they should behave towards children like Ishaan who have problems in school.[33] Because filming at New Era High School occurred during the winter holiday, those portraying Ishaan's classmates gave up their vacation to participate.[34] To fill in the campus background, students from nearby schools were also brought in.[35] A total of 1,500?children were used for wide-shots of the film's art-fair climax; medium shots only required 400?students.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew to acting, the children often made errors such as staring into the camera, and Khan resorted to unorthodox methods to work around their rookie mistakes. For example, an early scene in the film featured a school assembly; Khan wanted the students to act naturally and to ignore the principal's speech, but recognised that this would be a difficult feat with cameras present. First Assistant Director Sunil Pandey spoke continuously in an attempt to \\"bore the hell out of [them]\\", and they eventually lost interest in the filming and behaved normally.[37] A later scene involved Nikumbh enlightening his class about famous people who suffer from dyslexia, and the children's responses to his speech were the last portion to be filmed. Having already spent 3ÿ4?days hearing the dialogue the children's reactions were \\"jaded\\". Khan opted to film them while he recited a tale, and manipulated his storytelling to achieve the varying spontaneous reactions.[38] The following scene had the children playing around a nearby pond. Horrified when he learned that the water was 15 feet (4.6?m) deep, Khan recruited four lifeguards in case a child fell in.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nKhan found it important that the audience connect the film to real children, and had Pandey travel throughout India filming documentary-style footage of children from all walks of life. Those visuals were integrated into the end credits.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile claymation has been used in Indian television commercials,[41] the film's title sequencea representation of Ishaan's imagination[42]marked its first instance in a Bollywood film.[43] Khan gave claymation artist Dhimant Vyas free rein over the various elements.[44] The storyboarding took one and a half months and the shooting required 15?days.[41] The \\"3 into 9\\" sequence, in which Ishaan delves into his imagination to solve a math problem, was originally conceived as a 3D animation. Halfway through its creation, however, Khan felt it was not turning out as he had envisioned it. Khan scrapped the project and hired Vaibhav Kumaresh, who hand-drew the scene as a 2D animation.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nArtist Samir Mondal composed Ishaan and Nikumbh's art-fair watercolour paintings. He held a workshop with the schoolchildren, and incorporated elements from their artwork into Ishaan's.[46] Mondal also instructed Khan on a painter's typical mannerisms and movements.[47] Gupte created the rest of Ishaan's artwork and Assistant Art Director Veer Nanavati drew Ishaan's flipbook.[48] The art department's designs for Ishaan's school notebooks disappointed Khan, who had familiarised himself with dyslexic writing. Using his left hand, Khan instead wrote it himself.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe musical sequence of \\"Jame Raho\\" establishes the characters of the four members of Ishaan's family; for example, the father is hardworking and responsible, and Yohaan is an \\"ideal son\\" who does all the right things. A robotic style of music overlaps most of the sequencethis is mirrored by the machine-like morning routines of the mother, father, and Yohaanbut changes for Ishaan's portion to imply that he is different from the rest. This concept is furthered by speed ramping and having the camera sway with the music to create a distinct style.[50] The twilight scenes of \\"Maa\\" were a particular issue for the production crew. Because the specific lighting only lasted ten to fifteen minutes a day, the scenes took nearly ten evenings to film. Production at one time considered having a child singing, but ultimately deemed it too over the top and felt it would connect to more people if sung by an adult. Shankar initially performed the song as a samplethey planned to replace him with another singerbut production eventually decided that his rendition was best.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIshaan's truancy scenehe leaves school one day after realising that his mother has not signed his failed math testoriginally coincided with the song \\"Kholo Kholo,\\" but Khan did not believe it worked well for the situation. In his opinion, the accompanying song should focus on what a child wantsto be freeand be told from the first-person perspective instead of \\"Kholo Kholo\\"'s second person. When Khan took over as director, he opted to use \\"Mera Jahan\\"a song written by Gupteand moved \\"Kholo Kholo\\" to the art fair. Viewers of test screenings were divided over the truancy scene. Half thoroughly enjoyed it but the rest complained that it was too long, did not make sense, and merely showed \\"touristy\\" visuals of Mumbai. Khan nevertheless kept the scene, because he \\"connected deeply\\" with it and felt that it established Ishaan's world.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nShiamak Davar choreographed the dance sequence of \\"Bum Bum Bole,\\" and was given free rein over its design. He had intended to use 40?students from his dance school, but Khan did not want trained dancers.[34] Davar gave the children certain cues and a general idea of what to do, but left the style and final product up to them to avoid a choreographed appearance.[53] Time constraints meant that while Khan was busy filming \\"Bum Bum Bole,\\" Ram Madhvani took over as director for \\"Bheja Kum\\".[34][54] The latter sequence, containing a \\"fun-filled\\" song of rhythmic dialogue,[55] allowed the audience to perceive how Ishaan sees the world and written languages. It was intended to represent \\"a young boy's worst nightmare, in terms of?... the worst thing that he can think of\\"; Madhvani based the visual concept on his son's fear of \\"creepy-crawlies\\" such as cockroaches, dragonflies, and lizards.[56] Tata Elxsi's Visual Computing Labs made the creatures out of the English alphabet and numbers, although Khan insisted they include the Hindi alphabet as not all the audience would be familiar with English.[56][57] The chalkboard writing's transformation into a snake was included to surprise the audience and \\"end the song on a high note.\\"[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn writing the song \\"Taare Zameen Par,\\" lyricist Prasoon Joshi followed the theme of \\"however much you talk about children, it's not enough.\\" Every line throughout the song describes children, and only one repeats: \\"Kho Naa Jaaye Yeh / Taare Zameen Par\\" (\\"Let us not lose these / Little stars on earth\\").[58] The song is mostly set to the annual day performance by the developmentally disabled children of Tulips School. Actual students from Tulips School and Saraswati Mandir participated, and were filmed over a period of five days.[59] The sequence originally featured numerous dance performances, but was trimmed down when test audiences found it too long.[60] A song accompanying the scene in which Ishaan's mother is watching home videos of her son was also cut, and replaced with background music after test audiences expressed their opposition to yet another song.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nTiming and other aspects are usually planned when scoring a film, but Khan chose to take a more improvised approach. Instead of using a studio, he and the trio ShankarÿEhsaanÿLoy recorded it at Khan's home in Panchgani, to clear their heads and not be in the mindset of the city. As they watched the film, Khan pointed out when he wanted music to begin and of what type. Ehsaan Noorani noted that this strategy allowed the score to have a \\"spontaneity to it.\\"[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent styles of background music were used to convey certain things. For example, a guitar is played when Ishaan is tense or upset, sometimes with discordant notes.[24] The music of the opening scenethe recurring \\"Ishaan's Theme,\\" which represents the character's peace of mindoverpowers the background noise to show that Ishaan is lost in his own world; the noise becomes louder after he snaps back to reality.[64] But the scene in which Nikumbh explains dyslexia to Ishaan's family took the opposite approach. Silent at first, the music is slowly introduced as the father begins to understand his son's dilemma. The almost seven-minute long scene scarcely used any background music, to slow the pace and make it seem more realistic.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nTaare Zameen Par was released worldwide on 21 December 2007, although countries such as Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Fiji opened it on 20 December.[66][67] It debuted in India with 425?prints,[67][68] although revenue-sharing issues between the film's distributors and theatre owners caused some slight delays.[67] The movie grossed ?150 million (US$2.1?million) domestically within the first three days.[68] Its theatre occupancy in Mumbai dropped to 58 percent during its third week, but climbed back to 62 percent the following weekthis brought the total to ?770 million (US$11?million)after the Maharashtra government granted the film exemption from the entertainment tax. Anticipating further tax exemption in other states, world distributor PVR Pictures circulated 200 more prints of the film.[69] The film completed its domestic run with $19,779,215.[66] To reach more audiences, the film was later dubbed in the regional languages of Tamil and Telugu. Both were scheduled for release on 12 September 2008, the former under the title Vaalu Nakshatram.[70] It grossed $1,223,869 in the US by its seventh week, and S351,303 in the UK by its ninth week.[71] Reports regarding the film's worldwide gross have conflicted, with sources citing ?889.7 million (US$12?million),[4] ?1.07 billion (US$15?million),[72] ?1.31 billion (US$18?million),[3] and ?1.35 billion (US$19?million).[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to Khan's support for the Narmada Bachao Andolan and his criticism of Chief Minister Narendra Modi,[74][75] approximately 50?activists of the Sardar Patel Group conducted protests outside of PVR and INOX theatres in Vadodara, Gujarat. The group also issued statements to all the multiplexes of Gujarat, suggesting that the film not be screened unless Khan apologised for his comments.[74][76] The INOX cinema eventually boycotted the film; INOX Operations Manager Pushpendra Singh Rathod stated that \\"INOX is with Gujarat, and not isolated from it\\".[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Dyslexia Association screened Taare Zameen Par  on 29 October 2008 in Seattle, Washington. Khan noted in his official blog that there were about 200?people in the audience and that he was \\"curious to see the response of a non-Indian audience to what we had made.\\" He felt some concern that Taare Zameen Par was shown in a conference room rather than a cinema hall and was projected as a DVD rather than as a film. He said that the showing concluded to an \\"absolutely thunderous standing ovation\\" which \\"overwhelmed\\" him and that he \\"saw the tears streaming down the cheeks of the audience.\\" Khan also noted that the reaction to the film \\"was exactly as it had been with audiences back home in India\\".[77][78]\\r\\n\\r\\nTaare Zameen Par received positive reviews from critics. Subhash K. Jha suggests that the film is \\"a work of art, a water painting where the colors drip into our hearts, which could easily have fallen into the motions of over-sentimentality. Aamir Khan holds back where he could easily resort to an extravagant display of drama and emotions.\\"[79] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN argued that the true power of the film lies in its \\"remarkable, rooted, rock-solid script which provides the landscape for such an emotionally engaging, heart-warming experience.\\"[80] Manish Gajjar from the BBC stated that the film \\"touches your heart and moves you deeply with its sterling performances. [It is] a film full of substance!\\"[81] Jaspreet Pandohar, also of BBC, posited that Taare Zameen Par is a \\"far cry from the formulaic masala flicks churned out by the Bollywood machine,\\" and is \\"an inspirational story that is as emotive as it is entertaining; this is a little twinkling star of a movie.\\"[82] Furthermore, Aprajita Anil of Screen gave the film four stars and stated, \\"Taare Zameen Par cannot be missed. Because it is different. Because it is delightful. Because it would make everyone think. Because it would help everyone grow. Because very rarely do performances get so gripping. And of course because the 'perfectionist' actor has shaped into a 'perfectionist' director.\\"[83] In addition, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap stated that, \\"Taare Zameen Par took me back to my hostel days. If you take away the dyslexia, it seems like my story. The film affected me so deeply that I was almost left speechless. After watching the film, I was asked how I liked Taare Zameen Par. I could not talk as I was deeply overwhelmed.\\"[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there were some criticisms. Jha's only objection to the film was Nikumbh's \\"sanctimonious lecture\\" to Ishaan's \\"rather theatrically-played\\" father. Jha found this a jarring \\"deviation from the delectable delicacy\\" of the film's tone.[79] Although she applauded the film overall and recommended \\"a mandatory viewing for all schools and all parents\\", Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India believed the second half was \\"a bit repetitive,\\" the script needed \\"taut editing,\\" and Ishaan's trauma \\"[seemed] a shade too prolonged and the treatment simplistic.\\"[85] Despite commending the \\"great performances\\" and excellent directing, Gautaman Bhaskaran of The Hollywood Reporter, too, suggested that the movie \\"suffers from a weak script.\\"[86] Likewise, Derek Kelly of Variety criticised it for what he described as its \\"touchy-feely-ness\\" attention to \\"a special needs kid's plight.\\" Kelly also disliked the film for being \\"so resolutely caring?... and devoid of real drama and interesting characters\\" that \\"it should have 'approved by the Dyslexia Assn.' stamped on the posters.\\"[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his article \\"Taare Zameen Par and dyslexic savants\\" featured in the Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology, Ambar Chakravarty noted the general accuracy of Ishaan's dyslexia. Though Chakravarty was puzzled by Ishaan's trouble in simple arithmetica trait of dyscalculia rather than dyslexiahe reasoned it was meant to \\"enhance the image of [Ishaan's] helplessness and disability\\". Labeling Ishaan an example of \\"dyslexic savant syndrome\\", he especially praised the growth of Ishaan's artistic talents after receiving help and support from Nikumbh, and deemed it the \\"most important (and joyous) neurocognitive phenomenon\\" of the film. This improvement highlights cosmetic neurology, a \\"major and therapeutically important issue\\" in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nLikewise, in their article \\"Wake up call from 'Stars on the Ground'\\" for the Indian Journal of Psychiatry, T. S. Sathyanarayana Rao and V. S. T. Krishna wrote that the film \\"deserves to be vastly appreciated as an earnest endeavor to portray with sensitivity and empathetically diagnose a malady in human life\\". They also felt it blended \\"modern professional knowledge\\" with a \\"humane approach\\" in working with a dyslexic child. However, the authors believed the film expands beyond disabilities and explores the \\"present age where everyone is in a restless hurry\\". The pair wrote, \\"This film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives. We seem to be heading to a state of mass scale mindlessness even as children are being pushed to 'perform'. Are we seriously getting engrossed in the race of 'achievement' and blissfully becoming numb to the crux of life i.e., experiencing meaningful living in a broader frame rather than merely existing?\\" The film depicts how \\"threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children\\", and that teachers should instead map their strengths and weakness. With this in mind, the author felt that Khan \\"dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be getting to know the child before making any efforts to fill them with knowledge and abilities\\". Overall, the pair found a \\"naive oversimplification\\" in the film. With India \\"only recently waking to recognizing the reality and tragedy of learning disability\\", however, they \\"easily [forgave the film's fault] under artistic license\\".[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film raised awareness of the issue of dyslexia, and prompted more open discussions among parents, schools, activists, and policymakers.\\r\\nAnjuli Bawa, a parent-activist and founder of Action Dyslexia Delhi, said that the number of parents who visit her office increased tenfold in the months following the film's release.[89] Many began taking a more proactive approach by contacting her after noticing problems, rather than using her as a last resort. Gupte himself received \\"many painful letters and phone calls\\" from Indian parents. He noted, \\"Fathers weep on the phone and say they saw the film and realized that they have been wrong in the way they treated their children. This is catharsis.\\"[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese reactions have also brought about a change in policies. The film, only ten days after its debut, influenced the Central Board of Secondary Education to provide extra time to special childrenincluding the visually impaired, physically challenged and dyslexicduring exams. In 2008, Mumbai's civic body also opened 12?classrooms for autistic students. In Chandigarh, the education administration started a course to educate teachers on how to deal with children with learning disabilities.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film has had a similarly positive response in Greater China, where the film was not officially released yet has a large online cult following due to Aamir Khan's popularity in the region after the success of 3 Idiots (2009). The film has been well received by Chinese audiences for how it tackles issues such as education and dyslexia, and is one of the highest-rated films on popular Chinese film site Douban, along with two other Aamir Khan films, 3 Idiots and Dangal (2016).[92][93]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong its many awards, Taare Zameen Par won the Filmfare Best Film Award for 2008,[94] as well as the National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare.[95] Khan's directorial role and Safary's performance were recognised at the 2008 Zee Cine Awards,[96] 2008 Filmfare Awards,[94] and 4th Apsara Film & Television Producers Guild Awards.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nTaare Zameen Par was initially acclaimed as India's official entry for the 2009 Academy Awards Best Foreign Film,[20][98][99] but after it failed to progress to the short list, a debate began in the Indian media as to why Indian films never win Academy Awards.[100] Speculation for the reasons behind Taare Zameen Par's failed bid included Rediff.com's Arthur J. Pai's observation that it lacked mainstream media attention;[101] AMPAS jury member Krishna Shah criticised its length and abundance of songs.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\n American film critic Lisa Tsering in  The Hollywood Reporter.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nKhan claimed that he was \\"not surprised\\"  that Taare Zameen Par was not included in the Academy Award shortlist,[104] and argued, \\"I dont make films for awards. I make films for the audience. The audience, for which I have made the film, really loved it and the audiences outside India have also loved it. What I am trying to say is that film has been well loved across the globe and that for me it is extremely heartening and something that I give very high value to.\\"[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian news media also frequently compared Taare Zameen Par's nomination failure with the British film Slumdog Millionaire's multiple Academy Award nominations and wins,[106][107] and noted that other Indian films in the past were overlooked.[108] Film critic Rajeev Masand argued that it is difficult to compare the two films and noted that Slumdog Millionaire was being marketed in a way that Indian films such as Taare Zameen Par could not compete with.[109] In this context, Slumdog Millionaire actor Mahesh Manjrekar stated, \\"Im sad that Aamirs Taare Zameen Par didnt make it to the final round of the Oscars. I thought it to be way better than Slumdog [Millionaire]..., without taking away anything from Boyle and the kids. But, Indian movies are underestimated there.\\"[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nUTV Home Entertainment released the film on DVD in India on 25 July 2008.[111][112] It was launched at Darsheel Safary's school, Green Lawns High School, in Mumbai. Aamir Khan, Tisca Chopra, Vipin Sharma, Sachet Engineer, and the rest of the cast and crew were present. In his speech, Khan stated, \\"Darsheel is a very happy child, full of life and vibrant. I am sure it's because of the way his parents and teachers have treated him. I must say Darsheel's principal Mrs. Bajaj has been extremely supportive and encouraging. The true test of any school is how happy the kids are and by the looks of it, the children here seem really happy.\\"[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt Disney Company Home Entertainment, which acquired 33?percent of UTV Software Communications, bought the DVD rights for distribution in North America, the United Kingdom, and Australia for ?70 million (US$970,000).[114] This marked \\"the first time an international studio has bought the video rights of an Indian film.\\"[115] Retitling it Like Stars on Earth, Disney released the film in Region?2 on 26 October 2009,[116] in Region?1 on 12 January 2010,[117] and in Region?4 on 29 March 2010.[118] A three-disc set, the Disney version features the original Hindi audio soundtrack with English subtitles or another dubbed in English, as well as bonus material such as audio commentary, deleted scenes, and the musical soundtrack.[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soundtrack for Taare Zameen Par was released on 4 November 2007 under the label T-Series.[120] The music is mainly composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, with lyrics by Prasoon Joshi.

He gave it an overall rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, calling it a \\"zero compromise album\\" that \\"stays true to the film's spirit\\".[122] Planet Bollywood's Atta Khan rated it 9 out of 10, noting that the soundtrack \\"unquestionably lives up to all expectations\\". He felt that it maintained an \\"all round polished nature\\" and \\"is destined to become a classic\\". Although he, too, enjoyed the musical variety, he believed the composers overused the guitar and synthesizers.[123] Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the soundtrack a score of 3 out of 5, commenting, \\"Taare Zameen Par isn't your regular soundtrack about fluttering hearts and sleepless nights. What makes these delicate and whimsical creations special is their underlying innocence.\\"[124] According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 11,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's thirteenth highest-selling.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\n.","input":"Who is the singer of taare zameen par?"},{"output":"31 May 1910","context":"The Union of South Africa (Dutch: Unie van Zuid-Afrika, Afrikaans: Unie van Suid-Afrika) is the historic predecessor to the present-day republic of South Africa. It came into being on 31 May 1910 with the unification of four previously separate British colonies: the Cape, Natal, Transvaal and Orange River colonies. It included the territories formerly part of the Boer republics annexed in 1902, the South African Republic and the Orange Free State.\\r\\nFollowing the First World War, the Union of South Africa was granted the administration of South West Africa (formerly a German colony and today the sovereign state of Namibia) as a League of Nations mandate, which became treated in most respects as if it were another province of the Union, but never was formally annexed.\\r\\nThe Union of South Africa was a dominion of the British Empire, and became sovereign on 11 December 1931. It was governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with the Crown represented by a governor-general. The Union came to an end with the enactment of a new constitution on 31 May 1961, by which it became a republic and left the Commonwealth, under the new name Republic of South Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike Canada and Australia, the Union of South Africa was a unitary state, rather than a federation, with each colony's parliaments being abolished and replaced with provincial councils.[2] A bicameral parliament was created, consisting of a House of Assembly and Senate, and its members were elected mostly by the country's white minority.[3] During the course of the Union the franchise changed on several occasions always to suit the needs of the government of the day.[4] Parliamentary supremacy was a convention of the constitution, inherited from the United Kingdom; save for procedural safeguards in respect of the entrenched sections of franchise and language, the courts were unable to intervene in Parliament's decisions.[5]\\r\\nOwing to disagreements over where the Union's capital should be, a compromise was reached in which every province would be dealt a share of the benefits of the capital: the administration would be seated in Pretoria[6] (Transvaal), Parliament would be in Cape Town[7] (Cape Province), the Appellate Division would be in Bloemfontein[8] (Orange Free State). Bloemfontein and Pietermaritzburg (Natal) were given financial compensation.[9]\\r\\nThe Union initially remained under the British Crown as a self-governing dominion of the British Empire. With the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, the Union and other dominions became equal in status to the United Kingdom and it could no longer legislate on behalf of them.[10] The Monarch was represented in South Africa by a Governor-General, while effective power was exercised by the Executive Council, headed by the Prime Minister.[11] Louis Botha, formerly a Boer general, was appointed first Prime Minister of the Union, heading a coalition representing the white Afrikaner and English-speaking British diaspora communities. Prosecutions before courts were instituted in the name of the Crown (cited in the format Rex v Accused) and government officials served in the name of the Crown.\\r\\nAn entrenched clause in the Constitution mentioned Dutch and English as official languages of the Union, but the meaning of Dutch was changed by the Official Languages of the Union Act, 1925 to include both Dutch and Afrikaans.[12]\\r\\nMost English-speaking whites in South Africa supported the United Party of Jan Smuts, which favoured close relations with the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, rather than the Afrikaans-speaking Nationalists, many of whom held anti-British sentiments, and were opposed to South Africa's entry into the Second World War. Some extremist Nationalist organisations, like the Ossewa Brandwag, openly supported Nazi Germany during the Second World War.\\r\\nMany opposed moves to make the country a republic, voting \\"no\\" in the 5 October 1960 referendum, but due to the much larger number of Afrikaans-speaking voters, the referendum passed, leading to the establishment of a republic in 1961. The Afrikaner-dominated Government consequently withdrew South Africa from the Commonwealth. Natal, which had an English-speaking majority, voted against. Following the referendum result, some whites in Natal even called for secession from the Union.[13] Five years earlier, some 33,000 Natalians had signed the Natal Covenant in opposition to the plans for a republic.[14]\\r\\nSubsequently, the National Party Government passed a Constitution that repealed the South Africa Act. The features of the Union were carried over with very little change to the newly formed Republic. The decision to transform from a Union to Republic was narrowly decided in the referendum. The decision together with the Government's insistence on adhering to its policy of apartheid resulted in South Africa's de facto expulsion from the Commonwealth of Nations; South Africa left the association when it was resolved that it would not be permitted to remain on the terms it wished.\\r\\nThe South Africa Act dealt with race in two specific provisions. First it entrenched the liberal Cape Qualified Franchise system of the Cape Colony which operated free of any racial considerations (although due to socio-economic restrictions no real political expression of non-whites was possible.)[15][16] The Cape Prime Minister at the time, John X. Merriman, fought hard, but ultimately unsuccessfully, to extend this system of multi-racial franchise to the rest of South Africa. Second it made \\"native affairs\\" a matter for the national government. The practice therefore was to establish a Minister of Native Affairs.\\r\\nAccording to Stephen Howe, colonialism in some casesmost obviously among white minorities in South Africameant mainly that these violent settlers wanted to maintain more racial inequalities than the colonial empire found just.[17]\\r\\nSeveral previous unsuccessful attempts to unite the colonies were made, with proposed political models ranging from unitary, to loosely federal.\\r\\nSir George Grey, the Governor of Cape Colony from 1854 to 1861, decided that unifying the states of southern Africa would be mutually beneficial. The stated reasons were that he believed that political divisions between the white-controlled states \\"weakened them against the natives\\", threatened an ethnic divide between British and Boer, and left the Cape vulnerable to interference from other European powers. He believed that a united \\"South African Federation\\", under British control, would resolve all three of these concerns.[18]\\r\\nHis idea was greeted with cautious optimism in southern Africa; the Orange Free State agreed to the idea in principle and the Transvaal may also eventually have agreed. However, he was overruled by the British Colonial Office which ordered him to desist from his plans. His refusal to abandon the idea eventually led to him being recalled.\\r\\nIn the 1870s, the London Colonial Office, under Secretary for the Colonies Lord Carnarvon, decided to apply a system of Confederation onto southern Africa. On this occasion however, it was largely rejected by southern Africans, primarily due to its very bad timing. The various component states of southern Africa were still simmering after the last bout of British expansion, and inter-state tensions were high. The Orange Free State this time refused to even discuss the idea, and Prime Minister John Molteno of the Cape Colony called the idea badly informed and irresponsible. In addition, many local leaders resented the way it was imposed from outside without understanding of local issues.[19] The Confederation model was also correctly seen as unsuitable for the disparate entities of southern Africa, with their wildly different sizes, economies and political systems.[20]\\r\\nThe Molteno Unification Plan (1877), put forward by the Cape government as a more feasible unitary alternative to confederation, largely anticipated the final act of Union in 1909. A crucial difference was that the Cape's liberal constitution and multiracial franchise were to be extended to the other states of the union. These smaller states would gradually accede to the much larger Cape Colony through a system of treaties, whilst simultaneously gaining elected seats in the Cape parliament. The entire process would be locally driven, with Britain's role restricted to policing any set-backs. While subsequently acknowledged to be more viable, this model was rejected at the time by London.[21] At the other extreme, another powerful Cape politician at the time, Saul Solomon, proposed an extremely loose system of federation, with the component states preserving their very different constitutions and systems of franchise.[22]\\r\\nLord Carnarvon rejected the (more informed) local plans for unification, as he wished to have the process brought to a conclusion before the end of his tenure and, having little experience of southern Africa, he preferred to enforce the more familiar model of confederation used in Canada. He pushed ahead with his Confederation plan, which unraveled as predicted, leaving a string of destructive wars across southern Africa. These conflicts eventually fed into the first and second Anglo-Boer Wars, with far-reaching consequences for the subcontinent.[23]\\r\\nAfter gold was discovered in the 1880s, thousands of British men flocked to the gold mines of the South African Republic (Transvaal) and the Orange Free State. The newly arrived miners were needed for the mines but were distrusted by the politically dominant Afrikaners, who called them \\"uitlanders\\" and imposed heavy taxes and very limited civil rights, with no right to vote. The British, jealous of the gold and diamond mines and highly protective of its people, demanded reforms, which were rejected. A small-scale private British effort to overthrow Transvaal's President Paul Kruger, the Jameson Raid of 1895, was a fiasco, and presaged full-scale conflict as diplomatic efforts all failed.[24][25][26]\\r\\nWar started on 11 October 1899 and ended on 31 May 1902 as Great Britain was aided by its Cape Colony, Colony of Natal and some native African allies. The British war effort was further supported by volunteers from across the Empire. All other nations were neutral, but public opinion in them was largely hostile to Britain. Inside Britain and its Empire there also was a significant Opposition to the Second Boer War because of the atrocities and military failures.[27]\\r\\nThe British were overconfident and under prepared. Prime Minister Salisbury and his top officials, especially colonial secretary Joseph Chamberlain, ignored the repeated warnings of military advisors that the Boers were well prepared, well armed, and fighting for their homes in a very difficult terrain. The Boers struck first, besieging Ladysmith, Kimberly, and Mafeking in early 1900, and winning important battles at Colenso, Magersfontein and Stormberg. Staggered, the British fought back, relieved its besieged cities, and prepared to invade first the Orange Free State, and then Transvaal in late 1900. The Boers refused to surrender or negotiate, and reverted to guerrilla warfare. After two years of hard fighting, Britain, using over 400,000 soldiers systematically destroyed the resistance, raising worldwide complaints about brutality. The Boers were fighting for their homes and families, who provided them with food and hiding places. The British solution was to forcefully relocate all the Boer civilians into heavily guarded concentration camps, where about 28,000 died of disease. Then it systematically blocked off and tracked down the highly mobile Boer combat units. The battles were small operations; most of the dead were victims of disease. The war ended in victory for the British and the annexation of both republics, which became the Transvaal Colony and the Orange River Colony.[28]\\r\\nAt the close of the Anglo-Boer War in 1902, the four colonies were for the first time under a common flag, and the most significant obstacle which had prevented previous plans at unification had been removed. Hence the long-standing desire of many colonial administrators to establish a unified structure became feasible.\\r\\nThe matter of trade tariffs had been a long-standing source of conflict between the various political units of Southern Africa. Essentially at the heart of the crisis lay the fact that the Transvaal was a landlocked economic hub that resented its dependence on its neighbours, as well as the costs it was incurring through rail and harbour customs.\\r\\nThe Cape Colony was heavily dependent upon customs as a source of tax revenue and subsequently was directly competing with both Natal and Portuguese East Africa (Mozambique). At the time of unification the bulk of cargo destined for the Witwatersrand area entered through Louren?o Marques (now Maputo in Mozambique) owing largely to the relative distance and the ZARs policy of reducing its dependence on the British Empire. The South African Customs Union came into existence in 1906, but various problems existed with the arrangements particularly because the Transvaal was insistent on dominating the Union.\\r\\nAfter Unification the South African Customs Union continued to exist including the other British territories (the Protectorates and Rhodesia).\\r\\nIn 1922 the colony of Southern Rhodesia had a chance (ultimately rejected) to join the Union through a referendum. The referendum resulted from the fact that by 1920 British South Africa Company rule in Southern Rhodesia was no longer practical with many favouring some form of 'responsible government'. Some favoured responsible government within Southern Rhodesia while others (especially in Matabeleland) favoured membership in the Union of South Africa. Politician Sir Charles Coghlan claimed that such membership with the Union would make Southern Rhodesia the \\"Ulster of South Africa\\".[29]\\r\\nPrior to the referendum, representatives of Southern Rhodesia visited Cape Town where the Prime Minister of South Africa, Jan Smuts, eventually offered terms he considered reasonable and which the United Kingdom government found acceptable. Although opinion among the United Kingdom government, the South African government and the British South Africa Company favoured the union option (and none tried to interfere in the referendum), when the referendum was held the results saw 59.4% in favour of responsible government for a separate colony and 40.6% in favour of joining the Union of South Africa.\\r\\nThe inhospitable coast of what is now the Republic of Namibia remained uncolonised up until the end of the 19th century.\\r\\nFrom 1874, the leaders of several indigenous peoples, notably Maharero of the Herero nation, approached the Cape Parliament to the south. Anticipating invasion by a European power and already suffering Portuguese encroachment from the north and Afrikaner encroachment from the south, these leaders approached the Cape Colony government to discuss the possibility of accession and the political representation it would entail. Accession to the Cape Colony, a self-governing state with a system of multi-racial franchise and legal protection for traditional land rights, was at the time considered marginally preferable to annexation by Portugal or Germany.\\r\\nIn response, the Cape Parliament appointed a special Commission under William Palgrave, to travel to the territory between the Orange and Cunene rivers and to confer with these leaders regarding accession to the Cape. In the negotiations with the Palgrave Commission, some indigenous nations such as the Damara and the Herero responded positively (Oct 1876), other reactions were mixed. Discussions regarding the magisterial structure for the area's political integration into the Cape dragged on until, from 1876, it was blocked by Britain. Britain relented, insofar as allowing the Cape to incorporate Walvis Bay, which was brought under the magisterial district of Cape Town, but when the Germans established a protectorate over the area in 1884, South West Africa was predominantly autonomous.[30][31][32]\\r\\nThereafter, South West Africa became a German colony, except for Walvis Bay and the Offshore Islands which remained part of the Cape, outside of German control.\\r\\nFollowing the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 the Union of South Africa occupied and annexed the German colony of German South West Africa. With the establishment of the League of Nations and cessation of the war, South Africa obtained a Class C Mandate to administer South West Africa \\"under the laws of the mandatory (South Africa) as integral portions of its territory\\". Subsequently, the Union of South Africa generally regarded South West Africa as a fifth province, although this was never an official status.\\r\\nWith the creation of the United Nations, the Union applied for the incorporation of South West Africa, but its application was rejected by the U.N., which invited South Africa to prepare a Trusteeship agreement instead. This invitation was in turn rejected by the Union, which subsequently did not modify the administration of South West Africa and continued to adhere to the original mandate. This caused a complex set of legal wranglings that were not finalised when the Union was replaced with the Republic of South Africa. In 1949, the Union passed a law bringing South West Africa into closer association with it including giving South West Africa representation in the South African parliament.\\r\\nWalvis Bay, which is now in Namibia, was originally a part of the Union of South Africa as it was a part of the Cape Colony at the time of Unification. In 1921 Walvis Bay was integrated with the Class C Mandate over South West Africa for the rest of the Union's duration and for part of the Republic era.\\r\\nIn 1990 South West Africa gained independence as Namibia, but Walvis Bay remained under South African sovereignty. At midnight on 28 February 1994 South Africa formally transferred sovereignty over Walvis Bay and the Penguin Islands to Namibia.\\r\\nThe Statute of Westminster passed by the Imperial Parliament in December 1931, which repealed the Colonial Laws Validity Act and implemented the Balfour Declaration 1926, had a profound impact on the constitutional structure and status of the Union. The most notable effect was that the South African Parliament was released from many restrictions concerning the handling of the so-called \\"native question\\". However the repeal was not sufficient to enable the South African Parliament to ignore the entrenched clauses of its constitution (the South Africa Act) which led to the coloured-vote constitutional crisis of the 1950s wherein the right of coloureds to vote in the main South African Parliament was removed and replaced with a separate, segregated, and largely powerless assembly.\\r\\n Wikimedia Atlas of Union of South Africa\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 30S 25E? / ?30S 25E? / -30; 25","input":"When was the union of south africa formed?"},{"output":"World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, Illinois","context":"An amusement park is a park that features various attractions, such as rides and games, as well as other events for entertainment purposes. A theme park is a type of amusement park that bases its structures and attractions around a central theme, often featuring multiple areas with different themes. Unlike temporary and mobile funfairs and carnivals, amusement parks are stationary and built for long-lasting operation. They are more elaborate than city parks and playgrounds, usually providing attractions that cater to a variety of age groups. While amusement parks often contain themed areas, theme parks place a heavier focus with more intricately-designed themes that revolve around a particular subject or group of subjects.\\r\\nAmusement parks evolved from European fairs, pleasure gardens and large picnic areas, which were created for people's recreation. World's fairs and other types of international expositions also influenced the emergence of the amusement park industry.[2] Lake Compounce opened in 1846 and is considered the oldest continuously-operating amusement park in North America.[3] The first theme parks emerged in the mid-twentieth century with the opening of Santa Claus Land in 1946 and the popular Disneyland theme park in 1955.[4][5][6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe amusement park evolved from three earlier traditions, the oldest being the periodic fair of the Middle Ages - one of the earliest was the Bartholomew Fair in England, which began in 1133. By the 18th and 19th centuries, they had evolved into places of entertainment for the masses, where the public could view freak shows, acrobatics, conjuring and juggling, take part in competitions and walk through menageries.\\r\\nThe world's oldest amusement park, Bakken (\\"The Hill\\"), opened in mainland Europe in 1583. It is located north of Copenhagen in Klampenborg, Denmark.[8][9]\\r\\nA wave of innovation in the 1860s and 1870s created mechanical rides, such as the steam-powered carousel (built by Thomas Bradshaw, at the Aylsham Fair), and its derivatives. This inaugurated the era of the modern funfair ride, as the working classes were increasingly able to spend their surplus wages on entertainment.[10]\\r\\nThe second influence was the pleasure garden. One of the earliest gardens was the Vauxhall Gardens, founded in 1661 in London. By the late 18th century, the site had an admission fee for its many attractions. It regularly drew enormous crowds, with its paths often noted for romantic assignations; tightrope walkers, hot air balloon ascents, concerts and fireworks providing amusement. Although the gardens were originally designed for the elites, they soon became places of great social diversity. Public firework displays were put on at Marylebone Gardens, and Cremorne Gardens offered music, dancing and animal acrobatics displays.[11]\\r\\nPrater in Vienna, Austria, was opened in 1766.\\r\\nThe concept of a fixed park for amusement was further developed with the beginning of the world's fairs. The first World fair began in 1851 with the construction of the landmark Crystal Palace in London, England. The purpose of the exposition was to celebrate the industrial achievement of the nations of the world and it was designed to educate and entertain the visitors.[12]\\r\\nAmerican cities and business also saw the world's fair as a way of demonstrating economic and industrial success.[12] The World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, Illinois was an early precursor to the modern amusement park. The fair was an enclosed site, that merged entertainment, engineering and education to entertain the masses. It set out to bedazzle the visitors, and successfully did so with a blaze of lights from the \\"White City.\\" [2] To make sure that the fair was a financial success, the planners included a dedicated amusement concessions area called the Midway Plaisance.[12] Rides from this fair captured the imagination of the visitors and of amusement parks around the world, such as the first steel Ferris wheel, which was found in many other amusement areas, such as the Prater by 1896. Also, the experience of the enclosed ideal city with wonder, rides, culture and progress (electricity), was based on the creation of an illusory place.[2]\\r\\nThe \\"midway\\" introduced at the Columbian Exposition would become a standard part of most amusement parks, fairs, carnivals and circuses. The midway contained not only the rides, but other concessions and entertainments such as shooting galleries, penny arcades, games of chance and shows.[13]\\r\\nThe modern amusement park evolved from earlier seaside pleasure resorts that had become popular with the public for day-trips or weekend holidays in Blackpool, United Kingdom and Coney Island, United States.[14]\\r\\nBlackpool began to develop as a seaside resort with the completion of a branch line to Blackpool from Poulton on the main Preston and Wyre Joint Railway line from Preston to Fleetwood. Fleetwood declined as a resort, as its founder and principal financial backer, Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood, went bankrupt. In contrast, Blackpool boomed. A sudden influx of visitors, arriving by rail, provided the motivation for entrepreneurs to build accommodation and create new attractions, leading to more visitors and a rapid cycle of growth throughout the 1850s and 1860s.\\r\\nThe growth was intensified by the practice among the Lancashire cotton mill owners of closing the factories for a week every year to service and repair machinery. These became known as wakes weeks. Each town's mills would close for a different week, allowing Blackpool to manage a steady and reliable stream of visitors over a prolonged period in the summer.\\r\\nIn 1863, the North Pier was completed, rapidly becoming a centre of attraction for elite visitors. Central Pier was completed in 1868, with a theatre and a large open-air dance floor. The town expanded southward beyond what is today known as the Golden Mile, towards South Shore, and South Pier was completed in 1893, making Blackpool the only town in the United Kingdom with three piers. In 1878, the Winter Gardens complex opened, incorporating ten years later the Opera House, said to be the largest in Britain outside London.\\r\\nIn 1879, large parts of the promenade were wired. The lighting and its accompanying pageants reinforced Blackpool's status as the North of England's most prominent holiday resort, and its specifically working class character. It was the forerunner of the present-day Blackpool Illuminations. By the 1890s, the town had a population of 35,000, and could accommodate 250,000 holidaymakers. The number of annual visitors, many staying for a week, was estimated at three million.\\r\\nIn 1894 two of the town's most prominent buildings opened, the Grand Theatre on Church Street, and Blackpool Tower on the Promenade. The Grand Theatre was one of Britain's first all-electric theatres. When the tower opened, 3,000 customers took the first rides to the top. Tourists paid sixpence for admission, sixpence more for a ride in the lifts to the top, and a further sixpence for the circus.[15]\\r\\nIn the United States, picnic groves were established along rivers and lakes that provided bathing and water sports, such as Lake Compounce in Connecticut, first established as a picturesque picnic park in 1846, and Riverside Park in Massachusetts, founded in the 1870s along the Connecticut River.[16]\\r\\nA similar location was Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, on the Atlantic Ocean, where a horse-drawn streetcar line brought pleasure seekers to the beach beginning in 1829. In 1875, a million passengers rode the Coney Island Railroad, and in 1876 two million visited Coney Island. Hotels and amusements were built to accommodate both the upper classes and the working class at the beach. The first carousel was installed in the 1870s, the first roller coaster, the \\"Switchback Railway\\", in 1884.\\r\\nIn the final decade of the 19th century, electric trolley lines were developed in many large American cities. Companies that established the trolley lines also developed trolley parks as destinations of these lines. Trolley parks such as Atlanta's Ponce de Leon Park, or Reading's Carsonia Park were initially popular natural leisure spots before local streetcar companies purchased the sites, expanding them from picnic groves to include regular entertainments, mechanical amusements, dance halls, sports fields, boat rides, restaurants and other resort facilities.\\r\\nSome of these parks were developed in resort locations, such as bathing resorts at the seaside in New Jersey and New York. A premiere example in New Jersey was Atlantic City, a famous vacation resort. Entrepreneurs erected amusement parks on piers that extended from the boardwalk out over the ocean. The first of several was the Ocean Pier in 1891, followed later by the Steel Pier in 1898, both of which boasted rides and attractions typical of that time, such as Midway-style games and electric trolley rides. The boardwalk also had the first Roundabout installed in 1892 by William Somers, a wooden predecessor to the Ferris Wheel. Somers installed two others in Asbury Park, New Jersey and Coney Island, New York.[17][18]\\r\\nAn early park was the Eldorado Amusement Park that opened in 1891 on the banks of the Hudson River, overlooking New York City. It consisted of 25 acres.[19]\\r\\nThe first permanent enclosed entertainment area, regulated by a single company, was founded in Coney Island in 1895: Sea Lion Park at Coney Island in Brooklyn. This park was one of the first to charge admission to get into the park in addition to sell tickets for rides within the park.[2]\\r\\nIn 1897, Sea Lion Park was joined by Steeplechase Park, the first of three major amusement parks that would open in the Coney Island area. George Tilyou designed the park to provide thrills and entertainment. The combination of the nearby population center of New York City and the ease of access to the area made Coney Island the embodiment of the American amusement park.[2] Coney Island also featured Luna Park and Dreamland. Coney Island was a huge success and by year 1910 attendance on days could reach a million people.[2] Fueled by the efforts of Frederick Ingersoll, other \\"Luna Parks\\" were quickly erected worldwide and opened to rave reviews.\\r\\nThe first amusement park in England was opened in 1896 - the Blackpool Pleasure Beach by W. G. Bean. In 1904, Sir Hiram Maxim's Captive Flying Machine was introduced; he had designed an early aircraft powered by steam engines that had been unsuccessful and instead opened up a pleasure ride of flying carriages that revolved around a central pylon. Other rides included the 'Grotto' (a fantasy ride), 'River Caves' (a scenic railway), water chutes and a toboganning tower.[20]\\r\\nFire was a constant threat in those days, as much of the construction within the amusement parks of the era was wooden. In 1911, Dreamland was the first Coney Island amusement park to completely burn down; in 1944, Luna Park also burned to the ground. Most of Ingersoll's Luna Parks were similarly destroyed, usually by arson, before his death in 1927.\\r\\nDuring the Gilded Age, many Americans began working fewer hours[21] and had more disposable income. With new-found money and time to spend on leisure activities, Americans sought new venues for entertainment. Amusement parks, set up outside major cities and in rural areas, emerged to meet this new economic opportunity. These parks served as source of fantasy and escape from real life.[2] By the early 1900s, hundreds of amusement parks were operating in the United States and Canada. Trolley parks stood outside many cities. Parks like Atlanta's Ponce de Leon[22] and Idora Park,[23] near Youngstown, OH, took passengers to traditionally popular picnic grounds, which by the late 1890s also often included rides like the Giant Swing, Carousel, and Shoot-the-Chutes. These amusement parks were often based on nationally known parks or world's fairs: they had names like Coney Island, White City, Luna Park, or Dreamland. The American Gilded Age was, in fact, amusement parks' Golden Age that reigned until the late 1920s.\\r\\nThe Golden Age of amusement parks also included the advent of the kiddie park. Founded in 1925, the original Kiddie Park is located in San Antonio, Texas and is still in operation today. The kiddie parks became popular all over America after World War II.[24]\\r\\nThis era saw the development of the new innovations in roller coasters that included extreme drops and speeds to thrill the riders. By the end of the First World War, people seemed to want an even more exciting entertainment, a need met by roller coasters.[25] Although the development of the automobile provided people with more options for satisfying their entertainment needs, the amusement parks after the war continued to be successful, while urban amusement parks saw declining attendance.[2] The 1920s is more properly known as the Golden Age of roller coasters, being the decade of frenetic building for these rides.[25]\\r\\nIn England, Dreamland Margate opened in 1920 with a Scenic Railway rollercoaster that opened to the public in 1920 with great success, carrying half a million passengers in its first year.[26] The park also installed other rides common to the time including a smaller roller coaster, the Joy Wheel, Miniature Railway, The Whip and the River Caves. A ballroom was constructed on the site of the Skating Rink in 1920 and in 1923 a Variety Cinema was built on the site. Between 1920 and 1935 over S500,000 was invested in the site, constantly adding new rides and facilities and culminating in the construction of the Dreamland Cinema complex in 1934 which stands to this day.[27]\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Blackpool Pleasure Beach was also being developed. Frequent large-scale investments were responsible for the construction of many new rides, including the Virginia Reel, Whip, Noah's Ark, Big Dipper and Dodgems. In the 1920s the \\"Casino Building\\" was built, which remains to this day. In 1923, land was reclaimed from the sea front. It was at this period that the park moved to its 44-acre (180,000 m2) current location above what became Watson Road, which was built under the Pleasure Beach in 1932. During this time Joseph Emberton, an architect famous for his work in the amusement trade was brought in to redesign the architectural style of the Pleasure Beach rides, working on the \\"Grand National\\" roller coaster, \\"Noah's Ark\\" and the Casino building to name a few.\\r\\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II during the 1940s saw the decline of the amusement park industry. War caused the affluent urban population to move to the suburbs, television became a source of entertainment, and families went to amusement parks less often.[2]\\r\\nBy the 1950s, factors such as urban decay, crime, and even desegregation in the ghettos led to changing patterns in how people chose to spend their free time. Many of the older, traditional amusement parks closed or burned to the ground. Many would be taken out by the wrecking ball to make way for suburban housing and development. In 1964, Steeplechase Park, once the king of all amusement parks, closed down for good. The traditional amusement parks which survived, for example, Kennywood, in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, and Cedar Point, in Sandusky, Ohio, did so in spite of the odds.[2]\\r\\nThe amusement park industry's offerings range from large, worldwide type theme parks such as Walt Disney World, SeaWorld Orlando and Universal Studios Hollywood to smaller and medium-sized theme parks such as the Six Flags parks and Cedar Fair parks. Countless smaller ventures exist across the United States and around the world. Simpler theme parks directly aimed at smaller children have also emerged, such as Legoland.\\r\\nExamples of amusement parks in shopping malls exist in West Edmonton Mall, Alberta, Canada; Pier 39, San Francisco; Mall of America, Bloomington, Minnesota.\\r\\nFamily fun parks starting as miniature golf courses have begun to grow to include batting cages, go-karts, bumper cars, bumper boats and water slides. Some of these parks have grown to include even roller coasters, and traditional amusement parks now also have these competition areas in addition to their thrill rides.\\r\\nAs of 2008, the Walt Disney Company accounted for around half of the total industry's revenue in the US as a result of more than 50 million visitors of its U.S.-based attractions each year.[28]\\r\\nIn 2015, theme parks in the United States had a revenue of US$8 billion and theme parks in China had a revenue of US$4.6 billion, with China expected to overtake the United States by 2020.[29]\\r\\nSome parks use rides and attractions for educational purposes. Disney was the first to successfully open a large-scale theme park built around education. Named Epcot, it opened in 1982 as the second park in the Walt Disney World Resort. There are also Holy Land USA[30] and the Holy Land Experience,[31] which are theme parks built to inspire Christian piety. Dinosaur World entertains families with dinosaurs in natural settings, while the SeaWorld and Busch Gardens parks also offer educational experiences, with each of the parks housing several thousand animals, fish and other sea life in dozens of attractions and exhibits focusing on animal education.[32]\\r\\nCreated in 1977, the Puy du Fou is a much celebrated theme park in Vende, France. It is centered around European, French and local history. It received several international prizes.\\r\\nSome theme parks did evolve from more traditional amusement park enterprises, such as Knott's Berry Farm. In the 1920s, Walter Knott and his family sold berries from a roadside stand, which grew to include a restaurant serving fried chicken dinners. Within a few years, lines outside the restaurant were often several hours long. To entertain the waiting crowds, Walter Knott built a Ghost Town in 1940, using buildings relocated from real old west towns such as the Calico, California ghost town and Prescott, Arizona. In 1968, the Knott family fenced the farm, charged admission for the first time, and Knott's Berry Farm officially became an amusement park.[2] Because of its long history, Knott's Berry Farm currently claims to be \\"America's First Theme Park.\\" Knott's Berry Farm is now owned by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut may be the true oldest continuously operating amusement park in the United States, open since 1846. Santa Claus Town, which opened in Santa Claus, Indiana in 1935 and included Santa's Candy Castle and other Santa Claus-themed attractions, is considered the first themed attraction in the United States: a precursor to the modern day theme park. Santa Claus Land (renamed Holiday World in 1984) opened in 1946 in Santa Claus, Indiana and many people will argue that it was the first true Theme Park despite Knott's history.[16] In the 1950s the Herschend family took over operation of the tourist attraction, Marvel Cave near Branson, Missouri. Over the next decade they modernized the cave, which led to large numbers of people waiting to take the tour. The Herschend family opened a recreation of the old mining town that once existed atop Marvel Cave. The small village eventually became the theme park, Silver Dollar City. The park is still owned and operated by the Herschends and the family has several other parks including Dollywood, Celebration City and Wild Adventures.\\r\\nThe first regional amusement park, as well as the first Six Flags park, Six Flags over Texas was officially opened in 1961 in Arlington, Texas.[33] The first Six Flags amusement park was the vision of Angus Wynne, Jr. and helped create the modern, competitive amusement park industry. In the late 1950s, Wynne visited Disneyland and was inspired to create an affordable, closer, and larger amusement park that would be filled with fantasy. He followed in the steps of Disney and had subdivisions within the park that reflected different lands. The subdivisions included the Old South and other sections that referenced Wynne's background.[34] By 1968, the second Six Flags park, Six Flags Over Georgia, opened, and in 1971, Six Flags Over Mid-America (now Six Flags St. Louis) opened near St. Louis, Missouri. Also in 1971 was the opening of the Walt Disney World resort complex in Florida, with the Magic Kingdom (1971), Epcot (1982), Disney's Hollywood Studios (1989) and Disney's Animal Kingdom (1998).\\r\\nAmusement parks collect much of their revenue from admission fees paid by guests attending the park. Other revenue sources include parking fees, food and beverage sales and souvenirs.\\r\\nPractically all amusement parks operate using one of two admission principles:\\r\\nIn amusement parks using the pay-as-you-go scheme, a guest enters the park at little or no charge. The guest must then purchase rides individually, either at the attraction's entrance or by purchasing ride tickets (or a similar exchange method, like a token). The cost of the attraction is often based on its complexity or popularity. For example, a guest might pay one ticket to ride a carousel but four tickets to ride a roller coaster.\\r\\nThe park may allow guests to purchase a pass providing unlimited admissions to all attractions within the park for a specified duration of time. A wristband or pass is then shown at the attraction entrance to gain admission.\\r\\nDisneyland opened in 1955 using the pay-as-you-go format.[35] Initially, guests paid the ride admission fees at the attractions. Within a short time, the problems of handling such large amounts of coins led to the development of a ticket system that, while now out of use, is still part of the amusement-park lexicon.[35] In this new format, guests purchased ticket books that contained a number of tickets, labeled \\"A,\\" \\"B\\" and \\"C.\\" Rides and attractions using an \\"A-ticket\\" were generally simple, with \\"B-tickets\\" and \\"C-tickets\\" used for the larger, more popular rides. Later, the \\"D-ticket\\" was added, then finally the now-famous \\"E-ticket\\", which was used on the biggest and most elaborate rides, like Space Mountain. Smaller tickets could be traded up for use on larger rides (i.e., two or three A-tickets would equal a single B-ticket). Disneyland, as well as the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, abandoned this practice in 1982.\\r\\nThe advantages of pay-as-you-go include the following:\\r\\nThe disadvantages of pay-as-you-go include the following:\\r\\nAn amusement park using the pay-one-price scheme will charge guests a single admission fee. The guest is then entitled to use most of the attractions (usually including flagship roller coasters) in the park as often as they wish during their visit. A daily admission pass (daypass) is the most basic fare on sale, also sold are season tickets which offer holders admission for the entire operating year[37] (plus special privileges for the newest attractions), and express passes which gives holders priority in bypassing lineup queues for popular attractions.\\r\\nPay-one-price format parks also have attractions that are not included in the admission charge; these are called \\"up-charge attractions\\" and can include Skycoasters or go-kart tracks, or games of skill where prizes are won.\\r\\nWhen Angus Wynne, founder of Six Flags Over Texas, first visited Disneyland in 1959, he noted that park's pay-as-you-go format as a reason to make his park pay-one-price.[38] He thought that a family would be more likely to visit his park if they knew, up front, how much it would cost to attend.[38]\\r\\nThe advantages of pay-one-price include\\r\\nThe disadvantages of pay-one-price include:\\r\\nMechanized thrill machines are a defining feature of amusement parks. Early rides include the carousel, which originally developed from cavalry training methods first used in the Middle Ages. By the 19th century, carousels were common in parks around the world. Another such ride which shaped the future of the amusement park was the roller coaster. The origins of roller coasters can be traced back to 17th-century Russia, where gravity-driven attractions, which at first only consisted of individual sleds or carts riding freely down chutes on top of specially constructed snow slopes with piles of sand at the bottom for braking, were used as winter leisure activities. These crude and temporarily built curiosities, known as Russian Mountains, were the beginning of the search for even more thrilling amusement park rides. The Columbian Exposition of 1893 was a particularly fertile testing ground for amusement rides and included some that the public had never seen before, such as the world's first Ferris wheel, one of the most recognized products of the fair. In the present day, many rides of various types are set around a specific theme.\\r\\nParks contains a mixture of attractions which can be divided into several categories.\\r\\nFlat rides are usually considered to be those that move their passengers in a plane generally parallel to the ground.\\r\\nThere is a core set of flat rides which most amusement parks have, including the enterprise, tilt-a-whirl, gravitron, chairswing, swinging inverter ship, twister, and top spin. However, there is constant innovation, with new variations on ways to spin and throw passengers around appearing in an effort to keep attracting customers. Manufactures such as Huss and Zamperla specialise in creating flat rides among other amusement attractions.[citation needed]\\r\\nAmusement parks often feature multiple roller coasters of primarily timber or steel construction. Fundamentally, a roller coaster ride is one in which a specialized railroad system with steep drops and sharp curves, passengers sit and are restrained in cars, usually with two or more cars joined to form a train. Some roller coasters feature one or more inversions (such as vertical loops) which turn the riders upside down. Over the years there have been many roller coaster manufactures with a variety of types of roller coasters.\\r\\nPopular manufactures today include:\\r\\nAmusement park railroads have had a long and varied history in American amusement parks as well as overseas. Some of the earliest park trains were not really trains; they were trolleys, which brought park patrons to the parks on regular rail lines from the cities to the end of the rail lines where the parks were located. As such, some older parks, such as Kennywood in Pennsylvania, were referred to as trolley parks. The earliest park trains that only operated on lines within the park's boundaries, such as the one on the Zephyr Railroad in Dorney Park, were mostly custom-built. Also, amusement park railroads tend to be narrow gauge, meaning the space between their rails is smaller than that of 4?ft?8?1?2?in (1,435?mm) standard gauge railroads. Some specific narrow gauges that are common on amusement park railroads are 3?ft (914?mm) gauge, 2?ft?6?in (762?mm) gauge, 2?ft (610?mm), and 15?in (381?mm) gauge.\\r\\nPast and present manufacturers include:\\r\\nAmusement parks with water resources generally feature a few water rides, such as the log flume, bumper boats, rapids and rowing boats. Such rides are usually gentler and shorter than roller coasters and many are suitable for all ages. Water rides are especially popular on hot days.\\r\\nOverlapping with both train rides and water rides, dark rides are enclosed attractions in which patrons travel in guided vehicles along a predetermined path, through an array of illuminated scenes which may include lighting effects, animation, music and recorded dialogue, and other special effects.\\r\\nFerris wheels are the most common type of amusement ride at state fairs in the US.[39]\\r\\nTransport rides are used to take large numbers of guests from one area to another, as an alternative to walking, especially for parks that are large or separated into distant areas. Transport rides include chairlifts, monorails, aerial trams, and escalators.[citation needed]\\r\\nOcean Park Hong Kong is well known for its 1.5-kilometre (0.9?mi) cable car connecting the Lowland and Headland areas of the park, and for having the world's second longest outdoor escalator in the Headland. Both transportation links provide scenic views of the park's hilly surroundings and, while originally intended for practicality rather than thrills or enjoyment, have become significant park attractions in their own right.[40]","input":"What is the first theme park in america?"},{"output":"Stephen Curry","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest-paid NBA players by season over the past twelve seasons have received contracts with salaries noted in the twenty-million-dollar range. In this twelve-year span, Kevin Garnett received $28,000,000, which was the highest salary payment of any NBA player, during the 2003ÿ04 season. Garnett has been the highest-paid NBA player per year in seven of the past twelve NBA seasons. Michael Jordan was the first NBA player to sign a contract worth over thirty million dollars in a season. During the 1997ÿ98 season, Jordan earned $33,140,000, which still stands as the most any NBA player has earned on a 1 year contract, Jordan also holds the record for the second largest 1 year contract at $30,140,000 in the 1996-97 season. Kobe Bryant become just the second player to reach this milestone when the 2013ÿ14 season began.[1] LeBron James became the third in the 2016ÿ17 season. Stephen Curry became the first player to eclipse $40-Million per year when he signed a record 5-year contract worth $201-Million in 2017, starting with $34,682,550 in the 2017-18 season and ending with the largest earnings in the 2021-22 season with a record payout of $45,780,966.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in the 1984ÿ85 NBA season, the NBA's first salary cap was introduced. The NBA salary cap is the maximum dollar amount each NBA team can spend on its players for the season. However, the NBA uses a \\"soft\\" salary cap, which means that significant \\"salary exceptions\\" allow NBA teams to exceed their allotted amount in order to sign players. The salary cap is determined during the offseason, but as stated earlier, it is liable to change.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn exception is necessary to sign a player for a contract that would exceed the salary cap threshold of the \\"soft cap\\". The Larry Bird exception, more commonly known as Bird Rights, allows teams to re-sign a current player only if he has played for that particular team for a minimum of three years.[3] Another exception known as the mid-level exception allows for teams that are over the salary cap to sign one or more players as long as they do not exceed the total amount of the average NBA salary.[4] Next, the bi-annual exception can be used by teams every other year to sign a free agent(s) for up to two years at an amount set by the NBA.[5] Finally, the rookie player exception allows any NBA team to sign their first-round draft pick to a contract based upon a scale previously set forth by the NBA. Another option for teams would be to assign players to a league-assigned minimum salary contract for a maximum of two years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to 2010ÿ11 NBA season game performance, the league's best players were not its highest-paid players.

One of the islands, St Agnes, is the most southerly point in both England and the United Kingdom, being over 4 miles (6.4?km) further south than the most southerly point of the British mainland at Lizard Point.\\r\\nThe population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203.[2] Scilly forms part of the ceremonial county of Cornwall, and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the Council of the Isles of Scilly.\\r\\nThe adjective \\"Scillonian\\" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The Duchy of Cornwall owns most of the freehold land on the islands. Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agricultureparticularly the production of cut flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScilly has been inhabited since the Stone Age, and until the early 20th century its history had been one of subsistence living. Farming and fishing continue, but the main industry now is tourism.\\r\\nThe islands may correspond to the Cassiterides (Tin Isles) visited by the Phoenicians and mentioned by the Greeks. However, the archipelago itself does not contain much tinit may be that the islands were used as a staging post.\\r\\nIt is likely that until relatively recent times the islands were much larger and perhaps joined together into one island named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400ÿ500 AD, forming the current 55 islands and islets, if an island is defined as \\"land surrounded by water at high tide and supporting land vegetation\\".[3] The word Ennor is a contraction of the Old Cornish[4] En Noer (Moer, mutated to Noer), meaning 'the land'[4] or the 'great island'.[5]\\r\\nEvidence for the older large island includes:\\r\\nOffshore, midway between Land's End and the Isles of Scilly, is the supposed location of the mythical lost land of Lyonesse, referred to in Arthurian literature, of which Tristan is said to have been a prince. This may be a folk memory of inundated lands, but this legend is also common among the Brythonic peoples; the legend of Ys is a parallel and cognate legend in Brittany as is that of Cantre'r Gwaelod in Wales.\\r\\nScilly has been identified as the place of exile of two heretical 4th century bishops, Instantius and Tiberianus, who were followers of Priscillian.[10]\\r\\nIn 995, Olaf Tryggvason became King Olaf I of Norway. Born c. 960, Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986 he (supposedly) met a Christian seer on the Isles of Scilly. He was probably Priscillian and a part of the tiny Christian community that was exiled here from Spain by Emperor Maximus for Priscillianism and their part in the Priscilline heresy. In Snorri Sturluson's Royal Sagas of Norway, it is stated that this seer told him:\\r\\nThou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptised.\\r\\nThe legend continues that, as the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of mutineers upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the Haakon Jarl was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.\\r\\nWith the Norman Conquest, the Isles of Scilly came more under centralised control. About 20 years later, the Domesday survey was conducted. The islands would have formed part of the \\"Exeter Domesday\\" circuit, which included Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, and Wiltshire.\\r\\nIn the mid-12th century, there was reportedly a Viking attack on the Isles of Scilly, called Syllingar by the Norse,[11] recorded in the Orkneyinga saga Sweyn Asleifsson \\"went south, under Ireland, and seized a barge belonging to some monks in Syllingar and plundered it.\\"[11] (Chap LXXIII)\\r\\n...the three chiefsSwein, Torbj?rn and Eirikwent out on a plundering expedition. They went first to the Suereyar [Hebrides], and all along the west to the Syllingar, where they gained a great victory in Maruh?fn on Columba's-mass [9 June], and took much booty. Then they returned to the Orkneys.[11]\\r\\n\\"Maruh?fn\\" literally means \\"Mary's Harbour/Haven\\". The name does not make it clear if it referred to a harbour on a larger island than today's St Mary's, or a whole island.\\r\\nIt is generally considered that Cornwall, and possibly the Isles of Scilly, came under the dominion of the English Crown late in the reign of ?thelstan (r. 924ÿ939). In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. King Henry I (r. 1100ÿ35) gave it to the abbey of Tavistock who established a priory on Tresco, which was abolished at the Reformation.[12]\\r\\nAt the turn of the 14th century, the Abbot and convent of Tavistock Abbey petitioned the king,\\r\\nstat[ing] that they hold certain isles in the sea between Cornwall and Ireland, of which the largest is called Scilly, to which ships come passing between France, Normandy, Spain, Bayonne, Gascony, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall: and, because they feel that in the event of a war breaking out between the kings of England and France, or between any of the other places mentioned, they would not have enough power to do justice to these sailors, they ask that they might exchange these islands for lands in Devon, saving the churches on the islands appropriated to them.[13]\\r\\nWilliam le Poer, coroner of Scilly, is recorded in 1305 as being worried about the extent of wrecking in the islands, and sending a petition to the King. The names provide a wide variety of origins, e.g. Robert and Henry Sage (English), Richard de Tregenestre (Cornish), Ace de Veldre (French), Davy Gogch (possibly Welsh, or Cornish), and Adam le Fuiz Yaldicz (Spanish?).\\r\\nIt is not known at what point the islanders stopped speaking the Cornish language, but the language seems to have gone into decline in Cornwall beginning in the Late Middle Ages; it was still dominant between the islands and Bodmin at the time of the Reformation, but it suffered an accelerated decline thereafter. The islands appear to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of Penwith on the mainland, in contrast to the history of Irish or Scottish Gaelic.\\r\\nDuring the English Civil War, the Parliamentarians captured the isles, only to see their garrison mutiny and return the isles to the Royalists. By 1651 the Royalist governor, Sir John Grenville, was using the islands as a base for privateering raids on Commonwealth and Dutch shipping. The Dutch admiral Maarten Tromp sailed to the isles and on arriving on 30 May 1651 demanded compensation. In the absence of compensation or a satisfactory reply, he declared war on England in June. It was during this period that the Three Hundred and Thirty Five Years' War started between the isles and the Netherlands.\\r\\nIn June 1651, Admiral Robert Blake recaptured the isles for the Parliamentarians. Blake's initial attack on Old Grimsby failed, but the next attacks succeeded in taking Tresco and Bryher. Blake placed a battery on Tresco to fire on St Mary's, but one of the guns exploded, killing its crew and injuring Blake. A second battery proved more successful. Subsequently, Grenville and Blake negotiated terms that permitted the Royalists to surrender honourably. The Parliamentary forces then set to fortifying the islands. They built Cromwell's Castlea gun platform on the west side of Trescousing materials scavenged from an earlier gun platform further up the hill. Although this poorly sited earlier platform dated back to the 1550s, it is now referred to as King Charles's Castle.\\r\\nDuring the night of 22 October 1707, the isles were the scene of one of the worst maritime disasters in British history, when out of a fleet of 21 Royal Navy ships headed from Gibraltar to Portsmouth, six were driven onto the cliffs. Four of the ships sank or capsized, with at least 1,450 dead, including the commanding admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell.\\r\\nThere is evidence for inundation by the tsunami caused by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.[14]\\r\\nThe islands appear to have been raided frequently by Barbary pirates to enslave residents to support the Barbary slave trade.[15]\\r\\nAn early governor of Scilly was Thomas Godolphin, whose son Francis received a lease on the Isles in 1568. They were styled Governors of Scilly and the Godolphins and their Osborne relatives held this position until 1834. In 1834 Augustus John Smith acquired the lease from the Duchy for S20,000.[16] Smith created the title Lord Proprietor of the Isles of Scilly for himself, and many of his actions were unpopular. The lease remained in his family until it expired for most of the Isles in 1920 when ownership reverted to the Duchy of Cornwall. Today, the Dorrien-Smith estate still holds the lease for the island of Tresco.\\r\\nThe Isles of Scilly form an archipelago of five inhabited islands (six if Gugh is counted separately from St Agnes) and numerous other small rocky islets (around 140 in total) lying 45?km (28?mi) off Land's End.[18]\\r\\nThe islands' position produces a place of great contrastthe ameliorating effect of the sea, greatly influenced by the North Atlantic Current, means they rarely have frost or snow, which allows local farmers to grow flowers well ahead of those in mainland Britain. The chief agricultural product is cut flowers, mostly daffodils. Exposure to Atlantic winds also means that spectacular winter gales lash the islands from time to time. This is reflected in the landscape, most clearly seen on Tresco where the lush Abbey Gardens on the sheltered southern end of the island contrast with the low heather and bare rock sculpted by the wind on the exposed northern end.\\r\\nNatural England has designated the Isles of Scilly as National Character Area 158.[19] As part of a 2002 marketing campaign, the plant conservation charity Plantlife chose sea thrift (Armeria maritima) as the \\"county flower\\" of the islands.[6][20]\\r\\nThis table provides an overview of the most important islands:\\r\\n(1) Inhabited until 1855.\\r\\nIn 1975 the islands were designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The designation covers the entire archipelago, including the uninhabited islands and rocks, and is the smallest such area in the UK. The islands of Annet and Samson have large terneries and the islands are well populated by seals. The Isles of Scilly are the only British haunt of the lesser white-toothed shrew (Crocidura suaveolens), where it is known locally as a \\"teak\\" or \\"teke\\".[21]\\r\\nThe islands are famous among birdwatchers for their ability to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far flung islands first.\\r\\nThe tidal range at the Isles of Scilly is high for an open sea location; the maximum for St Mary's is 5.99?m (19.7?ft). Additionally, the inter-island waters are mostly shallow, which at \\"spring tides\\" allows for dry land walking between several of the islands. Many of the northern islands can be reached from Tresco, including Bryher, Samson and St Martin's (requires very low tides). From St Martin's White Island, Little Ganilly and Great Arthur are reachable. Although the sound between St Mary's and Tresco, The Road, is fairly shallow, it never becomes totally dry ÿ but according to some sources it should be possible to wade at extreme low tides. Around St Mary's several minor islands become accessible, including Taylor's Island on the west coast and Tolls Island on the east coast. From Saint Agnes, Gugh becomes accessible at each low tide, via a tombolo.\\r\\nThe Isles of Scilly has a temperate Oceanic climate (K?ppen climate classification Cfb), and has one of the mildest climates in the United Kingdom. The average annual temperature is 11.8?C (53.2?F) in comparison to London, where it is 11.6?C (52.9?F). Winters are among the warmest in the country due to the moderating effects of the ocean, and despite being on exactly the same latitude as Winnipeg in Canada, snow and frost are extremely rare. Summers are not as warm as on the mainland. The Scilly Isles are one of the sunniest areas in the southwest with on average 7 hours per day in May. The lowest temperature ever recorded was ?7.2?C (19.0?F) and the highest was 27.8?C (82.0?F).[23] The maximum snowfall was 23?cm (9?in) on 12 January 1987.[24] It has never recorded a temperature below freezing between May and November.\\r\\nAll the islands of Scilly are all composed of granite rock of early Permian age, an exposed part of the Cornubian batholith. The Irish Sea Glacier terminated just to the north of the Isles of Scilly during the last Ice Age.[26][27]\\r\\nPolitically, the islands are part of England, one of the four countries of the United Kingdom. They are represented in the UK Parliament as part of the St Ives constituency. As part of the United Kingdom, the islands are part of the European Union and are represented in the European Parliament as part of the multi-member South West England constituency.\\r\\nSee also: Council of the Isles of Scilly\\r\\nHistorically, the Isles of Scilly were administered as one of the hundreds of Cornwall, although the Cornwall quarter sessions had limited jurisdiction there. For judicial purposes, shrievalty purposes, and lieutenancy purposes, the Isles of Scilly are \\"deemed to form part of the county of Cornwall\\".[28] The archipelago is part of the Duchy of Cornwall[29] ÿ the duchy owns the freehold of most of the land on the islands and the duke exercises certain formal rights and privileges across the territory, as he does in Cornwall proper.\\r\\nThe Local Government Act 1888 allowed the Local Government Board to establish in the Isles of Scilly \\"councils and other local authorities separate from those of the county of Cornwall\\"... \\"for the application to the islands of any act touching local government.\\" Accordingly, in 1890 the Isles of Scilly Rural District Council (the RDC) was formed as a sui generis unitary authority, outside the administrative county of Cornwall. Cornwall County Council provided some services to the Isles, for which the RDC made financial contributions. The Isles of Scilly Order 1930[30] granted the Council the \\"powers, duties and liabilities\\" of a county council. Section 265 of the Local Government Act 1972 allowed for the continued existence of the RDC, but renamed as the Council of the Isles of Scilly.[31][32]\\r\\nThis unusual status also means that much administrative law (for example relating to the functions of local authorities, the health service and other public bodies) that applies in the rest of England applies in modified form in the islands.[33]\\r\\nThe Council of the Isles of Scilly is a separate authority to the Cornwall Council unitary authority, and as such the islands are not part of the administrative county of Cornwall. However the islands are still considered to be part of the ceremonial county of Cornwall.\\r\\nWith a total population of just over 2,000, the council represents fewer inhabitants than many English parish councils, and is by far the smallest English unitary council. As of 2015[update], 130 people are employed full-time by the council[34] to provide local services (including water supply and air traffic control). These numbers are significant, in that almost 10% of the adult population of the islands is directly linked to the council, as an employee or a councillor.[35]\\r\\nThe Council consists of 21 elected councillors  13 of whom are returned by the ward of St Mary's, and two from each of four \\"off-island\\" wards (St Martin's, St Agnes, Bryher, and Tresco). The latest elections took place on 2 May 2013; all 20 elected were independents (one seat remained vacant).[36]\\r\\nThe council is headquartered at Town Hall, by The Parade park in Hugh Town, and also performs the administrative functions of the AONB Partnership[37] and the Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority.[38]\\r\\nSome aspects of local government are shared with Cornwall, including health, and the Council of the Isles of Scilly together with Cornwall Council form a Local Enterprise Partnership. In July 2015 a devolution deal was announced by the government under which Cornwall Council and the Council of the Isles of Scilly are to create a plan to bring health and social care services together under local control. The Local Enterprise Partnership is also to be bolstered.[39]\\r\\nTwo flags are used to represent Scilly:\\r\\nAn adapted version of the old Board of Ordnance flag has also been used, after it was left behind when munitions were removed from the isles. The \\"Cornish Ensign\\" (the Cornish cross with the Union Jack in the canton) has also been used.[40][43]\\r\\nThe Isles of Scilly form part of the Devon and Cornwall Police force area. There is a police station in Hugh Town.\\r\\nThe Cornwall Air Ambulance helicopter provides cover to the islands.[44]\\r\\nThe islands have their own independent fire brigade ÿ the Isles of Scilly Fire and Rescue Service ÿ which is staffed entirely by retained firefighters on all the inhabited islands.\\r\\nEducation is available on the islands up to age 16. There is one school, the Five Islands School, which provides primary schooling at sites on St Agnes, St Mary's, St Martin's and Tresco, and secondary schooling at a site on St Mary's. Secondary students from outside St Mary's live at a school boarding house (Mundesley House) during the week. In 2004, 92.9% of pupils (26 out of 28) achieved five or more GCSEs at grade C and above, compared to the English average of 53.7%.[45] Sixteen- to eighteen-year-olds are entitled to a free sixth form place at a state school or sixth form college on the mainland, and are provided with free flights and a grant towards accommodation. Post eighteen, suitably qualified students attend universities and colleges on the mainland.\\r\\nSince the mid-18th century the Scillonian economy has relied on trade with the mainland and beyond as a means of sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen the rise and fall of industries such as kelp harvesting, pilotage, smuggling, fishing, shipbuilding and, latterly, flower farming. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.[46][47][48]\\r\\nToday, tourism is estimated to account for 85% of the islands' income. The islands have been successful in attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities.[49][50] The majority of visitors stay on St Mary's, which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, Tresco is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented. Bryher and St Martin's are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. St Agnes has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.\\r\\nThe islands' economy is highly dependent on tourism, even by the standards of other island communities. The concentration [on] a small number of sectors is typical of most similarly sized UK island communities. However, it is the degree of concentration, which is distinctive along with the overall importance of tourism within the economy as a whole and the very limited manufacturing base that stands out.[47]\\r\\nTourism is also a highly seasonal industry owing to its reliance on outdoor recreation, and the lower number of tourists in winter results in a significant constriction of the islands' commercial activities. However, the tourist season benefits from an extended period of business in October when many birdwatchers (\\"birders\\") arrive.\\r\\nBecause of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and Siberia. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago.\\r\\nScilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American passerines. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island will see a significant increase in numbers of birders. This type of birding, chasing after rare birds, is called \\"twitching\\".\\r\\nThe islands are home to ornithologist Will Wagstaff.\\r\\nThe predominance of tourism means that \\"tourism is by far the main sector throughout each of the individual islands, in terms of employment... [and] this is much greater than other remote and rural areas in the United Kingdom. Tourism accounts for approximately 63% of all employment.[47]\\r\\nBusinesses dependent on tourism, with the exception of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.[47] However, much of the work generated by this, with the exception of management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, especially for those involved in cleaning, catering and retail.[51]\\r\\nBecause of the seasonality of tourism, many jobs on the islands are seasonal and part-time, so work cannot be guaranteed throughout the year. Some islanders take up other temporary jobs out of season to compensate for this. Due to a lack of local casual labour at peak holiday times, many of the larger employers accommodate guest workers, who come to the islands for the summer to have a working holiday.\\r\\nThe islands were not subject to income tax until 1954, and there was no motor vehicle excise duty levied until 1971.[52]\\r\\nSt Mary's is the only island with a significant road network and the only island with public highways; in 2005 there were 619 registered vehicles on the island. The island also has taxis and a tour bus. Vehicles on the islands are exempt from annual MOT tests.[53][54][55] Roads and streets across Scilly have very few signs or markings, and route numbers (of the three A roads on St Mary's) are not marked at all.\\r\\nAir access to the islands is via St Mary's Airport. Fixed-wing aircraft services, operated by Isles of Scilly Skybus, operate from Land's End, Newquay and Exeter.[56] The scheduled helicopter service, which previously linked Penzance Heliport with St Mary's Airport and Tresco Heliport, ceased at the end of October 2012; Tresco Heliport is now closed to scheduled services.\\r\\nBy sea, the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company provides a passenger and cargo service from Penzance to St Mary's, which is currently operated by the Scillonian III passenger ferry, supported until summer 2017 by the Gry Maritha cargo vessel and now by the Mali Rose. The other islands are linked to St. Mary's by a network of inter-island launches.[57] St Mary's Harbour is the principal harbour of the Isles of Scilly, and is located in Hugh Town.\\r\\nThe freehold land of the islands is the property of the Duchy of Cornwall (except for Hugh Town on St Mary's, which was sold to the inhabitants in 1949). The duchy also holds 3,921 acres (16?km2) as duchy property, part of the duchy's landholding.[58] All the uninhabited islands, islets and rocks and much of the untenanted land on the inhabited islands is managed by the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust, which leases these lands from the Duchy for the rent of one daffodil per year.[59] The trust currently has four full-time salaried staff and 12 trustees, who are all residents of the Isles. The full trust board is responsible for policy whilst a management team is responsible for day-to-day administration. Its small income and the small number of staff have led to the trust adopting a policy of recruiting volunteers to help it carry out its extensive work programme. While volunteers of all ages are welcome, most are young people who are studying for qualifications in related fields, such as conservation and land management.\\r\\nLimited housing availability is a contentious yet critical issue for the Isles of Scilly, especially as it affects the feasibility of residency on the islands. Few properties are privately owned, with many units being let by the Duchy of Cornwall, the council and a few by housing associations. The management of these subsequently affects the possibility of residency on the islands.[60] The Duchy Tenants Association was formed in 1996 by a number of tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall.\\r\\nHousing demand outstrips supply; a problem compounded by restrictions on further development designed to protect the islands' unique environment and prevent the infrastructural carrying capacity from being exceeded. This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly for the majority of the islands' populations, it has also affects the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.[61][62]\\r\\nHigh housing costs pose significant problems for the local population, especially as local incomes (in Cornwall) are only 70% of the national average, whilst house prices are almost S5,000 higher than the national average. This in turn affects the retention of key workers and the younger generation, which consequently affects the viability of schools and other essential community services.[49][62]\\r\\nThe limited access to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to blame for this, attracting newcomers to the area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.[63]\\r\\nAccording to the 2001 UK census, 97% of the population of the islands are white British,[1] with nearly 93% of the inhabitants born in the islands, in mainland Cornwall or elsewhere in England.[64] Since EU enlargement in 2004, a number of eastern Europeans have moved to the island, joining the Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans who traditionally made up most of the islands' overseas workers. By 2005, their numbers were estimated at nearly 100 out of a total population of just over 2,000.[65] This has been called 'the land that crime forgot'.[66]\\r\\nOne continuing legacy of the isles' past is gig racing, wherein fast rowing boats (\\"gigs\\") with crews of six (or in one case, seven) race between the main islands. Gig racing has been said to derive from the race to collect salvage from shipwrecks on the rocks around Scilly, but the race was actually to deliver a pilot onto incoming vessels, to guide them through the hazardous reefs and shallows. (The boats are correctly termed \\"pilot gigs\\"). The World Pilot Gig Championships are held annually over the May Day bank holiday weekend. The event originally involved crews from the Islands and a few crews from Cornwall, but in the intervening years the number of gigs attending has increased, with crews coming from all over the South-West and further afield.[67]\\r\\nThe Isles of Scilly feature what is reportedly the smallest football league in the world, the Isles of Scilly Football League.[68] The league's two clubs, Woolpack Wanderers and Garrison Gunners, play each other 17 times each season and compete for two cups and for the league title. The league was a launching pad for the Adidas \\"Dream Big\\" Campaign[69] in which a number of famous professional footballers (including David Beckham) arrive on the island to coach the local children's side. The two share a ground, Garrison Field, but travel to the mainland for part of the year to play other non-professional clubs.\\r\\nIn December 2006, Sport England published a survey which revealed that residents of the Isles of Scilly were the most active in England in sports and other fitness activities. 32% of the population participate at least three times a week for 30 minutes or more.[70]\\r\\nThere is a golf club with a nine-hole course (each with two tees) situated on the island of St Mary's, near Porthloo and Telegraph. The club was founded in 1904 and is open to visitors.[71]\\r\\nThe islands are served by a radio and television transmitter at Telegraph, on St Mary's, which is a relay of the main transmitter at Redruth (Cornwall) and broadcasts BBC Radio 1, 2, 3, 4 and BBC Radio Cornwall and the range of Freeview television and BBC radio channels known as 'Freeview Light'.[72] Radio Scilly, a community radio station, was launched in September 2007.\\r\\nThere is no local newspaper; Scilly Now & Then is a free community magazine produced eight times a year and is available to mainland subscribers while The Scillonian is published twice yearly and reports matters of local interest. There is an active news forum on the news and information websites scillytoday.com[73] and thisisscilly.com.[74]\\r\\nInternet access is available across the inhabited islands by means of superfast fibre broadband by BT. The islands connected via fibre are St. Mary's, Tresco and Bryher. St. Martins, St. Agnes and Gugh are connected via a new fibre microwave link from St. Mary's, with fibre cabinets on each island, including Gugh.\\r\\nMobile phone coverage is available across the archipelago, with 2G, 3G and 4G services available across all islands, although coverage does vary between operators. Vodafone and O2 provide strong 4G coverage across all the islands, whilst EE's is somewhat limited beyond Gugh towards St. Agnes. Three provide 3G coverage to all the islands, and 4G is due shortly.\\r\\nThe Isles of Scilly were featured on the TV programme Seven Natural Wonders as one of the wonders of South West England. Since 2007 the islands have featured in the BBC series An Island Parish, following various real-life stories and featuring in particular the newly appointed Chaplain to the Isles of Scilly. A 12-part series was filmed in 2007 and first broadcast on BBC2 in January 2008.[75] After Reverend David Easton left the islands in 2009, the series continued under the same name but focused elsewhere..[76]\\r\\nThe heroine of Walter Besant's novel Armorel of Lyonesse came from Samson, and about half the action of the novel takes place in the Isles of Scilly.\\r\\nThe events of Nevil Shute's novel Marazan occur, in part, around these islands.\\r\\nFive children's books written by Michael Morpurgo, Why the Whales Came, The Sleeping Sword, The Wreck of the Zanzibar, Arthur, High King of Britain and Listen to the Moon are set around the Isles of Scilly.\\r\\nThe Riddle of Samson, a novel by Andrew Garve (a pen name of Paul Winterton) is set mainly around the Isles of Scilly.\\r\\nIn Jacob's Room, by Virginia Woolf, the hero and a friend of his sail around the islands.\\r\\nThe novels that make up The Cortes Trilogy by John Paul Davis take place in the Isles of Scilly.\\r\\nStone In the Blood[77] by Colin Jordan & David England is set on the islands both in 1974 and the Iron Age, when most of Scilly was still one joined landmass.\\r\\nScilly is mentioned in the traditional British naval song \\"Spanish Ladies\\".","input":"What is the population of the scilly isles?"},{"output":"16 June 1980","context":"50 centavos, 1, 2, 5, 10 meticais\\r\\nThe metical (plural: meticais) is the currency of Mozambique, abbreviated with the symbol MZN or MT.

The minimum purchase and drinking ages is a state law, and most states still permit \\"underage\\" consumption of alcohol in some circumstances. In some states, no restriction on private consumption is made, while in other states, consumption is only allowed in specific locations, in the presence of consenting and supervising family members, as in the states of Colorado, Maryland, Montana, New York, Texas, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

In 1920, the 18th amendment to the U.S. Constitution declared it illegal to manufacture, transport, or sell intoxicating liquors.[5] This was repealed with the passing of the 21st Amendment in 1933, which was followed by the adoption of minimum legal drinking age policies in all states, with most states electing a minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) of 21.[5] Between 1970 and 1975, 29 states lowered the MLDA from 21 to 18, 19, or 20. This was primarily due to the passing of the 26th Amendment, which lowered the required voting age from 21 to 18.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1960s, both Congress and the state legislatures came under increasing pressure to lower the minimum voting age from 21 to 18. This was in large part due to the Vietnam War, in which many young men who were ineligible to vote (or legally drink) were conscripted to fight in the war, thus lacking any means to influence the people sending them off to risk their lives. \\"Old enough to fight, old enough to vote,\\" was a common slogan used by proponents of lowering the voting age. The slogan traced its roots to World War II, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt lowered the military draft age to 18. With the lowering of the voting age to 18, the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) was similarly lowered under the notion that by being able to vote (and for males, be subject to being involuntarily drafted into the enlisted ranks of the military), one should also be able to legally consume alcoholic beverages.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, these changes were soon followed by studies showing an increase in motor vehicle fatalities attributable to the decreased MLDA. In response to these findings, many states raised the minimum legal drinking age to 19 (and sometimes to 20 or 21).[5] In 1984, the National Minimum Legal Drinking Act, written by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) and influenced by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), required all states to enforce a minimum legal drinking age of 21 or else risk losing 10% of all federal highway construction funds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the MLDA was still left to the discretion of the state, the act did not violate the 21st amendment which reserved the right to regulate alcohol for all responsibilities not specifically appointed to the federal government to the states.[5] However, as the act controlled the distribution of anywhere from $8 million to $99 million, depending on the size of the state, the act gave a strong incentive for states to change the drinking age to 21.[5] By 1995, all 50 states, two permanently inhabited territories, and D.C. were in compliance, but Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (and Guam until 2010) remained at 18 despite them losing 10% of federal highway funding.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor of law Tim Jost noted that the Roberts Court ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius, though upholding South Dakota v. Dole, had serious implications for future laws that incentivize state action.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Court expressly distinguished South Dakota v. Dole, the drinking age case, because only a small portion of highway funds were at risk.... There will certainly be future litigation when other federal programs are changed and all of the funding for the existing program is at risk, however.\\r\\nConstitutional lawyer Adam Winkler disagrees saying[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe health care decision on Medicaid is likely to be limited to its facts.... Where a state's budget is truly dependent on federal dollars to survive, then conditional spending offers will be called into question. The health care decision doesn't purport to call into question any previous conditional spending law. And its not likely to have much impact because there's no clear majority opinion establishing new limits.\\r\\nThe Conservative Party of New York opposed the passage of the law in 1984.  In 2001, according to the same article, New York State Assembly member Flix Ortiz introduced a bill that would lower the drinking age back to 18. He cited unfairness and difficulty with enforcement as his motivations.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, the National Youth Rights Association was founded, in part, to seek to lower the drinking age back to 18. In 2004, the president of Vermont's Middlebury College, John McCardell, Jr. wrote in The New York Times that \\"the 21-year-old drinking age is bad social policy and terrible law\\" that has made the college drinking problem far worse.[9] Groups that oppose the 21 minimum include Choose Responsibility, the Amethyst Initiative, and Students for Sensible Drug Policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMothers Against Drunk Driving supports the 21 law and has been the main opponent to lowering it back to 18.\\r\\n\\r\\nA key cluster of philosophical opposition to the minimum lies in the natural human need for education and experience; young adults do not receive the opportunity to educate themselves and drink responsibly before the age of 21.  A related line of thought emphasizes the importance of individual rights and freedoms.[5]  Another cluster comes from pragmatism, emphasizing the reality that young people are unlikely to stop drinking, and point to statistics on underage drinking as a reason to institute a lower drinking age, which would provide the opportunity to help \\"young people learn to make healthy and responsible choices\\".[5] Social environmental theories are also cited; making alcohol a forbidden fruit may encourage more dangerous drinking than would occur if the drinking age were lowered.[10][11]  With a lower drinking age, young people would have access to \\"publicly moderated drinking environments\\", rather than \\"model their behavior after the excessive consumption typical of private student parties\\",[12] though the perception of excessive drinking on college campuses is often overstated.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen brewing magnate Pete Coors raised the drinking age as a campaign issue during the 2004 U.S. Senate race in Colorado, Republican leaders praised his stand on states' rights but distanced themselves from apparent self-interest.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nCollege campuses across the nation continue to struggle with issues of underage drinking, despite the nationwide MLDA of 21. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) took special interest in this issue, and compiled a list of recommendations for colleges to implement in order to combat underage drinking on campus. However, few schools have actually implemented these recommendations, and according to a recent study, most of the intervention programs currently in place on college campuses have proven ineffective. Underage drinking is nearly impossible to prevent on college campuses because access to alcoholic beverages is extremely easy.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough it is not the only factor that contributes to student drinking, liquor's contraband status seems to imbue it with mystique.  As a result, use and abuse of liquor is seen as sophisticated and is expected.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the colleges surveyed, 98% offered alcohol education programs to their students. Only 50% of surveyed colleges offered intervention programs, 33% coordinated efforts with the surrounding community to monitor illegal alcohol sales, 15% confirmed that surrounding establishments offered responsible beverage service training, and 7% restricted the number of alcohol outlets within the community. Special services for \\"problem drinkers\\" were available at 67% of the surveyed schools; 22% of the schools referred problem drinkers to off-campus resources, and 11% offered no intervention program whatsoever. 34% of the surveyed schools were located in communities which actively instituted compliance checks, but 60% of these checks occurred without university involvement. One fifth of surveyed schools were all together unaware of the NIAAA's recommendations.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany factors may explain colleges' failure to implement the NIAAA's recommendations to control underage drinking on campus: a lack of university funding, a lack of time, a perceived lack of authority or jurisdiction within the community, or even a lack of interest on the part of the university, many universities even see the program as a waste of resources. Whatever the reasons may be, a multitude of options are available should colleges choose to institute programs to decrease instances of underage drinking on campus. These options include, but are not limited to, alcohol education programs, social norms campaigns, substance-free housing, individual interventions, parental notification policies, disciplinary procedures for alcohol-related violations, and amnesty policies to protect the health and safety of students.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral studies, including a 2011 review, were found to disprove the idea that raising the drinking age to 21 actually saved lives in the long run.[17][18][19][20] For example, Miron and Tetelbaum (2009) found that when the federally coerced and non-coerced states were separated out, any lifesaving effect is no longer statistically or practically significant in the coerced states, and even in the voluntary-adopting states the effect does not seem to last beyond the first year or two.  They also find that the 21 drinking age appears to have only a minor impact on teen drinking.[21] There is also some evidence that traffic deaths were merely shifted from the 18-20 age group to the 21-24 age group rather than averted.[22][23][20] Additionally, Canada, Australia, the UK, and several other nations saw similar or faster declines in traffic fatalities than the USA did since the early 1980s despite not raising their drinking ages to 21.[24]  Thus, the magnitude of any public health and safety benefits of the 21 drinking age, at least relative to a legal drinking age of 18, remains unclear.","input":"When was the national minimum drinking age act passed?"},{"output":"either the 10th or 11th century","context":"The European colonization of the Americas describes the history of the settlement and establishment of control of the continents of the Americas by various European powers. Starting in either the 10th or 11th century, when West Norse sailors explored and briefly settled on the shores of present-day Canada, according to Icelandic Sagas, violent conflicts with the indigenous population ultimately led to the Norse abandoning those settlements.[1]\\r\\nEuropean colonization began in 1492, when a Spanish expedition headed by the Genoese explorer Christopher Columbus sailed west to find a new trade route to the Far East but inadvertently landed in what came to be known to Europeans as the \\"New World\\". Running aground on the northern part of Hispaniola on 5 December 1492, which the Taino people had inhabited since the 7th century, the site became the first European settlement in the Americas. European conquest, large-scale exploration and colonization soon followed. Columbus's first two voyages (1492ÿ93) reached the Bahamas and various Caribbean islands, including Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and Cuba. In 1497, sailing from Bristol on behalf of England, John Cabot landed on the North American coast, and a year later, Columbus's third voyage reached the South American coast. As the sponsor of Christopher Columbus's voyages, Spain was the first European power to settle and colonize the largest areas, from North America and the Caribbean to the southern tip of South America.\\r\\nOther powers such as France also founded colonies in the Americas: in eastern North America, a number of Caribbean islands and small coastal parts of South America. Portugal colonized Brazil, tried colonizing the eastern coasts of present-day Canada and settled for extended periods northwest (on the east bank) of the River Plate. The Age of Exploration was the beginning of territorial expansion for several European countries. Europe had been preoccupied with internal wars and was slowly recovering from the loss of population caused by the Black Death; thus the rapid rate at which it grew in wealth and power was unforeseeable in the early 15th century.[2]\\r\\nEventually, most of the Western Hemisphere came under the control of European governments, leading to changes to its landscape, population, and plant and animal life. In the 19th century over 50 million people left Europe for the Americas.[3] The post-1492 era is known as the period of the Columbian Exchange, a dramatically widespread exchange of animals, plants, culture, human populations (including slaves), ideas and communicable disease between the American and Afro-Eurasian hemispheres following Columbus's voyages to the Americas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNorse journeys to Greenland and Canada are supported by historical and archaeological evidence.[4] A Norse colony in Greenland was established in the late 10th century, and lasted until the mid 15th century, with court and parliament assemblies (ting) taking place at Brattahle and a bishop located at Garear.[5] The remains of a Norse settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, Canada, were discovered in 1960 and were dated to around the year 1000 (carbon dating estimate 990ÿ1050 CE).[6] L'Anse aux Meadows is the only site widely accepted as evidence of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. It was named a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1978.[7] It is also notable for its possible connection with the attempted colony of Vinland, established by Leif Erikson around the same period or, more broadly, with the West Norse colonization of the Americas.[8]\\r\\nEarly explorations and conquests were made by the Spanish and the Portuguese immediately following their own final reconquest of Iberia in 1492. In the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, ratified by the Pope, these two kingdoms divided the entire non-European world into two areas of exploration and colonization, with a north to south boundary that cut through the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern part of present-day Brazil. Based on this treaty and on early claims by Spanish explorer Vasco N~?ez de Balboa, discoverer of the Pacific Ocean in 1513, the Spanish conquered large territories in North, Central and South America.\\r\\nSpanish conquistador Hernn Corts took over the Aztec Kingdom and Francisco Pizarro conquered the Inca Empire. As a result, by the mid-16th century, the Spanish Crown had gained control of much of western South America, Central America and southern North America, in addition to its earlier Caribbean territories. Over this same timeframe, Portugal claimed lands in North America (Canada) and colonized much of eastern South America, naming it Santa Cruz and Brazil.\\r\\nOther European nations soon disputed the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas. England and France attempted to plant colonies in the Americas in the 16th century, but these failed. England and France succeeded in establishing permanent colonies in the following century, along with the Dutch Republic. Some of these were on Caribbean islands, which had often already been conquered by the Spanish or depopulated by disease, while others were in eastern North America, which had not been colonized by Spain north of Florida.\\r\\nEarly European possessions in North America included Spanish Florida, Spanish New Mexico, the English colonies of Virginia (with its North Atlantic offshoot, Bermuda) and New England, the French colonies of Acadia and Canada, the Swedish colony of New Sweden, and the Dutch New Netherland. In the 18th century, DenmarkÿNorway revived its former colonies in Greenland, while the Russian Empire gained a foothold in Alaska. Denmark-Norway would later make several claims in the Caribbean, starting in the 1600s.\\r\\nAs more nations gained an interest in the colonization of the Americas, competition for territory became increasingly fierce. Colonists often faced the threat of attacks from neighboring colonies, as well as from indigenous tribes and pirates.\\r\\nThe first phase of well-financed European activity in the Americas began with the Atlantic Ocean crossings of Christopher Columbus (1492ÿ1504), sponsored by Spain, whose original attempt was to find a new route to India and China, known as \\"the Indies\\". He was followed by other explorers such as John Cabot, who was sponsored by England and reached Newfoundland. Pedro lvares Cabral reached Brazil and claimed it for Portugal.\\r\\nAmerigo Vespucci, working for Portugal in voyages from 1497 to 1513, established that Columbus had reached a new set of continents. Cartographers still use a Latinized version of his first name, America, for the two continents. Other explorers included Giovanni da Verrazzano, sponsored by France in 1524; the Portuguese Jo?o Vaz Corte-Real in Newfoundland; Jo?o Fernandes Lavrador, Gaspar and Miguel Corte-Real and Jo?o lvares Fagundes, in Newfoundland, Greenland, Labrador, and Nova Scotia (from 1498 to 1502, and in 1520); Jacques Cartier (1491ÿ1557), Henry Hudson (1560sÿ1611), and Samuel de Champlain (1567ÿ1635), who explored the region of Canada he reestablished as New France.\\r\\nIn 1513, Vasco N~?ez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama and led the first European expedition to see the Pacific Ocean from the west coast of the New World. In an action with enduring historical import, Balboa claimed the Pacific Ocean and all the lands adjoining it for the Spanish Crown. It was 1517 before another expedition, from Cuba, visited Central America, landing on the coast of Yucatn in search of slaves.\\r\\nThese explorations were followed, notably in the case of Spain, by a phase of conquest: The Spaniards, having just finished the Reconquista of Spain from Muslim rule, were the first to colonize the Americas, applying the same model of governing their European holdings to their territories of the New World.\\r\\nTen years after Columbus's discovery, the administration of Hispaniola was given to Nicols de Ovando of the Order of Alcntara, founded during the Reconquista. As in the Iberian Peninsula, the inhabitants of Hispaniola were given new landmasters, while religious orders handled the local administration. Progressively the encomienda system, which granted tribute (access to indigenous labor and taxation) to European settlers, was set in place.\\r\\nA relatively common misconception is that a small number of conquistadores conquered vast territories, aided only by disease epidemics and their powerful caballeros. In fact, recent archaeological excavations have suggested a vast Spanish-Indian alliance numbering in the hundreds of thousands.[9] Hernn Corts eventually conquered Mexico with the help of Tlaxcala in 1519ÿ1521, while the conquest of the Incas was carried out by some 40,000 Incan renegades led by Francisco Pizarro in between 1532 and 1535.\\r\\nOver the 1st century and a half after Columbus's voyages, the native population of the Americas plummeted by an estimated 80% (from around 50 million in 1492 to eight million in 1650[10]), mostly by outbreaks of Old World diseases.\\r\\nIn 1532, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor sent a vice-king to Mexico, Antonio de Mendoza, in order to prevent Cortes' independentist drives, who definitively returned to Spain in 1540. Two years later, Charles V signed the New Laws (which replaced the Laws of Burgos of 1512) prohibiting slavery and the repartimientos, but also claiming as his own all the American lands and all of the indigenous people as his own subjects.\\r\\nWhen in May 1493, the Pope Alexander VI issued the Inter caetera bull granting the new lands to the Kingdom of Spain, he requested in exchange an evangelization of the people. Thus, during Columbus's second voyage, Benedictine friars accompanied him, along with twelve other priests. As slavery was prohibited between Christians, and could only be imposed in non-Christian prisoners of war or on men already sold as slaves, the debate on Christianization was particularly acute during the 16th century. In 1537, the papal bull Sublimis Deus definitively recognized that Native Americans possessed souls, thus prohibiting their enslavement, without putting an end to the debate. Some claimed that a native who had rebelled and then been captured could be enslaved nonetheless.\\r\\nLater, the Valladolid debate between the Dominican priest Bartolom de Las Casas and another Dominican philosopher Juan Gins de Sep~lveda was held, with the former arguing that Native Americans were beings doted with souls, as all other human beings, while the latter argued to the contrary and justified their enslavement.\\r\\nThe process of Christianization was at first violent: when the first Franciscans arrived in Mexico in 1524, they burned the places dedicated to pagan cult, alienating much of the local population.[11] In the 1530s, they began to adapt Christian practices to local customs, including the building of new churches on the sites of ancient places of worship, leading to a mix of Old World Christianity with local religions.[11] The Spanish Roman Catholic Church, needing the natives' labor and cooperation, evangelized in Quechua, Nahuatl, Guaran and other Native American languages, contributing to the expansion of these indigenous languages and equipping some of them with writing systems. One of the first primitive schools for Native Americans was founded by Fray Pedro de Gante in 1523.\\r\\nTo reward their troops, the Conquistadores often allotted Indian towns to their troops and officers. Black African slaves were introduced to substitute for Native American labor in some locationsincluding the West Indies, where the indigenous population was nearing extinction on many islands.\\r\\nDuring this time, the Portuguese gradually switched from an initial plan of establishing trading posts to extensive colonization of what is now Brazil. They imported millions of slaves to run their plantations. The Portuguese and Spanish royal governments expected to rule these settlements and collect at least 20% of all treasure found (the quinto real collected by the Casa de Contrataci܇n), in addition to collecting all the taxes they could. By the late 16th century American silver accounted for one-fifth of Spain's total budget.[12] In the 16th century perhaps 240,000 Europeans entered American ports.[13][14]\\r\\nInspired by the Spanish riches from colonies founded upon the conquest of the Aztecs, Incas, and other large Native American populations in the 16th century, the first Englishmen to settle permanently in America hoped for some of the same rich discoveries when they established their first permanent settlement in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. They were sponsored by common stock companies such as the chartered Virginia Company financed by wealthy Englishmen who exaggerated the economic potential of this new land. The main purpose of this colony was the hope of finding gold.[2]\\r\\nIt took strong leaders, like John Smith, to convince the colonists of Jamestown that searching for gold was not taking care of their immediate needs for food and shelter and the biblical principle that \\"he who will not work shall not eat\\" (see 2 Thessalonians 3). The lack of food security leading to extremely high mortality rate was quite distressing and cause for despair among the colonists. To support the Colony, numerous supply missions were organized. Tobacco later became a cash crop, with the work of John Rolfe and others, for export and the sustaining economic driver of Virginia and the neighboring colony of Maryland.\\r\\nFrom the beginning of Virginia's settlements in 1587 until the 1680s, the main source of labor and a large portion of the immigrants were indentured servants looking for new life in the overseas colonies. During the 17th century, indentured servants constituted three-quarters of all European immigrants to the Chesapeake region. Most of the indentured servants were teenagers from England with poor economic prospects at home. Their fathers signed the papers that gave them free passage to America and an unpaid job until they became of age. They were given food, clothing, housing and taught farming or household skills. American landowners were in need of laborers and were willing to pay for a laborers passage to America if they served them for several years. By selling passage for five to seven years worth of work they could then start out on their own in America.[15] Many of the migrants from England died in the first few years.[2]\\r\\nEconomic advantage also prompted the Darien Scheme, an ill-fated venture by the Kingdom of Scotland to settle the Isthmus of Panama in the late 1690s. The Darien Scheme aimed to control trade through that part of the world and thereby promote Scotland into a world trading power. However, it was doomed by poor planning, short provisions, weak leadership, lack of demand for trade goods, and devastating disease.[16] The failure of the Darien Scheme was one of the factors that led the Kingdom of Scotland into the Act of Union 1707 with the Kingdom of England creating the united Kingdom of Great Britain and giving Scotland commercial access to English, now British, colonies.[17]\\r\\nIn the French colonial regions, the focus of economy was on sugar plantations in Caribbean. In Canada the fur trade with the natives was important. About 16,000 French men and women became colonizers. The great majority became subsistence farmers along the St. Lawrence River. With a favorable disease environment and plenty of land and food, their numbers grew exponentially to 65,000 by 1760. Their colony was taken over by Britain in 1760, but social, religious, legal, cultural and economic changes were few in a society that clung tightly to its recently formed traditions.[18][19]\\r\\nRoman Catholics were the first major religious group to immigrate to the New World, as settlers in the colonies of Portugal and Spain (and later, France) belonged to that faith. English and Dutch colonies, on the other hand, tended to be more religiously diverse. Settlers to these colonies included Anglicans, Dutch Calvinists, English Puritans and other nonconformists, English Catholics, Scottish Presbyterians, French Huguenots, German and Swedish Lutherans, as well as Quakers, Mennonites, Amish, Moravians and Jews of various nationalities.\\r\\nMany groups of colonists went to the Americas searching for the right to practice their religion without persecution. The Protestant Reformation of the 16th century broke the unity of Western Christendom and led to the formation of numerous new religious sects, which often faced persecution by governmental authorities. In England, many people came to question the organization of the Church of England by the end of the 16th century. One of the primary manifestations of this was the Puritan movement, which sought to \\"purify\\" the existing Church of England of its many residual Catholic rites that they believed had no mention in the Bible.\\r\\nA strong believer in the notion of rule by divine right, Charles I, King of England and Scotland, persecuted religious dissenters. Waves of repression led to the migration of about 20,000 Puritans to New England between 1629 and 1642, where they founded multiple colonies. Later in the century, the new Pennsylvania colony was given to William Penn in settlement of a debt the king owed his father. Its government was set up by William Penn in about 1682 to become primarily a refuge for persecuted English Quakers; but others were welcomed. Baptists, Quakers, German and Swiss Protestants and Anabaptists flocked to Pennsylvania. The lure of cheap land, religious freedom and the right to improve themselves with their own hand was very attractive.[20]\\r\\nSlavery was a common practice in the Americas prior to the arrival of Europeans, as different American Indian groups captured and held other tribes' members as slaves.[21] Many of these captives were forced to undergo human sacrifice in Amerindian civilizations such as the Aztecs. In response to some enslavement of natives in the Caribbean during the early years, the Spanish Crown passed a series of laws prohibiting slavery as early as 1512. A new stricter set of laws was passed in 1542, called the New Laws of the Indies for the Good Treatment and Preservation of Indians, or simply New Laws. These were created to prevent the exploitation of the indigenous peoples by the encomenderos or landowners, by strictly limiting their power and dominion.[22] This helped curb Indian slavery considerably, though not completely. Later, with the arrival of other European colonial powers in the New World, the enslavement of native populations increased, as these empires lacked legislation against slavery until decades later. The population of indigenous peoples declined (mostly from European diseases, but also from forced exploitation and atrocities). Later, native workers were replaced by Africans imported through a large commercial slave trade.\\r\\nBy the 18th century, the overwhelming number of black slaves was such that Amerindian slavery was less commonly used. Africans, who were taken aboard slave ships to the Americas, were primarily obtained from their African homelands by coastal tribes who captured and sold them. Europeans traded for slaves with the slave capturers of the local native African tribes in exchange for rum, guns, gunpowder, and other manufactures.\\r\\nThe total slave trade to islands in the Caribbean, Brazil, Mexico and to the United States is estimated to have involved 12 million Africans.[23][24] The vast majority of these slaves went to sugar colonies in the Caribbean and to Brazil, where life expectancy was short and the numbers had to be continually replenished. At most about 600,000 African slaves were imported into the U.S., or 5% of the 12 million slaves brought across from Africa.[25] Life expectancy was much higher in the U.S. (because of better food, less disease, lighter work loads, and better medical care) so the numbers grew rapidly by excesses of births over deaths, reaching 4 million by the 1860 Census. From 1770 until 1860, the rate of natural growth of North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that of England.[26]\\r\\nSlaves imported to the Thirteen colonies/United States by time period:[27]\\r\\nThe European lifestyle included a long history of sharing close quarters with domesticated animals such as cows, pigs, sheep, goats, horses, and various domesticated fowl, from which many diseases originally stemmed. Thus, in contrast to the indigenous people, Europeans had developed a richer endowment of antibodies.[29] The large-scale contact with Europeans after 1492 introduced novel germs to the indigenous people of the Americas.\\r\\nEpidemics of smallpox (1518, 1521, 1525, 1558, 1589), typhus (1546), influenza (1558), diphtheria (1614) and measles (1618) swept the Americas subsequent to European contact,[30][31] killing between 10 million and 100 million[32] people, up to 95% of the indigenous population of the Americas.[33] The cultural and political instability attending these losses appears to have been of substantial aid in the efforts of various colonists in New England and Massachusetts to acquire control over the great wealth in land and resources of which indigenous societies had customarily made use.[34]\\r\\nSuch diseases yielded human mortality of an unquestionably enormous gravity and scale ÿ and this has profoundly confused efforts to determine its full extent with any true precision. Estimates of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas vary tremendously.\\r\\nOthers have argued that significant variations in population size over pre-Columbian history are reason to view higher-end estimates with caution. Such estimates may reflect historical population maxima, while indigenous populations may have been at a level somewhat below these maxima or in a moment of decline in the period just prior to contact with Europeans. Indigenous populations hit their ultimate lows in most areas of the Americas in the early 20th century; in a number of cases, growth has returned.[35]\\r\\nGeographic differences between the colonies played a large determinant in the types of political and economic systems that later developed. In their paper on institutions and long-run growth, economists Daron Acemo?lu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson argue that certain natural endowments gave rise to distinct colonial policies promoting either smallholder or coerced labor production.[36] Densely settled populations, for example, were more easily exploitable and profitable as slave labor. In these regions, landowning elites were economically incentivized to develop forced labor arrangements such as the Peru mit'a system or Argentinian latifundias without regard for democratic norms. French and British colonial leaders, conversely, were incentivized to develop capitalist markets, property rights, and democratic institutions in response to natural environments that supported smallholder production over forced labor.\\r\\nJames Mahoney, a professor at Northwestern University, proposes that colonial policy choices made at critical junctures regarding land ownership in coffee-rich Central America fostered enduring path dependent institutions.[37] Coffee economies in Guatemala and El Salvador, for example, were centralized around large plantations that operated under coercive labor systems. By the 19th century, their political structures were largely authoritarian and militarized. In Colombia and Costa Rica, conversely, liberal reforms were enacted at critical junctures to expand commercial agriculture, and they ultimately raised the bargaining power of the middle class. Both nations eventually developed more democratic and egalitarian institutions than their highly concentrated landowning counterparts.\\r\\nIn 2007, the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History and the Virginia Historical Society (VHS) co-organized a traveling exhibition to recount the strategic alliances and violent conflict between European empires (English, Spanish, French) and the Native people living in North America. The exhibition was presented in three languages and with multiple perspectives. Artifacts on display included rare surviving Native and European artifacts, maps, documents, and ceremonial objects from museums and royal collections on both sides of the Atlantic. The exhibition opened in Richmond, Virginia on March 17, 2007, and closed at the Smithsonian International Gallery on October 31, 2009.\\r\\nThe related online exhibition explores the international origins of the societies of Canada and the United States and commemorates the 400th anniversary of three lasting settlements in Jamestown (1607), Qubec (1608), and Santa Fe (1609). The site is accessible in three languages.[38]","input":"When did the first european settlers came to america?"},{"output":"on the anterior of the distal forearm","context":"The flexor carpi ulnaris muscle (or FCU) is a muscle of the human forearm that acts to flex and adduct (medial deviation) the hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlexor carpi ulnaris muscle arises by two heads, humeral and ulnar, connected by a tendinous arch beneath which the ulnar nerve and artery pass.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts insertion is into the pisiform bone, into the hamate bone via the pisohamate ligament and into the fifth metacarpal bone via the pisometacarpal ligament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe muscle acts to flex and adduct the wrist joint.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flexor carpi ulnaris muscle is innervated by the ulnar nerve which has its roots in the C8 and T1 spinal nerves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris can be seen on the anterior of the distal forearm.

Eight teams from each of the two conferences qualify for the playoffs based on regular season points totals. The final round is commonly known as the Stanley Cup Finals, which sees the two conference champions play for the Stanley Cup.\\r\\nThe NHL has always used a playoff tournament to determine its champion. Its playoff system has changed over the years, from the league's inception in 1917 when ownership of the Stanley Cup was shared between different leagues, to when the NHL took over the Cup in 1926, to the current setup today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Stanley Cup playoffs consists of four rounds of best-of-seven series. Each series is played in a 2ÿ2ÿ1ÿ1ÿ1 format, meaning the team with home-ice advantage hosts games one, two, five, and seven, while their opponent hosts games three, four, and six. Games five, six, and seven are only played if needed.\\r\\nEight teams in each conference qualify for the playoffs. In the playoff series format instituted in 2014, the first, second, and third place team in each of the four divisions qualify for the playoffs automatically. Two additional teams from each conference, regardless of divisional alignment, also qualify for the playoffs by having the highest point totals out of the remaining teams in the conference. These teams are referred to as the Wild Cards. Since there is no attention paid to divisional alignment with the wild cards, it is possible for one division in each conference to have five teams in the postseason while the other has just three.\\r\\nIn the First Round,[1] the teams are split into two separate brackets by division. Each bracket consists of the top three divisional qualifiers and one of the wild cards. The lower seeded wild card plays against the division winner with the best record while the other wild card plays against the other division winner, and both wild cards are de facto #4 seeds. The other two series match the second and third place teams from the divisions.\\r\\nThe winners of both First Round series advance to the Second Round.[1] The reseeding in the previous format, which ensured the top seed would play the lowest remaining seed, was discarded. The winners of these series advance to the Conference Finals and the two Conference Final winners move on to the Stanley Cup Finals.[1]\\r\\nIn the first two rounds, the higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage (regardless of point record). Thereafter, it goes to the team with the better regular season record (regardless of seeding); in the case of a tie, the league's standard tiebreaking procedure is applied. The team with home-ice advantage hosts games one, two, five, and seven, while the opponent hosts games three, four, and six (games five through seven are played if necessary).\\r\\nAny ties in the standings at the end of the regular season are broken using the following protocols:\\r\\nThe National Hockey League has always used a playoff tournament to determine its champion, generally opening up its playoff games to a much larger number of teams, including those with a losing regular season record in some years (the most recent being the seventh and eighth seeded San Jose Sharks and Edmonton Oilers, respectively, in 1999).\\r\\nFrom the NHL's inception until 1920, both NHL and Pacific Coast Hockey Association teams were eligible for the Stanley Cup. The NHL's regular season was divided into two halves, with the top team from each half moving on to the league finals, which was a two-game total goals series in 1918 and a best-of-seven series in 1919. In 1920, the Ottawa Senators were automatically declared the league champion when the team had won both halves of the regular season. The two halves format was abandoned the next year, and the top two teams faced off for the NHL championship in a two-game total goals series.\\r\\nAt the time, the NHL champion would later face the winners of the PCHA and, from 1921, the Western Canada Hockey League in further rounds in order to determine the Stanley Cup champion. During this time, as the rules of the NHL and those of the western leagues differ (the main difference being that NHL rules allowed five skaters while the western leagues allowed six), the rules for each game in the Stanley Cup Finals alternated between those of the NHL and the western leagues. Before the WCHL competed for the Stanley Cup, the Cup championship series a best-of-five series. Following the involvement of the WCHL, one league champion was given a bye straight to the finals (a best-of-three affair starting in 1922), while the other two competed in a best-of-three semifinal. As travel expenses were high during these times, it was often the case that the NHL champions were sent west to compete. In a dispute between the leagues in 1923 about whether to send one or both western league champions east, the winner of the PCHA/WCHL series would proceed to the Stanley Cup Finals, while the loser of the series would face the NHL champion, both series being best-of-three.\\r\\nIn 1924 the NHL playoffs expanded from two to three teams (with the top team getting a bye to the two-game total goal NHL finals), but because the first-place Hamilton Tigers refused to play under this format, the second and third place teams played for the NHL championship in a two-game total goals affair. The Stanley Cup Finals returned to a best-of-five format the same year.[3]\\r\\nWith the merger of the PCHA and WCHL in 1925 and the merged league's collapse in 1926, the NHL took de facto control of the Stanley Cup. While the Cup would not be formally deeded to the league until 1947, from 1926 onward the NHL playoffs and the Stanley Cup playoffs are considered synonymous. The NHL was subsequently divided into the Canadian and American divisions until the 1927ÿ28 season. For 1927, six teams qualified for the playoffs, three from each division, with the division semifinals and finals being a two-game total goals affair, and the Stanley Cup Finals becoming a best-of-five series. In 1928, the playoff format was changed so that the two teams with identical division ranking would face each other (i.e. the first place teams played each other, the second place teams play each other, and likewise for the third place teams). The first place series was a best-of-five affair, with the winner proceeding to the best-of-three Stanley Cup Finals, while the others were a two-game total goals series. The winner of the second and third place series played each other in a best-of-three series, with the winner earning the other berth to the Stanley Cup Finals. This format had a slight modification the following year, where the semifinal series became a two-game total goals affair and the Stanley Cup Finals became a best-of-five series. The two-game total goals format was abolished in 1937, with those series being changed to best-of-three affairs.[4]\\r\\nThe 1930s saw the reduction of teams from ten to seven, and with it an end to the Canadian and American divisions. The Stanley Cup playoffs saw the first- and second-place teams play against each other in a best-of-seven series for one berth in the Stanley Cup Finals, while the third- to sixth-place teams battled in a series of best-of-three matches for the other berth (with the third-place team taking on the fourth-place team, and the fifth-place team against the sixth-place team). In 1939, the Stanley Cup Finals became a best-of-seven series, the format still used today.[4]\\r\\nThe 1942ÿ43 season saw the removal of the New York Americans, leaving six remaining teams (known today as the \\"Original Six\\"). Throughout this era, the first and third-place teams played in one best-of-seven semifinal, while the second and fourth-place teams played in the other best-of-seven semifinal. During this time, Detroit Red Wings fans often threw an octopus onto the ice as a good luck charm, as eight wins were required to win the Stanley Cup.[4]\\r\\nThe 1967 expansion saw the number of teams double from six to 12 in the 1967ÿ68 season, and with it the creation of the Western and Eastern divisions. The playoff format remained largely the same, with all series remaining best-of-seven, and the division champions battling for the Stanley Cup. The 1970ÿ71 season, because of fan demand, brought forth the first inter-conference playoff matchup outside of the Stanley Cup Finals since the pre-war expansion, which had the winner of the second-place versus fourth-place matchup in one conference take on the winner of the first- versus third-place matchup in the other conference for a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals. The following year had one minor change to its playoff format: a stronger team would face a weaker opponent. Thus, instead of a first-place versus third-place and a second versus fourth-place matchup in the first round, the first round had the first-place versus the fourth and the second versus the third-place. This practice of having stronger teams facing weaker opposition has continued to the present day.[4]\\r\\nThe 1974ÿ75 season saw another change to its playoff system to accommodate the league of 18 teams, 12 of which qualified for the playoffs. The top team from each division would earn a bye to the quarterfinal, while the second- and third-place teams from each division started their playoff run from a best-of-three preliminary round. In each round of the playoffs, the teams remaining were seeded regardless of divisional or conference alignment, with the preliminary-round series being a best-of-three affair while the remainder of the series remained best-of-seven. The 1977ÿ78 season had one minor change in its playoff format: although the second-place finishers from each division would qualify for the preliminary round, the four playoff spots reserved for the third-place teams were replaced by four wild-card spotsspots for the four teams with the highest regular-season point total that did not finish first or second in their divisions.[4]\\r\\nWith the absorption of four teams from the World Hockey Association in the 1979ÿ1980 season, a new playoff system was introduced where 16 of the league's 21 teams would qualify for postseason play. The four division winners would qualify for the playoffs while twelve wildcard positions rounded out the sixteen teams. At the beginning of each round the teams were seeded based on their regular season point totals, with the preliminary round being a best-of-five series while all other playoff series were best-of-seven.[4]\\r\\nThe 1981ÿ1982 season brought forth the return of divisional matchups, with the top four teams from each division qualifying for the playoffs. Division champions would be determined, followed by the Conference champions, who would meet in the Stanley Cup Finals. The division semifinals was a best-of-five affair until the 1986ÿ87 season, when it became a best-of-seven series, while all other series remained best-of seven.[4]\\r\\nFor the 1993ÿ94 season, the league revamped its playoff structure to become conference-based rather than division-based. Eight teams in each conference qualified for the playoffs. The division first-place teams were seeded first (the team with the best record in the conference) and second in the conference playoffs and received home ice advantage for the first two rounds. The next six best teams in each conference also qualified and were seeded third through eighth. All teams played in the first round: first-place versus eighth, second versus seventh, third versus sixth and fourth versus fifth. All series were best-of-seven, but the arrangement of home games was changed for Central and Pacific division teams. Instead of the normal 2ÿ2ÿ1ÿ1ÿ1 rotation, a series involving teams from both divisions was 2ÿ3ÿ2, with the higher seeded team having the option of starting play at home or on the road (ALL teams with home-ice advantage chose to play the default 2-2-1-1-1 format, from 1995-1998). After each round, surviving teams were reseeded to play a conference semi-final, then a conference final. The conference winners then played each other in the Stanley Cup Finals. Home ice advantage was determined by higher seed in the first three rounds and by regular-season points of the two teams in the Stanley Cup Finals.[4]\\r\\nIn 1998ÿ99, the league was re-organized into two conferences of three divisions apiece, resulting in the playoff format used through 2013. The qualifiers remained sixteen, but the seeding changed. The three first-place teams in each division qualified and were seeded first through third for the playoffs. Of the other teams in each conference, the top five finishers qualified for the fourth through eighth seedings. All teams played in the first round: first-place versus eighth, second versus seventh, third versus sixth and fourth versus fifth, by those criteria. After each round, surviving teams were reseeded to play a conference semi-final, then a conference final. Like the 1994ÿ1998 system, the conference winners then played each other in the Stanley Cup Finals, and home ice advantage was determined by higher seed in the first three rounds and by regular-season points of the two teams in the Stanley Cup Finals.[4]\\r\\nThe NHL realigned into a four-division, two-conference system for the 2013ÿ14 season. Under the new postseason system, the top three teams in each division make the playoffs, with two wild-cards in each conference (for a total of eight playoff teams from each conference). The format is division-based, similar to the 1981ÿ82 system. In the First Round, the top-ranked team in the conference plays against the lowest-ranked wild-card, while the other division winner plays against the higher ranked wild-card. The second and third place teams in each division then play each other. The first round winners then meet in the Second Round. The third round will still consist of the Western Conference and Eastern Conference Finals, with those conference winners advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals.[5]\\r\\nCompared to other major professional sports leagues, playoff upsets are relatively common in the NHL.[6] According to NHL broadcaster Darren Eliot, this is because the style of competition in the playoffs is different from the regular season: instead of playing different teams every night, the goal is to advance through four best-of-seven playoff series.[7] The Presidents' Trophy winner may have to go through other playoff clubs who might have a hotter goaltender, a better defensive team, or other players that pose matchup problems. If the regular season champion's primary success was only outscoring others, they may be out of luck facing goaltenders that can shut them out.[7] And although rare, another aspect is that the NHL leads the other leagues in game seven comebacks. Only four instances has an NHL team been able to come back from being down 0ÿ3 to win a seven-game series: the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs, the 1975 New York Islanders, the 2010 Philadelphia Flyers, and the 2014 Los Angeles Kings. There has been only one such \\"reverse sweep\\" comeback in the MLB postseason (the 2004 Boston Red Sox) and none in the NBA playoffs.\\r\\nNHL broadcaster Darren Eliot explaining the lack of success of Presidents' Trophy winners winning the Stanley Cup.[7]\\r\\nDespite having more American-based teams than Canadian-based ones throughout much of the NHL's existence (dating back to the Original Six era when it was two Canadian clubs to four American ones, and now 7 to 24 since 2017), there have been only two times in league history where none of the Canadian teams qualified for the postseason: 1970 and 2016.[8] However, the 1993 Montreal Canadiens remain the last Canadian club to go all the way and win the Stanley Cup.[9]\\r\\nThe Stanley Cup playoffs MVP award, the Conn Smythe Trophy is based on the entire NHL postseason instead of just the championship game or series, unlike the playoff MVP awards presented in the other major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada (the Super Bowl MVP, the NBA Finals MVP, and the World Series MVP), although in its history the trophy has never been given to someone that was not in the finals. Doug Gilmour and Peter Forsberg, in 1986 and 1999, respectively, are the only players who have topped the postseason in scoring without making it to the Finals.\\r\\nNHL players have often grown beards when their team is in the playoffs, where they do not shave until their team is eliminated or wins the Stanley Cup. The tradition was started in the 1980s by the New York Islanders, and is often mirrored by the fans, as well.[10][11]\\r\\nAt the conclusion of a playoff series, players and coaches line up and exchange handshakes with their counterparts on the opposing team, and this has been described by commentators as \\"one of the great traditions in sports\\".[12] However, there have been rare occasions that individual players have refused to participate, such as Gerry Cheevers who left the ice without shaking hands with any of the Flyers in 1978,[13] and Billy Smith who avoided handshakes as he was particularly passionate about losses.[14] More recent examples of players refusing the handshake include the 1996 playoffs when several Detroit Red Wings players protested the dirty hit by the Colorado Avalanche's Claude Lemieux,[15] and in the 2008 playoffs when Martin Brodeur refused to shake Sean Avery's hand after Avery screened him in an earlier game.[14]\\r\\nIt is common among players to never touch or hoist the Prince of Wales Trophy (Eastern Conference champion) or Clarence S. Campbell Bowl (Western Conference champion) after they have won the conference finals; the players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus it should be the only trophy that they should be hoisting. There have been five recent exceptions to this ÿ Scott Stevens of the Devils in 2000 and 2003 and Sidney Crosby of the Penguins in 2009, 2016, and 2017. In four of these occurrences, their teams went on to win the Stanley Cup. In recent years, the captain of the winning team poses (usually looking solemn) with the conference trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well.[16]\\r\\nThere are many traditions and anecdotes associated with the championship trophy, the Stanley Cup.\\r\\nBecause the Ice Hockey World Championships are held in the same time period as the Stanley Cup playoffs, the only NHL players who can participate in the former are those on NHL teams that have been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention.[17] This policy has been in place since a 1977 agreement between the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation, which allowed Team Canada to field a team in the World Championships after an-eight year absence.[18][19]\\r\\nCorrect as of 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs\\r\\nPrior to 1927 the NHL playoff champion did not receive the Stanley Cup. In most years the winning team was awarded the O'Brien Trophy but from 1915 through 1926 the NHA/NHL champion would play the PCHA/WHL champion for the Stanley Cup.[22] The results outlined here are only those between NHL teams and do not include any Stanley Cup Finals series before 1927. For the first four years the NHL playoffs entailed the best team from the first half of the season playing a two games against the best team from the second half. The winner was the team that scored the most combined goals. There were no NHL playoffs in 1920 because Ottawa had the best record in both halves and was declared the NHL champion. Starting in 1921 the NHL scrapped the half-season scheme and had the teams with the top two records play for the league title. In 1926 the league introduced a two-game semifinal series for the second- and third-best teams to play for entry into the final against the regular season champion. The following year, with 10 teams in the league, the NHL expanded the playoffs to include six teams. The winners of the Canadian and American divisions would earn byes into the semifinal round while the remaining four would start in the quarterfinals.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nThe playoff format was altered slightly in 1929, having the two division winners play one another in the semifinal rather than the winners of the quarterfinal round. Because the NHL took charge of the NHL finals became a best-of series as the Stanley cup championship had been since 1914. A year later the Semifinal round became a best-of series with the division winners playing a five game set and the quarterfinal winners facing off in a best-of-three meeting. In 1931 the meeting between quarterfinal winners reverted to a two-game total-goal series and didn't change back for five years. The next year all series became best-of's and two years after, in 1939, the league ended the divisional format when the Montreal Maroons suspended operations, leaving the league with only 7 teams. Instead, the top two finishers played one another in a best-of-seven semifinal round while the other four playoff teams played best-of-three series to decide the second finalist. The same year the Stanley Cup finals shifted to a best-of-seven series where it has remained ever since (as of 2018).\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nWith only six teams in the league the quarterfinal round was ended and the top four finishers made the playoffs. All playoff series became best-of-sevens with the #1 and #3 teams playing in one semifinal while the #2 and #4 seeds met in the other. This arrangement remained unchanged the entire 25-year duration of the 'Original Six' era.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nWhen the league doubled its size in 1967 they also doubled the number of playoff teams, reintroducing the quarterfinals but keeping the 1-vs-3 style that existed for the previous quarter-century and keeping all series as best-of-sevens. In 1971 the league altered the semifinals to pit east teams against west teams and followed that by rearranging the first round to have the top seeds play the bottom seeds in intra-conference series. Once they league's size swelled to 18 teams an additional four teams received bids into the postseason. Starting in 1975 the division winners received byes into the second round while the remaining eight teams started in a best-of-three preliminary round with the top seed facing the lowest seed. After the opening round all teams were reseeded for the quarterfinals and semifinals regardless of their division or conference.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nWhen the WHA folded in 1979 four teams were absorbed into the NHL. With 21 teams the NHL expanded the playoffs once more to include 16 with all teams starting in the preliminary round which was increased to a best-of-five series. Teams were seeded regardless of their conference or division 1 through 16 and reseeded after the first two rounds. Starting in 1982 the NHL split the playoffs into eastern- and western-conference with each conference providing 8 teams where it has remained since (as of 2018). Furthermore the NHL had the first two round being played within each division, granting the four regions one entry each into the conference finals. The divisional semifinals were expanded to seven-game-series in 1987.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nThe NHL added nine franchises from 1991 to 2000 while an additional four moving to new cities (three of those teams were WHA alumni) Despite the increase in league size the NHL playoffs remained static at 16 teams. The league did, however, change the format by dropping the divisional rounds in 1994 with the division winners receiving the top two seeds and the rest being sorted according to their records.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nAfter the NHL lockout in 2004-05 that saw the cancellation of the first Stanley Cup final in 86 years The league went through another stable period where no new franchises were added. The playoffs as well were mostly consistent throughout the period. Only one change occurred; beginning with the 2014 playoffs the league returned to 4 divisions with the top three teams in each division making the playoffs and the two teams in each conference with the best record receiving 'wild card' spots. The better wild card team would play the lesser division champion for each conference and vice versa.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs\\r\\nThe NHL added Vegas as the first expansion team in 17 years for the 2017-18 season. Though no adjustment occurred as far as the playoffs were concerned, the league also approved an ownership group to make a bid for a 32nd team to be located in Seattle. If approved, the team would not begin play until the 2021-22 season.\\r\\nNumbers in table represent each team's appearance in the playoffs","input":"How many games in the stanley cup series?"},{"output":"The Gettysburg Address","context":"The Lincoln Memorial is an American national monument built to honor the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. It is located on the western end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., across from the Washington Monument. The architect was Henry Bacon; the designer of the primary statue ÿ Abraham Lincoln, 1920 ÿ was Daniel Chester French; the Lincoln statue was carved by the Piccirilli Brothers;[2] and the painter of the interior murals was Jules Guerin. Dedicated in 1922, it is one of several monuments built to honor an American president. It has always been a major tourist attraction and since the 1930s has been a symbolic center focused on race relations.\\r\\nThe building is in the form of a Greek Doric temple and contains a large seated sculpture of Abraham Lincoln and inscriptions of two well-known speeches by Lincoln, \\"The Gettysburg Address\\" and his Second Inaugural Address. The memorial has been the site of many famous speeches, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech, delivered on August 28, 1963, during the rally at the end of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\\r\\nLike other monuments on the National Mall ÿ including the nearby Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Korean War Veterans Memorial, and National World War II Memorial ÿ the memorial is administered by the National Park Service under its National Mall and Memorial Parks group. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since October 15, 1966. It is open to the public 24 hours a day. In 2007, it was ranked seventh on the List of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects. Since 2010, approximately 6 million people visit the memorial annually.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first public memorial to Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C., was a statue by Lot Flannery erected in front of the District of Columbia City Hall in 1868, three years after Lincoln's assassination.[4][5] Demands for a fitting national memorial had been voiced since the time of Lincoln's death. In 1867, Congress passed the first of many bills incorporating a commission to erect a monument for the sixteenth president. An American sculptor, Clark Mills, was chosen to design the monument. His plans reflected the nationalistic spirit of the time, and called for a 70-foot (21?m) structure adorned with six equestrian and 31 pedestrian statues of colossal proportions, crowned by a 12-foot (3.7?m) statue of Abraham Lincoln. Subscriptions for the project were insufficient.[6]\\r\\nThe matter lay dormant until the start of the 20th century, when, under the leadership of Senator Shelby M. Cullom of Illinois, six separate bills were introduced in Congress for the incorporation of a new memorial commission. The first five bills, proposed in the years 1901, 1902, and 1908, met with defeat because of opposition from Speaker Joe Cannon. The sixth bill (Senate Bill 9449), introduced on December 13, 1910, passed. The Lincoln Memorial Commission had its first meeting the following year and U.S. President William H. Taft was chosen as the commission's president. Progress continued at a steady pace and by 1913 Congress had approved of the Commission's choice of design and location.[6]\\r\\nThere were questions regarding the commission's plan. Many thought that architect Henry Bacon's Greek temple design was far too ostentatious for a man of Lincoln's humble character. Instead they proposed a simple log cabin shrine. The site too did not go unopposed. The recently reclaimed land in West Potomac Park was seen by many to be either too swampy or too inaccessible. Other sites, such as Union Station, were put forth. The Commission stood firm in its recommendation, feeling that the Potomac Park location, situated on the Washington Monument-Capitol axis, overlooking the Potomac River and surrounded by open land, was ideal. Furthermore, the Potomac Park site had already been designated in the McMillan Plan of 1901 to be the location of a future monument comparable to that of the Washington Monument.[6][7]\\r\\nWith Congressional approval and a $300,000 allocation, the project got underway. On February 12, 1914, a dedication ceremony was conducted and the following month the actual construction began. Work progressed steadily according to schedule. Some changes were made to the plan. The statue of Lincoln, originally designed to be 10 feet (3.0?m) tall, was enlarged to 19 feet (5.8?m) to prevent it from being overwhelmed by the huge chamber. As late as 1920, the decision was made to substitute an open portal for the bronze and glass grille which was to have guarded the entrance. Despite these changes, the Memorial was finished on schedule. Commission president William H. Taft ÿ who was then Chief Justice of the United States ÿ dedicated the Memorial on May 30, 1922 and presented it to President Warren G. Harding, who accepted it on behalf of the American people. Lincoln's only surviving son, 78-year-old Robert Todd Lincoln, was in attendance.[8]\\r\\nThe Memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.[9]\\r\\nThe exterior of the Memorial echoes a classic Greek temple and features Yule marble from Colorado. The structure measures 189.7 by 118.5 feet (57.8 by 36.1?m) and is 99 feet (30?m) tall. It is surrounded by a peristyle of 36 fluted Doric columns, one for each of the 36 states in the Union at the time of Lincoln's death, and two columns in-antis at the entrance behind the colonnade. The columns stand 44 feet (13?m) tall with a base diameter of 7.5 feet (2.3?m). Each column is built from 12 drums including the capital. The columns, like the exterior walls and facades, are inclined slightly toward the building's interior. This is to compensate for perspective distortions which would otherwise make the memorial appear to bulge out at the top when compared with the bottom, a common feature of Ancient Greek architecture.[10]\\r\\nAbove the colonnade, inscribed on the frieze, are the names of the 36 states in the Union at the time of Lincoln's death and the dates in which they entered the Union.[Note 1] Their names are separated by double wreath medallions in bas-relief. The cornice is composed of a carved scroll regularly interspersed with projecting lions' heads and ornamented with palmetto cresting along the upper edge. Above this on the attic frieze are inscribed the names of the 48 states present at the time of the Memorial's dedication. A bit higher is a garland joined by ribbons and palm leaves, supported by the wings of eagles. All ornamentation on the friezes and cornices was done by Ernest C. Bairstow.[10]\\r\\nThe Memorial is anchored in a concrete foundation, 44 to 66 feet (13 to 20?m) in depth, constructed by M. F. Comer and Company and the National Foundation and Engineering Company, and is encompassed by a 187-by-257-foot (57 by 78?m) rectangular granite retaining wall measuring 14 feet (4.3?m) in height.[10]\\r\\nLeading up to the shrine on the east side are the main steps. Beginning at the edge of the Reflecting Pool, the steps rise to the Lincoln Memorial Circle roadway surrounding the edifice, then to the main portal, intermittently spaced with a series of platforms. Flanking the steps as they approach the entrance are two buttresses each crowned with an 11-foot (3.4?m) tall tripod carved from pink Tennessee marble[10] by the Piccirilli Brothers.[11]\\r\\nThe Memorial's interior is divided into three chambers by two rows of four Ionic columns, each 50 feet (15?m) tall and 5.5 feet (1.7?m) across at their base. The central chamber, housing the statue of Lincoln, is 60 feet wide, 74 feet deep, and 60 feet high.[12] The north and south chambers display carved inscriptions of Lincoln's second inaugural address and his Gettysburg Address.[Note 2] Bordering these inscriptions are pilasters ornamented with fasces, eagles, and wreaths. The inscriptions and adjoining ornamentation are by Evelyn Beatrice Longman.[10]\\r\\nThe Memorial is replete with symbolic elements. The 36 columns represent the states of the Union at the time of Lincoln's death; the 48 stone festoons above the columns represent the 48 states in 1922. Inside, each inscription is surmounted by a 60-by-12-foot (18.3 by 3.7?m) mural by Jules Guerin portraying principles seen as evident in Lincoln's life: Freedom, Liberty, Immortality, Justice, and the Law on the south wall; Unity, Fraternity, and Charity on the north. Cypress trees, representing Eternity, are in the murals' backgrounds. The murals' paint incorporated kerosene and wax to protect the exposed artwork from fluctuations in temperature and moisture.[13]\\r\\nThe ceiling consists of bronze girders ornamented with laurel and oak leaves. Between these are panels of Alabama marble, saturated with paraffin to increase translucency. But feeling that the statue required even more light, Bacon and French designed metal slats for the ceiling to conceal floodlights, which could be modulated to supplement the natural light; this modification was installed in 1929. The one major alteration since was the addition of a handicapped elevator in the 1970s.[13]\\r\\nIN THIS TEMPLE\\r\\nAS IN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE\\r\\nFOR WHOM HE SAVED THE UNION\\r\\nTHE MEMORY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN\\r\\nIS ENSHRINED FOREVER\\r\\nLying between the north and south chambers is the central hall containing the solitary figure of Lincoln sitting in contemplation. The statue was carved by the Piccirilli Brothers under the supervision of the sculptor, Daniel Chester French, and took four years to complete. The statue, originally intended to be only 10 feet (3.0?m) tall, was, on further consideration, enlarged so that it finally stood 19 feet (5.8?m) tall from head to foot, the scale being such that if Lincoln were standing, he would be 28 feet (8.5?m) tall. The widest span of the statue corresponds to its height. Of Georgia white marble, it weighs 175 short tons (159?t) and was shipped in twenty-eight pieces.[13]\\r\\nThe statue rests upon an oblong pedestal of Tennessee marble 10 feet (3.0?m) high, 16 feet (4.9?m) wide, and 17 feet (5.2?m) deep. Directly beneath this lies a platform of Tennessee marble about 34.5 feet (10.5?m) long, 28 feet (8.5?m) wide, and 6.5 inches (0.17?m) high. Lincoln's arms rest on representations of Roman fasces, a subtle touch that associates the statue with the Augustan (and imperial) theme (obelisk and funerary monuments) of the Washington Mall.[14] The statue is discretely bordered by two pilasters, one on each side. Between these pilasters, and above Lincoln's head, is engraved an epitaph of Lincoln[13] by Royal Cortissoz.[15]\\r\\nThe sculpture has been at the center of two urban legends. Some have claimed that the face of General Robert E. Lee was carved onto the back of Lincoln's head,[16] and looks back across the Potomac toward his former home, Arlington House, now within the bounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Another popular legend is that Lincoln is shown using sign language to represent his initials, with his left hand shaped to form an \\"A\\" and his right hand to form an \\"L\\", the president's initials. The National Park Service denies both legends.[16]\\r\\nHowever, historian Gerald Prokopowicz writes that, while it is not clear that sculptor Daniel Chester French intended Lincoln's hands to be formed into sign language versions of his initials, it is possible that French did intend it, because he was familiar with American Sign Language, and he would have had a reason to do so, that is, to pay tribute to Lincoln for having signed the federal legislation giving Gallaudet University, a university for the deaf, the authority to grant college degrees.[17] The National Geographic Society's publication, \\"Pinpointing the Past in Washington, D.C.\\" states that Daniel Chester French had a son who was deaf and that the sculptor was familiar with sign language.[18][19] Historian James A. Percoco has observed that, although there are no extant documents showing that French had Lincoln's hands carved to represent the letters \\"A\\" and \\"L\\" in American Sign Language, \\"I think you can conclude that it's reasonable to have that kind of summation about the hands.\\"[20]\\r\\nAs Sandage (1993) demonstrates, the Memorial has become a symbolically sacred venue especially for the Civil Rights Movement. In 1939, the Daughters of the American Revolution refused to allow the African-American contralto Marian Anderson to perform before an integrated audience at the organization's Constitution Hall. At the suggestion of Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harold L. Ickes, the Secretary of the Interior, arranged for a performance on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Easter Sunday of that year, to a live audience of 70,000, and a nationwide radio audience.\\r\\nOn August 28, 1963, the memorial grounds were the site of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which proved to be a high point of the American Civil Rights Movement. It is estimated that approximately 250,000 people came to the event, where they heard Martin Luther King Jr., deliver his historic I Have a Dream speech before the memorial honoring the president who had issued the Emancipation Proclamation 100 years earlier. King's speech, with its language of patriotism and its evocation of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, was meant to match the symbolism of the Lincoln Memorial as a monument to national unity.[21] The D.C. police also appreciated the location because it was surrounded on three sides by water, so that any incident could be easily contained.[22] Twenty years later, on August 28, 1983, crowds gathered again to mark the 20th Anniversary Mobilization for Jobs, Peace and Freedom, to reflect on progress in gaining civil rights for African Americans and to commit to correcting continuing injustices. The \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech is such a part of the Lincoln Memorial story, that the spot on which King stood, on the landing eighteen steps below Lincoln's statue, was engraved in 2003 in recognition of the 40th anniversary of the event.\\r\\nAt the memorial on May 9, 1970, President Richard Nixon had a middle-of-the-night impromptu, brief meeting with protesters who, just days after the Kent State shootings, were preparing to march against the Vietnam War.\\r\\nIn September 1962, vandals painted the words \\"nigger lover\\" in foot-high pink letters on the rear wall.[23]\\r\\nOn the morning of July 26, 2013, the memorial was shut down after the statue's base and legs were splashed with green paint.[24] It reopened later that day.[25] A 58-year-old Chinese national, Jiamei Tian, was later found responsible for the vandalism. Following her arrest at the Washington National Cathedral, she was admitted to St. Elizabeths Hospital, a psychiatric facility, and was later found to be incompetent to stand trial; she has since been released from the hospital.[26]\\r\\nOn February 27, 2017, graffiti written in permanent marker was found at the memorial, the Washington Monument, the District of Columbia War Memorial, and the National World War II Memorial, saying \\"Jackie shot JFK\\", \\"blood test is a lie\\", as well as other claims. Street signs and utility boxes were also defaced. Authorities believed that a single person was responsible for all the vandalism.[27]\\r\\nOn August 15, 2017, graffiti that Reuters reported \\"appeared to read 'fuck law'\\" was spray painted in red on one of the columns. The initials \\"M+E\\" were etched on the same pillar. A \\"mild, gel-type architectural paint stripper\\" was used to remove the paint without damaging the memorial. However, the etching was deemed \\"permanent damage.\\" A Smithsonian Institution directional sign several blocks away was also defaced.[28][29]\\r\\nOn September 18, 2017, Nurtilek Bakirov from Kyrgyzstan was arrested when a police officer saw him vandalizing the Memorial at around 1:00 PM EDT. Bakirov used a penny to carve the letters \\"HYPT MAEK\\" in what appeared to Cyrillic letters into the fifth pillar on the north side. As of 20 September 2017[update], police do not know what the words mean, although there is a possibility that they contain a reference to the vandal's name. Court documents indicate that the letters can not be completely removed, but could be polished at the cost of approximately $2,000. A conservator for the National Park Service said that the stone would weather over time, helping to obscure the letters, although she characterized it as \\"permanent damage\\".[30]\\r\\nAs one of the most prominent American monuments, the Lincoln Memorial is often featured in books, films, and television shows that take place in Washington; by 2003 it had appeared in over 60 films,[31] and in 2009, Mark S. Reinhart compiled some short sketches of dozens of uses of the Memorial in film and television.[32]\\r\\nSome examples of films include Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, in a key scene where the statue and its inscription provide inspiration to freshman Senator Jefferson Smith, played by James Stewart[33] ÿ the Park Service did not want director Frank Capra to film at the Memorial, so he sent a large crew elsewhere as a distraction while a smaller crew filmed Stewart and Jean Arthur at the Memorial;[34] The Day the Earth Stood Still, a science fiction film in which the alien Klaatu visits the Memorial and is impressed by Lincoln's words carved there; the 2001 version of Planet of the Apes; X-Men: First Class; the 2011 film Transformers: Dark of the Moon, where Megatron destroys the statue of Lincoln and then sits on the chair as a throne;[35] and the 2016 horror movie The Purge: Election Year, in which the Lincoln Memorial is shown with dead and burning bodies on the steps and the columns defaced with giant letters that spell out \\"PURGE\\", written in human blood.[36]\\r\\nOther films and television programs which have featured the Memorial include In the Line of Fire; National Treasure, in which the main characters discuss the possibility of stealing the Declaration of Independence while sitting on the steps of the Memorial; the comedy Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, where the statue of Lincoln helps defeat the Horus warriors; the \\"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\\" episode of The Simpsons;[37] the scene from Forrest Gump, in which Forrest (Tom Hanks) delivers a speech standing on a podium in front of the Memorial facing the reflecting pool; and the 2013 film White House Down, in which the President (Jamie Foxx) requests a fly-by of the Lincoln Memorial, at both the beginning and the end of the movie to pay homage to his hero.[33]\\r\\nMany of the appearances of the Lincoln Memorial are actually digital visual effects, due to restrictive filming rules.[37] As of 2017, according to the National Park Service, \\"Filming/photography is prohibited above the white marble steps and the interior chamber of the Lincoln Memorial.\\"[38]\\r\\nMitchell Newton-Matza argued in 2016, \\"Reflecting its cherished place in the hearts of Americans, the Lincoln Memorial has often been featured prominently in popular culture, especially motion pictures.\\"[39] According to Tracey Gold Bennett, \\"The majesty of the Lincoln Memorial is a big draw for film location scouts, producers, and directors because this landmark has appeared in a considerable number of films.\\"[40]\\r\\nJay Sacher writes:\\r\\nFrom high to low, the memorial is cultural shorthand for both American ideals and 1960s radicalism. From Forrest Gump's Zelig-like insertion into anti-war rallies on the steps of the memorial, to the villainous Decepticon robots discarding the Lincoln statue and claiming it as a throne....The memorial's place in the culture is assured even as it is parodied.[37]\\r\\nFrom 1959 (the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's birth) to 2008, the memorial, with statue visible through the columns, was depicted on the reverse of the United States one-cent coin, which since 1909 has depicted a bust of Lincoln on its front.\\r\\nThe memorial has appeared on the back of the U.S. five-dollar bill since 1929. The front of the bill bears Lincoln's portrait.\\r\\nInformational notes\\r\\nCitations\\r\\nBibliography","input":"What are the inscriptions on the lincoln memorial?"},{"output":"Earl Warren","context":"Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court. In a 5ÿ4 majority, the Court held that both inculpatory and exculpatory statements made in response to interrogation by a defendant in police custody will be admissible at trial only if the prosecution can show that the defendant was informed of the right to consult with an attorney before and during questioning and of the right against self-incrimination before police questioning, and that the defendant not only understood these rights, but voluntarily waived them.\\r\\nThis case has a significant impact on law enforcement in the United States, by making what became known as the Miranda rights part of routine police procedure to ensure that suspects were informed of their rights. The Supreme Court decided Miranda with three other consolidated cases: Westover v. United States, Vignera v. New York, and California v. Stewart.\\r\\nThe Miranda warning (often shortened to \\"Miranda\\", or \\"Mirandizing\\" a suspect) is the name of the formal warning that is required to be given by police in the United States to criminal suspects in police custody (or in a custodial situation) before they are interrogated, in accordance with the Miranda ruling. Its purpose is to ensure the accused are aware of, and reminded of, these rights before questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\\r\\nPer the U.S. Supreme Court decision Berghuis v. Thompkins (June 1, 2010), criminal suspects who are aware of their right to silence and to an attorney, but choose not to \\"unambiguously\\" invoke them, may find any subsequent voluntary statements treated as an implied waiver of their rights, and used as or as part of evidence. At least one scholar has argued that Thompkins effectively gutted Miranda.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1960s, a movement which provided defendants with legal aid emerged from the collective efforts of various bar associations.\\r\\nIn the civil realm, it led to the creation of the Legal Services Corporation under the Great Society program of President Lyndon Baines Johnson. Escobedo v. Illinois, a case which closely foreshadowed Miranda, provided for the presence of counsel during police interrogation. This concept extended to a concern over police interrogation practices, which were considered by many[who?] to be barbaric and unjust. Coercive interrogation tactics were known in period slang as the \\"third degree\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nOn March 13, 1963, Ernesto Miranda was arrested, by the Phoenix Police Department, based on circumstantial evidence linking him to the kidnapping and rape of an eighteen-year-old woman ten days earlier.[2] After two hours of interrogation by police officers, Miranda signed a confession to the rape charge on forms that included the typed statement: \\"I do hereby swear that I make this statement voluntarily and of my own free will, with no threats, coercion, or promises of immunity, and with full knowledge of my legal rights, understanding any statement I make may be used against me.\\"[3]\\r\\nHowever, at no time was Miranda told of his right to counsel. Before being presented with the form on which he was asked to write out the confession he had already given orally, he was not advised of his right to remain silent, nor was he informed that his statements during the interrogation would be used against him. At trial, when prosecutors offered Miranda's written confession as evidence, his court-appointed lawyer, Alvin Moore, objected that because of these facts, the confession was not truly voluntary and should be excluded. Moore's objection was overruled and based on this confession and other evidence, Miranda was convicted of rape and kidnapping. He was sentenced to 20ÿ30 years of imprisonment on each charge, with sentences to run concurrently. Moore filed Miranda's appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court, claiming that Miranda's confession was not fully voluntary and should not have been admitted into the court proceedings. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision to admit the confession in State v. Miranda, 401 P.2d 721 (Ariz. 1965). In affirmation, the Arizona Supreme emphasized heavily the fact that Miranda did not specifically request an attorney.[4]\\r\\nAttorney John Paul Frank, former law clerk to Justice Hugo Black, represented Miranda in his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.[5]\\r\\nChief Justice Earl Warren, a former prosecutor, delivered the opinion of the Court[6], ruling that due to the coercive nature of the custodial interrogation by police (Warren cited several police training manuals which had not been provided in the arguments), no confession could be admissible under the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination clause and Sixth Amendment right to an attorney unless a suspect had been made aware of his rights and the suspect had then waived them:\\r\\nThe person in custody must, prior to interrogation, be clearly informed that he has the right to remain silent, and that anything he says will be used against him in court; he must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation, and that, if he is indigent, a lawyer will be appointed to represent him.[7]\\r\\nThus, Miranda's conviction was overturned. The Court also made clear what had to happen if the suspect chose to exercise his or her rights:\\r\\nIf the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease... If the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present. At that time, the individual must have an opportunity to confer with the attorney and to have him present during any subsequent questioning.\\r\\nWarren pointed to the existing practice of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the rules of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, both of which required notifying a suspect of his right to remain silent; the FBI warning included notice of the right to counsel.\\r\\nHowever, the dissenting justices accused the majority of overreacting to the problem of coercive interrogations, and anticipated a drastic effect. They believed that, once warned, suspects would always demand attorneys, and deny the police the ability to gain confessions.\\r\\nIn a separate concurrence in part, dissent in part, Justice Tom C. Clark argued that the Warren Court went \\"too far too fast\\". Instead, Justice Clark would use the \\"totality of the circumstances\\" test enunciated by Justice Goldberg in Haynes v. Washington. Under this test, the court would:\\r\\nconsider in each case whether the police officer prior to custodial interrogation added the warning that the suspect might have counsel present at the interrogation and, further, that a court would appoint one at his request if he was too poor to employ counsel. In the absence of warnings, the burden would be on the State to prove that counsel was knowingly and intelligently waived or that in the totality of the circumstances, including the failure to give the necessary warnings, the confession was clearly voluntary.\\r\\nIn dissent, Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote that \\"nothing in the letter or the spirit of the Constitution or in the precedents squares with the heavy-handed and one-sided action that is so precipitously taken by the Court in the name of fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities\\". Harlan closed his remarks by quoting former Justice Robert H. Jackson: \\"This Court is forever adding new stories to the temples of constitutional law, and the temples have a way of collapsing when one story too many is added.\\"\\r\\nJustice Byron White took issue with the court announcing a new constitutional right when it had no \\"factual and textual bases\\" in the Constitution or previous opinions of the Court for the rule announced in the opinion. He stated: \\"The proposition that the privilege against self-incrimination forbids in-custody interrogation without the warnings specified in the majority opinion and without a clear waiver of counsel has no significant support in the history of the privilege or in the language of the Fifth Amendment.\\" Nor did Justice White believe it had any basis in English common law.\\r\\nWhite further warned of the dire consequences of the majority opinion:\\r\\nI have no desire whatsoever to share the responsibility for any such impact on the present criminal process.\\r\\nIn some unknown number of cases, the Court's rule will return a killer, a rapist or other criminal to the streets and to the environment which produced him, to repeat his crime whenever it pleases him. As a consequence, there will not be a gain, but a loss, in human dignity.\\r\\nMiranda was retried in 1967 after the original case against him was thrown out. This time the prosecution, instead of using the confession, introduced other evidence and called witnesses. One witness was Twila Hoffman, a woman with whom Miranda was living at the time of the offense; she testified that he had told her of committing the crime.[8][9] Miranda was convicted in 1967 and sentenced to serve 20 to 30 years.[9] The Supreme Court of Arizona affirmed,[10] and the United States Supreme Court denied review.[11] Miranda was paroled in 1972. After his release, he returned to his old neighborhood and made a modest living autographing police officers' \\"Miranda cards\\" which contained the text of the warning, for reading to arrestees. He was stabbed to death during an argument in a bar on January 31, 1976.[12] A suspect was arrested, but he, unlike Miranda, exercised his right to remain silent. With no evidence against him, he was released.[13]\\r\\nAnother three defendants whose cases had been tied in with Miranda's ÿ an armed robber, a stick-up man, and a bank robber ÿ either made plea bargains to lesser charges or were found guilty again despite the exclusion of their confessions.[14]\\r\\nAfter the Miranda decision, the nation's police departments were required to inform arrested persons or suspects of their rights under the ruling. Such information is called a Miranda warning.\\r\\nSince it is usually required that the suspects be asked if they understand their rights, courts have also ruled that any subsequent waiver of Miranda rights must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Many American police departments have pre-printed Miranda waiver forms which a suspect must sign and date (after hearing and reading the warnings again) if an interrogation is to occur.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Miranda decision was widely criticized when it came down, as many felt it was unfair to inform suspected criminals of their rights, as outlined in the decision. Richard Nixon and other conservatives denounced Miranda for undermining the efficiency of the police, and argued the ruling would contribute to an increase in crime. Nixon, upon becoming President, promised to appoint judges who would be \\"strict constructionists\\" and who would exercise judicial restraint. Many supporters of law enforcement were angered by the decision's negative view of police officers.[citation needed]\\r\\nData from the FBI Uniform Crime Reports shows a sharp reduction in the clearance rate of violent and property crimes after Miranda.[15] However, according to other studies from the 1960s and 1970s, \\"contrary to popular belief, Miranda had little, if any, effect on detectives ability to solve crimes.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe federal Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 purported to overrule Miranda for federal criminal cases and restore the \\"totality of the circumstances\\" test that had prevailed previous to Miranda.[16] The validity of this provision of the law, which is still codified at 18 U.S.C. ?3501, was not ruled on for another 30 years because the Justice Department never attempted to rely on it to support the introduction of a confession into evidence at any criminal trial.[citation needed]\\r\\nMiranda was undermined by several subsequent decisions which seemed to grant exceptions to the \\"Miranda warnings\\", challenging its claim to be a necessary corollary of the Fifth Amendment. The exceptions and developments that occurred over the years included:\\r\\nUnited States v. Garibay (1998) pointed out an important matter in regards to expansion of Miranda. Garibay barely spoke English and clearly showed a lack of understanding; indeed, \\"the agent admitted that he had to rephrase questions when the defendant appeared confused.\\"[18] The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled a \\"clear error\\" when the district court found that Garibay had \\"knowingly and intelligently waived his Miranda rights\\" due to the defendants low I.Q. and poor English language skills.[19] The court investigated many facets of his waiver and discovered that Mr. Garibay was missing all items that they were looking for: he never signed a waiver, he only received his warnings verbally and in English, and no interpreter was provided although they were available. With an opinion that stressed \\"the requirement that a defendant 'knowingly and intelligently' waive his Miranda rights\\", the Court reversed Garibay's conviction and remanded his case.[19]\\r\\nMiranda survived a strong challenge in Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428 (2000), where the validity of Congress's overruling of Miranda through ?3501 was tested. At issue was whether the Miranda warnings were actually compelled by the Constitution, or were rather merely measures enacted as a matter of judicial policy.[citation needed] In Dickerson, the Court, speaking through Chief Justice Rehnquist, upheld Miranda 7ÿ2 and stated that \\"the warnings have become part of our national culture\\". In dissent, Justice Scalia argued Miranda warnings were not constitutionally required. He cited several cases demonstrating a majority of the then-current court, counting himself, and Justices Kennedy, O'Connor, and Thomas, as well as the Chief Justice (who had just delivered a contrary opinion), \\"[were] on record as believing that a violation of Miranda is not a violation of the Constitution\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nOver time, interrogators began to think of techniques to honor the \\"letter\\" but not the \\"spirit\\" of Miranda. In the case of Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600 (2004), the Supreme Court halted one of the more controversial practices. Missouri police were deliberately withholding Miranda warnings and questioning suspects until they obtained confessions, then giving the warnings, getting waivers, and getting confessions again. Justice Souter wrote for the plurality: \\"Strategists dedicated to draining the substance out of Miranda cannot accomplish by training instructions what Dickerson held Congress could not do by statute.\\"[20]\\r\\nBerghuis v. Thompkins (2010) is a ruling where the Supreme Court held that a suspect's \\"ambiguous or equivocal\\" statement or no statements do not mean that police must end an interrogation.[21] At least one scholar has argued that Thompkins effectively gutted Miranda. In The Right to Remain Silent, Charles Weisselberg wrote that \\"the majority in Thompkins rejected the fundamental underpinnings of Miranda v. Arizonas prophylactic rule and established a new one that fails to protect the rights of suspects\\" and that\\r\\nBut in Thompkins, neither Michigan nor the Solicitor General were able to cite any decision in which a court found that a suspect had given an implied waiver after lengthy questioning. Thompkins persevered for almost three hours before succumbing to his interrogators. In finding a waiver on these facts, Thompkins gives us an implied waiver doctrine on steroids.[1]","input":"Who was involved in the miranda v arizona case?"},{"output":"young adult post-apocalyptic dystopian science fiction","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Maze Runner is a 2009 young adult post-apocalyptic dystopian science fiction novel written by American author James Dashner and the first book released in The Maze Runner series, although it is the third in narrative order.[2][3] The novel was published 7?October 2009 by Delacorte Press, an imprint of Random House, and was made into a 2014 major motion picture by 20th Century Fox.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas wakes up in a metal elevator that brings him to a place called the Glade. He has no memory of who he is or how he got there. He gradually discovers that the Glade is run by two boys: Alby, the leader, and Newt, the second-in-charge, who both maintain order by enforcing simple but effective rules. The elevator box surfaces from under the ground every week supplying new food, tools, medicine, and sometimes weapons. Every month a new boy with no memory of anything but his first name finds himself in that elevator box. The Glade is surrounded by a square of 4?mile-high walls made of concrete. Outside the walls is the Maze, a labyrinth of high concrete walls covered in ivy that changes every day. The Maze houses strange, lethal creatures known as Grievers. Grievers are described as amorphous monsters of metal and flesh. The Gladers are trying to stay alive as well as \\"solve\\" the Maze by running through it as fast as they can while tracking movements of the walls and trying to find an exit to escape.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day after Thomas' arrival, a girl named Teresa is delivered through the elevator into the Glade with a note saying \\"She's the last one. Ever.\\" It implies that there will be no more children sent into the Glade. The girl subsequently lapses into a coma. When Thomas comes to visit her, he recognizes her, but can't remember her name until he hears her voice telepathically in his mind telling him her name. Teresa wakes up and tells Thomas that they knew each other before they were sent into the Glade, and reveals that they could communicate telepathically.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer arrival triggers a series of changes to life in the Glade: People start acting strangely, the sun disappears, the weekly deliveries of supplies stop coming, and the doors of the Maze stay open at night, which allows the Grievers to enter the Glade and hunt the children. Thomas and Minho are the first people in the Glade to survive the night in the maze.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas proposes that the walls of the Maze aren't random, but that their movements are actually a code, leading to the discovery that the Maze is spelling out words. Thomas also discovers that the cliff that they all thought was just a cliff turns out to be where the Grievers leave the Maze or \\"The Griever Hole\\" as he and Minho call it. If they can come and go over the edge of the Cliff, then maybe so can the Gladers. This drives Thomas to think they need memories to get out, so he intentionally gets stung by a Griever so he can go through the Changing ÿ the process that people go through after getting the Grief Serum, a syringe of medicine that arrives in the Box along with the other supplies and is administered to people who have been stung by Grievers. The Changing can trigger memories and most often does.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas and the Gladers find out what the pattern is, which causes most of the Gladers to decide to make a run for the exit, knowing that it could be suicidal trying to take on the Grievers, but figuring that nothing could be worse than being stuck in the Glade waiting to be hunted by the Grievers. They succeed, only to find out that they were test subjects in an experiment conducted by an organization called World In Catastrophe: Killzone Experiment Department (WICKED). Gally, one of the Gladers who always knew something was different about Thomas and hated him for it, appears at the laboratory to which the teenagers escape. He hadn't originally escaped with them, and he is acting as though he is being controlled. He moves to throw a knife at Thomas, but Chuck, the youngest Glader and Thomas' friend, jumps in front of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter briefly mourning the death of Chuck, all 20 Gladers are rescued by a group of people and brought to a safe haven while being told about catastrophic solar flares that caused an apocalyptic event, followed by a virus called the Flare that killed millions.

His publisher wanted him to write another book, but he decided he would try for a national book market instead.

It would be an experiment, to study their minds. Terrible things would be done to them ÿ awful things; completely hopeless ÿ until the victims turn everything on its head.\\" The book was later published in 2009.[4] Dashner wrote the book from December 2005 to March?2006.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nKirkus Reviews wrote: \\"Hard to put down, this is clearly just a first installment, and it will leave readers dying to find out what comes next.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nJessica Harrison of the Deseret Morning News labeled The Maze Runner as \\"a thrilling adventurous book for kids ages?13+ that will get readers' hearts pumping and leave them asking for more.\\" She noted that it \\"starts out a bit slow\\" but as it matched Thomas's confusion and picked up pace as he became more accustomed, she wrote that \\"it's almost as if Dashner is easing the reader into what becomes a fast-paced, nonstop action.\\" However, she thought the \\"only drawback\\" was the \\"fictionalized slang\\", saying, \\"While it feels realistic and fits with his characters, it gets old pretty fast.

From 1961 to 1994, the head of state was called the State President.\\r\\nThe President is elected by the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, and is usually the leader of the largest party, which has been the African National Congress since the first non-racial elections were held on 27 April 1994. The role was founded to be distinct from the now defunct role of prime minister, but the two roles were merged in the 1983 constitution which specified a four-year term of office. The Constitution limits the president's time in office to two five-year terms.[2] The first president to be elected under the new constitution was Nelson Mandela, and the incumbent president is Jacob Zuma.\\r\\nUnder the interim constitution (valid from 1994 to 1996), there was a Government of National Unity, in which a Member of Parliament (MP) from the largest opposition party was entitled to a position as Deputy President. Along with Thabo Mbeki, the last State President, F. W. de Klerk also served as Deputy President, in his capacity as the leader of the National Party which was the second-largest party in the new Parliament. But De Klerk later resigned and went into opposition with his party. A voluntary coalition government continues to exist under the new constitution (adopted in 1996), although there have been no appointments of opposition politicians to the post of Deputy President.\\r\\nThe President is required to be a member of the National Assembly at the time of his election. Upon his election, he immediately resigns his seat for the duration of his term. The President may be removed either by a motion of no-confidence or an impeachment trial.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe office of the President, and the roles that come with it, were established by Chapter Five of the Constitution of South Africa which was formed by a Constituent Assembly upon the dissolution of apartheid as state policy.[2]\\r\\nA number of manifestations of the office have existed. Aspects of these offices exist within the presidency today. The executive leadership of the British colonies of Natal and of the Cape of Good Hope were invested in their Governors, likewise was invested in the Presidents of the Boer republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. Alternating sovereignty as a result of wars culminated in the Vereeniging Treaty signed in which concluded the South African War.\\r\\nThe Union of South Africa, a British Dominion, was established on 31 May 1910[3] and the head of state was invested in the apolitical and ceremonial Monarch of the United Kingdom (who was represented by a viceroy, the Governor-General).\\r\\nUpon the declaration of South Africa as a republic on 31 May 1961, the office of State President was created.[4] It was originally a ceremonial post, but became an executive post in 1984 when a new constitution abolished the post of Prime Minister and transferred its powers to the State President.\\r\\nSouth Africa has an almost unique system for the election of its president. Unlike other former British colonies and dominions who have adopted a parliamentary republican form of government and those that follow the Westminster system, South Africa's President is both head of state and head of government and Commander-in-Chief of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). Contrary to presidential systems around the world, the President of South Africa is elected by the Parliament of South Africa[5] rather than by the people directly. He is thus answerable to it in theory and able to influence legislation in practice as head of the majority party (presently the ANC).\\r\\nThe president is elected at the first sitting of parliament after an election, and whenever a vacancy arises. The president is elected by the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, from among its members. The chief justice must oversee the election. Once elected, a person is no longer a member of the national assembly. They must then be sworn in as president within five days of the election. Should a vacancy arise, the date of a new election must be set by the chief justice, but not more than 30 days after the vacancy occurs.[6]\\r\\nThe Constitution has thus prescribed a system combining both parliamentary and presidential systems in a unique manner. Only Botswana and a few other countries use a similar system. Between 1996 and 2003 Israel combined the two systems in an opposite way, with an elected prime minister.[7]\\r\\nAlthough the presidency is the key institution, it is hedged about with numerous checks and balances that prevent its total dominance over the government, as was the case in many African countries. The presidential term is five years, with a limit of two terms. Thus the electoral system attempts (at least on paper) to prevent the accumulation of power in the president as was during Apartheid or in many other African countries.[8]\\r\\nThe President-elect will, before formally assuming office, make and subscribe an oath or solemn affirmation in the terms st out in Schedule 3 before the Chief Justice or a Judge of the Supreme Court.\\r\\nThe President elected in terms of section 77 (1) (a) is subjected to sections 87 and 93 (2), hold office-\\r\\n(a) for the period terminating on a date five years as from the date of the date of the first sitting of the National Assembly under the Constitution; or\\r\\n(b) if the Parliament is dissolved during such period, for the period until a President has been elected in terms of section 77 (1) (b) after such dissolution and has assumed office.\\r\\n(1) The President is responsible for the observance of the provision of the Constitution as the supreme law of the land\\r\\n(2) The president provides with dignity the executive leadership in the interest of national unity in accordance with the Constitution and the law of the country.\\r\\n(3) The president cannot hold any other public office and cannot perform remunerative work outside the duties of the president's office.\\r\\nAccording to chapter five of the constitution, the president can only exercise the powers of his or her office while within the Republic of South Africa. Should the president be outside of the country, or unable to fulfil the duties of the office, they may appoint an acting president.\\r\\nThe presidential vacancy should be filled first by the deputy president, then cabinet minister selected by the president, then a cabinet minister selected by the cabinet, and finally by the Speaker of the National Assembly.[9]\\r\\nThe President is the head of state, head of government and commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the Republic of South Africa. The rights, responsibilities and remuneration of the President are enumerated in Chapter V of the Constitution of South Africa and subsequent amendments and laws passed by the Parliament of South Africa.\\r\\nThe executive power of the Republic is invested in the president. He appoints various officials to positions listed in the Constitution however the most significant are the ministers and justices of the Supreme Court of Appeal and the Constitutional Court. Through the Cabinet, the president implements and enforces the constitution and laws and enforces his or her political objectives. Judges are appointed on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission.\\r\\nThe president plays a role in the formation of legislation. He or she signs bills into laws and can do the opposite, veto them (although subject to an override), refers bills back to Parliament or to the Constitutional Court or can call for a referendum. The president summons parliament, often delivering his or her objectives and agenda in a State of the Nation Address at the beginning of each session.\\r\\nThe president is the commander-in-chief of the South African National Defence Force thereby possessing influence or control over foreign and security policy. He or she is accorded the constitutional powers to declare war and make peace, negotiate and sign (although not ratify) treaties (and the alliances that may come with them), and receives and appoints diplomatic officials, confers honours and grants pardons.[10]\\r\\n(1) The president performs the following powers and functions:\\r\\n(a) Sign bills duly passes by parliament.\\r\\n(b) Convey meetings with Cabinet\\r\\n(c) Refer disputes of a constitutional nature between parties represented in Parliament or between organs of state at any level of government to the Constitutional Court.\\r\\n(d) Confer honours.\\r\\n(e) Appoint, accredit, receive and recognise ambassadors, diplomatic representatives and other diplomatic officials.\\r\\n(f) Appoint commissions of inquiry.\\r\\n(g) Negotiate and sign international agreements\\r\\n(2) The president shall consult the Executive Deputy President.\\r\\n(a) In development and execution of the policies of the international government.\\r\\n(b) All matters relating to the management of the Cabinet and performance of Cabinet business.\\r\\n(c) Assign and allocation of functions contemplated in section 84 (5) to an Executive Deputy President.\\r\\n(3) The President exercises and performs all powers and functions assigned to him by the Constitution or any other law, except those specified in subsections (1) and (2) or where otherwise expressly or by implication provided in this Constitution in consultation with the cabinet.

Opened in 1919, it was the oldest operating GM plant when it was largely idled in December 2008, and ceased all remaining production on April 23, 2009.\\r\\nThe plant covers 4,800,000?square feet (446,000?m3).[1] It employed around 7,000 workers at its peak in 1970, but was down to about 1,200 when it ceased production of GM vehicles in December 2008.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1918, the Samson Tractor division of General Motors was formed from the merger of Samson Tractor of California and the Janesville Machine Company, a farm implement manufacturer.[4] A Samson Tractor Division plant employing 3,000 workers was opened in Janesville in 1919, with the first tractor produced on May 1, 1919.[5] A farm depression that started in 1920 forced Samson to curtail production and lay off more than 1,000 workers.[4] Samson eventually went bankrupt.[5] Although General Motors wanted to abandon the Janesville plant, its general manager, Joseph A. Craig, convinced the company to stay, and in 1920 GM transferred its truck production from Flint, Michigan to the Janesville plant.[5]\\r\\nChevrolet began producing automobiles at the plant in 1923. In the same year, an adjacent Fisher Body plant began construction.[5] Production at the factory was halted during the Great Depression for about a year. In 1937 union organizers led a sit-down strike, part of a nationwide series of strikes at GM, which quickly resulted in a national contract.[5] During World War II, the Janesville plants were taken over by General Motors' Oldsmobile Division, and produced artillery.[6]\\r\\nProduction of automobiles resumed following the war. In 1953, a second shift was added to both the Chevrolet and the Fisher Body factories.[5] In April 1967, the 100 millionth GM vehicle was produced at the Chevrolet plant.[5]\\r\\nJanesville Assembly was one of the plants operated under Chevrolet Assembly management prior to General Motors Assembly Division management (most established pre-1945).\\r\\nThe terminology is confusing because most plants assembled more than just Chevrolet or B-O-P, and refers to the management structure only. The five brands originated vehicles from their respective \\"home\\" plants, where vehicles were assembled locally for their respective regions. Vehicles were also produced in \\"knock-down\\" kits and sent to the branch assembly locations. The \\"home\\" branches were Flint, Michigan for both Buick and Chevrolet; Oldsmobile at Lansing, Michigan; Pontiac at Pontiac, Michigan; and Cadillac at Detroit, Michigan.[7]\\r\\nIn 1969, the Chevrolet and Fisher Body factories joined to form the General Motors Assembly Division.[5] Peak production at the Janesville Assembly occurred in 1977, when there were 7,100 employees, and 274,286 cars and 114,681 trucks were produced.[5]\\r\\nIn the 1980s General Motors moved large car production from Janesville and started making subcompact J-cars, such as the Chevrolet Cavalier. In 1987 the company moved Janesville's pickup line to the Fort Wayne, Indiana assembly plant.[5] Local efforts resulted in GM moving medium-duty truck and full-size sport-utility production from plants in Michigan to Janesville.[5] By 1992 it was the only GM plant manufacturing large SUVs. In 2002 GM returned Janesville's medium-duty truck production to Flint, Michigan.\\r\\nMost recently the Janesville Assembly built full-size SUVs.[6] It was one of three plants producing the GMT900 trucks, such as the Chevrolet Suburban. It began building the next-generation short-wheelbase GMT900 trucks in January 2006 and the long-wheelbase GMT900 trucks in March of that year and an overtime shift was added to meet demand.[citation needed] From 1994 until 2009, the plant also produced medium-duty trucks for Isuzu under its partnership with GM.[8]\\r\\nIn 2006, the Janesville GM Assembly plant achieved a milestone of producing more than 500,000 full-size sport utility vehicles with E85 FlexFuel capable engines. The Janesville employees were recognized in a ceremony at the plant that included Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle (D).\\r\\nIn 2007, discussion of greenhouse gas fuel emissions regulations sparked a dialogue about the future of the Janesville GM plant.[9] That same year United Auto Workers Local 95 participated in a strike at the facility.[10]\\r\\nIn 2008, fuel prices, the related slow sales of SUVs, and the economy resulted in GM cutting back full-time production at the Janesville plant to a single shift. Combined with an ongoing employee buy-out program, layoffs totaled around 750 jobs in July 2008.[11] During GM's annual shareholder meeting on June 3, 2008, CEO Rick Wagoner announced that the Janesville assembly plant would close by 2010, along with three other GM factories, and could close sooner if the market dictated.[12] The cutbacks announced, along with other changes, were expected to save the North American division $1 billion per year starting in 2010.[13] GM extended its annual summer shutdown an additional two weeks and planned another ten weeks of shutdown for the remainder of 2008 because of excess inventories of SUVs made at the plant.[14]\\r\\nIn October 2008, GM announced that the production of SUVs at the Janesville Assembly would end December 23, 2008.[15][16] On that day workers gathered at a ceremony with a banner reading \\"Last Vehicle off the Janesville Assembly Line\\".[17] The last GM vehicle produced, a Chevrolet Tahoe, was donated to the United Way of North Rock County, which raffled the vehicle off.[18]\\r\\n57 production employees continued assembly work at the Janesville Assembly until April 23, 2009, completing the GM/Isuzu light truck partnership and then an additional 40 to 50 \\"skilled trade employees\\" worked to decommission the plant.[19]\\r\\nGeneral Motors placed the factory on standby until at least 2015 when the company and employee unions negotiate a new contract. The factory was one of three? along with Orion Assembly and Spring Hill Manufacturing - that General Motors kept on standby during their bankruptcy. It was the only one still on standby status in 2014. The factory can only be completely closed by agreement of both General Motors and the United Automobile Workers.[20]\\r\\nAs of January 2016, GM had signed a new contract with the United Auto Workers that cleared the way for selling the Janesville plant.[21] Water or ground contamination on the north and south sides of the plant have delayed the sale of the plant. GM was working with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to clean up that area.[22] As of February 2016, GM was working with CBRE Group of Los Angeles to market the 250 acre site (excluding the contaminated area on the north side of the site) on a global market, hoping to have a buyer by 2017.[23]\\r\\nList of GM factories\\r\\nCoordinates: 423947.93N 89114.02W? / ?42.6633139N 89.0205611W? / 42.6633139; -89.0205611","input":"When did the gm plant in janesville close?"},{"output":"Mount Carmel High School","context":"Adam Mitchel Lambert (born January 29, 1982) is an American singer, songwriter and stage actor. Since 2009, he has sold over 3 million albums and 5 million singles worldwide.[4][5]\\r\\nLambert rose to fame in 2009 after finishing as runner-up on the eighth season of American Idol.[6] Later that year, he released his debut album, For Your Entertainment, which debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200.[7] The album spawned several hit singles, including \\"Whataya Want from Me\\", for which he received a Grammy nomination for \\"Best Male Pop Vocal Performance\\".\\r\\nIn 2012, Lambert released his second studio album, Trespassing.

His father is of partial Norwegian descent and his mother is Jewish, with roots in Romania.[9] Lambert was raised in his mother's religion.[10] He has a younger brother, Neil.[11] Shortly after his birth, his family moved to San Diego, California.[12]\\r\\nLambert began performing with Metropolitan Educational Theatre network (now MET2) from the age of nine.[12] A few years later, he began more intense acting and vocal coaching, continuing to perform with both MET2 and what was to become the Broadway Bound Youth Theatre Foundation, as he moved through Mesa Verde Middle School and then Mount Carmel High School.[11] There, he became heavily involved with theater and choir, performed vocals with the school's jazz band, and competed in the local Air Bands competitions.[12] He also appeared in local professional productions such as Hello, Dolly!, Camelot, The Music Man, Grease, Chess and Peter Pan, at venues such as The Starlight, The Lyceum and others.[12][13]\\r\\nAfter graduating high school in 2000, he attended California State University, Fullerton, but left after five weeks to move to Los Angeles: \\"I just decided that what I really wanted to do was try to work in the real entertainment world. Life is all about taking risks to get what you want.\\"[13]\\r\\nAt 19, Lambert landed his first professional job, performing on a cruise ship for ten months with Anita Mann Productions. Afterwards, he performed in light opera in Orange County, California. By 21, he was signed with a manager and cast in a European tour of Hair.[14] In 2004, he appeared in the Theatre Under the Stars (TUTS) production of Brigadoon[15] and a Pasadena Playhouse production of 110 in the Shade,[12] before being cast in the role of Joshua in The Ten Commandments: The Musical at the Kodak Theatre alongside Val Kilmer.[16] He came to the attention of the casting director for Wicked, and was hired as the understudy for the role of Fiyero and an ensemble member in the first national touring production of the musical from 2005; and the Los Angeles production from 2007. He finished performances with the musical in 2008.[12]\\r\\nDuring this same period, Lambert briefly fronted underground rock band The Citizen Vein with Steve Sidelnyk, Tommy Victor and Monte Pittman.[17] He also worked as a demo singer and a session musician; a compilation of his 2005 recordings were released in 2009 on the album Take One[18] by Hi Fi Recordings and Wilshire Records.\\r\\nLambert auditioned for the eighth season of American Idol in San Francisco, California by singing \\"Rock with You\\" and \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\".[17] Advancing to Hollywood week, he performed \\"What's Up\\" and \\"Believe\\" solo, and \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\" in the group effort.[19] Simon Cowell voiced some concern about his theatricality, but Randy Jackson found it \\"current\\".[17] He advanced easily to the top 36 performing \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\",[19] after which he was voted into the top 13.\\r\\nIn the first week of live shows, his rendition of Michael Jackson's \\"Black or White\\" was praised by all four judges.[20] For Country week, he sang a sitar-infused version of \\"Ring of Fire\\". His Motown night acoustic version of The Miracles' \\"The Tracks of My Tears\\" drew praise from judges and a standing ovation from Smokey Robinson, the week's mentor. Advancing to the top 8, he sang the 2001 Michael Andrews and Gary Jules arrangement of \\"Mad World\\". Because the show had exceeded its time slot, only Cowell gave a critique, which he did by giving Lambert a standing ovation, the only one he bestowed during his decade-long run as an American Idol judge. After Lambert sang \\"If I Can't Have You\\", delivering what DioGuardi called his \\"most memorable performance\\", Cowell described his vocals as \\"immaculate.\\" For the top 3 show, he performed \\"One\\" before Cowell declared, \\"If you are not in the final next week, it will be one of the biggest upsets\\"; and continued with \\"Cryin'\\" before Abdul affirmed, \\"we'll be seeing you next week and many years after that\\".[20]\\r\\nLambert performed three solos in the finale, a reprise of \\"Mad World\\", followed by the 1960s civil rights anthem \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\", to tremendously positive judge reaction. After his performance of the mandatory winner's single, \\"No Boundaries\\" Cowell summed up Lambert's journey: \\"Over the entire season, you've been one of the best, most original contestants we've ever had on the show. The hope and whole idea of a show like this is to find a worldwide star, and I truly believe we've found that in you\\".[20] Lambert was announced as the runner-up for the eighth season of American Idol. Upon winning, Kris Allen stated: \\"Adam deserved this\\", later explaining he thought Lambert deserved to win as much as he did, and that Lambert \\"was the most consistent person all year. He was seriously one of the most gifted performers that I've ever met\\".[21] Lambert's version of the winner's single was released alongside Allen's. The LA Times later ranked Lambert fifth in its list of the top 120 American Idol contestants, selected from the first nine seasons of the show, above Allen.[22]\\r\\nPhotos of Lambert kissing another man surfaced during the American Idol competition. Highlighted as controversial, they were displayed by conservative commentators on The O'Reilly Factor, who called them \\"embarrassing,\\" but did not agree that the images would impact the competition.[23] Lambert confirmed that the photos were of him, stating he had nothing to hide and had always been open about his life.[24] Mainstream media speculated on his sexuality and the readiness of American Idol voters for an openly gay winner.[25] He confirmed that he was gay in a Rolling Stone cover interview shortly thereafter.[26]\\r\\nLambert performed \\"Mad World\\" on The Early Show,[27] and Live with Regis and Kelly.[28] He began the American Idols LIVE!

Spin said the album is \\"perhaps the strongest, most flavorful batch of tunes to reach an AI vet, and Lambert's polymorphous vocal skills unite dancefloor strut and hard-rock pomp in a convincing glam package\\". Rolling Stone, however, gave it a more mixed review: \\"The songs sound great but feel strangely stuffy[it] seems like a disc that was overthought. Next time, the hugely talented Lambert should make sure he's going straight for the gut.\\"[32] Its Claude Kelly and Dr. Luke-produced lead single \\"For Your Entertainment\\" preceded the album's release but was not as successful as its second single \\"Whataya Want from Me\\" which impacted on charts worldwide, became his highest-peaking single (at number 10) on the Billboard Hot 100, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 53rd awards ceremony. Another notable single was \\"Time for Miracles\\", the ending theme for the disaster movie 2012. As of April 2012, For Your Entertainment had sold nearly 2 million copies worldwide[33] and was certified gold in the US in June 2010.[34]\\r\\nOn November 22, Lambert performed \\"For Your Entertainment\\" at the American Music Awards of 2009. The controversial performance, which was the night's finale, showed Lambert kissing a male bassist and grabbing the crotch of another.[35] In response, the Parents Television Council, a conservative decency group, urged viewers to complain to the FCC,[36] though the performance aired \\"outside the FCC's usual 6am-10pm time frame prohibiting the broadcast of indecent material\\".[37] ABC received about 1,500 telephoned complaints and cancelled Lambert's November 25 performance on Good Morning America. He was invited instead to appear on the Early Show on the same date.[38] Discussing the incident in a Rolling Stone interview, Lambert stated: \\"Female performers have been doing this for yearspushing the envelope about sexualityand the minute a man does it, everybody freaks out. We're in 2009it's time to take risks, be a little more brave, time to open people's eyes and if it offends them, then maybe I'm not for them. My goal was not to piss people off, it was to promote freedom of expression and artistic freedom.\\"[35] Lambert returned to the AMAs two years later as a presenter, and was warmly received. Rejecting claims that the singer was banned from the show in 2009, Executive Producer Larry Klein said that he's anticipating future Lambert performances: \\"Adam Lambert is a friend of ours, he's talented and I like everything about him.\\"[39] Lambert's performance was included in Billboard's list of \\"Top Ten American Music Awards Moments\\" on the eve of its 40th anniversary, in November 2012.[40]\\r\\nIn the months leading to his album release, Lambert appeared on the cover of magazines such as Entertainment Weekly in May 2009,[41] Rolling Stone in June 2009[42] and Details in November 2009.[43] His Rolling Stone cover story became the magazine's best selling issue of the year.[44] He appeared on the cover of Out magazine in their 2009 \\"Out 100\\" issue, sparking controversy as Out's publisher issued him an open letter questioning the \\"gayness\\" of his image.[45] In April, he became one of People Magazine's Most Beautiful People 2010.[46] He was chosen for Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People of 2009, and interviewed on the December 10 show.[47] In late 2009, he performed on the Late Show with David Letterman,[48] The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien,[49] the season finale of So You Think You Can Dance,[50] The Jay Leno Show[51] and The Oprah Winfrey Show.[52] He performed his first official solo concert, which sold-out, at Fantasy Springs Resort Casino in Indio, California.[53]\\r\\nIn April 2010, Lambert returned to American Idol as the first former contestant to mentor during an Elvis Presley themed week, where he also performed.[54] In June, he appeared on Canada's MuchMusic Video Awards to receive the UR Fav International Video award for \\"Whataya Want from Me.\\"[55]\\r\\nIn early June 2010, Lambert embarked on his debut headlining Glam Nation Tour, playing in the United States, Europe and Asia for 113 shows, nearly all of them sold out.[56] The Indianapolis show was filmed for Lambert's first video release Glam Nation Live, a 13-track CD with DVD.[57] The concert, which MTV called \\"out of this world\\", and his subsequent video release, were well-received, with Entertainment Weekly saying it \\"sizzles\\" with the energy that Lambert's vocals bring in a live concert setting.[58] Glam Nation Live debuted at number one on the SoundScan Music Video chart[59] and landed at number 12 on Billboard's 2011 year-end music video sales chart.[60] This followed the release of his first extended play, Acoustic Live!, consisting of acoustic versions of songs recorded live in various countries.

In March, Billboard reported that Queen + Adam Lambert topped their \\"Hot Tours\\" recap, with their Australian shows.[172][173]\\r\\nCritics, celebrities and colleagues have been outspoken in their praise for Lambert's vocal command. Kathie Bretches-Urban, co-founder of Metropolitan Educational Theatre Network (now MET2)[174] where Lambert performed as a youth, said \\"He has invested his entire life in music and performing?... He'd just come out onstage, and it popped\\".[175] Record producer Rob Cavallo once described Lambert as having an unlimited range, and able to sing every note on a guitar from the lowest to the highest.[176] In a March 2012 interview, rock artist Meat Loaf rated Lambert's voice in the company of only two others, Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin, based on \\"that jet pack quality to their voice that just lets it take off.\\"[177] Lambert's total recorded vocal range spans from bass E to B flat above tenor high C (E2 ÿ B?5), giving him three octaves and six semitones.[178]\\r\\nIn 2011, when he took the stage at the MTV Europe Music Awards, honoree Queen guitarist Brian May noted that Lambert's voice has \\"sensitivity, depth, maturity, and awesome range and power which will make jaws drop\\";[179] while Roger Taylor added that Lambert had \\"the best range I've ever heard\\" in a BBC interview in 2012.[180] Pharrell Williams, after collaborating with Lambert on his Trespassing album, commented, \\"This kid has a voice like a siren ÿ there's no guys singing in that Steve Winwood-Peter Cetera range.\\"[181]\\r\\nIn October 2012, the Sunday Mirror reported that Lambert had insured his voice for $48 million. A source told the tabloid newspaper: \\"Insurance for stars is a big deal in the US and Adam's voice is his bacon.\\"[182]\\r\\nLambert is best known for his theatrical performance style and meticulous attention to detail in all aspects of his personal presentation. He draws upon extensive stage experience in the ease with which he can refine and define his image through fashion and other imagery, which are essential to how he chooses to inhabit his songs, rivet his audiences and showcase his individuality.[183] While a contestant on American Idol, Lambert's precise yet varied stagings of himself kept audiences and judges glued as much to his presentation as to his vocal talent.[184] His signature flamboyance and glam rock styling was a break-out moment in men's fashion, duly noted by fashion publications and taste-makers, who compared him to Lady Gaga in terms of crossing style boundaries and being unabashedly individual.[185][186]\\r\\nLambert made three fashion related TV appearances at the close of 2010. He fused his passion for music and fashion on MTV's \\"Talk@Playground\\", appearing in discussion with Skingraft designer Jonny Cota.[187] He was a guest judge on Project Runway, in an episode that styled a rock band for their upcoming Rolling Stone cover.[188] He was the subject for whom the young designers of \\"All on the Line with Joe Zee\\" created a modern look, which he then critiqued along with the show's hosts.[189]\\r\\nLambert continued to grace the covers of magazines, moving more specifically into the fashion and culture space.[190][191] Reflecting the mood and concept behind his album Trespassing, the Fault Magazine fashion shoot exemplified Lambert's commitment to aligning the elements of his artistic vision so that a cohesive narrative emerges.[192] When Lambert appeared on the December 2012 cover of London-based high style magazine Fiasco's \\"Obsession\\" issue, he again took the opportunity to manipulate and provoke with his image and style. Sporting a sophisticated, minimalist look that recalled old Hollywood, Lambert played with male stereotypes and representations; and in the interview, emphasized that his fashion and presentation are often disparate from gay as well as straight regimes: \\"For the general audience, they look at the way I style myself and they go, 'Errrr, that's gay', but you ask a handful of gay guys and they're like, 'I would never wear that!'\\"[193][194] In August, 2015, he was one of four artists to appear on the cover of Billboard's \\"Music's Men of Style\\" issue. He discussed his natural shift towards a cleaner, more classic look; and reiterated that the intersection of music and fashionthe constant motion of trendsis a fascination and part of being a pop musician.[195]\\r\\nLambert is represented by London-based MiLK Management modelling agency as of July 2016.[4]\\r\\nLambert was inspired when his father gave him access to his large record collection of 1970s music. He was attracted to theatrical rock from artists like Madonna, David Bowie, Michael Jackson, Queen, Aerosmith, and Led Zeppelin.[196] Lambert referred to Michael Jackson and Madonna as \\"King and Queen\\" because they creatively merged music with makeup, fashion and cinematic video.[197] Among his strongest influences are British singers such as Freddie Mercury, David Bowie and Robert Plant: \\"Those are the people I really gravitate towards\\".[198]\\r\\nIn March 2013, Lambert wrote an article for Out magazine's tribute to David Bowie, who was about to release a new album. In it, he explained how Bowie helped inform the expression of his own sexuality and gender in his work: \\"A light bulb went offI wasn't into drag, I didn't want to dress like a woman, but I wanted to express my gender and artistic identity differently than the mainstream. Bowie was a key inspiration. It was about the androgyny of mixing it up, and that was what was so incredible about his conceptshe was one of the first rock stars to really push the idea that sexuality was not black and white but an exploration\\".[199]\\r\\nLambert's own music has been influenced by numerous genres including classic rock, pop, and electronic music; and his performance style draws heavily from his stage experience.[200] Lambert envisions himself as the type of artist \\"that creates from the ground up, not only an amazing song, but one with a beat, and a story, and a look, and a theme\\".[197] For his second album, he used inspiration from classic disco, 1990s electronica, funk and dubstep music.[181]\\r\\nSince his appearance on American Idol, Lambert has lent considerable support and time to charitable causes. As of October 2011, financial donations had reached the $1,000,000 mark.[201]\\r\\nIn January 2010, in lieu of gifts for his 28th birthday, Lambert asked fans to donate to DonorsChoose.org, as 2,435 fans donated $322,700.[202] In June 2010, Lambert teamed with the charity for his \\"Glam A Classroom\\" campaign, raising another $208,590, supported by 3,020 fans.[203] In October 2010, he collaborated on a second Signature Collection with The Pennyroyal Studio, which sold out after raising $43,092 for DonorsChoose.[204] Lambert contributed to the MusiCares charity when he and The Pennyroyal Studio collaborated on the design of an Eye of Horus pendant, whose sale raised $32,000 in 7 days.[205]\\r\\nIn January 2011, he began a campaign to raise $29,000 for charity: water to commemorate his 29th birthday and the campaign raised $323,803, which helped 16,190 people receive clean water.[206] He continued his efforts for his 30th birthday, in January 2012, this time asking fans to \\"give up\\" their birthdays in an ongoing drive that had raised $82,000 by May 2012.[207] In June 2013, an accounting by charity:water listed 55 projects thus far completed with funds raised by Lambert.[208]\\r\\nLambert returned to the American Idol stage for the March 10, 2011, results show, singing an acoustic version of his For Your Entertainment track \\"Aftermath\\".

It's not all about me. It's about trying to raise awareness and getting people to take action.\\"[228] His heavily provocative AMA performance, featuring a gay kiss on live television, served to push societal boundaries by highlighting a double standard of ethics in media regulation as well.[35][229]\\r\\nLambert was presented the \\"Equality Idol Award\\" by Sam Sparro at the Equality California Los Angeles Equality Awards in August 2011 for being an exemplary role model for the LGBT community.[230] He was honored with his mother the following month at the PFLAG National Los Angeles event for his \\"authentic\\" voice.[231]\\r\\nLambert received a GLAAD Media Award nomination for Outstanding Music Artist in 2010.

Two decks are required for game of up to four players. Five or six players require three decks. Aces are high (above a King) or low, (below 2). Each game has seven hands, and the rules for each hand are unique. One person begins as dealer for the first hand, and then the person to the dealer's left becomes dealer for the next hand, and so on. Each player is dealt eleven cards for the seven rounds. The rest of the deck is then placed face down in the middle of the players; this is referred to as the deck. One card is taken from the top of the deck and placed face up next to it. This card is called the upcard and becomes the beginning of the discard pile.\\r\\nEach player has a choice at the beginning of their turn. They may either pick up one new card from the top of the deck or take the upcard. (Also, the other players in the game have the ability to get the up card.) After the player draws his card, either from the deck or the upcard, he must then choose any card in his hand to discard, and he then places this card face up on the discard pile. That card then becomes the new upcard, which the next player in turn can take or other players can buy. To get a card that isn't yours a player must say, BUY\\", before the next player draws their card, or else it is already considered \\"dead\\". Once a player discards their card the card underneath that card is now considered a \\"dead\\" card because it is no longer in the game. Players may not take these cards.\\r\\nJokers are wild cards and can be played in the place of any card. A player is not allowed to have more jokers than face-cards in either a set or run. An example of this would be if one is trying to get a set he must have three or more cards of the same rank (8/8/8). But if a player has a joker or 2 he could play in place of an 8 (8/8/joker). But a player cannot lay more jokers than face-cards (8/joker/joker). However he may lay the same number of jokers as face-cards (8/8/joker/joker). The same applies for runs.if a player has laid down and has a joker in a run or set, the joker can be replaced by the appropriate card by any player.If a player who has not laid down yet replaces any joker he must lay down his meld in that turn, but if the player has already laid down his meld he may take the joker and use it how he chooses anytime.\\r\\nA \\"buy\\" is when a out-of-turn player takes the upcard, draws 2 extra cards from the stock, and cannot play the cards immediately, but must wait for his turn. If more than one player wants it, the one closest to the dealer's left has precedence. There is a limit to the number of buys allowed. , each player is only allowed 2 buys per hand.\\r\\nThe object of each hand is to come up with the correct combination of cards to be able to meld, or \\"lay out\\". The combination for each hand is different, and they become more difficult with each subsequent hand. The combinations for each hand are either sets or runs (sequence) or a combination of both. A set is a combination of a specific number of cards of the same rank, and the suit is not important. An example of a \\"set of 3\\" is three cards that are all 8's, and the 8's can all be of different suits. A run is a combination of a specific number of cards of the same suit that have consecutive ranks. An example of a \\"run of 4\\" is the 4, 5, 6, and 7 of clubs. An example of a combination for a hand is for hand #2, \\"1 set of 3 and 1 run of 4.\\" This means that a player must have both a set of 3 cards and a run of 4 cards in his hand before he can meld. A player can meld only when it is his turn. As always, he must start his hand by drawing a card, then when he has the correct sequence of cards, he can meld or \\"go down.\\" He does so by laying his meld cards face up on the table in their correct sequence. After melding, a player can then play on the melds of other players. When done, he must then discard.\\r\\nWhen a player is \\"down\\" (meaning he has already melded), he still takes his turn in turn with the other players, and he still must draw a card and discard. However, a player who is down cannot buy a card, nor can he stop a player from buying the top card in the discard pile when it is his turn. A player who is down can play his cards on the melds that have been completed either by himself or by other players. For example, if a player has laid down a set of 8's, and on a subsequent turn he then draws another 8, he can play this 8 on his set of 8's. He does this by placing the 8 with the set of 8's. If he has a card that he would like to play on a run, he must be sure to keep the order of the run. For example, if there is a run of 5 consisting of 4-5-6-7-8 of clubs, the player can play a 3 of clubs or a 9 of clubs.\\r\\nPlay progresses until the final hand when one of the players \\"goes out,\\" meaning he is able to play the last card in his hand. Although players may discard throughout the game, to win they must be able to lay down all of their cards without discarding. In order to win, on a player's turn they must be able to draw a card and then go out without a discard. The winner of the hand gets zero points, and the other players count their cards to determine their score for the hand. After all seven hands are played, the winner is the player with the lowest score.duandon\\r\\n1. two sets\\r\\n2. one set and one run\\r\\n3. two runs\\r\\n4. three sets\\r\\n5. two set and one run\\r\\n6. one set and two runs\\r\\n7. three runs\\r\\n10 to king: 10 points","input":"How many cards do you get in shanghai?"},{"output":"Bill de Blasio","context":"Bill de Blasio\\r\\nDemocratic\\r\\n\\r\\nAn election for Mayor of New York City will be held on November 7, 2017.

The original three films were written by George C. Johnson, George Nolfi, along with Brian Koppelman and David Levien, for each respective film. Released from 2001 to 2007, the trilogy is often cited as defining its genre and leading to a proliferation and commercialization of heist films throughout the world.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the 1960 Rat Pack film, Ocean's 11, the series has seen mixed to favorable critical reception and substantial commercial success. Collectively grossing US$1.17 billion worldwide, the most commercially successful rendition was the first, Ocean's Eleven (2001). It established the ensemble cast of George Clooney, Matt Damon, and Brad Pitt, as Danny Ocean, Linus Caldwell, and Rusty Ryan, respectively. A long list of supporting cast members maintain the trilogy. The first sequel, Ocean's Twelve was released in 2004 with the third and final film, Ocean's Thirteen, following in 2007. An all-female spin-off written and directed by Gary Ross, Ocean's 8 was released on June 8, 2018, 11 years to the day after Thirteen's release.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ocean's film series was inspired by the 1960 heist film, Ocean's 11, directed by Lewis Milestone and starring five of the Rat Pack: Peter Lawford, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Joey Bishop.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaster thief Danny Ocean (George Clooney), just out of prison, plans an elaborate Las Vegas three-casino-heist to win back his ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts).

The team is given two weeks to come up with the money so they travel to Europe to execute three heists. In order to extend the deadline they attempt to steal world's oldest stock certificate, issued by the Dutch East India Company in 1602. Worth ?2.5 million, the certificate is stolen just before the crew get there by a rival thiefÿ\\"The Night Fox\\" (Vincent Cassel). The rival thief proposes to the crew a competition to steal Hermitage Museum's Imperial Coronation Egg in order to find out who is the best there is in the world. In exchange for the competition, the rival thief offers to pay back the $198 million debt they have with Terry Benedict. With only a week left, the crew agrees and eventually loses the competition after a Europol detective, Agent Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), catches them in the act. After this it is revealed that The Night Fox's mentor, Gaspar LeMarque, was behind the heist all along. He told the Ocean's crew to go to the museum beforehand, switch out the real egg for a fake one and convince The Night Fox to steal it.

In the later stages of AIDS it can be very severe. It usually first presents as a persistent cough. It is typically treated with a series of three antibiotics for a period of at least six months.\\r\\nM. avium, M. intracellulare, and M. chimaera are each saprotrophic organisms present in soil and water; entry into hosts is usually via the gastrointestinal tract, but also can be via the lungs.\\r\\nMAC infections can cause fevers, diarrhea, malabsorption, as well as loss of appetite and weight loss, and can disseminate to the bone marrow. MAI is typically resistant to standard mycobacterial therapies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSymptoms are similar to tuberculosis (TB), and include fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Pulmonary involvement is similar to TB, while diarrhea and abdominal pain are associated with gastrointestinal involvement.\\r\\nM. avium and M. haemophilum infections in children form a distinct clinical entity, not associated with abnormalities of the immune system. M. avium typically causes unilateral swelling of one of the lymph nodes of the neck. This node is firm at the beginning, but a collarstud abscess' is formed eventually, which is a characteristic blue-purple in colour with multiple discharging sinuses. The treatment of choice is surgical excision of the affected lymph nodes,[2] with antibiotic treatment (usually clarithromycin and rifabutin for 18 to 24 months) reserved for those patients who cannot have surgery.\\r\\nMAC bacteria are common in the environment and cause infection when inhaled or swallowed. Recently, M. avium has been found to deposit and grow in bathroom shower heads from which it may be easily aerosolized and inhaled.[3]\\r\\nMycobacterium avium complex (MAC), also called Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, is a microbial complex of three Mycobacterium species (i.e. M. avium, M. intracellulare, and M. chimaera.[4] It causes Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection.[5][6] Some sources also include Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP).[7]\\r\\nMAI is common in immunocompromised individuals, including senior citizens and those with HIV/AIDS or cystic fibrosis. Bronchiectasis, the bronchial condition which causes unnatural enlargement of the bronchial tubes, is commonly found with MAI infection. Whether the bronchiectasis leads to the MAC infection or is the result of it is not always known.[8]\\r\\nThe Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) includes common atypical bacteria, i.e. nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), found in the environment which can infect people with HIV and low CD4 cell count (below 100/microliter); mode of infection is usually inhalation or ingestion.\\r\\nMAC causes disseminated disease in up to 40% of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States, producing fever, sweats, weight loss, and anemia.[9][10][11] Disseminated MAC characteristically affects people with advanced HIV disease and peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/uL. Effective prevention and therapy of MAC has the potential to contribute substantially to improved quality of life and duration of survival for HIV-infected persons.[12]\\r\\nMycobacterium avium complex is the most commonly found form of non-tuberculous mycobacteria.[13]\\r\\nImmunodeficiency is not a requirement for MAI.[14]\\r\\nMycobacterium avium complex (MAC) usually affects patients with abnormal lungs or bronchi. However, Candace Baker, Jerome Reich and Richard Johnson describe a series of six patients with MAC infection of the right middle lobe or left lingula who did not have any predisposing lung disorders.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe right middle lobe and left lingula of the lungs are served by bronchi that are oriented downward when a person is in the upright position. As a result, these areas of the lung may be more dependent upon vigorous voluntary expectoration (cough) for clearance of bacteria and secretions.\\r\\nSince the six patients in their retrospective case series were older females, Reich and Johnson and Baker proposed that patients without a vigorous cough may develop right middle lobe or left lingular infection with MAC. They proposed this syndrome be named Lady Windermere syndrome, after the character Lady Windermere in Oscar Wilde's play Lady Windermere's Fan. However, little research has confirmed this speculative cause.[15]\\r\\nDiagnosis can be achieved through blood cultures, or cultures of other bodily fluids such as sputum. Bone marrow culture can often yield an earlier diagnosis, but is usually avoided as an initial diagnostic step because of its invasiveness.\\r\\nMany people will have anemia and neutropenia if bone marrow is involved. MAC bacteria should always be considered in a person with HIV infection presenting with diarrhea.\\r\\nThe diagnosis requires consistent symptoms with two additional signs:\\r\\nDisseminated MAC is most readily diagnosed by one positive blood culture. Blood cultures should be performed in patients with symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities compatible with mycobacterium infection. Blood cultures are not routinely recommended for asymptomatic persons, even for those who have CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/uL.[12]\\r\\nMAC in patients with HIV disease is theorized to represent recent acquisition rather than latent infection reactivating (which is the case in many other opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients).\\r\\nThe risk of MAC is inversely related to the patient's CD4 count, and increases significantly when the CD4 count decreases below 50 cells/mm3. Other risk factors for acquisition of MAC infection include using an indoor swimming pool, consumption of raw or partially cooked fish or shellfish, bronchoscopy and treatment with granulocyte stimulating factor.\\r\\nDisseminated disease was previously the common presentation prior to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Today, in regions where HAART is the standard of care, localized disease presentation is more likely. This generally includes a focal lymphadenopathy/lymphadenitis.\\r\\nPeople with AIDS are given macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin for prophylactic treatment.[16]\\r\\nPeople with HIV infection and less than 50 CD4+ T-lymphocytes/uL should be administered prophylaxis against MAC. Prophylaxis should be continued for the patient's lifetime unless multiple drug therapy for MAC becomes necessary because of the development of MAC disease.[12]\\r\\nClinicians must weigh the potential benefits of MAC prophylaxis against the potential for toxicities and drug interactions, the cost, the potential to produce resistance in a community with a high rate of tuberculosis, and the possibility that the addition of another drug to the medical regimen may adversely affect patients' compliance with treatment. Because of these concerns, therefore, in some situations rifabutin prophylaxis should not be administered.[12]\\r\\nBefore prophylaxis is administered, patients should be assessed to ensure that they do not have active disease due to MAC, M. tuberculosis, or any other mycobacterial species. This assessment may include a chest radiograph and tuberculin skin test.[12]\\r\\nRifabutin, by mouth daily, is recommended for the people's lifetime unless disseminated MAC develops, which would then require multiple drug therapy. Although other drugs, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, have laboratory and clinical activity against MAC, none has been shown in a prospective, controlled trial to be effective and safe for prophylaxis. Thus, in the absence of data, no other regimen can be recommended at this time.The 300-mg dose of rifabutin has been well tolerated. Adverse effects included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, rash, and gastrointestinal disturbances.[12]\\r\\nPostinfection treatment involves a combination of antituberculosis antibiotics, including rifampicin, rifabutin, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, ethambutol, streptomycin, clarithromycin or azithromycin.\\r\\nNTM infections are usually treated with a three-drug regimen of either clarithromycin or azithromycin, plus rifampicin and ethambutol. Treatment typically lasts at least 12 months.\\r\\nAlthough studies have not yet identified an optimal regimen or confirmed that any therapeutic regimen produces sustained clinical benefit for patients with disseminated MAC, the Task Force concluded that the available information indicated the need for treatment of disseminated MAC. The Public Health Service therefore recommends that regimens be based on the following principles:[12]\\r\\nClinical manifestations of disseminated MACsuch as fever, weight loss, and night sweatsshould be monitored several times during the initial weeks of therapy. Microbiologic response, as assessed by blood culture every 4 weeks during initial therapy, can also be helpful in interpreting the efficacy of a therapeutic regimen.Most patients who ultimately respond show substantial clinical improvement in the first 4ÿ6 weeks of therapy. Elimination of the organisms from blood cultures may take somewhat longer, often requiring 4ÿ12 weeks.[12]\\r\\nHIV-infected children less than 12 years of age also develop disseminated MAC. Some age adjustment is necessary when clinicians interpret CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts in children less than 2 years of age. Diagnosis, therapy, and prophylaxis should follow recommendations similar to those for adolescents and adults.[12]\\r\\n\\"Lady Windermere syndrome\\" is one term to describe infection in the lungs due to MAC.[17] It is named after a character in Oscar Wilde's play Lady Windermere's Fan.[18]\\r\\nIn recent years, some have described the eponym as inappropriate,[19] and some have noted that it would have been unlikely that Lady Windermere had the condition to which her name was assigned.[20]\\r\\nThe more commonly used term is nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection, or non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (NMI). There is no evidence that a person's reluctance to spit has any causal role in NTM infection, the chief reason for the term having been applied to older women presenting with the condition.[21]\\r\\nLady Windermere syndrome is a type of mycobacterial lung infection.[22]\\r\\nThe original Chest article proposing the existence and pathophysiology of the Lady Windermere syndrome suggested the character Lady Windermere in Oscar Wilde's Victorian-era play Lady Windermere's Fan is a good example of the fastidious behavior believed to cause the syndrome. The article states:\\r\\nVictorian women presumably believed \\"ladies don't spit,\\" and consequently might have been predisposed to develop lung infection.\\r\\nShortly after the Lady Windermere syndrome was proposed, a librarian wrote a letter to the editor of Chest[23] challenging the use of Lady Windermere as the eponymous ancestor of the proposed syndrome. In the play, Lady Windermere is a vivacious young woman, married only two years, who never coughs or displays any other signs of illness. While her avoidance of shaking hands might be interpreted as \\"fastidiousness\\", two alternative explanations may be just as probable:\\r\\nThe scholars highlight the literary malapropism,[25] but some in the medical community have adopted the term regardless, and peer-reviewed medical journals still sometimes mention the Lady Windermere syndrome, although it is increasingly viewed as a limiting and sexist term for a serious bacterial infection.[26][27]","input":"Which microorganisms cause mycobacterium avium complex (mac) infection?"},{"output":"matrifocal (a mother and her children)","context":"","input":"What are the different kinds of family patterns?"},{"output":"Avatar","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nFilms generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights and merchandising. However, theatrical box office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally, war films, musicals and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, but franchise films have been among the best performers in the 21st century. Six Harry Potter films and five films from Peter Jackson's Middle-earth series are included in the nominal earnings chart, while the Star Wars and Pirates of the Caribbean franchises feature prominently. There is also continued interest in the superhero genre: Batman and Superman from DC Comics and films based on the Marvel Comics brand, such as Spider-Man, X-Men and films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, have generally done well. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by Avatar and Titanic (both directed by James Cameron), which are original works. Animated family films have performed consistently well, with Disney films enjoying lucrative re-releases prior to the home-video era. Disney also enjoyed later success with films such as Frozen (the highest-grossing animated film), Zootopia and The Lion King, as well as with its Pixar brand, of which the Toy Story and Finding Nemo films have been the best performers. Beyond Disney and Pixar animation, the Shrek, Ice Age and Despicable Me series have met with the most success.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile inflation has eroded away the achievements of most films from the 1960s and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the Star Wars and Superman franchises, James Bond and Star Trek films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When properly adjusted for inflation, however, on that comparative scale Gone with the Windwhich was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five yearsis still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a worldwide box-office gross of over $2.7?billion, Avatar is often proclaimed to be the \\"highest-grossing\\" film, but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income, which can form a significant portion of a film's earnings. Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. Titanic earned $1.2?billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[1] in addition to the $2.2?billion it grossed in theaters. While complete sales data are not available for Avatar, it earned $345?million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America,[2] and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.[3] After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3?billion. Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film's earnings, with a film often earning as much as 20ÿ25% of its theatrical box-office for a couple of television runs on top of pay-per-view revenues;[4] Titanic earned a further $55?million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights,[1] equating to about 9% of its North American gross.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a film is highly exploitable as a commercial property, its ancillary revenues can dwarf its income from direct film sales.[5] The Lion King earned over $2?billion in box-office and home video sales,[6] but this pales in comparison to the $6?billion earned at box offices around the world by the stage adaptation.[7] Merchandising can be extremely lucrative too: The Lion King also sold $3?billion of merchandise,[8] while Pixar's Carswhich earned $462?million in theatrical revenues and was only a modest hit by comparison to other Pixar films[9]generated global merchandise sales of over $8?billion in the five years after its 2006 release.[10][11] Pixar also had another huge hit with Toy Story 3, which generated almost $10?billion in merchandise retail sales in addition to the $1?billion it earned at the box office.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Thirty-three films in total have grossed in excess of $1?billion worldwide, of which three have grossed over $2?billion, with Avatar ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\\r\\n\\r\\nFBox Office Mojo stopped updating its main total for Frozen in August 2014, while it was still in release. The total listed here incorporates subsequent earnings in Japan, Nigeria, Spain, the United Kingdom and Germany up to the end of 2015 but omits earnings in Turkey, Iceland, Brazil, and Australia (2016) which amount to a few hundred thousand dollars. It was re-released in the United Kingdom in December 2017 with Olaf's Frozen Adventure earning an additional $1,655,398. The total is rounded to $1 million to compensate for the numerical inaccuracy. \\r\\nF8In the case of The Fate of the Furious the gross is sourced from BoxOffice rather than the chart's regular source, Box Office Mojo, after irregularities were discovered in the latter's figure. Ongoing weekly drops in the totals for several countriesArgentina being the worst affectedled to a drop in the overall worldwide total.[14] In view of what appears to be an aberration in the source an alternative figure is provided. \\r\\nTS3The gross for Toy Story 3 has been corrected to $1,066,969,703, meaning that it finished one place higher at the end of its release. \\r\\nDM2Disney issued an erratum to the gross for The Lion King, correcting its gross from $987.5 million to $968.5 million. This means that Despicable Me 2 finished its run ahead of it and would have ranked one place higher at the end of its release. \\r\\nFNFinding Nemo finished one place higher at the end of its original release, after taking corrections into account. Its total now stands at $940.3 million, which would put the first run at $871.0 million after deducting the 3D reissue gross of $69.3 million. Meanwhile, the total gross for The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has been corrected to $871.5 million, which would rank below Finding Nemo's first run once its 2011 reissue gross is deducted.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[15] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[16] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars.[17] Ticket prices have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother complication is release in multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged. One notable example of this phenomenon is Avatar, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films.[18] Social and economic factors such as population change[19] and the growth of international markets[20][21][22] also impact on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's tickets, or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe measuring system for gauging a film's success is based on unadjusted grosses, mainly because historically this is the way it has always been done because of the practices of the film industry: the box office receipts are compiled by theaters and relayed to the distributor, which in turn releases them to the media.[23] Converting to a more representative system that counts ticket sales rather than gross is also fraught with problems because the only data available for older films are the sale totals.[19] As the motion picture industry is highly oriented towards marketing currently released films, unadjusted figures are always used in marketing campaigns so that new blockbuster films can much more easily achieve a high sales ranking, and thus be promoted as a \\"top film of all time\\",[17][24] so there is little incentive to switch to a more robust analysis from a marketing or even newsworthy point of view.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made. Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses,[24] and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also impact upon the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. Gone with the Windfirst released in 1939is generally considered to be the most successful film, with Guinness World Records in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4 billion. Estimates for Gone with the Wind's adjusted gross have varied substantially: its owner, Turner Entertainment, estimated its adjusted earnings at $3.3 billion in 2007, a few years earlier than the Guinness estimate;[25] other estimates fall either side of this amount, with one putting its gross just under $3 billion in 2010,[26] while another provided an alternative figure of $3.8 billion in 2006.[27] Which film is Gone with the Wind's nearest rival depends on the set of figures used: Guinness had Avatar in second place with $3 billion, while other estimates saw Titanic in the runner-up spot with first-run worldwide earnings of almost $2.9 billion at 2010 prices. The only other film that all sources agreed grossed in excess of $2 billion at recent prices is Star Wars; according to Guinness it has earned $2.8 billion at 2014 price levels, while other sources from 2010/2011 put its adjusted earnings at $2.2ÿ2.6 billion.[26][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nTFAEven though the nominal gross for Star Wars: The Force Awakens surpasses the inflation-adjusted gross for both Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Jaws, inflation has occurred in the interim so it is not possible to rank it until Guinness World Records provide an updated chart of adjusted grosses.\\r\\n\\r\\nTThe figure for Titanic is most likely based on the gross from its 1997 theatrical release, and does not incorporate earnings from the 2012 reissue. According to the 2012 edition of Guinness World Records, the adjusted total for Titanic as of 2011 stood at $2,413,800,000, and a re-release in 2012 added a further $343,550,770 to the total.[31] However, the 2015 edition put the adjusted total at $2,516,000,000an increase of just $102,000,000; this is a rise of 4.2% since 2011, an increase shared by the other adjusted totals in the chart.\\r\\n\\r\\nSThe 2015 edition of Guinness World Records does not provide an explicit figure for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. However, it does state that it is one of only two pre-1955 filmsthe other being Gone with the Windthat are among the adjusted top ten. It placed tenth in the 2012 edition, and the eleventh highest-grossing film according to the 2015 edition is The Exorcist, which has grossed $1.794 billion adjusted to 2014 prices. The adjusted grosses for the other films on the chart increased by 4.2 percent between 2011 and 2014 according to Guinness, and using this apparent rate of inflation would take the adjusted gross for Snow White from $1.746 billion at 2011 prices to $1.819 billion at 2014 prices.\\r\\n\\r\\nAudience tastes were fairly eclectic during the 20th century, but several trends did emerge. During the silent era, films with war themes were popular with audiences, with The Birth of a Nation (American Civil War), The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, The Big Parade and Wings (all World War I) becoming the most successful films in their respective years of release, with the trend coming to an end with All Quiet on the Western Front in 1930. With the advent of sound in 1927, the musicalthe genre best placed to showcase the new technologytook over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war themed films dominate again during this period, starting with Gone with the Wind (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with The Best Years of Our Lives (World War II) in 1946. Samson and Delilah (1949) saw the beginning of a trend of increasingly expensive historical dramas set during Ancient Rome/biblical times throughout the 1950s as cinema competed with television for audiences,[35] with Quo Vadis, The Robe, The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur and Spartacus all becoming the highest-grossing film of the year during initial release, before the genre started to wane after several high-profile failures.[36] The success of White Christmas and South Pacific in the 1950s foreshadowed the comeback of the musical in the 1960s with West Side Story, Mary Poppins, My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Funny Girl all among the top films of the decade. The 1970s saw a shift in audience tastes to high concept films, with six such films made by either George Lucas or Steven Spielberg topping the chart during the 1980s. The 21st century has seen an increasing dependence on franchises and adaptations, with the box office dominance of films based on pre-existing intellectual property at record levels.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nSteven Spielberg is the most represented director on the chart with six films to his credit, occupying the top spot in 1975, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1989 and 1993. Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) are in second and third place with five and four films respectively, while D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and James Cameron (1991, 1997 and 2009) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. The following directors have also all directed two films on the chart: Frank Lloyd, King Vidor, Frank Capra, Michael Curtiz, Leo McCarey, Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean, Stanley Kubrick, Guy Hamilton, Mike Nichols, William Friedkin, Peter Jackson, Gore Verbinski and Michael Bay; Mervyn LeRoy, Ken Annakin and Robert Wise are each represented by one solo credit and one shared credit, and John Ford co-directed two films. Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only five directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003) and Verbinski (2006 and 2007).\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of release schedulesespecially in the case of films released towards the end of the yearand different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained. At least one film every year has generated $100 million in gross revenue at the box office since 1967, and from 2008 each year has succeeded in producing a billion dollar grossing film.\\r\\n\\r\\n( ... ) Since grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs, a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Canada and U.S. gross only.\\r\\n\\r\\nRDistributor rental.\\r\\n\\r\\nTBATo be ascertained.\\r\\n\\r\\nINNo contemporary sources provide figures for 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, although The Numbers provides a figure of $8,000,000 for the North American box office gross.[41] However, it is possible this figure has been mistaken for the gross of the 1954 remake which also earned $8,000,000 in North American rentals.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nFHSome sources such as The Numbers state that Aloma of the South Seas is the highest grossing film of the year, earning $3 million.[43] However, no contemporary sources provide figures for Aloma of the South Seas, so it is unclear what the $3 million figure relates to. If it were the rental gross then that would have made it not only the highest-grossing film of the year, but one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era, and if that is the case it would be unusual for both International Motion Picture Almanac and Variety to omit it from their lists.\\r\\n\\r\\nSSIt is not clear if the figure for Sunny Side Up is for North America or worldwide. Other sources put its earnings at $2 million,[44] which may suggest the higher figure is the worldwide rental, given the confusion over international figures during this period.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nONThe figure for It Happened One Night is not truly representative of its success: it was distributed as a package deal along with more than two dozen other Columbia films, and the total earnings were averaged out; the true gross would have been much higher.\\r\\n\\r\\nS7Snow White's $418 million global cume omits earnings outside of North America from 1987 onwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nGWIt is not absolutely clear how much Gone with the Wind earned from its initial release. Contemporary accounts often list it as earning $32 million in North American rentals and retrospective charts have often duplicated this claim; however, it is likely this was the worldwide rental figure. Trade journals would collate the data by either obtaining it from the distributors themselves, who were keen to promote a successful film, or by surveying theaters and constructing an estimate. Distributors would often report the worldwide rental since the higher figure made the film appear more successful, while estimates were limited to performance in North America; therefore it was not unusual for worldwide and North American rentals to be mixed up. Following the outbreak of World War II, many of the foreign markets were unavailable to Hollywood so it became standard practice to just report on North American box-office performance.[45] In keeping with this new approach, the North American rental for Gone with the Wind was revised to $21 million in 1947 ($11 million lower than the previous figure),[46] and as of 1953following the 1947 re-releaseVariety was reporting earnings of $26 million.[47] Through 1956, MGM reported cumulative North American earnings of $30,015,000 and foreign earnings of $18,964,000, from three releases.[48] Worldwide rentals of $32 million from the initial release is consistent with the revised figures and later reported worldwide figures: they indicate that the film earned $21 million in North America and $11 million overseas from the initial release, and added a further $9 million in North America and $8 million overseas from subsequent re-releases up to 1956.\\r\\n\\r\\nMDMom and Dad does not generally feature in 'high-gross' lists such as those published by Variety due to its independent distribution. Essentially belonging to the exploitation genre, it was marketed as an educational sex hygiene film in an effort to circumvent censorship laws. Falling foul of the Motion Picture Production Code, Mom and Dad was prevented from obtaining mainstream distribution and restricted to independent and drive-in theaters. It was the biggest hit of its kind, and remained in continual distribution until the 1970s when hardcore pornography eventually took over. At the end of 1947 it had earned $2 million, and by 1949, $8 million; by 1956 it had earned $22 million in rentals, representing a gross of $80 million, and would have easily placed in the top ten films in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Estimates of its total earnings are as high as $100 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nUNChopra-Gant stipulates that the figure given for Unconquered is for North American box-office, but as was common at the time, the chart confuses worldwide and North American grosses. Other sources state that the takings for Forever Amber ($8 million) and Life with Father ($6.5 million)[49] were in fact worldwide rental grosses, so it is possible this is also true of Unconquered.\\r\\n\\r\\nCIThe Cinerama figures represent gross amounts. Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since Variety at the time ranked films by their US rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of This Is Cinerama, the $50 million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5 million US rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so Variety's formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the US share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee. Variety's 'rental' amounts are often repeated, but have no basis in the reality of what the films actually earnedthey are hypothetical figures conceived for comparative analysis.[50] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120 million in worldwide box office receipts.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nGSVariety put the worldwide rental for The Greatest Show on Earth at around $18.35 million (with $12.8 million coming from the United States[42]) a year after its release; however, Birchard puts its earnings at just over $15 million up to 1962. It is likely that Birchard's figure is just the North American gross rental, and includes revenue from the 1954 and 1960 reissues.\\r\\n\\r\\nSWThe \\"first run\\" Star Wars grosses do not include revenue from the 1997 special-edition releases; however, the figure does include revenue from the re-releases prior to the special editions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHPProduction costs were shared with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows?ÿ Part 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least ten films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since The Birth of a Nation assumed the top spot in 1915. Both The Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg holding the record on three occasions and James Cameronthe current holdertwice. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when Jurassic Park overtook E.T., and Cameron emulated the feat when Avatar broke the record set by Titanic.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome sources claim that The Big Parade superseded The Birth of a Nation as highest-grossing film, eventually being replaced by Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which in turn was quickly usurped by Gone with the Wind.[52] Exact figures are not known for The Birth of a Nation, but contemporary records put its worldwide earnings at $5.2 million as of 1919.[53] Its international release was delayed by World War I, and it was not released in many foreign territories until the 1920s; coupled with further re-releases in the United States, its $10 million earnings as reported by Variety in 1932 are consistent with the earlier figure.[54] At this time, Variety still had The Birth of a Nation ahead of The Big Parade ($6,400,000) on distributor rentals andif its estimate is correctSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs ($8,500,000)[55] would not have earned enough on its first theatrical run to take the record;[56] although it would have been the highest-grossing 'talkie',[57] displacing The Singing Fool ($5,900,000).[58] Although received wisdom holds that it is unlikely The Birth of a Nation was ever overtaken by a silent-era film,[59] the record would fall to 1925's Ben-Hur ($9,386,000) if The Birth of a Nation earned significantly less than its estimated gross.[60] In addition to its gross rental earnings through public exhibition, The Birth of a Nation played at a large number of private, club and organizational engagements which figures are unavailable for.[61] It was hugely popular with the Ku Klux Klan who used it to drive recruitment,[62] and at one point Variety estimated its total earnings to stand at around $50 million.[63] Despite later retracting the claim, the sum has been widely reported even though it has never been substantiated.[53] While it is generally accepted that Gone with the Wind took over the record of highest-grossing film on its initial releasewhich is true in terms of public exhibitionit is likely it did not overtake The Birth of a Nation in total revenue until a much later date, with it still being reported as the highest earner up until the 1960s.[61] Gone with the Wind itself may have been briefly overtaken by The Ten Commandments (1956), which closed at the end of 1960 with worldwide rentals of $58ÿ60 million[64][65] compared to Gone with the Wind's $59 million;[66] if it did claim the top spot its tenure there was short-lived, since Gone with the Wind was re-released the following year and increased its earnings to $67 million. Depending on how accurate the estimates are, the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur may also have captured the record from Gone with the Wind: as of the end of 1961 it had earned $47 million worldwide,[67] and by 1963 it was trailing Gone with the Wind by just $2 million with international takings of $65 million,[68] ultimately earning $66 million from its initial release.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother film purported to have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film, Deep Throat. In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on juvenile justice that the film had earned $600 million;[70] this figure has been the subject of much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than Star Wars, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. The main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount.[71] Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976about four years into the film's releaseshowed the film had grossed over $25 million.[72] Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $600 million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the box office receipts for the film.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Birth of a Nation, Gone with the Wind, The Godfather, Jaws, Star Wars, E.T. and Avatar all increased their record grosses with re-releases. The grosses from their original theatrical runs are included here along with totals from re-releases up to the point that they lost the record; therefore the total for The Birth of a Nation includes income from its reissues up to 1940; the total for Star Wars includes revenue from the late 1970s and early 1980s reissues but not from the 1997 Special Edition; the total for E.T. incorporates its gross from the 1985 reissue but not from 2002; the total for Avataras the current record-holderincludes all its earnings at the present time. Gone with the Wind is represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939ÿ1942 release (roadshow/general release/second-run)[74] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to The Sound of Music in 1966; its 1971 entryafter it took back the recordincludes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. The Godfather was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and Jaws was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. The Sound of Music, The Godfather, Jaws, Jurassic Park and Titanic increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013 and 2012 respectively, but they are not included in the totals here since they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\\r\\n\\r\\nRDistributor rental.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncludes revenue from re-releases. If a film increased its gross through re-releases while holding the record, the year in which it recorded its highest gross is also noted in italics.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 2000, only seven film series had grossed over $1 billion at the box office: James Bond,[83] Star Wars,[84] Indiana Jones,[85] Rocky,[86][87][88] Batman,[89] Jurassic Park[90] and Star Trek.[91] Since the turn of the century that number has increased to over fifty (not including one-off hits such as Avatar, Titanic and Frozen).[92] This is partly due to inflation and market growth, but also to Hollywood's adoption of the franchise model: films that have built-in brand recognition, such as being based on a well known literary source or an established character. The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \\"pre-sold\\" films within the industry.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe films in the cross-franchise Marvel Cinematic Universe have collectively grossed the most, amassing over $14 billion at the box office. The Harry Potter films are the highest-grossing series based on a single property, earning nearly $8 billion at the box office (although the Eon James Bond films have earned over $14 billion in total when adjusted to current prices[93]); Harry Potter has also generated at least $3.5 billion in home video revenue,[94] taking total consumer spending on the films to over $11 billion. If ancillary income from merchandise is included, then Star Wars is the most lucrative property;[95] it holds the Guinness world record for the \\"most successful film merchandising franchise\\" and was valued at S19.51 billion in 2012 (approximately $30 billion).[96][97] Only two franchises have had more than two films gross over $1 billion: the Marvel Cinematic Universe with five, and Star Wars with four. The two Avengers films comprise the only franchise where each installment has grossed over $1 billion. Avengers is also the only franchise to have a series average of over $1 billion per film, although the Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, Jurassic Park and Finding Nemo franchises, Harry Potter films, and Peter Jackson's Middle-earth adaptation also average over $1 billion adjusted for inflation.[28][98]\\r\\n\\r\\n*Canada and U.S. gross only.\\r\\n\\r\\nRDistributor rental.","input":"What is the movie with the highest box office?"},{"output":"Cabo San Lucas International Airport","context":"Cabo San Lucas International Airport (Spanish: Aer܇dromo Internacional de Cabo San Lucas) (ICAO: MMSL) is a small international airfield (officially it's an \\"aerodrome\\") located 4.5 miles (7.2?km) northwest of Cabo San Lucas in Baja California Sur, Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe airport has air taxi service.

In Italy the press is known as a caffettiera a stantuffo. In New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa the apparatus is known as a coffee plunger, and coffee brewed in it as plunger coffee. Its French name is cafetire  piston, though French speakers also use genericized trademarks, notably Melior or Bodum. In the UK and the Netherlands the device is known as a cafetire, the French word for coffee maker or pot. In the United States and Canada, it is known as a French press or coffee press.\\r\\nOver the years, the French press has undergone several design modifications. The first coffee press, which may have been made in France, was the modern coffee press in its rudimentary forma metal or cheesecloth screen fitted to a rod that users would press into a pot of hot water and coffee grounds. The coffee press was patented by Milanese designer Attilio Calimani in 1929. It underwent several design modifications through Faliero Bondanini, who patented his own version in 1958 and began manufacturing it in a French clarinet factory called Martin SA under the brand name \\"Melior\\".[2] Its popularity may have been aided in 1965 by its use in the Michael Caine film The Ipcress File. The device was further popularized across Europe by a British company by the name of Household Articles Ltd. and the Danish tableware and kitchenware company Bodum.\\r\\nThe modern French press consists of a narrow cylindrical beaker, usually made of glass or clear plastic, equipped with a metal or plastic lid and plunger that fits tightly in the cylinder and has a fine stainless steel wire or nylon mesh filter.\\r\\nCoffee is brewed by placing coarsely ground coffee in the empty beaker and adding hotbetween 93ÿ96?C (199ÿ205?F)water, in proportions of about 30?g (1.1?oz) of coffee grounds to 500?ml (17?US?fl?oz) of water, more or less to taste. The brewing time is about two to four minutes. Then the mesh plunger or piston is pressed, to separate the grounds and hold them at the bottom of the beaker. The mesh piston normally does not compress the coffee grounds, as most designs leave a generous spaceabout 30?mm (1.2?in)below the piston in its lowest position. If the brewed coffee is allowed to remain in the beaker with the used grounds, the coffee may become astringent and bitter, though this is an effect that some users of the French press consider desirable.\\r\\nA French press works best with coffee of a coarser grind than does a drip brew coffee filter, about the consistency of kosher salt.[3] Finer grounds, when immersed in water, have lower permeability, requiring an excessive amount of force to be applied by hand to lower the plunger and are more likely to seep through or around the perimeter of the press filter and into the coffee.[4] Additionally, finer grounds will tend to over-extract and cause the coffee to taste bitter.[3]\\r\\nIt is believed that the optimum time for brewing the coffee is around four minutes, and some consider the coffee spoiled after about 20 minutes.[5] Other approaches, such as cold-brewing, require several hours of contact between the water and the grounds to achieve the desired extraction.\\r\\nFrench presses are more portable and self-contained than other coffee makers. Travel mug versions exist, which are made of tough plastic instead of the more common glass, and have a sealed lid with a closable drinking hole. Some versions are marketed to hikers and backpackers not wishing to carry a heavy, metal percolator or a filter using drip brew. Other versions include stainless steel, insulated presses designed to keep the coffee hot, similar in design to thermos flasks. One variation uses a \\"pull\\" design: the coffee grounds are placed in a mesh basket, which is then pulled into the lid after brewing, trapping the grounds out of the coffee. Others produce a similar effect by having shutters that can be closed via the top of the press, sealing the grounds off from the coffee entirely. French presses are also sometimes used to make cold brew coffee.\\r\\nIn the same way as coffee, a French press can also be used in place of a tea infuser to brew loose tea. To some extent the tea will continue to steep even after the plunger is depressed, which may cause the tea remaining in the press to become bitter. It might thus be advisable to decant the tea into a serving vessel after preparation. The same French press should not be used for both tea and coffee unless thoroughly cleaned, as coffee residue will spoil the flavour of the tea.\\r\\nHowever, this method is more suitable for light teas and is not suitable for Indian Chai (which requires to be boiled) or Chinese tea (which tends to be diffused for a long time, with tea leaves reused as a rule).[6]\\r\\nA French press can also be used for straining broth from shellfish or other ingredients.[7]","input":"What is the purpose of a french press?"},{"output":"in 1950","context":"The history of video games spans a period of time between the invention of the first electronic games and today, covering a long period of invention and changes. Video gaming would not reach mainstream popularity until the 1970s and 1980s, when arcade video games, gaming consoles and home computer games were introduced to the general public. Since then, video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and a part of modern culture in most parts of the world. The early history of video games, therefore, covers the period of time between the first interactive electronic game with an electronic display in 1947, the first true video games in the early 1950s, and the rise of early arcade video games in the 1970s (Pong and the beginning of the first generation of video game consoles with the Magnavox Odyssey, both in 1972). During this time there were a wide range of devices and inventions corresponding with large advances in computing technology, and the actual first video game is dependent on the definition of \\"video game\\" used.\\r\\nFollowing the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to use an electronic display, the first true video games were created in the early 1950s. Initially created as technology demonstrations, such as the Bertie the Brain and Nimrod computers in 1950 and 1951, video games also became the purview of academic research. A series of games, generally simulating real-world board games, were created at various research institutions to explore programming, humanÿcomputer interaction, and computer algorithms. These include OXO and Christopher Strachey's draughts program in 1952, the first software-based games to incorporate a CRT display, and several chess and checkers programs. Possibly the first video game created simply for entertainment was 1958's Tennis for Two, featuring moving graphics on an oscilloscope. As computing technology improved over time, computers became smaller and faster, and the ability to work on them was opened up to university employees and undergraduate students by the end of the 1950s. These new programmers began to create games for non-academic purposes, leading up to the 1962 release of Spacewar! as one of the earliest known digital computer games to be available outside a single research institute.\\r\\nThroughout the rest of the 1960s, digital computer games were created by increasingly numerous programmers and sometimes sold commercially in catalogs. As the audience for video games expanded to more than a few dozen research institutions with the falling cost of computers, and programming languages that would run on multiple types of computers were created, a wider variety of games began to be developed. Video games transitioned into a new era in the early 1970s with the launch of the commercial video game industry with the display of the coin-operated arcade game Galaxy Game and the release of the first widely available arcade game Computer Space, and then in 1972 with the release of the immensely successful arcade game Pong and the first home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, which launched the first generation of video game consoles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"video game\\" has evolved over the decades from a purely technical definition to a general concept defining a new class of interactive entertainment. Technically, for a product to be a video game, there must be a video signal transmitted to a cathode ray tube (CRT) that creates a rasterized image on a screen.[1] This definition would preclude early computer games that outputted results to a printer or teletype rather than a display, any game rendered on a vector-scan monitor, any game played on a modern high definition display, and most handheld game systems.[1] From a technical standpoint, these would more properly be called \\"electronic games\\" or \\"computer games\\".[2]\\r\\nToday, however, the term \\"video game\\" has completely shed its purely technical definition and encompasses a wider range of technology. While still rather ill-defined, the term \\"video game\\" now generally encompasses any game played on hardware built with electronic logic circuits that incorporates an element of interactivity and outputs the results of the player's actions to a display.[3] Going by this broader definition, the first video games appeared in the early 1950s; they were tied largely to research projects at universities and large corporations, though, and had little influence on each other due to their primary purpose as academic and promotional devices rather than entertainment games.[4]\\r\\nThe ancestors to these games include the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to incorporate a cathode ray tube screen.[5] The player simulates an artillery shell trajectory on a CRT screen connected to an oscilloscope, with a set of knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program.[6] It was patented by Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann in 1947.[7] While the idea behind the game was potentially to use a television set as the display and thus sell the invention to consumers, as Goldsmith and Mann worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories, the patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used and the device never manufactured beyond the original handmade prototypes.[6][8][9] This, along with the lack of electronic logic circuits, keeps the device from being considered the first video game. Around the same time as the device was invented, the earliest known written computer game was developed by Alan Turing and David Champernowne in 1948, a chess simulation called Turochamp, though it was never actually implemented on a computer as the code was too complicated to run on the machines of the time. Turing tested the code in a game in 1952 where he mimicked the operation of the code in a real chess game against an opponent, but was never able to run the program on a computer.[9]\\r\\nThe earliest known[citation needed] publicly demonstrated electronic game was created in 1950. Bertie the Brain was an arcade game of tic-tac-toe, built by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition.[10] To showcase his new miniature vacuum tube, the additron tube, he designed a specialized computer to use it, which he built with the assistance of engineers from Rogers Majestic. The large metal computer, which was four meters tall, could only play tic-tac-toe on a lightbulb-backed display, and was installed in the Engineering Building at the Canadian National Exhibition from August 25 to September 9, 1950.[11][12] The game was a success at the two-week exhibition, with attendees lining up to play it as Kates adjusted the difficulty up and down for players. After the exhibition, Bertie was dismantled, and \\"largely forgotten\\" as a novelty. Kates has said that he was working on so many projects at the same time that he had no energy to spare for preserving it, despite its significance.[11]\\r\\nNearly a year later on May 5, 1951, the Nimrod computercreated by engineering firm and nascent computer developer Ferrantiwas presented at the Festival of Britain, and then showcased for three weeks in October at the Berlin Industrial Show before being dismantled.[9] Using a panel of lights for its display, it was designed exclusively to play the game of Nim; moves were made by players pressing buttons which corresponded with the lights. Nimrod could play either the traditional or \\"reverse\\" form of the game.[4] The machine was twelve feet wide, nine feet deep, and five feet tall.[9] It was based on an earlier Nim-playing machine, \\"Nimatron\\", designed by Edward Condon and built by Westinghouse Electric in 1940 for display at the New York World's Fair.[4] \\"Nimatron\\" had been constructed from electromechanical relays and weighed over a ton.[13] The Nimrod was primarily intended to showcase Ferranti's computer design and programming skills rather than entertain, and was not followed up by any future games.[4] Despite this, most of the onlookers at the Festival of Britain were more interested in playing the game than in the programming and engineering logic behind it.[9]\\r\\nAround this time, non-visual games were being developed at various research computer laboratories; for example, Christopher Strachey developed a simulation of the game draughts, or checkers, for the Pilot ACE that he unsuccessfully attempted to run for the first time in July 1951 at the British National Physical Laboratory and completed in 1952; this is the first known computer game to be created for a general-purpose computer, rather than a machine specifically made for the game like Bertie.[4][14] Strachey's program inspired Arthur Samuel to develop his own checkers game in 1952 for the IBM 701; successive iterations developed rudimentary artificial intelligence by 1955 and a version was shown on television in 1956.[4][9][15] Also in 1951, Dietrich Prinz wrote the first limited program of chess for the University of Manchester's general-purpose Ferranti Mark 1 computer, one of the first commercially available computers. The program was only capable of computing \\"mate-in-two\\" problems as it was not powerful enough to play a full game, and it had no video output.[16] Around the same time in the early 1950s, the RAND Corporation developed a series of combat simulation games of increasing complexity, where the player would enter orders to intercept enemy aircraft, or set up their forces to counter an enemy army invasion.[14] These simulations were not yet true video games, as they required human intervention to interpret the player's orders and the final results; the computer only controlled the paths that the enemies would take.[4]\\r\\nIn 1952, Alexander S. Douglas created OXO, a software program for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of tic-tac-toe. The EDSAC was one of the first stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35G16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer's memory.[9][17] As a part of a thesis on humanÿcomputer interaction, Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game.[18] The player entered input using a rotary telephone controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear on the screen, and then the computer's move would follow.[19] The game was not available to the general public, and was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory, by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be moved.[20] Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded.[9] Around the same time, Strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer, the Manchester Mark 1, culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952, which had a CRT display.[21] Like OXO, the display was mostly static, updating only when a move was made.[22] OXO and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen.[4]\\r\\nThe first known game incorporating graphics that updated in real time, rather than only when the player made a move, was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for a demonstration of the University of Michigan-developed MIDSAC computer at the University of Michigan in 1954. The game, developed over six months by the pair, featured a pool stick controlled by a joystick and a knob, and a full rack of 15 balls on a table seen in an overhead view.[4] The computer calculated the movements of the balls as they collided and moved around the table, disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion.[23] Like previous video games, the pool game was intended primarily to showcase the computing power of the MIDSAC computer.[4]\\r\\nWhile further games like checkers and chess were developed on research computers, the next milestone in video games came in 1958 with Tennis for Two. Perhaps the first game created solely for entertainment rather than as a technology demonstration or a research tool, the program simulated a game of tennis. Created by American physicist William Higinbotham for visitors at the Brookhaven National Laboratory to be more entertaining for visitors on their public day than the usual static exhibits about nuclear power, the game ran on a Donner Model 30 analog computer and displayed a side view of a tennis court on an oscilloscope.[9][24][25] The players controlled the angle of their shots with attached controllers, and the game calculated and simulated the trajectory of the ball, including the possibility of hitting the net.[26] The game was first shown on October 18, 1958. Hundreds of visitors lined up to play the new game during its debut.[26] Due to the game's popularity, an upgraded version was shown the following year, with enhancements including a larger screen and different levels of simulated gravity.[27] Afterwards, having served its purpose, the game was dismantled for its component parts.[9] While the game had no innovations in game design or technological development, its status as an entertainment-focused game, rather than an academic project or technological showpiece, has led it to be considered one of the first \\"real\\" video games as they are generally thought of today.[4]\\r\\nOver the next few years, during 1957ÿ61, various computer games continued to be created in the context of academic computer and programming research, particularly as computer technology improved to include smaller, transistor-based computers on which programs could be created and run in real time, rather than operations run in batches. A few programs, however, while used to showcase the power of the computer they ran on were also intended as entertainment products; these were generally created by undergraduate students, such as at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where they were allowed on occasion to develop programs for the TX-0 experimental computer.[28] These interactive graphical games were created by a community of programmers, many of them students affiliated with the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) led by Alan Kotok, Peter Samson, and Bob Saunders. The games included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze.[29][30] Mouse in the Maze allowed users to use a light pen to set up a maze of walls on the monitor, and spots that represented bits of cheese or glasses of martini. A virtual mouse was then released and would traverse the maze to find the objects.[28] Additionally, the wargame simulations from the early 1950s by the RAND Corporation had expanded into more complicated simulations which required little human intervention, and had also sparked the creation of business management simulation games such as The Management Game, which was used in business schools such as at Carnegie Mellon University by 1958.[4] By 1961, there were over 89 different business simulation games in use, with various graphical capabilities.[31] As the decade ended, despite several video games having been developed, there was no such thing as a commercial video game industry; almost all games had been developed on or as a single machine for specific purposes, and the few simulation games were neither commercial nor for entertainment.[9]\\r\\nBy 1961, MIT had acquired the DEC PDP-1 minicomputer, the successor to the TX-0, which also used a vector display system. The system's comparatively small size and processing speed meant that, like with the TX-0, the university allowed its undergraduate students and employees to write programs for the computer which were not directly academically related whenever it was not in use. In 1961-62, Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen created the game Spacewar! on the PDP-1, inspired by science fiction books such as the Lensman series.[32][33] The game was copied to several of the early minicomputer installations in American academic institutions, making it potentially the first video game to be available outside a single research institute.[34]\\r\\nThe two-player game has the players engaged in a dogfight between two spaceships set against the backdrop of a randomly generated background starfield.[29][33] The game was developed to meet three precepts: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game.[35] The game was a multiplayer game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship. After the game's initial development, members of the TMRC worked to improve the game, adding an accurate starfield and a gravitational body, and spread it to the couple dozen other institutions with a PDP-1, a process which continued over the next few years. As the computer was uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad.[36] Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping, since it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware.[37] Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, many without a monitor, which prohibited Spacewar or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience.[33][36] Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games.[38]\\r\\nAlthough the market for commercial gamesand software in generalwas small, due to the cost of computers limiting their spread to research institutions and large corporations, several were still created by programmers and distributed by the computer manufacturers. A number of games could be found in an April 1962 IBM program catalog. These included board games, \\"BBC Vik The Baseball Demonstrator\\", and \\"Three Dimensional Tic-Tack-Toe\\".[39] Following the spread of Spacewar, further computer games developed by programmers at universities were also developed and distributed over the next few years. These included the Socratic System, a question and answer game designed to teach medical students how to diagnose patients by Wallace Feurzeig in 1962,[40] and a dice game by Edward Steinberger in 1965.[41]\\r\\nThe creation of general programming languages like BASIC, which could be run on different hardware types, allowed for programs to be written for more than one specific computer, in turn letting games written in them to spread to more end players in the programming community than before. These games included a baseball simulation game written in BASIC by John Kemeny in 1965;[42] a BASIC bingo game by Larry Bethurum in 1966;[43] a basketball simulation game written in BASIC by Charles R. Bacheller in May 1967;[44] another baseball game that simulates the 1967 World Series written in BASIC by Jacob Bergmann in August 1967;[45] Space Travel, written by Ken Thompson for a Multics system in 1969 and which led in part to the development of the Unix operating system;[46] and Hamurabi, a text-based FOCAL game written by Doug Dyment in 1968 and converted to BASIC by David H. Ahl in 1969, and one of the first strategy video games ever made. Hamurabi and Space Travel were among several early mainframe games that were written during the time, and spread beyond their initial mainframe computers to general-purpose languages like BASIC.[47]\\r\\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, video games existed almost entirely as novelties passed around by programmers and technicians with access to computers, primarily at research institutions and large companies. The history of video games transitioned into a new era early in the decade, however, with the rise of the commercial video game industry. In 1971, Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck developed a coin-operated computer game, Galaxy Game, at Stanford University using a DEC PDP-11 computer with vector displays.[48] The pair was inspired to make the game by Spacewar; Tuck had remarked in 1966 while playing the game that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was unfeasible in 1966 due to the cost of computers, but in 1969 DEC released the PDP-11 for US$20,000; while this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, the pair felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing.[49] Only prototype units were ever built, though the second prototype was adapted to run up to eight games at once; a few months before the initial installation at Stanford in November 1971, the pair met with Nolan Bushnell, who informed them of his own game he was making for a much lower price.[48][49]\\r\\nThat game was Computer Space, developed by Bushnell and Ted Dabney. They had found the Data General Nova, a US$4,000 computer that they thought would be powerful enough to run four games of Spacewar at once; the computer turned out to not actually be powerful enough for the project. While investigating the concept of replacing some of the computer with purpose-built hardware, however, the pair discovered that making a system explicitly for running such a game, rather than general programs, would be much less expensive: as low as $100.[49][50] By 1971 when Bushnell met with Pitts and Tuck, a prototype version had been successfully displayed for a short time in August 1971 in a local bar, the design was nearly finished, and the pair had founded a company around it called Syzygy.[51] Bushnell had also found a manufacturer for the game, Nutting Associates, who would make the final game cabinets and sell them to distributors. Bushnell felt that Galaxy Game was not a real competitor to Computer Space, due to its high price. Pitts and Tuck believed, however, that despite the economic argument their game was superior, as they felt that Galaxy Game was a true expansion of Spacewar, while Computer Space just a pale imitation.[49] Some players at the time, however, believed Galaxy Game to actually be just a version of Spacewar!.[52] Galaxy Game's prototype installation was very popular, though at a low price-per-game, and the pair developed a second version to display at the same location; they were never able to enter production, though, as they eventually had to abandon the idea after spending US$65,000 developing it due to the high cost and lack of business plan.[49]\\r\\nAround the same time as Galaxy Game's protoype installation, Computer Space was released. It was the first coin-operated video game to be commercially sold (and the first widely available video game of any kind).[53] While it did well in its initial locations near college campuses, it performed very poorly in bars and arcades where pinball and other arcade games were typically placed; while it was commercially successful and made over US$1,000,000, it did not meet the high expectations of Nutting, who had expected to sell more than 1,500 units.[49][51] Bushnell and Dabney immediately started work on another game, using the same television set design as Computer Space, as well as founding their own company Atari, Inc. to back their projects.[53] While initially this game was to be a driving game that Bushnell planned to design, their first employee, Allan Alcorn, took a prototype ping-pong game suggestion of Bushnell's and expanded on it to create a game the company immediately seized on. They were unable to find a manufacturer, but on the evidence of the success of their prototype installation, decided to produce the game cabinets themselves.[49] Pong was released in 1972, a year after Computer Space. It was immensely commercially successful, selling over 8,000 units. It inspired copycat games to be sold in America, Europe, and Japan, and led to the popularization of the medium.[49][53]\\r\\nThat same year saw the release of the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console which could be connected to a television set.[54] The inventor, Ralph H. Baer, had initially had the idea in 1951 to make an interactive game on a television set. Unable to do so with the technological constraints at the time, he began work on a device that would attach to a television set and display games in 1966, and the \\"Brown Box\\", the last prototype of seven, was licensed to Magnavox to adapt and produce. They announced the console in May 1972, and it went on sale that September. The console and its games featured numerous innovations beyond being the first video game device for home consumers: it was the first game to use a raster-scan video display, or television set, directly displayed via modification of a video signal; it was also the first video gaming device to be displayed in a television commercial.[55] It sold for US$100 and shipped with several games, including \\"Table tennis\\", which Bushnell had seen a demo of and which Pong had been based on.[49] The Odyssey sold over 100,000 units in 1972, and more than 350,000 by the end of 1975, buoyed by the popularity of the table tennis game, in turn driven by the success of Pong.[49][56] Pong and the Odyssey kicked off a new era of video gaming, with numerous other competitors starting up in the video game industry as it grew in popularity.[49]","input":"When was the first video game released to the public?"},{"output":"the Baptist Missionary Society","context":"Samachar Darpan (Bengali: ?????? ?????) was a Bengali weekly newspaper published by the Baptist Missionary Society and published on 23 May 1818 from the Baptist Mission Press at Serampore in the first half of the 19th century. It is considered to be the first Indian-language newspaper, although some historians contend that the Bengali weekly Bengal Gazetti or Vangal Gazette published by Ganga Kishore Bhattacharya had begun publication earlier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe success of the Bengali monthly Digdarshan encouraged the missionaries of the Baptist Missionary Society to embark on a new venture - the publication of a Bengali newspaper. The initiative was taken by Joshua Marshman and William Ward. At about the same time Harachandra Roy was also planning to start a Bengali newspaper from his own printing press at Chorebagan Street in Calcutta. But before he could bring out his publication, the missionaries published the first issue of Samachar Darpan from the Baptist Mission Press in Serampore on May 23, 1818.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newspaper was published every Saturday and was edited by John Clark Marshman. Its price was 4 annas per copy. It contained news, both Indian and European, collected from various sources, particular from English newspapers. It also contained brief articles on various subjects. It carried some material of educational value which made it respected and popular among the educated people. Both in typography and contents the Samachar Darpan maintained a fairly good standard. Its coverage of local news was certainly better than any other English or Indian language newspaper. By reprinting news and comments from other Bengali newspapers, the Samachar Darpan enabled its readers to have acquaintance with the different sections of the Bengali opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe paper covered seven main beats: news of the government officials, government circulars, news of the European countries other than Britain, new events, birth, obituary and wedding, news of England, history of India and its scholarly books. It published useful information on the appointment of judges, collectors and so on.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom July 1829, the newspaper began to appear in both Bengali and English; the Bengali and English sections represented translation of each other. From January 1832, the Samachar Darpan began to be published twice a week - on Wednesday and Saturday. The price was raised from a rupee per month to one and a half. However, as a result of the hike in postage duty, the twice a week publication was discontinued and it again became a weekly newspaper from 8 November 1834.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1841, the missionaries decided to discontinue the publication that ended with the last issue of December. The official reason stated was that John Clark Marshman who was still the editor of the newspaper couldn't find sufficient time owing to other pre-occupations. But the actual reason was that the Samachar Darpan, though very successful as a newspaper, had failed miserably in its primary objective - propagation of Christianity.\\r\\nSamachar Darpan had an uninterrupted career till the end of 1841, when the publication was discontinued. By 1836, the circulation had reached 400, which was much higher than any other Indian language publication.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Clark Marshman, was the official editor and the editorial staff included some of the most distinguished Bengali Hindu pundits of the time. Marshman's control over the newspaper was only nominal and he had to depend much on his editorial board. Once when the pundits took an extended leave during the Puja, Marshman had to postpone the publications as well and he apologized to the subscribers for the delay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government showed a favourable attitude towards the publication, because the primary objective of the publication was the propagation of Christianity. The Government warned the missionaries that, \\"extra-ordinary precautions must be used not to give the natives cause for suspicion that the paper had been devised as an engine for undermining their religious opinions.\\" The newspaper was allowed to be circulated through the post office at one-fourth of the usual charge. The general tone of the newspaper was moderate as compared to other missionary publications. It had to be so if the newspaper was to gain some patronage from the public.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government appreciated the usefulness of the newspaper as a medium of communication with the literate public.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning, the Hindus were not friendly towards the Darpan. But as time passed their attitude changed towards the paper. Reformist and liberal Hindus, generally found in the Samachar Darpan a valuable ally because of its strong support in favour of social reform and education.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut conflict arose when Ram Mohan Roy wrote a book under the title The Precept of Jesus: The Guide To Peace And Happiness where he refuted the supernaturalism of Jesus but admired his moral teachings. The missionaries not content with vindicating the excellence of their own doctrines, attacked all the Hindu shastras as unreasonable, and also abused the Hindus in very offensive terms in Darpan dated 14 July 1821.[2] Doubts were expressed concerning Vedantic teaching about Maya; the teaching of Nyaya Shastra about God and creation; the dualism of Samkhya system; and the interpretation of sacrificial rites in the Mimamsa Shastra.[3] An outraged Ram Mohan Roy, responded to the article in a forceful letter, only to find that his missive was completely ignored by the editor. Spurred by indignation and eager to counterbalance the Christian missionary propaganda Roy started his own Brahminical Magazine where he eventually published the letter.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1826, the Government requested the missionaries to bring out a Persian edition of Samachar Darpan to provide better communication with the people of Upper India, which did not yet have any Indian-language newspaper. Accordingly, the Persian version called Akhbar-i-Serampur was published on 6 May 1826. The Government subsidized this newspaper with a monthly grant of 160 rupees. But after two years the publication was discontinued to lack of sufficient patronage.","input":"The first weekly bengali newspaper samachar darpan was published by?"},{"output":"Chicago","context":"The World's Columbian Exposition (the official shortened name for the World's Fair: Columbian Exposition,[1] also known as the Chicago World's Fair and Chicago Columbian Exposition) was a world's fair held in Chicago in 1893 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World in 1492.[2] The centerpiece of the Fair, the large water pool, represented the long voyage Columbus took to the New World. Chicago bested New York City; Washington, D.C.; and St. Louis for the honor of hosting the fair. The Exposition was an influential social and cultural event and had a profound effect on architecture, sanitation, the arts, Chicago's self-image,  and American industrial optimism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe layout of the Chicago Columbian Exposition was, in large part, designed by John Wellborn Root, Daniel Burnham, Frederick Law Olmsted and Charles B.

It was designed to follow Beaux Arts principles of design, namely French neoclassical architecture principles based on symmetry, balance, and splendor. The color of the material generally used to cover the buildings facades gave the fairgrounds its nickname, the White City.  Many prominent architects designed its 14 \\"great buildings\\". Artists and musicians were featured in exhibits and many also made depictions and works of art inspired by the exposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exposition covered 690 acres (2.8?km2), featuring nearly 200 new (but deliberately temporary) buildings of predominantly neoclassical architecture, canals and lagoons, and people and cultures from 46 countries.[2] More than 27 million people attended the exposition during its six-month run.  Its scale and grandeur far exceeded the other world's fairs, and it became a symbol of the emerging American Exceptionalism, much in the same way that the Great Exhibition became a symbol of the Victorian era United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nDedication ceremonies for the fair were held on October 21, 1892, but the fairgrounds were not actually opened to the public until May 1, 1893. The fair continued until October 30, 1893.  In addition to recognizing the 400th anniversary of the discovery of the New World by Europeans, the fair also served to show the world that Chicago had risen from the ashes of the Great Chicago Fire, which had destroyed much of the city in 1871.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 9, 1893, the day designated as Chicago Day, the fair set a world record for outdoor event attendance, drawing 751,026 people. The debt for the fair was soon paid off with a check for $1.5 million (equivalent to $40.9?million in 2017).[5] Chicago has commemorated the fair with one of the stars on its municipal flag.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany prominent civic, professional, and commercial leaders from around the United States participated in the financing, coordination, and management of the Fair, including Chicago shoe company owner Charles H. Schwab,[7] Chicago railroad and manufacturing magnate John Whitfield Bunn, and Connecticut banking, insurance, and iron products magnate Milo Barnum Richardson, among many others.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair was planned in the early 1890s during the Gilded Age of rapid industrial growth, immigration, and class tension. World's fairs, such as London's 1851 Crystal Palace Exhibition, had been successful in Europe as a way to bring together societies fragmented along class lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first American attempt at a world's fair in Philadelphia in 1876, drew crowds but was a financial failure. Nonetheless, ideas about distinguishing the 400th anniversary of Columbus' landing started in the late 1880s. Civic leaders in St. Louis, New York City, Washington DC and Chicago expressed an interest in hosting a fair to generate profits, boost real estate values, and promote their cities. Congress was called on to decide the location. New York's financiers J. P. Morgan, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and William Waldorf Astor, among others, pledged $15 million to finance the fair if Congress awarded it to New York, while Chicagoans Charles T. Yerkes, Marshall Field, Philip Armour, Gustavus Swift, and Cyrus McCormick, offered to finance a Chicago fair. What finally persuaded Congress was Chicago banker Lyman Gage, who raised several million additional dollars in a 24-hour period, over and above New York's final offer.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nChicago representatives not only fought for the world's fair on monetary reasons, but also on practicality reasons. On a Senate hearing held in January 1890, representative Thomas B. Bryan argued that the most important qualities for a world's fair were 'abundant supplies of good air and pure water,...ample space, accommodations and transportation for all exhibits and visitors...\\" He argued that New York had too many obstructions, and Chicago would be able to use large amounts of land around the city where there was \\"not a house to buy and not a rock to blast..\\" and that it would be so located that \\"the artisan and the farmer and the shopkeeper and the man of humble means\\" would be able to easily access the fair. Bryan continued to say that the fair was of 'vital interest' to the West, and that the West wanted the location to be Chicago. The city spokesmen would continue to stress the essentials of a successful Exposition and that only Chicago was fitted to fill these exposition requirements.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exposition corporation and national exposition commission settled on Jackson Park and an area around it as the fair site. Daniel H. Burnham was selected as director of works, and George R. Davis as director-general. Burnham emphasized architecture and sculpture as central to the fair and assembled the period's top talent to design the buildings and grounds including Frederick Law Olmsted for the grounds.[2] The temporary buildings were designed in an ornate Neoclassical style and painted white, resulting in the fair site being referred to as the White City.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Exposition's offices set up shop in the upper floors of the Rand McNally Building on Adams Street, the world's first all-steel-framed skyscraper. Davis's team organized the exhibits with the help of G. Brown Goode of the Smithsonian. The Midway was inspired by the 1889 Paris Universal Exposition, which included ethnological \\"villages\\".[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nCivil rights leaders protested the refusal to include an African American exhibit. Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells, Irvine Garland Penn, and Ferdinand Lee Barnet coauthored a pamphlet entitled \\"The Reason Why the Colored American is not in the World's Columbian Exposition - The Afro-American's Contribution to Columbian Literature\\" addressing the issue. The exhibition included a number of exhibits put on by black individuals and approved by white organizers of the fair, including exhibits by the sculptor Edmonia Lewis, a painting exhibit by scientist George Washington Carver, and a statistical exhibit by John Imogen Howard. It also included blacks in white exhibits, such as Nancy Green's portrayal of the character, \\"Aunt Jemima\\" for the R. T. Davis Milling Company.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair opened in May and ran through October 30, 1893.  Forty-six nations participated in the fair (it was the first world's fair to have national pavilions),[13] constructing exhibits and pavilions and naming national \\"delegates\\" (for example, Haiti selected Frederick Douglass to be its delegate).[14] The Exposition drew nearly 26 million visitors. The fair was originally meant to be closed on Sundays, but the Chicago Woman's Club petitioned that it stay open.[15][16] The club felt that if the exposition was closed on Sunday, it would restrict those who could not take off work during the work-week from seeing it.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exposition was located in Jackson Park and on the Midway Plaisance on 630 acres (2.5?km2) in the neighborhoods of South Shore, Jackson Park Highlands, Hyde Park and Woodlawn. Charles H. Wacker was the Director of the Fair. The layout of the fairgrounds was created by Frederick Law Olmsted, and the Beaux-Arts architecture of the buildings was under the direction of Daniel Burnham, Director of Works for the fair. Renowned local architect Henry Ives Cobb designed several buildings for the exposition. The Director of the American Academy in Rome, Francis Davis Millet, directed the painted mural decorations. Indeed, it was a coming-of-age for the arts and architecture of the \\"American Renaissance\\", and it showcased the burgeoning neoclassical and Beaux-Arts styles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World's Columbian Exposition was the first world's fair with an area for amusements that was strictly separated from the exhibition halls.  This area, developed by a young music promoter, Sol Bloom, concentrated on Midway Plaisance and introduced the term \\"midway\\" to American English to describe the area of a carnival or fair where sideshows are located.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt included carnival rides, among them the original Ferris Wheel, built by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr.[2] This wheel was 264 feet (80?m) high and had 36 cars, each of which could accommodate 40 people.[2][19]  The importance of the Columbian Exposition is highlighted by the use of rueda de Chicago (\\"Chicago wheel\\") in many Latin American countries such as Costa Rica and Chile in reference to the Ferris wheel.[citation needed] One attendee, George C. Tilyou, later credited the sights he saw on the Chicago midway for inspiring him to create America's first major amusement park, Steeplechase Park in Coney Island, New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair included life-size reproductions of Christopher Columbus' three ships, the Ni?a (real name Santa Clara), the Pinta, and the Santa Maria. These were intended to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of the Americas.  The ships, a joint project of the governments of Spain and the United States, were constructed in Spain and then sailed to America for the exposition.  The ships were a very popular exhibit.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nEadweard Muybridge gave a series of lectures on the Science of Animal Locomotion in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose on Midway Plaisance. He used his zoopraxiscope to show his moving pictures to a paying public. The hall was the first commercial movie theater.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Street in Cairo\\" included the popular dancer known as Little Egypt.[22] She introduced America to the suggestive version of the belly dance known as the \\"hootchy-kootchy\\", to a tune said to have been improvised by Sol Bloom (and now more commonly associated with snake charmers) which he had composed when his dancers had no music to dance to.[23][24] Bloom did not copyright the song, putting it immediately in the public domain.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso included was the first moving walkway or travelator. It had two different divisions: one where passengers were seated, and one where riders could stand or walk. It ran in a loop down the length of a lakefront pier to a casino.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough denied a spot at the fair, Buffalo Bill Cody decided to come to Chicago anyway, setting up his Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show just outside the edge of the exposition. Nearby, historian Frederick Jackson Turner gave academic lectures reflecting on the end of the frontier which Buffalo Bill represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe electrotachyscope of Ottomar Anschtz was demonstrated, which used a Geissler tube to project the illusion of moving images.\\r\\nLouis Comfort Tiffany made his reputation with a stunning chapel designed and built for the Exposition. This chapel has been carefully reconstructed and restored.  It can be seen in at the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art.\\r\\n\\r\\nArchitect Kirtland Cutter's Idaho Building, a rustic log construction, was a popular favorite,[25] visited by an estimated 18 million people.[26] The building's design and interior furnishings were a major precursor of the Arts and Crafts movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the other attractions at the fair, several products that are well known today were introduced. These products included Juicy Fruit Gum, Cream of Wheat, and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, among many others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an Anthropology Building at the World's Fair. Nearby, \\"The Cliff Dwellers\\"  featured a rock and timber structure that was painted to recreate Battle Rock Mountain in Colorado, a stylized recreation of American Indian cliff dwelling with pottery, weapons and other relics on display.[27] There was also an Eskimo display. There were also birch bark wigwams of the Penobscot tribe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe John Bull locomotive was displayed. It was only 62 years old, having been built in 1831. It was the first locomotive acquisition by the Smithsonian Institution. The locomotive ran under its own power from Washington, DC, to Chicago to participate, and returned to Washington under its own power again when the exposition closed. In 1981 it was the oldest surviving operable steam locomotive in the world when it ran under its own power again.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Baldwin 2-4-2 locomotive was showcased at the exposition, and subsequently the 2-4-2 type was known as the Columbia\\r\\n\\r\\nAn original frog switch and portion of the superstructure of the famous 1826 Granite Railway in Massachusetts could be viewed. This was the first commercial railroad in the United States to evolve into a common carrier without an intervening closure. The railway brought granite stones from a rock quarry in Quincy, Massachusetts, so that the Bunker Hill Monument could be erected in Boston. The frog switch is now on public view in East Milton Square, Massachusetts, on the original right-of-way of the Granite Railway.\\r\\n\\r\\nForty-six countries had pavilions at the exposition.[2] Norway participated by sending the Viking, a replica of the Gokstad ship.  It was built in Norway and sailed across the Atlantic by 12 men, led by Captain Magnus Andersen. In 1919 this ship was moved to Lincoln Park. It was relocated in 1996 to Good Templar Park in Geneva, Illinois, where it awaits renovation.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnited States states also had their own pavilions.[2] The work of noted feminist author Kate McPhelim Cleary was featured during the opening of the Nebraska Day ceremonies at the fair, which included a reading of her poem \\"Nebraska\\".[30] Four United States territories also had pavilions: Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Utah.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nVisitors to the Louisiana Pavilion were each given a seedling of a cypress tree.  This resulted in the spread of cypress trees to areas where they were not native.  Cypress trees from those seedlings can be found in many areas of West Virginia, where they flourish in the climate.[31] The Illinois was a detailed, full-scale mockup of an Indiana-class battleship, constructed as a naval exhibit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German firm Krupp had a pavilion of artillery, which apparently had cost one million dollars to stage,[32] including a coastal gun of 42?cm in bore (16.54?inches) and a length of 33 calibres (45.93 feet, 14 meters). A breech-loaded gun, it weighed 120.46 long tons (122.4 metric tons). According to the company's marketing: \\"It carried a charge projectile weighing from 2,200 to 2,500 pounds which, when driven by 900 pounds of brown powder, was claimed to be able to penetrate at 2,200 yards a wrought iron plate three feet thick if placed at right angles.\\"[33] Nicknamed \\"The Thunderer\\", the gun had an advertised range of 15 miles; on this occasion John Schofield declared Krupps' guns \\"the greatest peacemakers in the world\\".[32] This gun was later seen as a precursor of the company's World War I Dicke Berta howitzers.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1893 Parliament of the Worlds Religions, which ran from September 11 to September 27, marked the first formal gathering of representatives of Eastern and Western spiritual traditions from around the world. According to Eric J. Sharpe, Tomoko Masuzawa, and others, the event was considered radical at the time, since it allowed non-Christian faiths to speak on their own behalf; it was not taken seriously by European scholars until the 1960s.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the banks of the lake, patrons on the way to the casino were taken on a moving walkway, the first of its kind open to the public,[36] called The Great Wharf, Moving Sidewalk, it allowed people to walk along or ride in seats.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nHorticultural exhibits at the Horticultural Hall included cacti and orchids as well as other plants in a greenhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the buildings of the fair were designed in the neoclassical architecture style. The area at the Court of Honor was known as The White City. Facades were made not of stone, but of a mixture of plaster, cement, and jute fiber called staff, which was painted white, giving the buildings their \\"gleam\\".  Architecture critics derided the structures as \\"decorated sheds\\". The buildings were clad in white stucco, which, in comparison to the tenements of Chicago, seemed illuminated. It was also called the White City because of the extensive use of street lights, which made the boulevards and buildings usable at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1892, working under extremely tight deadlines to complete construction, director of works Daniel Burnham appointed Francis Davis Millet to replace the fair's official director of color, William Pretyman. Pretyman had resigned following a dispute with Burnham. After experimenting, Millet settled on a mix of oil and white lead whitewash that could be applied using compressed air spray painting to the buildings, taking considerably less time than traditional brush painting.[37] Joseph Binks, maintenance supervisor at Chicago's Marshall Field's Wholesale Store, who had been using this method to apply whitewash to the subbasement walls of the store, got the job to paint the Exposition buildings.[38][39] Claims this was the first use of spray painting may be apocryphal since journals from that time note this form of painting had already been in use in the railroad industry from the early 1880s.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the buildings included sculptural details and, to meet the Exposition's opening deadline, chief architect Burnham sought the help of Chicago Art Institute instructor Lorado Taft to help complete them. Taft's efforts included employed a group of talented women sculptors from the Institute known as \\"the White Rabbits\\" to finish some of the buildings, getting their name from Burnham's comment \\"Hire anyone, even white rabbits if they'll do the work.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe White City is largely credited for ushering in the City Beautiful movement and planting the seeds of modern city planning.  The highly integrated design of the landscapes, promenades, and structures provided a vision of what is possible when planners, landscape architects, and architects work together on a comprehensive design scheme.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe White City inspired cities to focus on the beautification of the components of the city in which municipal government had control; streets, municipal art, public buildings and public spaces.  The designs of the City Beautiful Movement (closely tied with the municipal art movement) are identifiable by their classical architecture, plan symmetry, picturesque views, axial plans, as well as their magnificent scale.  Where the municipal art movement focused on beautifying one feature in a city, the City Beautiful movement began to make improvements on the scale of the district.  The White City of the World's Columbian Exposition inspired the Merchants Club of Chicago to commission Daniel Burnham to create the Plan of Chicago in 1909, which became the first modern comprehensive city plan in America.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were fourteen main \\"great buildings\\"[42] centered around a giant reflective pool called the Grand Basin.[43] Buildings included:\\r\\n\\r\\nLouis Sullivan's polychrome proto-Modern Transportation Building was an outstanding exception to the prevailing style, as he tried to develop an organic American form. Years later, in 1922, he wrote that the classical style of the White City had set back modern American architecture by forty years.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs detailed in Erik Larson's popular history The Devil in the White City, extraordinary effort was required to accomplish the exposition, and much of it was unfinished on opening day. The famous Ferris Wheel, which proved to be a major attendance draw and helped save the fair from bankruptcy, was not finished until June, because of waffling by the board of directors the previous year on whether to build it. Frequent debates and disagreements among the developers of the fair added many delays. The spurning of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show proved a serious financial mistake.  Buffalo Bill set up his highly popular show next door to the fair and brought in a great deal of revenue that he did not have to share with the developers. Nonetheless, construction and operation of the fair proved to be a windfall for Chicago workers during the serious economic recession that was sweeping the country.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost all of the fair's structures were designed to be temporary; of the more than 200 buildings erected for the fair, the only two which still stand in place are the Palace of Fine Arts and the World's Congress Auxiliary Building. From the time the fair closed until 1920, the Palace of Fine Arts housed the Field Columbian Museum (now the Field Museum of Natural History, since relocated); in 1933 (having been completely rebuilt in permanent materials), the Palace building re-opened as the Museum of Science and Industry.[46]  The second building, the World's Congress Building, was one of the few buildings not built in Jackson Park, instead it was built downtown in Grant Park. The cost of construction of the World's Congress Building was shared with the Art Institute of Chicago, which, as planned, moved into the building (the museum's current home) after the close of the fair.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree other significant buildings survived the fair. The first is the Norway Building, a recreation of a traditional wooden stave church. After the Fair it was relocated to Lake Geneva, and in 1935 was moved to a museum called Little Norway in Blue Mounds, Wisconsin. In 2015 it was dismantled and shipped back to Norway, where it was restored and reassembled.[47] The second is the Maine State Building, designed by Charles Sumner Frost, which was purchased by the Ricker family of Poland Spring, Maine. They moved the building to their resort to serve as a library and art gallery. The Poland Spring Preservation Society now owns the building, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The third is the Dutch House, which was moved to Brookline, Massachusetts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1893 Viking ship that was sailed to the Exposition from Norway by Captain Magnus Andersen, is located in Geneva, Illinois. The ship is open to visitors on scheduled days April through October.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main altar at St. John Cantius in Chicago, as well as its matching two side altars, are reputed to be from the Columbian Exposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince many of the other buildings at the fair were intended to be temporary, they were removed after the fair. The White City so impressed visitors (at least before air pollution began to darken the fa?ades) that plans were considered to refinish the exteriors in marble or some other material. These plans were abandoned in July 1894, when much of the fair grounds was destroyed in a fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nHelen Keller, along with her mentor Anne Sullivan and Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, visited the fair in summer of 1893. Keller described the fair in her autobiography The Story of My Life.\\r\\n[49] Early in July, a Wellesley College English teacher named Katharine Lee Bates visited the fair. The White City later inspired the reference to \\"alabaster cities\\" in her poem \\"America the Beautiful\\".[50] The exposition was extensively reported by Chicago publisher William D. Boyce's reporters and artists.[51] There is a very detailed and vivid description of all facets of this fair by the Persian traveler Mirza Mohammad Ali Mo'in ol-Saltaneh written in Persian. He departed from Persia on April 20, 1892, especially for the purpose of visiting the World's Columbian Exposition.[52] Pierre de Coubertin visited the fair with his friends Paul Bourget and Samuel Jean de Pozzi. He devotes the first chapter of his book \\" Souvenirs d'Amrique et de Grce \\" (1897) to the visit. Swami Vivekananda visited the fair to attend the Parliament of the World's Religions and delivered his famous speech \\"Sisters and Brothers of America!\\".[53] Kubota Beisen was an official delegate of Japan. As an artist, he sketched hundreds of scenes, some of which were later used to make woodblock print books about the Exhibition.[54] Serial Killer Herman Mudgett (H. H. Holmes) attended the fair with two of his victims, Annie and Minnie Williams.\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples of exposition souvenirs can be found in various American museum collections.  One example, copyrighted in 1892 by John W. Green, is a folding hand fan with detailed illustrations of landscapes and architecture.[55] Charles W Goldsmith produced a set of ten postcard designs, each in full colour, showing the buildings constructed for the exhibition.[56] Columbian Exposition coins were also minted for the event.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair ended with the city in shock, as popular mayor Carter Harrison, Sr. was assassinated by Patrick Eugene Prendergast two days before the fair's closing.  Closing ceremonies were canceled in favor of a public memorial service.\\r\\n\\r\\nJackson Park was returned to its status as a public park, in much better shape than its original swampy form. The lagoon was reshaped to give it a more natural appearance, except for the straight-line northern end where it still laps up against the steps on the south side of the Palace of Fine Arts/Museum of Science & Industry building. The Midway Plaisance, a park-like boulevard which extends west from Jackson Park, once formed the southern boundary of the University of Chicago, which was being built as the fair was closing (the university has since developed south of the Midway). The university's football team, the Maroons, were the original \\"Monsters of the Midway\\". The exposition is mentioned in the university's alma mater: \\"The City White hath fled the earth,/But where the azure waters lie,/A nobler city hath its birth,/The City Gray that ne'er shall die.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effort to power the Fair with electricity, which became a demonstration piece for Westinghouse Electric and the alternating current system they had been developing for many years, took place at the end of what has been called the War of the currents between DC and AC.[57] Westinghouse initially did not put in a bid to power the Fair but agreed to be the contractor for a local Chicago company that put in a low bid of US$510,000 to supply an alternating current based system.[58] Edison General Electric, which at the time was merging with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric, put in a US$1,720,000 bid to power the Fair and its planned 93,000 incandescent lamps with direct current. After the Fair committee went over both proposals, Edison General Electric re-bid their costs at $554,000 but Westinghouse under bid them by 70 cents per lamp to get the contract.[58][59] Westinghouse could not use the Edison incandescent lamp since the patent belonged to General Electric and they had successfully sued to stop use of all patent infringing designs. Since Edison specified a sealed globe of glass in his design Westinghouse found a way to sidestep the Edison patent by quickly developing a lamp with a ground glass stopper in one end, based on a Sawyer-Man \\"stopper\\" lamp patent they already had. The lamps worked well but were short lived, requiring a small army of workmen to constantly replace them.[60] Westinghouse Electric had severely underbid the contract and struggled to supply all the equipment specified including twelve 1,000 horsepower single phase AC generators and all the lighting and other equipment required.[61] They also had to fend off a last minute lawsuit by General Electric claiming the Westinghouse Sawyer-Man based stopper lamp infringed on the Edison incandescent lamp patent.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Exposition held an Electricity Building which was devoted to electrical exhibits. A statue of Benjamin Franklin was displayed at the entrance. The exposition featured interior and exterior light and displays as well as displays of Thomas Edison's kinetoscope, search lights, a seismograph, electric incubators for chicken eggs,[63] and Morse code telegraph.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the exhibits were from commercial enterprises. Participants included General Electric, Brush, Western Electric, and Westinghouse. The Westinghouse Company displayed several polyphase systems. The exhibits included a switchboard, polyphase generators, step-up transformers, transmission line, step-down transformers, commercial size induction motors and synchronous motors, and rotary direct current converters (including an operational railway motor). The working scaled system allowed the public a view of a system of polyphase power which could be transmitted over long distances, and be utilized, including the supply of direct current. Meters and other auxiliary devices were also present.\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of the space occupied by the Westinghouse Company was devoted to demonstrations of electrical devices developed by Nikola Tesla[65] including a two-phase induction motor, and generators to power the system.[66] Tesla demonstrated a series of electrical effects, some which were in previous lectures performed in America and Europe.[67] These included his \\"Egg of Columbus\\", a metal egg that spun on a disk in a demonstraton of an electric motors rotating magnetic field, and a high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current demonstration where a near by coil lit a wireless gas-discharge lamp held in his hand.[68][67]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso at the Fair, the Chicago Athletic Association Football team played one of the very first night football games against West Point (the earliest being on September 28, 1892 between Mansfield State Normal and Wyoming Seminary). Chicago won the game 14-0. The game lasted only 40 minutes, compared to the normal 90 minutes.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were many other black artists at the fair, ranging from minstrel and early ragtime groups to more formal classical ensembles to street buskers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe women artists at the Woman's Building included Anna Lownes,[86]\\r\\nViennese painter Rosa Schweninger, and many others.[87] American composer Amy Cheney Beach was commissioned by the Board of Lady Managers of the fair to compose a choral work (Festival Jubilate, op. 17) for the opening of the Woman's Building.[77] Women inventions, such as the Mrs Potts sad-iron system was on display.[88] Ami Mali Hicks' stencil design was selected to adorn the frieze in the assembly room of the Women's Building.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Woman's Building included a Woman's Building Library Exhibit, which had seven thousand books-all by women. The Woman's Building Library was meant to show the cumulative contribution of the world's women to literature.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fisheries Building at the Exposition\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exposition was one influence leading to the rise of the City Beautiful movement.[100] Results included grand buildings and fountains built around Olmstedian parks, shallow pools of water on axis to central buildings, larger park systems, broad boulevards and parkways and, after the start of the 20th century, zoning laws and planned suburbs.  Examples of the City Beautiful movement's works include the City of Chicago, the Columbia University campus, and the National Mall in Washington D.C.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the fair closed, J.C. Rogers, a banker from Wamego, Kansas, purchased several pieces of art that had hung in the rotunda of the U.S. Government Building.  He also purchased architectural elements, artifacts and buildings from the fair.  He shipped his purchases to Wamego.  Many of the items, including the artwork, were used to decorate his theater, now known as the Columbian Theatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nMemorabilia saved by visitors can still be purchased. Numerous books, tokens, published photographs, and well-printed admission tickets can be found.  While the higher value commemorative stamps are expensive, the lower ones are quite common.  So too are the commemorative half dollars, many of which went into circulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough not available for purchase, The George Washington University maintains a small collection of exposition tickets for viewing and research purposes.  The collection is currently cared for by GWU's Special Collections Research Center, located in the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the exposition ended the Ferris Wheel was moved to Chicago's north side, next to an exclusive neighborhood. An unsuccessful Circuit Court action was filed against the owners of the wheel to have it moved. The wheel stayed there until it was moved to St. Louis for the 1904 World's Fair.[51]\\r\\nThe Columbian Exposition has celebrated many anniversaries since the fair in 1893. The Chicago Historical Society held an exhibition to commemorate the fair. The Grand Illusions exhibition was centered around the idea that the Columbian Exposition was made up of a series of illusions. The commemorative exhibition contained partial reconstructions, a video detailing the fair, and a catalogue similar to the one sold at the World's Fair of 1893.[102]","input":"Where was the 1893 world's fair held?"},{"output":"4468 Mallard","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon and North Eastern Railway locomotive numbered 4468 Mallard is a  Class A4 4-6-2 Pacific steam locomotive built at Doncaster, England in 1938. It is historically significant as the holder of the world speed record for steam locomotives at 126?mph (203?km/h).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A4 class was designed by Sir Nigel Gresley to power high-speed streamlined trains. The wind-tunnel-tested,[2] aerodynamic body and high power allowed the class to reach speeds of over 100 miles per hour (160?km/h), although in everyday service it rarely attained this speed. While in British Railways days regular steam-hauled rail services in the UK were officially limited to a 90?mph 'line speed', pre-war, the A4s had to run significantly above 90?mph just to keep schedule on trains such as the Silver Jubilee and Coronation,[3] with the engines reaching 100?mph on many occasions.[4][5] Mallard covered almost one and a half million miles (2.4 million km) before it was retired in 1963.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe locomotive is 70?ft (21?m) long and weighs 165 tons, including the tender.

The record was achieved on 3 July 1938 on the slight downward grade of Stoke Bank south of Grantham on the East Coast Main Line, and the highest speed was recorded at milepost 90?, between Little Bytham and Essendine. It broke the German (DRG Class 05) 002's 1936 record of 124.5?mph (200.4?km/h). The record attempt was carried out during the trials of a new quick-acting brake (the Westinghouse \\"QSA\\" brake).\\r\\n\\r\\nMallard was a very good vehicle for such an endeavour. The A4 class was designed for sustained 100+?mph (160+?km/h) running, and Mallard was one of a few of the class that were built with a double chimney and double Kylchap blastpipe, which made for improved draughting and better exhaust flow at speed. (The remainder of the class were retro-fitted in the late 1950s.) The A4's three-cylinder design made for stability at speed, and the large 6?ft 8?in (2.03?m) driving wheels meant that the maximum revolutions per minute was within the capabilities of the technology of the day. Mallard was four months old, meaning that it was sufficiently broken in to run freely, but not overly worn.  Selected to crew the locomotive on its record attempt were driver Joseph Duddington (a man renowned within the LNER for taking calculated risks) and fireman Thomas Bray.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the words of Rob Gwynne, assistant curator of rail vehicles at the National Railway Museum:\\r\\n\\r\\nDuddington, then aged 61, climbed into the cab, turned his cap around (as had George Formby in the contemporary film No Limit), and drove Mallard into the history books. He had 27 years on the footplate, and had once driven the Scarborough Flyer for 144 miles at over 74 mph (average speed), considered at the time to be the highest speed ever maintained by steam in the UK.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A4 class had previously had problems with the big end bearing for the middle cylinder, so the big end was fitted with a \\"stink bomb\\" of aniseed oil which would be released if the bearing overheated. Shortly after attaining the record speed, the middle big end did overheat and Mallard had to limp onwards to Peterborough.[7] It then travelled to Doncaster for repair. This had been foreseen by the publicity department, who had many pictures taken for the press, in case Mallard did not make it back to Kings Cross. The (Edwardian period) Ivatt Atlantic that replaced Mallard at Peterborough was only just in sight when the head of publicity started handing out the pictures.\\r\\n\\r\\nStoke Bank has a gradient of between 1:178 and 1:200. Mallard, pulling a dynamometer car and six coaches, topped Stoke Summit at 75?mph (121?km/h) and accelerated downhill. The speeds at the end of each mile (1.6?km) from the summit were recorded as: 87?, 96?, 104, 107, 111?, 116 and 119?mph (141, 155, 167, 172, 179, 187 and 192?km/h); half-mile (800 m) readings after that gave 120?, 122?, 123, 124? and finally 125?mph (194, 197, 198, 200 and 201?km/h).  The speed recorded by instruments in the dynamometer car reached a momentary maximum of 126?mph (203?km/h).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn arrival at King's Cross (just after the run), driver Joe Duddington and Inspector Sid Jenkins were quoted as saying that they thought a speed of 130?mph would have been possible if the train had not had to slow for the junctions at Essendine. In addition, at the time of the run there was a permanent way restriction to 15?mph just north of Grantham which slowed the train as they sought to build up maximum speed before reaching the high-speed downhill section just beyond Stoke tunnel.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 July 2013, Mallard celebrated 75 years since achieving the world speed record, and to help commemorate this date all six surviving Class A4 locomotives were brought together around the turntable in the Great Hall of the National Railway Museum at York for a two-week 'great gathering'. The visitors include three UK-based, privately owned engines in 4464 Bittern, 60007 Sir Nigel Gresley and 60009 Union of South Africa (formerly Osprey). Mallard's two internationally based sisters, 60008 Dwight D. Eisenhower and 60010 Dominion of Canada, were present after completing extensive transatlantic journeys, and undergoing cosmetic restoration at the NRM's workshops.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nMallard's world record has never been officially exceeded by a steam locomotive, though the German Class 05 was at least very close: in 1936, two years before Mallard's run, 05?002 had reached 200.4?km/h (124.5?mph) between Hamburg and Berlin. Stoke Bank is long, straight and slightly downhill, whereas the 1936 run of 05?002 took place on a horizontal stretch of track. Unlike world records for cars and aircraft, there is no requirement for an average of two runs in both directions, and assistance from gradient or wind has always been acceptable in rail speed records. Also, unlike Mallard, 05?002 survived the attempt undamaged: on the other hand, its train was only four coaches long (197 tons), whereas Mallard's train was seven coaches (240 tons).[9] In terms of rival claims, Gresley and the LNER had just one serious attempt at the record, which was far from a perfect run with a 15?mph (24?km/h) permanent way check just North of Grantham. Despite this a record was set.[10] Gresley planned to have another attempt in September 1939, but this was prevented by the outbreak of World War II.[11] Before the record run on 3 July 1938, it was calculated that 130?mph (210?km/h) was possible, and in fact Driver Duddington and LNER Inspector Sid Jenkins both said they might well have achieved this figure had they not had to slow for the Essendine junctions.[10] It is very possible that around 1946, the American Pennsylvania Railroad's T1 class duplex steam locomotive could have attained faster operational speeds than Mallard. However, such claims were not officially verified, thus Mallard continues to hold the official record. The LNER A4 and PRR T1 classes had the same piston stroke and driving wheel diameter, which gave both locomotives the same piston speed for the same track speed.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, Mallard still officially holds the record; plaques affixed to each side of the locomotive commemorate the feat. The plaques were proposed and designed by Morley headmaster Harry Underwood, a keen steam enthusiast, in 1948.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1948, shortly after the formation of British Railways, the decision was taken to test locomotives from all of the former 'Big Four' companies to find the best attributes of speed, power and efficiency with coal and water. There were two ways of testing and comparing locomotives: either at the Rugby Locomotive testing plant, which was not ready until late 1948 or by testing in the field itself. The results of these trials would be used to help design the British Railways Standard locomotives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe express passenger locomotive designs which would be compared were: London Midland Region (former LMS) Princess Coronation class, Eastern Region (former LNER) Class A4, Southern Region (former Southern) Merchant Navy class and Western Region (former GWR) 6000 Class or King class.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree Gresley A4 locomotives were chosen to represent the Eastern Region: E22 Mallard, 60033 Seagull and 60034 Lord Faringdon. All of the locomotives had the Kylchap double blastpipe chimney arrangement and were fresh from Doncaster works. Mallard had emerged from Doncaster with a fresh coat of post-war garter blue livery, stainless steel numbers 22 with a small 'E' painted above them (for Eastern region), new boiler (its fourth) and third tender of its career.\\r\\n\\r\\nE22 Mallard was used on 8 June 1948 on the Waterloo-Exeter route. Driver Marrable took the famous A4 with a load of 481 tons tare, 505 tons full, the same that had been used on the previous trip by 35018 British India Line. Mallard reached Clapham Junction in 6 minutes 57 seconds and Woking in 28 minutes 47 seconds. At Hook there were adverse signals, causing Mallard to slow to a crawl. Even so, Salisbury was reached in 108 minutes and 28 seconds. Despite the signals earlier, the train was only 5-and-a-half minutes late. The net time was 95.5 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMallard failed after this trial and 60033 Seagull took over. On 10 June Seagull achieved the run in 96 minutes 22 seconds, but had departed 3 minutes late, meaning Seagull had arrived with the same load 3.5 minutes early. For Mallard, the 1948 Locomotive Exchange Trials were over, but Mallard returned to the Waterloo-Exeter line for a Locomotive Club of Great Britain (LCGB) railtour on 24 February 1963.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Elizabethan\\" was a flagship express that ran non-stop over the 393 miles (632?km) between London King's Cross and Edinburgh Waverley from 1953 to the mid-1960s. Until September 1961 it was steam-hauled. In its day it was the longest non-stop run in the world. Two crews were needed for the six-and-a-half-hour run. They were able to change over mid-journey by using a corridor tender. Only a few locomotives other than Mallard had such a tender.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last steam-hauled Elizabethans ran on 8 September 1961, the northbound (\\"Down\\" in British railway parlance) train was accompanied by photographers, journalists and performance recorders. Their outputs were uncoordinated and have only come to light over many years. Mallard hauled the train, with sister loco 60009 Union of South Africa hauling the corresponding \\"Up\\" train.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journalists wrote a valedictory piece in The Sunday Telegraph of 10 September 1961. This has recently been reproduced in a compendium of railway-related pieces from The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph over the years.[15] This names the driver and fireman from Kings Cross to York as Harold Birkett and John Thorne. They were replaced north of York by driver Bob Currie and fireman Alec Mackay. Chief Motive Power Inspector Bert Dixon stayed on the footplate for the whole trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photographers appear to have been from British Railway's own photography unit. Some of the photographs of the trip have survived in the \\"Liverpool Street Collection\\" at the National Railway Museum. Four of them were reproduced in a minority publication in 1971,[16] one of them ÿ showing Driver Birkett using the corridor tender ÿ has been used in magazines since.\\r\\n\\r\\nTriangulation occurred in Railway Magazine in 2013 when a log of the run was published, with narrative, taken from Railway Performance Society's archives.[17] The original log was compiled by Mr C. Hudson. The train arrived three minutes early after a run involving several speed checks and was interpreted as a credit to men, system and machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nMallard was released into traffic for the first time on 3 March 1938. It was the first A4 to be fitted with a Kylchap double blast pipe from new. This was one of the factors that led to its selection for the attempt on the world rail speed record in July of that year.\\r\\n\\r\\nMallard wore a variety of liveries throughout its career. These were: garter blue as 4468, LNER wartime black from 13 June 1942, later wartime black with the tender marked as \\"NE\\" from 21 October 1943 as 22 with yellow small stencilled numbers, post-war garter blue with white and red lining from 5 March 1948 with stainless steel cabside number 22, British railways dark blue as 60022 from 16 September 1949, Brunswick green from 4 July 1952 and its original LNER garter blue for preservation in 1963.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A4 class was built with streamlined valances, or side skirting, but this was removed during the war to ease maintenance. Mallard lost its valances during a works visit 13 June 1942, regaining them in preservation in 1963.\\r\\n\\r\\nMallard was fitted with twelve boilers during its 25-year career. These boilers were: 9024 (from construction), 8959 (from 4496 Golden Shuttle, 13 June 1942), 8907 (from 2511 Silver King, 1 August 1946), 8948 (from 31 Golden Plover, Walter K Whigham, 10 January 1951), 29301 (from 60019 Bittern, 4 July 1952), 29315 (from 60014 Silver Link, 23 April 1954), 29328 (new-build boiler, 7 June 1957), 29308 (from 60008 Dwight D. Eisenhower, 27 August 1958), 29310 (from 60009 Union of South Africa, 9 March 1960) and 27965 (from 60009 Union of South Africa, 10 August 1961).\\r\\n\\r\\nMallard has had seven tenders throughout its career. It started off with a non-corridor tender in 1938, had corridor design tenders during its British Railways days and was fitted with a non-corridor tender in 1963 to recreate its original appearance. The tenders it has been fitted with are: 5642 (3 March 1938 ÿ 14 March 1939), 5639 (5 May 1939 ÿ 16 January 1948), 5323 (5 March 1948 ÿ 12 March 1953), 5648 (12 March 1953 ÿ 21 July 1958), 5330 (27 August 1958 ÿ 30 May 1962), 5651 (30 May 1962 ÿ 25 April 1963) and 5670 (current tender, masquerading as original tender 5642).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original non-corridor tender 5642 was later coupled to sister locomotive 60026 Miles Beevor when it was withdrawn on 21 December 1965 but later came into the possession of the A4 Preservation Society who had purchased this locomotive from the scrapyard to assist the restoration of classmate 4498 Sir Nigel Gresley. It was scrapped in 1973 as being surplus to requirements, by which time it had also donated parts to the restoration of A3 class locomotive 4472 Flying Scotsman, which had recently returned from America and was being restored at Derby Workshops.\\r\\n\\r\\nMallard was allocated to three sheds during its career: Doncaster, transferring on 21 October 1943 to Grantham and on 11 April 1948 to Kings Cross Top Shed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo A4s were exported after retirement, one to the USA (No. 60008 (LNER No. 4496) Dwight D. Eisenhower) and the other to Canada (No. 60010 (LNER No. 4489) Dominion of Canada). In October 2012, they came back to prepare for the 75th anniversary celebrations in 2013 of the record run.[18] They and Mallard were joined at the National Railway Museum by No. 4464 (BR. No. 60019) Bittern, No. 60007 (LNER No. 4498) Sir Nigel Gresley and No. 60009 (LNER No. 4488, formerly Osprey) Union of South Africa. No. 60008 had its BR Brunswick Green livery refreshed and No. 60010 was re-painted in LNER Garter Blue with stainless steel lettering and number 4489 and fitted with the Canadian bell and whistle.  In early 2014, the six A4s were displayed at the National Railway Museum Shildon, which was the final exhibition of the six engines together.  In March 2014, the Mallard returned to York, and the 4464, 60007, and 60009 all returned to their owners.  60008 and 4489 remained at Shildon until April, and were returned respectively to the US and Canada from AprilÿJune 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was restored to working order in the 1980s,[19] but has not operated since, apart from hauling some specials between York and Scarborough in July 1986 and a couple of runs between York and Harrogate/Leeds around Easter 1987.\\r\\n\\r\\nMallard is now part of the National Collection at the United Kingdom's National Railway Museum in York.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the weekend of 5 July 2008, Mallard was taken outside for the first time in years and displayed beside the three other A4s that are resident in the UK, thus reuniting them for the first time since preservation. It departed the museum for Locomotion, the NRM's outbase at Shildon on 23 June 2010, where it was a static exhibit, until it was hauled back to York on 19 July 2011 and put back on display in its original location in the Great Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nBachmann and Hornby released models of Mallard several times in Garter Blue. Hornby released a model of Mallard in BR Express Passenger Blue and a limited edition model in BR Dark Loco Green. Hornby has also released a limited edition model of 4468 in LNER form along with the other five surviving A4s in 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Corgi 1:120 scale model in Garter Blue as part of a series entitled \\"Rail Legends\\" is available.\\r\\n\\r\\nHachette Publications have also released an 'O' Gauge 'Build-It-Yourself' model in Partwork format.

The court was established in 1845 as a three-member panel. Since 1896, the justices (increased in number to six, then to seven in 1945, and finally to nine in 2017[1]) have been elected by the people, and today those elections are non-partisan. Three of the state's nine sitting Justices were re-elected, all unopposed, in 2012.[2]\\r\\nThe first Chief Justice of the Court was Joseph Henry Lumpkin, who was appointed in 1863. There have been 27 Chief Justices, and the current Chief Justice of the Court is Harris Hines.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgia was established as a state in 1788. In the state's early days the justice system was set up so that matters of law were settled at a local level. This is how courts were settled up until 1799 when the Judiciary Act was put into place. The Judiciary Act stated that the judges of Georgia would meet annually and discuss any laws or rules that may have or would cause argument among the state. This allowed much of the laws and rules to be somewhat unanimous in all regions of the state. However, this was short to last as in 1801 an act called for anything that was discussed at these meetings to be returned to each county by its appointed judge and there it would be discussed further and decided upon county by county. This brought matters back to a local level. This meant that local court law was the only way to achieve justice and it caused a huge lack of uniformity among courts until the establishment of the Supreme Court was urged by governor George W. Crawford. The order for a Supreme Court of Georgia was amended to the constitution in 1835; however, it was not established until 1845 and was implemented in 1846, decades after the Revolutionary War. The original court consisted of three justices: Joseph Henry Lumpkin, the presiding justice, Hiram Warner, and Eugenius A. Nisbet. Their salaries were $2,500 a year.\\r\\nIn the Court of Appeals, 12 judges are selected to serve 6 year terms. They are elected through nonpartisan elections. The Chief Judge serves for two years.\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of Georgia has the right and authority over every case that involves the review of select appellate jurisdiction. The cases in which it can perform rule over are the cases that bring in question of constitutionality of a law, constitutional arrangement, or mandate. Any election contest can be judged by the Supreme Court of Georgia and the cases it has appellate jurisdiction in are the following:\\r\\nEach justice can create an opinion but it must be passed to the other justices, and after a discussion, depending on the majority, that opinion can be taken in or nulled. In the instance that any justice cannot serve in a case due to disqualification or any other reason, a judge can substitute has to be sent by the Court to take that place.\\r\\nCourtroom security is provided by the Capitol Police Division of the Georgia State Patrol.\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of Georgia is unusual among state high courts in that it does not admit new lawyers to the state bar. Instead, new lawyers are admitted to practice by the superior court of a county where they live or wish to practice.[5] The new lawyers must separately seek admission to the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.\\r\\nBefore admission, the board of admissions for the Supreme Court of Georgia conducts a background check and only considers the applicants that have the quality and morals to practice law.[6]\\r\\nThe composition of the State Bar is made up of attorneys or lawyers that have practiced the law with experience, but they do not receive pay. They do; however, receive a reimbursement for their expenses due to traveling, if any. The State Bar is composed of five attorneys that are appointed by the Court and they are in charge of maintaining documentation of the Georgia State Bar examination that occurs twice a year ready, as well as evaluating it.[7]\\r\\nHuebner, Timothy.

Mbeki criticized the scientific consensus that HIV does cause AIDS beginning shortly after his election to the presidency. In 2000, he organized a Presidential Advisory Panel regarding HIV/AIDS including several scientists who denied that HIV caused AIDS. In the following eight years of his presidency, Mbeki continued to express sympathy for HIV/AIDS denialism, and instituted policies denying antiretroviral drugs to AIDS patients.[1] Instead of providing these drugs, which he described as \\"poisons\\",[2] shortly after he was elected to the presidency, he appointed Manto Tshabalala-Msimang as the country's health minister, who promoted the use of unproven herbal remedies such as ubhejane, garlic, beetroot, and lemon juice to treat AIDS,[3][4] which led to her acquiring the nickname \\"Dr. Beetroot.\\"[5] These policies have been blamed for the preventable deaths of between 343,000 and 365,000 people from AIDS.[4][6][7] As of 2008, Mbeki has remained silent about his views and policies on AIDS; according to The New York Times, his spokesman, Mukoni Ratshitanga, said Mr. Mbeki would not discuss his thinking on HIV and AIDS, explaining that policy decisions were made collectively by the cabinet and so questions should be addressed to the government.[4] Upon becoming president in 2008, Mbeki's successor, Kgalema Motlanthe, appointed Barbara Hogan as health minister to replace Tshabalala-Msimang on the first day of his presidency. Hogan told The New York Times, The era of denialism is over completely in South Africa.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason Mbeki became so enamored with HIV/AIDS denialism remains unclear, but some have suggested that it was influenced by Christine Maggiore meeting with him in the 1990s.[8] Another factor may have been when, in 1999, Anthony Brink published an article entitled \\"A Medicine from Hell\\", which described AZT as dangerous and ineffective. Brink would later claim that this article was responsible for Mbeki's policies banning the use of the drug. Brink contacted Mbeki after the article was published, and was welcomed as an expert.[9] Mbeki, in a 2002 document of which he was the co-author, also cited John Le Carre's novel The Constant Gardener as influencing his fear of pharmaceutical companies and their influence on scientific research.[10] Given that Mbeki explicitly accused supporters of the consensus position on HIV/AIDS of racism,[11] it has also been proposed that his denialist views arose from a history of racist portrayals of black people in South Africa under the apartheid system.[12] An article in Race & Class by Joy Wang proposes that both of these factors influenced Mbeki's embrace of AIDS denialism, and cites Frantz Fanon's essay \\"Medicine and Colonialism\\" to explain what Wang describes as \\"...the impasse between scientists and Mbeki's government.\\"[13] Martin Asser has also proposed that Mbeki's views on AIDS may have been influenced by the high price of ARV therapy relative to the relatively small amount of money his country's citizens have at their disposal.[14] In 2004, Theodore F. Sheckels of Randolph-Macon College argued that Mbeki, while discussing HIV/AIDS as president of South Africa, attempted to portray \\"the West\\" as the scapegoat in order to unite the country's black majority.[15] Barton Gellman has proposed an alternative explanation for Mbeki's viewsnamely, that he is \\"a sort of restless, roving intellect who likes to surf the Internet and is accustomed to being a dissident who allies himself against establishments. After all, he spent his whole adult life fighting apartheid.\\" He also noted that even if Mbeki followed every recommendation of the mainstream scientific community regarding AIDS he still wouldn't solve the problem, so, according to Gellman, Mbeki is \\"keeping the scientific uncertainties alive because he doesn't want to portray himself as helpless.\\"[16]\\r\\nOn May 10, 1994, Mandela became President of South Africa, remaining in that office until replaced by Thabo Mbeki five years later.[17] During his presidency, which lasted from then until 1999, Mandela remained largely indifferent to HIV/AIDS, and did not speak out about the danger it posed to South Africa until the early 2000s.[18] Mandela has himself reportedly expressed regret that he did not do more to combat AIDS during his presidency.[19]\\r\\nIn early 1997, Mbeki, who was then the Deputy President of South Africa, approached the other members of the African National Congress to pitch the idea of using a new anti-AIDS drug, developed in South Africa, called Virodene. The advantages over existing ARV drugs which proved appealing to Mbeki included being 200 times less expensive than antiretroviral triple therapy, and the possibility of bypassing the Western medical establishment if it was proven to work. This led to a group of AIDS patients who had been treated with Virodene being invited to testify before the Cabinet of South Africa. Their testimonies included many statements that they had gained weight and seen boils on their faces vanish after they started being treated.\\r\\nHowever, the fact remained that the makers of Virodene had previously been denied a license by the South African Medicines Control Council (MCC). The company argued that this happened because the South African AIDS establishment did not want any drugs other than ARVs to become available, because the establishment was funded by Western drug firms. Mbeki found this argument compelling. The drug was then legalized and heavily and favorably promoted in the popular media, until it became apparent that it posed a severe health hazard.[20] The MCC subsequently declared the drug unfit for human consumption.[21]\\r\\nOn June 14, 1999, Mbeki was elected President of South Africa.[22]\\r\\nOn October the 28th, Mbeki gave a speech to the National Council of Provinces in which he touched upon the issue of HIV/AIDS, and especially whether his government should distribute ARV drugs. He argued that they shouldn't be so quick to do so because of their adverse effects, and recommended that the members of the council read the information on the Internet on the topic.[23]\\r\\nOn March 19, 2000, it was reported that Mbeki had consulted biochemist David Rasnick and history professor Charles Geshekter, both of whom are AIDS denialists, for advice on HIV/AIDS. Awa Marie Coll-Seck reacted to the news by saying, \\"At first, we were thinking we would just ignore it, but now we think this confusion can really undermine all the efforts people have made to prevent this disease.\\"[24]\\r\\nOn April 20, 2000, Mbeki sent a five-page letter to Bill Clinton in which he describes AIDS as a \\"uniquely African catastrophe,\\" and compared the \\"persecution\\" of HIV/AIDS denialists to the treatment of black people in South Africa during the apartheid era. The letter was leaked to The Washington Post shortly afterward, which provoked condemnation from many commentators and \\"infuriated and embarrassed\\" Mbeki.[25][26] The following day, Jacob Zuma, then South African deputy president, compared those criticizing HIV/AIDS denialists to critics of Galileo during the 17th century. \\"His views were considered to be so threatening to the scientific establishment that he was forced to publicly recant,\\" Zuma was quoted as saying in a statement released by the office of the presidency.[27]\\r\\nLater that year, Mbeki convened a panel of 33 scientists whom he referred to as \\"experts\\", of whom about half were AIDS denialists such as Peter Duesberg and Harvey Bialy. The panel, known as the \\"Presidential Advisory Panel on AIDS,\\" also included AIDS researchers who supported the scientific consensus that HIV causes AIDS, and was split about evenly between the two groups.[28] Their first meeting was held from May 6 to May 7.[25] Nicoli Nattrass has blamed Duesberg and his supporters on this panel, as well as Mbeki, for the popularity of AIDS denialism in South Africa.[29]\\r\\nThe Presidential Advisory Panel on AIDS's second meeting took place on July 3 and 4 in Johannesburg.[30] Both meetings were closed to the general public and to nearly all journalists, with the exception of Mark Schoofs of the Village Voice. Schoofs reported that David Rasnick, another AIDS denialist member of the panel, had called for HIV testing to be completely banned, and had argued he hadn't seen \\"any evidence\\" of an AIDS catastrophe. The meeting also culminated in research proposals by both supporters and denialists of the HIV/AIDS hypothesis. South African health official Khotso Mokhele praised both proposals, saying that once concluded, one side of the HIV/AIDS debate might \\"shut up once and for all.\\"[30] The AIDS denialists at the meeting recommended that the disease be treated not with antiretroviral drugs, but rather with vitamins and alternative and complementary therapies including massage therapy, music therapy, yoga, spiritual care, homeopathy, Indian ayurvedic medicine, light therapy and many other methods.[10] On July 6, the scientific community responded with the Durban Declaration, signed by 5,000 scientists and published in Nature. The declaration stated, among other things, that \\"HIV causes AIDS. It is unfortunate that a few vocal people continue to deny the evidence. This position will cost countless lives.\\"[31] Nevertheless, when the International AIDS Conference in Durban was held just three days later, where Mbeki was scheduled to give the opening speech, he openly rejected the mainstream view that HIV is the cause of AIDS, and instead argued that it was caused by poverty, bad nourishment and general ill-health. The solution was not, Mbeki continued, expensive western medicine, but the alleviation of poverty in Africa.[32] He also invited Maggiore, an outspoken AIDS denialist, to give a talk at the conference,[33] and, in one of his own speeches, exhorted the other delegates at the conference to \\"...speak to one another honestly and frankly, with sufficient tolerance to respect everybody's point of view, with sufficient tolerance to allow all voices to be heard.\\"[34] His speech met with largely negative reception from the delegates attending the conference, hundreds of whom walked out.[35]\\r\\nIn September 2000, Mbeki told the South African Parliament that \\"The programme of the government in this country is based on this thesis that HIV causes Aids and everything in the programme says that.\\" However, he later stated that he still did not think HIV caused AIDS, and that it could, in his view, only be a contributing factor, not a sole cause.[36]\\r\\nIn mid-October, the South African government announced that Mbeki would be \\"reducing his role\\" in the HIV/AIDS debate, with Mbeki himself acknowledging he may have caused \\"confusion\\" by publicly challenging the mainstream view of the cause of AIDS.[2] Nevertheless, his approval rating had already dropped from 70 to 50 percent in the previous year. Many senior American politicians had expressed private doubts about his judgment, though other South African politicians were even more outspoken in their criticism. For example, many South African trade and banking officials expressed concern that Mbeki's statements were driving away potential investors.[37] In a 2007 interview, Mbeki told his biographer, Mark Gevisser, that he only did this because he was pressured to by his cabinet and he regrets his decision to do so.[38]\\r\\nIn August 2001, Mbeki incorrectly claimed, based on outdated statistics, that HIV/AIDS is only the 12th leading killer in South Africa, when it was actually the leading killer. He also asked health officials to reassess the budget accordingly, and proposed that the new healthcare budget include a decreased emphasis on HIV/AIDS.[11][39]\\r\\nThe following October, Mbeki gave two speeches in which he demonstrated that, according to the New York Times, he \\"...remains badly misinformed about [HIV]...\\" In the speeches, he exaggerated the dangers of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), downplayed the dangers of AIDS itself, and suggested that his critics were racist.[11] The Economist reacted to his speech to Parliament, in which he claimed that ARVs \\"...are becoming as dangerous to health as the thing they are supposed to treat,\\" by saying that this claim was simply wrong, adding that ARVs not only prolong life but also make sufferers less infectious. They also criticized the government's dismissal of its critics as stooges for international drug companies by arguing that \\"government intransigence, not the cost of drugs, is the real problem.\\"[40]\\r\\nOn September 26, 2003, Mbeki's spokesman confirmed that Mbeki had in fact stated that he didn't know anyone with AIDS. This remark provoked considerable criticism from AIDS activists and opposition politicians, with Xolani Kunene of Treatment Action Campaign remarking that Mbeki was \\"not living in the real South Africa.\\"[41]\\r\\nMbeki was asked by the South African Parliament if he thought rape played any role in spreading AIDS, to which he replied that The disease of racism led to blacks being portrayed as lazy, liars, foul-smelling, diseased, corrupt, violent, amoral, sexually depraved, animalistic, savage and rapist. In an opinion piece written four years later, Roger Cohen cited this remark as evidence that Mbeki considered HIV/AIDS to be \\"a fabrication foisted on Africans by whites determined to distract the continent from real problems of racism and poverty, and accepted by blacks afflicted with the slave mentality engendered by apartheid.\\"[42]\\r\\nThe ARVs that had been approved by the government of South Africa five months earlier first began reaching hospitals in April 2004. Some AIDS activists considered this timing suspicious, as it was two weeks before the national elections were to take place that year.[43]\\r\\nMatthias Rath travels to South Africa to sell his vitamins which, he claims, are effective at curing AIDS. He soon began organizing clinical trials of the efficacy of these vitamins, which led to the Treatment Action Campaign suing him later that year. Nevertheless, Tshabalala-Msimang stood by Rath, and even appeared at a forum in April to defend Rath's \\"right to free speech\\" and claim that his drugs had \\"equal validity\\" to ARVs.[44] Only after a long-running legal battle with the Medicines Control Council were these trials finally declared illegal.[29] AIDS activists have linked Rath's distribution of these vitamins to the deaths of some HIV/AIDS patients.[45]\\r\\nOn October 26, 2006, South Africa's government announced that they were reversing their previous policies on treatment of HIV/AIDS patients, and would now be distributing ARV drugs through the country's public health services. The announcement was made at a conference of AIDS activists, whom the government had previously ignored. These activists had been spending the previous few years in a legal battle with the country's government in an effort to get them to distribute ARV drugs.[46]\\r\\nIn late 2006, Tshabalala-Msimang fell ill, after which the country's deputy health minister, Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge, assumed leadership over South Africa's health policies after being summoned to do so by deputy president Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka. While she was at the helm of South Africa's health policies from then until she was fired next August, she attempted to reverse Mbeki's AIDS denialist policies by describing the number of South Africans waiting for ARV drugs as a \\"serious violation of human rights.\\" She was also one of the principal authors of the country's aggressively anti-AIDS health plan, which was adopted that December.[47]\\r\\nOn August 9, 2007, despite ongoing calls to fire Tshabalala-Msimang, Mbeki instead fired Madlala-Routledge, South Africa's then-deputy health minister and a longtime critic of his AIDS policies. The stated reason was that she had attended an AIDS conference without his permission, but critics argued this was merely an excuse for Mbeki to rid himself of a politician who was willing to criticize his policies.[48] Given that few other South African officials were willing to criticize Mbeki's views on AIDS, the Economist expressed concern that her absence would lead to a reversal of the superior AIDS policies she had helped implement.[49]\\r\\nOn August 31, 2007, after Tshabalala-Msimang came under attack for denying that HIV caused AIDS and promoting unorthodox treatments for the disease, Mbeki leapt to her defense, writing in ANC Today that she would go down in history as \\"...one of the pioneer architects of a South African public health system constructed to ensure that we achieve the objective of health for all our people, and especially the poor.\\" He also referred to her as a hero and to her critics as \\"wild animals.\\"[5]\\r\\nOn February 7, 2008, research by Nicoli Nattrass estimated that the failure of Mbeki's administration to provide ARV drugs until 2006 was responsible for about 343,000 deaths.[6] Later that year, a study by Pride Chigwedere et al., published in the December 2008 issue of the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, estimated that Mbeki's HIV/AIDS policies were responsible for \\"more than 330,000\\" deaths.[4][7]\\r\\nOn September 25, 2008, Kgalema Motlanthe succeeded Mbeki as president of South Africa. On the first day of his presidency, he removed Tshabalala-Msimang from the office of health minister and replaced her with Barbara Hogan. Hogan's views on AIDS reflected a dramatic shift from her predecessor's--in December 2008, she promised to increase the supply of ARV drugs available to pregnant women in South Africa, as well as to improve HIV prevention programs.[50]\\r\\nOn July 19, 2009, a paper co-authored by Duesberg and several other denialists was published, as an Epub ahead of print, in the non-peer reviewed journal Medical Hypotheses (though it had originally been submitted to the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes). The paper, which was mainly a response to Chigwedere's 2008 study, argued that official statistics showed that Chigwedere et al.'s estimates of deaths due to AIDS in South Africa (about 330,000 per year) were wildly overestimated and that there was \\"as yet no proof that HIV causes AIDS.\\"[51] Eventually, the journal received numerous expressions of concern about the paper, including accusations of libel and concern about its potential adverse impact on public health, and therefore retracted it that September.[51] This led to Elsevier, the journal's publisher, threatening to fire Bruce Charlton, the journal's editor, if he did not institute a peer-review process for the journal. Charlton refused, and was therefore fired in May 2010.[52]\\r\\nOn October 29, 2009, South Africa's president, Jacob Zuma, who had been elected president the previous May, gave a speech which was seen by many as the end of AIDS denialism in South Africa. In the speech, Zuma acknowledged HIV/AIDS as one of South Africa's most serious problems, saying that \\"...all South Africans need to know their HIV status, and be informed of the treatment options available to them.\\"[53]\\r\\nDuring Mbeki's presidency, many medical researchers harshly criticized his AIDS policies and predicted that these policies would lead to countless deaths.[31] Another critic of these policies was Harvard University's Robert Rotberg, who, in 2000, said of Mbeki's AIDS policies, \\"This is very foolish and uncharacteristic of him.\\"[54] In 2002, Mbeki's AIDS policies faced even more criticism, this time from Nelson Mandela, who said in an interview that \\"This [AIDS] is a war. It has killed more people than has been the case in all previous wars and in all previous natural disasters. We must not continue to be debating, to be arguing, when people are dying.\\" The Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town, Njongonkulu Ndungane, also criticized these policies, saying that the government was \\"sinning\\" by \\"withholding truth and maintaining the silence of denial\\" over AIDS.[55] Desmond Tutu also spoke out against Mbeki's AIDS denialist policies and compared them to \\"fiddling while Rome burns\\".[43] Ndungane, along with Max Essex, have argued that Mbeki's policies were worse than just bad judgmentNdungane even described these policies as a crime against humanity on the same scale as apartheid.[56] After Chigwedere et al.'s research estimating AIDS denialist policies in South Africa led to over 300,000 deaths was published,[7] philosopher Peter Singer cited it in support of his conclusion that \\"Mbeki, like Mandela, was active in the struggle against apartheid. Yet the Harvard study shows that he is responsible for the deaths of 5,000 times as many black South Africans as the white South African police who fired on the crowd at Sharpeville.\\" Singer also wrote that while Mbeki was not motivated by malice in deciding his AIDS policies, that he was nevertheless \\"culpable, not for having initially entertained a view held by a tiny minority of scientists, but for having clung to this view without allowing it to be tested in fair and open debate among experts.\\"[57] Other critics, such as Karl Kruszelnicki, have noted that South Africa, unlike many of its fellow sub-Saharan African countries, \\"...has both the medical personnel and wealth to meet the HIV/AIDS challenge head-on,\\" making it especially unfortunate that these resources were not used for so long.[58]\\r\\nIn 2006, 40% of South Africans believed there was a cure for AIDS.[59] Research presented by Nicoli Nattrass at a Harvard symposium on October 19, 2009 concluded that \\"...denialist beliefs are held disproportionately by black African men and are far more likely to be held by those supportive of Mbekis health minister [Tshabalala-Msimang].\\"[60]","input":"When did arvs become available in south africa?"},{"output":"England","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2017 ICC Women's World Cup Final was a one-day international cricket match played between England and India to decide the winner of the 2017 Women's World Cup. England won the game by nine runs to secure their fourth World Cup title, with Anya Shrubsole named player of the match. It was one of the closest finals in tournament history, with only the 2000 final being decided by a narrower margin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final was played at Lord's Cricket Ground, London, on 23 July 2017. Lord's had been announced as the host on 8 February 2016.[2] The game was sold out, with a near-capacity crowd of around 24,000 in attendance.[3] The bell to signal the start of play was rung by Eileen Ash, who at 105 years old is the oldest surviving international cricketer.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nEngland were playing in the Women's World Cup Final for the fifth time,[a] a mark surpassed only by Australia. However, in the preceding five tournaments (1997ÿ2013), England had made the final just once, defeating New Zealand in the 2009 final to claim their third World Cup title. India on the other hand was playing in the World Cup Final, only for the second time in their history. The first had been a loss to Australia in 2005.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group stage of the 2017 World Cup consisted of a simple round-robin, with each of the eight teams playing each other once and the top four teams progressing to the semi-finals. In the opening match of the tournament, India unexpectedly defeated England by 35 runs.[6][7] However, England went on to win all six of their remaining group-stage games, finishing top of the table ÿ with the same number of points as Australia but a superior net run rate. India finished third in the group stage, after losses to South Africa (by 115 runs) and Australia (by eight wickets).[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first semi-final, played on 18 July at Bristol County Ground, England defeated South Africa by two wickets. South Africa batted first, posting a score of 218/6 from their 50 overs. Towards the end of their innings, England required three runs from the final over to win, with Anya Shrubsole hitting the winning runs off Shabnim Ismail with just two balls to spare.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second semi-final, played at The County Ground, Derby, was reduced to 42 overs per side due to rain. India posted a score of 281/4, with Harmanpreet Kaur scoring 171 (not out) from 115 balls, including seven sixes. This was the highest individual score in the knockout stages of a World Cup,[10] and was widely heralded as one of the greatest ever World Cup innings.[11][12] In response, Australia was bowled out for 245, leaving India the victors by 36 runs.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach team had 15 players in its tournament squad, 11 of whom played in the final.[14] Both teams selected the same line-up for the final as they used in their semi-finals.[15] Only five selected players had previously played in a World Cup final ÿ Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami for India, and Katherine Brunt, Laura Marsh, and Sarah Taylor for England.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nEngland's captain Heather Knight won the toss and elected to bat. Their openers, Lauren Winfield (24 runs) and Tammy Beaumont (23), made steady progress, putting on 47 runs before Winfield was bowled by Rajeshwari Gayakwad. Beaumont was out three overs later, caught in the deep off the bowling of Poonam Yadav. This brought Heather Knight (1) to the crease, but she lasted just seven balls before also being dismissed by Yadav, leg before wicket (lbw; via DRS). Sarah Taylor (45) and Natalie Sciver (51) steadied the ship somewhat, putting on 83 runs for the fourth wicket whilst light rain fell. With the score at 146, Taylor was caught behind from the bowling of Jhulan Goswami. Goswami then had Fran Wilson out next ball, for a golden duck. Sciver also fell to Goswami a few overs later, unsuccessfully challenging an lbw decision. Katherine Brunt (34) and Jenny Gunn (25 not out) put on 32 runs for the seventh wicket before Brunt was run out by Goswami with a direct hit. Gunn continued on with Laura Marsh (14 not out) for the last four overs, with England finishing on 228/7 from their 50 overs. Jhulan Goswami was the pick of the Indian bowlers, finished with 3/23.[17][18][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia lost a wicket in their second over, with Smriti Mandhana bowled by Anya Shrubsole for a duck. Poonam Raut (86 runs) and Mithali Raj (17) then put on 38 runs before Raj was run out by Natalie Sciver. Raut and Harmanpreet Kaur (51) compiled a 95-run fourth-wicket partnership, lasting just over 20 overs, before Kaur was caught in the deep off the bowling of Alex Hartley. Raut then combined with Veda Krishnamurthy (35) for an additional 53 runs. Raut's dismissal with the score at 191 prompted a batting collapse, with India losing their final seven wickets for just 28 runs. As the match reached its climax, India required 11 runs from the last two overs, but instead lost their last two wickets in the first four balls of the 49th over, bowled by Anya Shrubsole.

As an adaptation to living at depth,[3] it has a high concentration of trimethylamine N-oxide in its tissues, which causes the meat to be toxic.[4] Greenland shark flesh treated to reduce toxin levels is eaten in Iceland as a delicacy known as k?stur hkarl.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greenland shark is one of the largest living species of shark, with dimensions comparable to those of the great white shark. Greenland sharks grow to 6.4?m (21?ft) and 1,000?kg (2,200?lb),[6] and possibly up to 7.3?m (24?ft) and more than 1,400?kg (3,100?lb).[7][8] Most Greenland sharks observed have been around 2.44ÿ4.8?m (8.0ÿ15.7?ft) long and weigh up to 400?kg (880?lb).[7][8]\\r\\nMales are typically smaller than females. It rivals the Pacific sleeper shark (possibly up to 7?m or 23?ft long) as the largest species in the family Somniosidae. The Greenland shark is a thickset species, with a short, rounded snout, small eyes, and very small dorsal and pectoral fins. The gill openings are very small for the species' great size.\\r\\nColoration can range from pale creamy-gray to blackish-brown and the body is typically uniform in color, though whitish spots or faint dark streaks are occasionally seen on the back.[7]\\r\\nWhen feeding on large carcasses, the shark employs a rolling motion of its jaw. The teeth of the upper jaw are very thin and pointed, lacking serrations. These upper jaw teeth, numbering from 48 to 52, act as an anchor while the lower jaw proceeds to cut massive chunks out of their prey for a quick and easy kill.\\r\\nThe lower teeth are interlocking and are broad and square, 50 to 52 in count, containing short, smooth cusps that point outward.[7] Teeth in the two halves of the lower jaw are strongly pitched in opposite directions.[9]\\r\\nThe Greenland shark is an apex predator and mostly eats fish. It has never been observed hunting.[10] Recorded fish prey have included smaller sharks, skates, eels, herring, capelin, Arctic char, cod, rosefish, sculpins, lumpfish, wolffish, and flounder.[7]\\r\\nGreenland sharks have also been found with remains of seals, polar bears, horses, moose,[11] and reindeer (in one case an entire reindeer body) in their stomachs.[7][12] The Greenland shark is known to be a scavenger, and is attracted by the smell of rotting meat in the water. The sharks have frequently been observed gathering around fishing boats.[7] It also scavenges on seals.[10]\\r\\nAlthough such a large shark could easily consume a human swimmer, the frigid waters it typically inhabits make the likelihood of attacks on humans very low, and no cases of predation on people have been verified.[7]\\r\\nAs an ectotherm living in a just-above-freezing environment, the Greenland shark has the lowest swim speed and tail-beat frequency for its size across all fish species, which most likely correlates with its very slow metabolism and extreme longevity. It swims at a leisurely 1.22?km/h (0.76?mph), with its fastest cruising speed only reaching 2.6?km/h (1.6?mph).[13] Because this top speed is only half that of a typical seal in their diet, biologists are uncertain how the sharks are able to prey on the faster seals. It is hypothesized that they may ambush them while they sleep.[14]\\r\\nGreenland sharks migrate annually based on depth and temperature rather than distance, although some do travel. During the winter, the sharks congregate in the shallows (up to 80 north) for warmth but migrate separately in summer to the deeps or even farther south in summer. The species has been observed at a depth of 2,200 metres (7,200?ft) by a submersible investigating the wreck of the SS Central America that lies about 160 miles (260?km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.[15] Daily vertical migration between shallower and deeper waters has also been recorded.[16]\\r\\nIn August 2013, researchers from Florida State University caught the first documented Greenland shark in the Gulf of Mexico at a depth of 1,749?m (5,738?ft), where the water temperature was 4.1?C (39.4?F).[17] A more typical depth for the species is above 1,200?m (3,900?ft).[7]\\r\\nThe shark is often colonized by the mutualistic bioluminescent copepod Ommatokoita elongata, which attaches itself to the shark's eyes and attracts prey to the shark's head.[18][19] The shark occupies what tends to be a very deep environment seeking its preferable cold water (?0.6 to 12?C or 30.9 to 53.6?F) habitat.[1]\\r\\nWhen hoisted upon deck, it beats so violently with its tail, that it is dangerous to be near it, and the seamen generally dispatch it, without much loss of time. The pieces that are cut off exhibit a contraction of their muscular fibres for some time after life is extinct. It is, therefore, extremely difficult to kill, and unsafe to trust the hand within its mouth, even when the head is cut off. And, if we are to believe Crantz, this motion is to be observed three days after, if the part is trod on or struck.\\r\\nThe Greenland shark has the longest known lifespan of all vertebrate species.[21] One Greenland shark was tagged off Greenland in 1936 and recaptured in 1952. Its measurements suggest that Greenland sharks grow at a rate of 0.5ÿ1?cm (0.2ÿ0.4?in) per year.[22] In 2016, a study based on 28 specimens that ranged from 81?to 502?cm (2.7ÿ16.5?ft) in length determined by radiocarbon dating of crystals within the lens of their eyes, that the oldest of the animals that they sampled, which also was the largest, had lived for 392 I 120 years. The authors further concluded that the species reaches sexual maturity at about 150 years of age.[21][23][24]\\r\\nAs recently as 1957, females were found not to deposit eggs in the bottom mud, but retain the developing embryos within their bodies so they are born alive after an undetermined gestation period (a process known as ovoviviparity). About 10 pups per litter are normal, each initially measuring some 38ÿ42?cm (15ÿ17?in) in length.[23][25]\\r\\nLike other elasmobranchii, Greenland sharks have high concentrations of the nitrogenous waste products urea and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in their tissues, which increases their buoyancy[26] and function as osmoprotectants. TMAO also counteracts the protein-destabilizing tendencies of urea[27][28] and of deep-water pressure.[3][28] Its presence in the tissues of both elasmobranch and teleost fish has been found to increase with depth.[3][29]\\r\\nThe blood of Greenland sharks contains three major types of hemoglobin, made up of two copies of ϫ globin combined with two copies of three very similar  subunits. These three types show very similar oxygenation and carbonylation properties, which are unaffected by urea, an important compound in marine elasmobranch physiology. They display identical electronic absorption and resonance Raman spectra, indicating that their heme-pocket structures are identical or highly similar. The hemoglobins also have a lower affinity for O2 compared to temperate sharks. These characteristics are interpreted as adaptations to living at great water depths.[30]\\r\\nThe flesh of the Greenland shark is toxic because of the presence of high concentrations of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO). If the meat is eaten without pretreatment, the ingested TMAO is metabolized into trimethylamine, which can produce effects similar to extreme drunkenness. Occasionally, sled dogs that eat the flesh are unable to stand up because of this effect. Similar toxic effects occur with the related Pacific sleeper shark, but not in most other shark species.[31][32]\\r\\nThe meat can be treated for safe consumption by boiling in several changes of water, drying, or fermenting for several months to produce k?stur hkarl. Traditionally, this is done by burying the meat in boreal ground for 6ÿ8 weeks, which presses the TMAO out of the meat and also results in partial fermentation. The meat is then dug up and hung up in strips to dry for several more months.[33] It is considered a delicacy in Iceland.[34][35]\\r\\nThe Greenland shark's poisonous flesh has a high urea content, which gave rise to the Inuit legend of Skalugsuak, the first Greenland shark.[36] The legend says that an old woman washed her hair in urine and dried it with a cloth. The cloth blew into the ocean to become Skalugsuak.[37] Another legend tells of a girl whose father cut off her fingers while drowning her, with each fingers turning into a sea creature, including Skalugsuak.[38]\\r\\nThe Greenland shark plays a role in cosmologies of the Inuit from the Canadian Eastern Arctic and Greenland. Igloolik Inuit believe that the shark lives within the urine pot of Sedna, goddess of the sea, and consequently its flesh has a urine-like smell, and acts as a helping spirit to shamans.[39]","input":"What kind of sharks live in the arctic?"},{"output":"between the embryonic state and birth","context":"A fetus is a stage in the prenatal development of viviparous organisms. In human development, a fetus or foetus (/?fi?t?s/; plural fetuses or foetuses) is a prenatal human between the embryonic state and birth. The fetal stage of development tends to be taken as beginning at the gestational age of eleven weeks, i.e. nine weeks after fertilization.[1][2] In biological terms, however, prenatal development is a continuum, with no clear defining feature distinguishing an embryo from a fetus. The use of the term \\"fetus\\" generally implies that an embryo has developed to the point of being recognizable as a human; this is the point usually taken to be the ninth week after fertilization. A fetus is also characterized by the presence of all the major body organs, though they will not yet be fully developed and functional and some not yet situated in their final anatomical location.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word fetus (plural fetuses) is from the Latin ftus (offspring, bringing forth, hatching of young).[3][4][5] The British, Irish, and Commonwealth spelling is foetus, which has been in use since at least 1594.[6] It arose as a hypercorrection based on an incorrect etymology (i.e. due to insufficient knowledge of Latin) that may have originated with an error by Isidore of Seville in AD?620.[7][8] This spelling is the most common in most Commonwealth nations, except in the medical literature, where fetus is used. The etymologically accurate original spelling fetus is used in Canada and the United States. In addition, fetus is now the standard English spelling throughout the world in medical journals.[9] The spelling faetus was used historically.[10]\\r\\nIn humans, the fetal stage commences at the beginning of the ninth week.[1] At the start of the fetal stage, the fetus is typically about 30 millimetres (1.2?in) in length from crown to rump, and weighs about 8?grams.[1] The head makes up nearly half of the fetus' size.[11] Breathing-like movement of the fetus is necessary for stimulation of lung development, rather than for obtaining oxygen.[12] The heart, hands, feet, brain and other organs are present, but are only at the beginning of development and have minimal operation.[13][14] The genitalia of the fetus starts to form and placenta becomes fully functional during week 9.[15]\\r\\nAt this point in development, uncontrolled movements and twitches occur as muscles, the brain, and pathways begin to develop.[16]\\r\\nA woman pregnant for the first time (primiparous), typically feels fetal movements at about 21 weeks, whereas a woman who has given birth at least once (multiparous), will typically feel movements by 20 weeks.[17] By the end of the fifth month, the fetus is about 20?cm (8?inches) long.\\r\\nThe amount of body fat rapidly increases. Lungs are not fully mature. Thalamic brain connections, which mediate sensory input, form. Bones are fully developed, but are still soft and pliable. Iron, calcium, and phosphorus become more abundant. Fingernails reach the end of the fingertips. The lanugo, or fine hair, begins to disappear, until it is gone except on the upper arms and shoulders. Small breast buds are present on both sexes. Head hair becomes coarse and thicker. Birth is imminent and occurs around the 38th week after fertilization. The fetus is considered full-term between weeks 36 and 40, when it is sufficiently developed for life outside the uterus.[19][20] It may be 48 to 53?cm (19 to 21?inches) in length, when born. Control of movement is limited at birth, and purposeful voluntary movements develop all the way until puberty.[21][22]\\r\\nThere is much variation in the growth of the human fetus. When fetal size is less than expected, that condition is known as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) also called fetal growth restriction (FGR); factors affecting fetal growth can be maternal, placental, or fetal.[23]\\r\\nMaternal factors include maternal weight, body mass index, nutritional state, emotional stress, toxin exposure (including tobacco, alcohol, heroin, and other drugs which can also harm the fetus in other ways), and uterine blood flow.\\r\\nPlacental factors include size, microstructure (densities and architecture), umbilical blood flow, transporters and binding proteins, nutrient utilization and nutrient production.\\r\\nFetal factors include the fetus genome, nutrient production, and hormone output. Also, female fetuses tend to weigh less than males, at full term.[23]\\r\\nFetal growth is often classified as follows: small for gestational age (SGA), appropriate for gestational age (AGA), and large for gestational age (LGA).[24] SGA can result in low birth weight, although premature birth can also result in low birth weight. Low birth weight increases risk for perinatal mortality (death shortly after birth), asphyxia, hypothermia, polycythemia, hypocalcemia, immune dysfunction, neurologic abnormalities, and other long-term health problems. SGA may be associated with growth delay, or it may instead be associated with absolute stunting of growth.\\r\\nViability refers to a point in fetal development at which the fetus may survive outside the womb. The lower limit of viability is approximately 5-3/4 months gestational age and is usually later.[25]\\r\\nThere is no sharp limit of development, age, or weight at which a fetus automatically becomes viable.[26] According to data from 2003ÿ05, survival rates are 20ÿ35% for babies born at 23 weeks of gestation (5-3/4 months); 50ÿ70% at 24-25 weeks (6 - 6-1/4 months); and >90% at 26-27 weeks (6-1/2 - 6-3/4 months) and over.[27] It is rare for a baby weighing less than 1.1 pounds (0.50?kg) to survive.[26]\\r\\nWhen such premature babies are born, the main causes of perinatal mortality are that the respiratory system and the central nervous system are not completely differentiated. If given expert postnatal care, some fetuses weighing less than 1.1 pounds (0.50?kg) may survive, and are referred to as extremely low birth weight or immature infants.[26] Preterm birth is the most common cause of perinatal mortality, causing almost 30 percent of neonatal deaths.[27]\\r\\nFetal pain, its existence and its implications are debated politically and academically. According to the conclusions of a review published in 2005, \\"Evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester.\\"[28][29] However, developmental neurobiologists argue that the establishment of thalamocortical connections (at about 6-1/2 months) is an essential event with regard to fetal perception of pain.[30] Nevertheless, the perception of pain involves sensory, emotional and cognitive factors and it is \\"impossible to know\\" when pain is experienced, even if it is known when thalamocortical connections are established.[30] Some authors [31] argue that fetal pain is possible from the second half of pregnancy: The available scientific evidence makes it possible, even probable, that fetal pain perception occurs well before late gestation wrote KJS Anand in the journal of the IASP.[32]\\r\\nWhether a fetus has the ability to feel pain and suffering is part of the abortion debate.[33][34] In the United States, for example, pro-life advocates have proposed legislation that would require providers of abortions to inform women that their fetuses may feel pain during the procedure and that would require each woman to accept or decline anesthesia for the fetus.[35]\\r\\nThe heart and blood vessels which form the circulatory system, form relatively early during embryonic development, but continue to grow and develop in complexity in the growing fetus. A functional circulatory system is a biological necessity, since mammalian tissues can not grow more than a few cell layers thick without an active blood supply. The prenatal circulation of blood is different than the postnatal circulation, mainly because the lungs are not in use. The fetus obtains oxygen and nutrients from the mother through the placenta and the umbilical cord.[36]\\r\\nBlood from the placenta is carried to the fetus by the umbilical vein. About half of this enters the fetal ductus venosus and is carried to the inferior vena cava, while the other half enters the liver proper from the inferior border of the liver. The branch of the umbilical vein that supplies the right lobe of the liver first joins with the portal vein. The blood then moves to the right atrium of the heart. In the fetus, there is an opening between the right and left atrium (the foramen ovale), and most of the blood flows from the right into the left atrium, thus bypassing pulmonary circulation. The majority of blood flow is into the left ventricle from where it is pumped through the aorta into the body. Some of the blood moves from the aorta through the internal iliac arteries to the umbilical arteries, and re-enters the placenta, where carbon dioxide and other waste products from the fetus are taken up and enter the woman's circulation.[36]\\r\\nSome of the blood from the right atrium does not enter the left atrium, but enters the right ventricle and is pumped into the pulmonary artery. In the fetus, there is a special connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, called the ductus arteriosus, which directs most of this blood away from the lungs (which aren't being used for respiration at this point as the fetus is suspended in amniotic fluid).[36]\\r\\nWith the first breath after birth, the system changes suddenly. Pulmonary resistance is reduced dramatically, prompting more blood to move into the pulmonary arteries from the right atrium and ventricle of the heart and less to flow through the foramen ovale into the left atrium. The blood from the lungs travels through the pulmonary veins to the left atrium, producing an increase in pressure that pushes the septum primum against the septum secundum, closing the foramen ovale and completing the separation of the newborn's circulatory system into the standard left and right sides. Thereafter, the foramen ovale is known as the fossa ovalis.\\r\\nThe ductus arteriosus normally closes within one or two days of birth, leaving the ligamentum arteriosum, while the umbilical vein and ductus venosus usually closes within two to five days after birth, leaving, respectively, the liver's ligamentum teres and ligamentum venosus.\\r\\nRemnants of the fetal circulation can be found in the adult.[37][38]\\r\\nIn addition to differences in circulation, the developing fetus also employs a different type of oxygen transport molecule in its hemoglobin from that when it is born and breathing its own oxygen. Fetal hemoglobin enhances the fetus' ability to draw oxygen from the placenta. Its oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is shifted to the left, meaning that it is able to absorb oxygen at lower concentrations than adult hemoglobin. This enables fetal hemoglobin to absorb oxygen from adult hemoglobin in the placenta, where the oxygen pressure is lower than at the lungs. Until around six months' old, the human infant's hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha and two gamma chains (2ϫ2). The gamma chains are gradually replaced by beta chains until the molecule becomes hemoglobin A with its two alpha and two beta chains (2ϫ2).\\r\\n3D ultrasound of 3-inch (76?mm) fetus (about 3-1/2 months gestational age)\\r\\nFetus at 4-1/4 months\\r\\nFetus at 5 months\\r\\nThe placenta functions as a maternal-fetal barrier against the transmission of microbes. When this is insufficient, mother-to-child transmission of infectious diseases can occur.\\r\\nMaternal IgG antibodies cross the placenta, giving the fetus passive immunity against those diseases for which the mother has antibodies. This transfer of antibodies in humans begins as early as the fifth month (gestational age) and certainly by the sixth month.[39]\\r\\nA developing fetus is highly susceptible to anomalies in its growth and metabolism, increasing the risk of birth defects. One area of concern is the pregnant woman's lifestyle choices made during pregnancy.[40] Diet is especially important in the early stages of development. Studies show that supplementation of the woman's diet with folic acid reduces the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube defects. Another dietary concern is whether breakfast is eaten. Skipping breakfast could lead to extended periods of lower than normal nutrients in the woman's blood, leading to a higher risk of prematurity, or other birth defects in the fetus. During this time alcohol consumption may increase the risk of the development of fetal alcohol syndrome, a condition leading to intellectual disability in some infants.[41]\\r\\nSmoking during pregnancy may also lead to reduced birth weight. Low birth weight is defined as 2500?grams (5.5?lb). Low birth weight is a concern for medical providers due to the tendency of these infants, described as \\"premature by weight\\", to have a higher risk of secondary medical problems. Some research shows that fetal ultrasounds (including Doppler, 3D/4D ultrasound and 2D ultrasound) can have negative effect on birth weight and neurodevelopment.[42]\\r\\nCongenital anomalies are acquired before birth. Infants with certain congenital anomalies of the heart can survive only as long as the ductus remains open: in such cases the closure of the ductus can be delayed by the administration of prostaglandins to permit sufficient time for the surgical correction of the anomalies. Conversely, in cases of patent ductus arteriosus, where the ductus does not properly close, drugs that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis can be used to encourage its closure, so that surgery can be avoided.\\r\\nAbortion of a human pregnancy is legal and/or tolerated in most countries, although with gestational time limits that normally prohibit late-term abortions.[43]\\r\\nA fetus is a stage in the prenatal development of viviparous organisms. This stage lies between embryogenesis and birth. Many vertebrates have fetal stages, ranging from most mammals to many fish. In addition, some invertebrates bear live young, including some species of onychophora[44] and many arthropods. The prevalence of convergent evolution to the fetal stage shows that it is relatively easy to develop. It presumably originates from a delay of egg release, with the eggs being hatched inside the parent before being laid. Over time, the robustness of the egg wall can be decreased until it becomes little more than a sac.\\r\\nThe fetuses of most mammals are situated similarly to the human fetus within their mothers.[45] However, the anatomy of the area surrounding a fetus is different in litter-bearing animals compared to humans: each fetus of a litter-bearing animal is surrounded by placental tissue and is lodged along one of two long uteri instead of the single uterus found in a human female.\\r\\nDevelopment at birth varies considerably among animals, and even among mammals. Altricial species are relatively helpless at birth and require considerable parental care and protection. In contrast, precocial animals are born with open eyes, have hair or down, have large brains, and are immediately mobile and somewhat able to flee from, or defend themselves against, predators. Primates are precocial at birth, with the exception of humans.[46]\\r\\nThe duration of gestation in placental mammals varies from 18 days in jumping mice to 23 months in elephants.[47] Generally speaking, fetuses of larger land mammals require longer gestation periods.[47]\\r\\nThe benefits of a fetal stage means that young are more developed when they are born. Therefore, they may need less parental care and may be better able to fend for themselves. However, carrying fetuses exerts costs on the mother, who must take on extra food to fuel the growth of her offspring, and whose mobility and comfort may be affected (especially toward the end of the fetal stage).\\r\\nIn some instances, the presence of a fetal stage may allow organisms to time the birth of their offspring to a favorable season.[44]","input":"When is an unborn child called a fetus?"},{"output":"Muhammad","context":"Brotherhood among the Sahaba refers to the time after the Hijra when the Islamic prophet Muhammad instituted brotherhood between the emigrants, Muhajirun, and the helpers, Ansar, and he chose Ali as his own brother.[1]\\r\\nA list includes:","input":"Who established brotherhood between the muhajireen and ansar?"},{"output":"Vi Lyles","context":"Jennifer Roberts\\r\\nDemocratic\\r\\nVi Lyles\\r\\nDemocratic\\r\\nThe 2017 Charlotte mayoral election took place on Tuesday, November 7, 2017.

In California, it was particularly admired for its beauty, size, and strength. The grizzly became a symbol of the Bear Flag Republic, a moniker that was attached to the short-lived attempt by a group of American settlers to break away from Mexico in 1846. Later, this rebel flag became the basis for the state flag of California, and then California was known as the \\"Bear State.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1953 researcher stated, \\"The specific status of North American brown bears (or grizzly bears) is one of the most complex problems of mammalian taxonomy. The difficulty stems directly from the work of Merriam (1918), who concluded that there are 86 forms of grizzlies (and brown bears) in North America.\\"[5]\\r\\nNorth American grizzlies were taxonomically grouped as a species apart from other bear species, until DNA testing revealed that they should properly be grouped in the same species as the other brown bears.[3] Grizzlies living in California had been classified by Merriam into many subspecies, but the only genetically anomalous grouping in North America is the ABC Islands bears.[6]\\r\\nThe California grizzly is one of the state's most visible and enduring symbols, adorning both the state flag and seal. The Bear Flag first flew in 1846 as a symbol of the short-lived California Republic. A second version was adopted as the state flag by the state legislature in 1911.[7] The bear symbol became a permanent part of the state seal in 1849. The California Grizzly was designated the official state animal in 1953.[8][9] The bear is celebrated in name and as mascot of the sports teams of the University of California, Berkeley (the California Golden Bears), and of the University of California, Los Angeles (the UCLA Bruins) and in the mascot of University of California, Riverside (Scottie the Bear, dressed in a Highland kilt). The California Maritime Academy operates a training ship named \\"Golden Bear\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first recorded encounters of California grizzlies by the Europeans are in the diaries kept by several members of the 1769 Portola expedition, first exploration by land of what is now the state of California. Several place names that include the Spanish word for bear (oso) trace their origins back to that first expedition (e.g. Los Osos).\\r\\nAs the settled frontier of New Spain was extended northward, settlers began to populate California and establish large cattle herds as the main industry. The grizzly bears killed livestock and so became enemies of the rancheros. Vaqueros hunted the grizzlies, sometimes roping and capturing them to be displayed in public battles with bulls.[10] This popular spectator sport inspired betting as to whether the bear or the bull would win.\\r\\nOne popular, though false[11] account is that Horace Greeley, after seeing such a fight, gave the modern stock market its \\"bear\\" and \\"bull\\" nicknames  based on the fighting styles of the two animals: the bear swipes downward while the bull hooks upward.\\r\\nIn 1866, a grizzly described as weighing as much as 2,200 pounds (1,000?kg) was killed in Valley Center, California, the biggest bear ever found in California, as recalled in 1932 by Catherine E. Lovett Smith, who had been six years old at the time and on whose family's ranch the bear had been found; Lovett Smith stated that this was where Valley Center got its original name of \\"Bear Valley\\" (other sources concurred as to the story of the bear, but differed on its size).[12]\\r\\nLess than 75 years after the discovery of gold in 1848, almost every grizzly bear in California had been tracked down and killed. One prospector in Southern California, William F. Holcomb (nicknamed \\"Grizzly Bill\\" Holcomb), was particularly well known for hunting grizzly bears in what is now San Bernardino County. The last hunted California grizzly was shot in Tulare County, California, in August 1922, although no body, skeleton or pelt was ever produced. Two years later in 1924, what was thought to be a grizzly was spotted in Sequoia National Park for the last time, and thereafter, grizzlies were never seen again in California.[12][13][14]\\r\\nCalifornian grizzlies had been pitted against other animals, such as bulls.[15]\\r\\nCalifornia still has habitat for about 500 grizzlies.[16] In 2014, the US Fish and Wildlife Service received and rejected a petition to reintroduce grizzly bears to California.[17][18] In 2015 the Center for Biological Diversity launched a petition aimed at the California state legislature to reintroduce the grizzly bear to the state.[19][20][21] The California grizzly bear has been considered as a possible candidate for attempts at deextinction, through the proposed use of back-breeding, cloning and genetic engineering to recreate extinct species.[22]\\r\\n Data related to Ursus arctos californicus at Wikispecies","input":"What kind of bear is the california flag?"},{"output":"February 18, 1974","context":"The Waltons is an American television series created by Earl Hamner, Jr., based on his book Spencer's Mountain, and a 1963 film of the same name, about a family in rural Virginia during the Great Depression and World War II.\\r\\nThe series pilot The Homecoming: A Christmas Story was broadcast on December 19, 1971.[1] Beginning in September 1972, the series aired on CBS for nine seasons.

John-Boy is the oldest of the children (17 years old in the beginning),[4] who becomes a journalist and novelist. Each episode is narrated at the opening and closing by a middle-aged John Jr. (voiced by author Earl Hamner on whom John-Boy is based). John Sr. manages to eke out a living for his family by operating a lumber mill with his sons' help as they grow older. The family income is augmented by some small-scale farming, and John occasionally hunts to put meat on the table. In the simpler days of their country youth, all of the children are rambunctious and curious, but as times grow tough and the Walton youths grow up to deal with them, the children slowly depart from the innocent, carefree days of walking everywhere barefoot while clad in overalls and hand-sewn pinafores, and into the harsh, demanding world of adulthood and responsibility.\\r\\nThe family shares hospitality with relatives and strangers as they are able.

Jefferson County sheriff Ep Bridges, who fought alongside John in World War I, keeps law and order in Walton's Mountain. The entire family (except for John) attends a Baptist church, of which Olivia and Grandma Esther are the most regular attendees.

See main article for a more complete list.\\r\\nEarl Hamner's rural childhood growing up in the unincorporated community of Schuyler, Virginia, provided the basis for the setting and many of the storylines of The Waltons. His family and the community provided many life experiences which aided in the characters, values, area, and human-interest stories of his books, movies, and television series. Hamner provided the voice-over of the older John-Boy, usually heard at the beginning and end of each episode.\\r\\nJohn-Boy Walton's fictional alma mater, Boatwright University, is patterned after Richmond College, which became part of the University of Richmond on Boatwright Drive near Westham Station in The West End of Richmond, Virginia, about seventy miles east of Schuyler.\\r\\nThe town of Walton's Mountain was built in the rear area of the Warner Bros. Studios, but the mountain itself was part of the range opposite Warner studios in Burbank, California. The Waltons' house facade was built in the back of the Warner Brothers lot. After the series concluded, the set was destroyed. For the reunion shows, a replica Waltons' house facade was built on the Here Come the Brides set on the Columbia Ranch studio, now part of the Warner Brothers studios. The Waltons' house is still used as scenery at Warner Brothers. For example, it served as the Dragonfly Inn on The Gilmore Girls.\\r\\nSome sources indicate CBS put the show on its Fall 1972 schedule in response to congressional hearings on the quality of television. Backlash from a 1971 decision to purge most rural-oriented shows from the network lineup may have also been a factor. The network gave The Waltons an undesirable timeslot ÿ Thursdays at 8 p.m., opposite two popular programs: The Flip Wilson Show on NBC and The Mod Squad on ABC.[9] \\"The rumor was that they put it against Flip Wilson and The Mod Squad because they didn't think it would survive. They thought, 'We can just tell Congress America doesn't want to see this',\\" Kami Cotler, who played Elizabeth Walton, said in a 2012 interview.[9] However, CBS had enough faith in the show to devise a full-page newspaper ad flanked with the show's positive reviews, urging people to watch the show. This ad was attributed to saving The Waltons, causing the ratings to radically increase.[10]\\r\\nRalph Waite was reluctant to audition for the part of John Walton because he didn't want to be tied to a long-running TV series, but his agent persuaded him by saying, \\"It will never sell. You do the pilot. You pick up a couple of bucks and then you go back to New York.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe Waltons won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 1973. Also in 1973 Richard Thomas won the Emmy for Lead Actor in a Drama Series. Michael Learned won the Emmy for Lead Actress in a Drama Series three times (1973, 1974, and 1976). Ellen Corby was also a three-time winner in the Supporting Actress category, winning in 1973, 1975, and 1976. Will Geer was awarded the Supporting Actor Emmy in 1975. Veteran actress Beulah Bondi won an Emmy in 1977 for Lead Actress in a Single Performance for her guest appearance as Martha Corrine Walton in the episode \\"The Pony Cart\\" (Episode #111). She first appeared in The Waltons episode \\"The Conflict\\" (Episode #51) as the widow of Zeb Walton's brother.\\r\\nThe series also earned a Peabody Award for its first season.[20]\\r\\nIn 2013, TV Guide ranked The Waltons No. 34 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.[21]\\r\\nIn 2017, from March 20 to March 24 INSP network remembered the life of Earl Hamner Jr. (who had died in 2016) by featuring clips of interviews (once per episode) with him about his time involved with The Waltons during the breaks while its syndicated reruns aired from 3-5PM and again at 7PM.\\r\\nThe Waltons Reunion movies:\\r\\nThe Walton's Reunion Movie Collection:\\r\\n1.

Television to avoid a lawsuit owing to the similarities between the series and the film Spencer's Mountain, which Warners owned.[23] Warner Bros. acquired Lorimar in 1989, and has continued to syndicate the series ever since.

Along many coastlines, the Moon contributes the major part (67%) of the combined lunar and solar tides. The exact interval between tides is influenced by the position of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth, as well as the specific location on Earth where the tide is being measured. Due to the Moon's orbital prograde motion, it takes a particular point on the Earth (on average) 24 hours and 50.5 minutes to rotate under the Moon, so the time between high lunar tides fluctuates between 12 and 13 hours. A tide clock is divided into two roughly 6-hour tidal periods that shows the average length of time between high and low tides in a semi-diurnal tide region, such as most areas of the Atlantic Ocean.\\r\\nTraditional Mechanical Tide Clocks:\\r\\nThe bottom of the tide clock dial (6 o-clock position) is marked \\"low tide\\" and the top of the tide clock dial (12 oclock position) is marked \\"high tide.\\" The left side of the dial is marked \\"hours until high tide\\" and has a count-down of hours from 5 to 1. There is one hand on the clock face, and along the left side it points to the number of hours \\"until\\" the (lunar) high tide. The right hand side of the clock is marked \\"hours until low tide\\" and has a count-down of hours from 5 to 1. The number pointed to by the hand gives the time \\"until\\" the (lunar) low tide. Some tide clocks incorporate time (using standard quartz movement) and even humidity and temperature in the same instrument.\\r\\nSome tide clocks count down the number of hours from high or low tide, as in \\"one hour past high or low tide\\". When the clock reaches the half way point (\\"half-tide\\"), it then counts the hours up to high tide or low tide, as in \\"one hour until high or low tide\\". Generally, there is an adjustment knob on the back on the instrument which may be used to set the tide using official tide tables for a specific location at either high or low tide.\\r\\nTides have an inherent lead or lag, known as the lunitidal interval, that is different at every location, so tidal clocks are set for the time when the local lunar high tide occurs. This is often complicated because the lead or lag varies during the course of the lunar month, as the lunar and solar tides fall into and out of synchronization. The lunar tide and solar tide are synchronized (ebb and flow at the same time) near the full moon and the new moon. The two tides are unsynchronized near the first and last quarter moon (or \\"half moon\\"). Also, in addition to the relative position of the moon and the elliptical pattern of the sun, the tide can be affected to some degree by wind and atmospheric pressure. All of these variables have less impact on the tide at the time of the full moon, so this is usually the best time to set a tide clock. If the tide clock is mounted on a moving boat, it will need to be reset more frequently. The best time to set the clock is at the new moon or the full moon, which is also when the clock can most reliably indicate the actual combined tide. A simple tide clock will always be least reliable near the quarter moon.\\r\\nTide range is the vertical distance between the highest high tide and lowest low tide. The size of the lunar tide compared to the solar tide (which comes once every 12 hours) is generally about 2 to 1, but the actual proportion along any particular shore depends on the location, orientation, and shape of the local bay or estuary. Along some shorelines, the solar tide is the only important tide, and ordinary 12-hour clocks suffice since the high and low tides come at nearly the same time every day. Because ordinary tidal clocks only track a part of the tidal effect, and because the relative size of the combined effects is different in different places, they are in general only partially accurate for tracking the tides. Consequently, all navigators use tide tables either in a booklet, computer or digital tide clock.\\r\\nAnalog tide clocks are most accurate for use on the Atlantic coasts of America and Europe. This is because along the Atlantic coastline the moon controls the tides predictably, ebbing and flowing on a regular (12- to 13-hour) schedule. However, in other parts of the world such as along the Pacific Coast, tides can be irregular.[1] The Pacific Ocean is so vast that the moon cannot control the entire ocean at once. The result is that parts of the Pacific Coast can have 3 high tides a day. Similarly, there are areas in the world like the Gulf of Mexico or the South China Sea that have only one high tide a day. Mechanical tide clocks used on the Pacific Coast must be adjusted frequently, often as much as weekly, and are not useful in diurnal areas (those with one tide per day).[2]\\r\\nDigital Tide Clocks:\\r\\nDigital tide clocks are not married to the 24 hour 50.5 minute tide cycle and thus track tides beyond the Atlantic coast. Smart digital tide clocks can work across all locations in North America without any adjustments. This is achieved by storing all the variations of tides at numerous locations. Given a particular location and date/time, a digital tide clock can display the previous tide, next tide and current absolute tide height. Thus, they are able to track semi-diurnal, diurnal and mixed diurnal tides.[3]","input":"How long does it take for the tide to come in?"},{"output":"a 17-year-old boy, who, after the death of his mother, moves in with his estranged relatives, the Codys, a criminal family clan governed by matriarch Smurf","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimal Kingdom is an American drama television series developed by Jonathan Lisco.

The plot follows two drag queens played by Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce and a transgender woman, played by Terence Stamp, as they journey across the Australian Outback from Sydney to Alice Springs in a tour bus that they have named \\"Priscilla\\", along the way encountering various groups and individuals. The film's title references the slang term \\"queen\\" for a drag queen or female impersonator.\\r\\nThe film was a surprise worldwide hit[2] and its positive portrayal of LGBT individuals helped to introduce LGBT themes to a mainstream audience. It received predominantly positive reviews and won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design at the 67th Academy Awards. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section of the 1994 Cannes Film Festival[3] and became a cult classic in both Australia and abroad. Priscilla subsequently provided the basis for a musical, Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, which opened in 2006 in Sydney before travelling to New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Canada and Broadway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnthony \\"Tick\\" Belrose (Hugo Weaving), using the drag pseudonym of Mitzi Del Bra, is a Sydney based drag queen who accepts an offer to perform his drag act at Lasseter's Hotel Casino Resort managed by his estranged wife Marion in Alice Springs, a remote town in central Australia. After persuading his friends and fellow performers, Bernadette Bassenger (Terence Stamp), a recently bereaved transgender woman, and Adam Whitely (Guy Pearce), a flamboyant and obnoxious younger drag queen who goes under the drag name Felicia Jollygoodfellow, to join him, the three set out for a four-week run at the casino in a large tour bus, which Adam christens \\"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\\".\\r\\nWhile on the long journey through remote lands bordering the Simpson Desert, they meet a variety of characters, including a group of friendly Aboriginal Australians for whom they perform, the less accepting attitudes of rural Australia in such towns as Coober Pedy, and are subjected to homophobic abuse, violence, including having their tour bus vandalized with homophobic graffiti.\\r\\nWhen the tour bus breaks down in the middle of the desert, Adam spends the whole day repainting it lavender to cover up the vandalism. The trio later meet Bob, a middle-aged mechanic from a small outback town who joins them on their journey. Before they arrive at Alice Springs, Tick reveals that Marion is actually his wife, as they never divorced, and that they are actually going there as a favour to her. Continuing their journey, Adam is almost mutilated by a homophobic gang before he is saved by Bob and Bernadette. Adam is shaken and Bernadette comforts him, allowing them to reach an understanding. Likewise, the others come to terms with the secret of Tick's marriage and resolve their differences. Together, they fulfill a long-held dream of Adam's, which, in the original plan, is to climb King's Canyon in full drag regalia.\\r\\nUpon arrival at the hotel, it is revealed that Tick and Marion also have an eight-year-old son, Benjamin, whom Tick has not seen for many years. Tick is nervous about exposing his son to his drag profession and anxious about revealing his homosexuality, though he is surprised to discover that Benjamin already knows and is fully supportive of his father's sexuality and career. By the time their contract at the resort is over, Tick and Adam head back to Sydney, taking Benjamin back with them, so that Tick can get to know his son. However, Bernadette decides to remain at the resort for a while with Bob, who has decided to work at the hotel after the two of them had become close.\\r\\nThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert had originally been conceived by filmmakers Stephan Elliott and Andrena Finlay, who were at the time in production of a film called Frauds. They initially tried to pitch Priscilla to various financiers at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival, but were unsuccessful,[4] and so instead took the film's concept to PolyGram and, with the backing of the Australian Film Finance Corporation, were able to begin production of the film on a relatively low budget of 2.7 million Australian dollars.\\r\\nElliott and the film's producers, Michael Hamlyn and Al Clark, the latter of whom was the husband of Finlay, all agreed to work for $50,000 each, a relatively low fee for filmmakers at the time, while the lack of funding meant that the crew agreed to receive takings of the film's eventual profits in compensation for their low salaries.[5] Due to the involvement of the Australian FFC, only one non-Australian actor was allowed to appear in the film, and Clark initially considered David Bowie, whom he had known back in the 1980s, and later briefly thought of John Hurt, although neither was available.[6]\\r\\nIn May 1993, after travelling around the Australian Outback searching for appropriate sites to film in, Priscilla's creators attended the Cannes to advertise their project, despite the fact that they had not yet confirmed any actors for the roles. Their primary choice for the role of Bernadette was Tony Curtis, who read and approved of the script, but eventually became unavailable. They then approached John Cleese, who was not interested.\\r\\nFor the part of Tick, they had initially wanted Rupert Everett and for Adam they wanted Jason Donovan.[7] However, at a pre-production casting meeting held at Cannes, Everett and Donovan did not get on well with one another and were found to be openly hostile toward the production staff. In light of this, it was readily agreed that they would not be suitable for the parts[8] and the search for their three leading men would resume. However, Donovan would go on to play Tick in the West End musical adaptation of the film.\\r\\nAfter unsuccessfully lobbying Colin Firth to play the role, producers eventually awarded the part to Hugo Weaving. Initially considering Tim Curry for the part of Bernadette, they cast Terence Stamp, who was initially anxious about the role because it was unlike anything that he had performed previously, although he eventually came on board with the concept.[9] Stamp himself suggested Bill Hunter for the role of Bob, who accepted the role without even reading the script or being told anything about the greater concept of the film other than the basic character description, while Australian actor Guy Pearce was hired at the eleventh hour direct from the Australian soap opera Snowy River to portray the sassy but sprite Adam.[10]\\r\\nAl Clark[11]\\r\\nMany scenes, including one where Bernadette encounters a butch, bigoted, Australian woman named Shirley, were filmed at the Outback town of Broken Hill in New South Wales, largely in a hotel known as Mario's Palace, also small scenes filmed in the All Nations Hotel, which Al Clark believed was \\"drag queen heaven\\".[12] They also decided to film at Coober Pedy, a rough-and-tumble mining town in Central Australia featured prominently in the film.[13]\\r\\nInitially, they tried to get permission to film upon the geological formation formerly known as Ayers Rock or \\"the Rock\\" (Uluru), but this was rejected by organizations responsible for the monument, such as the Uluru Board of Management, as it would have been in violation of Indigenous Australian religious beliefs.[14] Instead, the scene was filmed in King's Canyon.[15] Dialogue from the scene was rewritten slightly to accommodate the new location.\\r\\nWith filming over, the director and producers began editing the footage, repeatedly travelling to both London and to Los Angeles, which had then just been hit by the 1994 Northridge earthquake. On the advice of early viewers, the film was shortened and scenes such as Adam's flashback about his paedophilic uncle were edited.[16]\\r\\nThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert took $18,459,245 at the box office in Australia,[17] which is equivalent to $28,529,000 in 2010. [18]\\r\\nBeing an Australian film, not an American-produced Hollywood blockbuster, Priscilla was released as a minor commercial product in North America and other English-speaking nations.[19]\\r\\nDirector Elliott noted that the audiences viewing the film in Australia, the United States, and France all reacted to it differently, going on to state that \\"At a screening we had for an Australian audience, they laughed at all the Aussieisms. The Americans laughed too, but at different jokes. There is a line where Tick says, 'Bernadette has left her cake out in the rain...' [The French audience] didn't get it, whereas the Americans laughed for ten minutes.\\"[20] Tom O'Regan, a scholar of film studies, remarked that the film actually carried different meanings for members of different nationalities and subcultural groups, with LGBT Americans believing that the film was \\"the big one that will bring gay lifestyles into the mainstream\\", while Australians tended to \\"embrace it as just another successful Australian film\\".[21]\\r\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, Priscilla has a 93% \\"fresh\\" rating based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10; the consensus states: \\"While its premise is ripe for comedy  and it certainly delivers its fair share of laughs , Priscilla is also a surprisingly tender and thoughtful road movie with some outstanding performances.\\"[22] Metacritic reports a 68 out of 100 rating, based on 19 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[23]\\r\\nAmerican film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt that Bernadette was the key part of the film, stating that \\"the real subject of the movie is not homosexuality, not drag queens, not showbiz, but simply the life of a middle-aged person trapped in a job that has become tiresome.\\"[24] Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote \\"The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert presents a defiant culture clash in generous, warmly entertaining ways.\\"[25] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone commented \\"In this roaringly comic and powerfully affecting road movie, Terence Stamp gives one of the years best performances.\\"[25] Kenneth Turan from the Los Angeles Times wrote \\"The comic pizazz and bawdy dazzle of this films vision of gaudy drag performers trekking across the Australian outback certainly has a boisterous, addictive way about it.\\"[25]\\r\\nThe film was ranked 7th on Logo's 50 Greatest Films with an LGBT theme,[26] and #10 on AfterElton's Fifty Greatest Gay Movies list.[27]\\r\\nPriscilla, along with other contemporary Australian films Young Einstein (1988), Sweetie (1989), Strictly Ballroom (1992), and Muriel's Wedding (1994), provided Australian cinema with a reputation for \\"quirkiness\\", \\"eccentricity\\" and \\"individuality\\" across the world.[2] Both Priscilla and Muriel's Wedding (which had also featured a soundtrack containing ABBA songs) in particular became cult classics, not only in their native Australia, but also in the United Kingdom, where a wave of Australian influences, such as the soap operas Neighbours and Home and Away, had made their mark in the late 1980s and early 1990s.[28]\\r\\nIn 1995, an American film, To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar, was released, featuring three drag queens who travel across the United States. According to Al Clark, the creators of Priscilla heard about the film while shooting theirs, and \\"for a moment [were] troubled\\" until they read the script of To Wong Foo, when they decided that it was sufficiently different from Priscilla to not be a commercial and critical threat.[29] To Wong Foo proved to be critically far less successful than Priscilla, only gaining a 41% fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes.[30] Financially however, To Wong Foo did better at the box office making three times as much in the U.S. with over 36 million dollars.[31]\\r\\nDuring the Closing Ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Priscilla was part of a parade of images of Australian popular culture. A 1980 Ford Denning (resembling the bus used in the film) featuring a giant steel stiletto heel which extended from and retracted into the roof  inspired by scenes from the film  paraded around the Olympic Stadium. The bus was accompanied by several stiletto heel tricycle floats and drag queens in big wigs in tribute to the film's international success and the local Sydney gay community.[32][33] The music video for Iggy Azalea's 2013 single \\"Work\\" paid homage to scenes from the film.[34]\\r\\nThe film has come under criticism for alleged racist and sexist elements, particularly in the portrayal of the Filipina character, Cynthia. Melba Margison of the Centre for Filipino Concerns stated that Cynthia was portrayed as \\"a gold-digger, a prostitute, an entertainer whose expertise is popping out ping-pong balls from her sex-organ, a manic depressive, loud and vulgar. The worst stereotype of the Filipina.\\" She argued that, by portraying Cynthia in this manner, the filmmakers were \\"violently kill[ing]\\" the dignity of Filipina women, something that she feared would lead to \\"more violence against us\\".[35] An editor writing in The Age echoed these concerns, highlighting that \\"It is perhaps a pity that a film with a message of tolerance and acceptance for homosexuals should feel the need of what looks very much to us like a racist and sexist stereotype.\\"[35] Similarly, in his study of bisexuality in cinema, Wayne M. Bryant argued that while it was \\"an excellent film\\", The Adventures of Priscilla was marred by \\"instances of gratuitous sexism\\".[36]\\r\\nProducer Clark defended the film against these accusations, arguing that while Cynthia was a stereotype, it was not the purpose of filmmakers to avoid the portrayal of \\"vulnerable characters\\" from specific minority backgrounds. He stated that she was \\"a misfit like the three protagonists are, and just about everybody else in the film is, and her presence is no more a statement about Filipino women than having three drag queens is a statement about Australian men.\\"[35] Tom O'Regan noted that as a result of this controversy, the film gained \\"an ambiguous reputation.\\"[37]\\r\\nThe film featured a soundtrack made up of pre-existing \\"camp classics\\" (pop music songs that have a particular fanbase in the LGBT community). The original plan by the film's creators was to have a Kylie Minogue song in the finale, although it was later decided that an ABBA song would be more appropriate because its \\"tacky qualities\\" were \\"more timeless\\"[38] (although in the musical adaptation, the character Adam performs a medley of Kylie Minogue songs atop Uluru). The film itself featured four main songs, which were performed by two or more of the drag queens as a part of their show within the film; \\"I've Never Been to Me\\" by Charlene, \\"I Will Survive\\" by Gloria Gaynor, \\"Finally\\" by CeCe Peniston, and \\"Mamma Mia\\" by ABBA. On 23 August 1994, Fontana Island released the soundtrack on CD.[39]\\r\\nOriginal music for the soundtrack was composed by Guy Gross, with choral arrangements by Derek Williams, and released separately on CD.[40]\\r\\nOn 14 November 1995, the film was released on VHS. On 7 October 1997, it was released on DVD with a collectible trivia booklet.\\r\\nIn 2004, a 10th Anniversary Collector's Edition was released on DVD in Australia with the following special features: a feature-length audio commentary with writer/director Stephan Elliott, three deleted scenes, two featurettes: \\"Behind the Bus: Priscilla with Her Pants Down\\" and \\"Ladies Please\\", cast and crew biographies, the original Australian theatrical trailer, US theatrical and teaser trailers, and a number of hidden features\\r\\nIn 2006, it was re-released on DVD in Australia with the following special features: a feature-length audio commentary with writer/director Elliott, \\"Birth of a Queen\\" (featurette), deleted scenes, tidbits from the Set, \\"The Bus from Blooperville\\" ÿ Gag reel documentary, a photo gallery, and US theatrical and teaser trailers.\\r\\nOn 5 June 2007, it was re-released in the United States as the \\"Extra Frills Edition\\" DVD.

The DACA policy was rescinded by the Trump administration on September 5, 2017, but full implementation of the rescission was delayed six months to give Congress time to decide how to deal with the population that was previously eligible under the policy.[2]\\r\\nResearch shows that DACA increased the wages and labor force participation of DACA-eligible immigrants,[3][4][5] and reduced the number of unauthorized immigrant households living in poverty.[6] Studies have shown that DACA increased the mental health outcomes for DACA-eligible immigrants and their children.[7][8][9] There are no known major adverse impacts from DACA on native-born workers' employment while most economists say that DACA benefits the U.S. economy.[10][11][12][13] To be eligible for the program, recipients may not have felonies or serious misdemeanors on their records. There is no evidence that DACA-eligible individuals are more likely to commit crimes than any other person within the US.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe policy was created after acknowledgment that dreamer students had been largely raised in the United States, and this was seen as a way to remove immigration enforcement attention from \\"low priority\\" individuals with good behavior.[15][16] The illegal immigrant student population was rapidly increasing; approximately 65,000 illegal immigrant students graduate from U.S. high schools on a yearly basis.[17]\\r\\nThe DREAM Act bill, which would have provided a pathway to permanent residency for unauthorized immigrants brought to the United States upon meeting certain qualifications, was considered by Congress in 2007. It failed to overcome a bipartisan filibuster in the Senate.[18] It was considered again in 2011. The bill passed the House, but did not get the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster in the Senate.[19][18] In 2013, legislation had comprehensively reformed the immigration system, including allowing Dreamers permission to stay in the country, work and attend school; this passed the Senate but was not brought up for a vote in the House.[18] The New York Times credits the failure of Congress to pass the DREAM Act bill as the driver behind Obama's decision to sign DACA.[18]\\r\\nPresident Barack Obama announced this policy with a speech in the Rose Garden of the White House on June 15, 2012.[20] The date was chosen as the 30th anniversary of Plyler v. Doe, a Supreme Court decision barring public schools from charging illegal immigrant children tuition. The policy was officially established by a memorandum from the Secretary of Homeland Security titled \\"Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children\\".[21] This policy allowed certain immigrants to escape deportation and obtain work permits for a period of two years- renewable upon good behavior. To apply, immigrants had to be younger than 31 on June 15, 2012, must have come to the U.S. when they were younger than 16, and must have lived in the U.S. since 2007. In August 2012, the Pew Research Center estimated that up to 1.7 million people were eligible.[22]\\r\\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) began accepting applications for the program on August 15, 2012.[22] As of June 2016[update], USCIS had received 844,931 initial applications for DACA status, of which 741,546 (88%) were approved, 60,269 (7%) were denied, and 43,121 (5%) were pending. Over half of those accepted reside in California and Texas.[23] According to an August 2017 survey, most current registrants (called \\"Dreamers\\" in a reference to the DREAM Act bill) are in their 20s, and about 80% arrived in the United States when they were 10 or younger.[24]\\r\\nIn November 2014, Obama announced his intention to expand DACA to make more people eligible.[25][26] However, in December 2014, Texas and 25 other states, all with Republican governors, sued the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas asking the court to enjoin implementation of both the DACA expansion and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans,(a similar program).[27][28][29] In February 2015, Judge Andrew S. Hanen issued a preliminary injunction blocking the expansion from going into effect while the case, Texas v. United States, proceeds.[30][31] After progressing through the court system, an equally divided (4ÿ4) Supreme Court left the injunction in place, without setting any precedent.[32]\\r\\nRepublican Party leaders denounced the DACA program as an abuse of executive power.[33]\\r\\nNearly all Republicans in the House of Representatives (along with three Democrats) voted 224ÿ201 to defund DACA in June 2013.[34] Lead author of the amendment Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) stated, \\"The point here is...the President does not have the authority to waive immigration law, nor does he have the authority to create it out of thin air, and he's done both with these Morton memos in this respect.\\"[35] However, in practice Congress does not have the ability to defund DACA since the program is almost entirely funded by its own application fees rather than congressional appropriations.[36]\\r\\nDACA was formally initiated by a policy memorandum sent from Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to the heads of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The memo formally directed them to exercise their enforcement discretion on behalf of individuals who met the requirements.[38]\\r\\nTo apply for DACA, illegal immigrants must pay a $495 application fee, submit several forms, and produce documents showing they meet the requirements. They do not need legal representation.\\r\\nTo be eligible, illegal immigrants must have entered the United States before their 16th birthday and prior to June 2007, be currently in school, a high school graduate or be honorably discharged from the military, be under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012, and not have been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor or three other misdemeanors, or otherwise pose a threat to national security. The program does not provide lawful status or a path to citizenship,[39] nor does it provide eligibility for federal welfare or student aid.[3]\\r\\nIn August 2012, the Migration Policy Institute estimated that as many as 1.76 million people could be eligible for DACA. Of those, 28% were under 15 and would have to wait until reaching that age to apply. In addition, roughly 20% did not meet any of the education criteria, but could become eligible by enrolling in a program before submitting their application. 74% of the eligible population was born in Mexico or Central America. Smaller proportions came from Caribbean and South America (11%), Asia (9%), and the rest of the world (6%).[40]\\r\\nTo qualify for DACA, applicants must meet the following major requirements, although meeting them does not guarantee approval:[39]\\r\\nTo show proof of qualification (verify these requirements), applicants must submit three forms; I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals; I-765, Application for Employment Authorization; and I-765WS, Worksheet, as well as supporting documentation.[39]\\r\\nIn addition to the $495 application fee, if a DACA qualifying illegal immigrant wants to travel abroad there is an additional fee and application requirement.\\r\\nForm I-131 Application Type D*, with a fee of $575 needs to be submitted to USCIS.[41]\\r\\n(Form I-131 must also be submitted by anyone that applies for a \\"Green Card\\" or other residency option regardless of how they arrived upon US soil).\\r\\nTo receive advance parole one must travel abroad for the sole purpose of an educational, employment, or humanitarian purposes. This must be indicated on the Form I-131 as described below:\\r\\nTravel for leisure is not a valid purpose.[41]\\r\\nUSCIS released the process for DACA renewals in June 2014 and directed applicants to file their documents during a 30-day window starting 150 days before the expiration of their previous DACA status. Renewing requires an additional $495 fee.[42]\\r\\nAs of June 2016, there had been 606,264 renewal cases, with 526,288 approved, 4,703 denied and 75,205 renewals pending.[23]\\r\\nIn November 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama announced changes to DACA which would expand it to include illegal immigrants who entered the country prior to 2010, eliminate the requirement that applicants be younger than 31 years old, and lengthen the renewable deferral period to two years. The Pew Research Center estimated that this would increase the number of eligible people by about 330,000.[26]\\r\\nHowever, in December 2014, Texas and 25 other states, all with Republican governors, sued in the District Court for the Southern District of Texas asking the court to enjoin implementation of both the DACA expansion and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (a similar program).[27][28][29] In February 2015, Judge Andrew S. Hanen issued a preliminary injunction blocking the expansion from going into effect while the case, Texas v. United States, proceeds.[30][31] After progressing through the court system, the appeals court ruled 2ÿ1 in favor of enjoining the DACA expansion. When the Obama administration appealed to the Supreme Court, Justice Antonin Scalia's untimely death left an 8 justice court, which then ruled equally divided (4ÿ4) for and against the injunction. Procedural rules of the Court in the case of a tie would mean that no opinion would be written, no precedent would be set by the Supreme Court in the case, and that the appellate court's ruling would stand.[32]\\r\\nThe court's temporary injunction does not affect the existing DACA. Individuals may continue to come forward and request an initial grant of DACA or renewal of DACA under the guidelines established in 2012.[39]\\r\\nAccording to FactCheck.org, \\"there is no evidence that DACA holders are more likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens.\\"[13] Factcheck.Org noted that \\"numerous studies have found that immigrants do not commit crimes at a higher rate than non-immigrants.\\"[13]\\r\\nFact-checkers note that, on a large scale or in the long run, there is no reason to believe that DACA recipients have a major deleterious effect on American workers' employment chances; to the contrary, some economists say that DACA benefits the overall U.S. economy.[10][12][11][43][44] Economists have warned that ending DACA could adversely affect the U.S. economy, and that \\"most economists see immigration generally as an economic boon.\\"[11][44] Almost all economists reject Jeff Sessions' claim that DACA \\"denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same jobs to go to illegal aliens.\\"[11] Sessions' claim is rooted in what economists call the \\"lump of labor fallacy\\" (i.e., the idea that there is a limit to amount of work force available in any economy).[10][45]\\r\\nA 2016 study in the Journal of Public Economics found that DACA increased labor force participation and decreased the unemployment rate for DACA-eligible immigrants. DACA also increased the income of illegal immigrants in the bottom of the income distribution.[3] The study estimates that DACA moved 50,000 to 75,000 unauthorized immigrants into employment.[3] According to University of California, Davis economist Giovanni Peri, DACA consequently \\"increases consumption and overall demand for U.S. services, products, and jobs where the DACA recipients live and spend. Economists have shown that highly skilled workers increase local productivity and create opportunities for the other workers too\\".[46] A 2016 study in Economics Letters found that DACA-eligible households were 38% less likely than non-eligible unauthorized immigrant households to live in poverty.[6] Furthermore, DACA-eligible workers tend to have higher-skilled, higher-paying jobs than undocumented immigrants.[47]\\r\\nAccording to Giovanni Peri, ending DACA would bring a net loss in productivity, given that, as of 2017, the U.S. economy is close to full employment.[10][48] Ike Brannon and Logan Albright of the CATO Institute wrote in a 2017 that ending DACA would have an adverse economic and fiscal impact, estimating that the cost of immediately eliminating DACA and deporting those who received deferred action would be $283 billion over a decade (representing an economic loss of $215 billion, a fiscal loss of $60 billion (from lower net tax revenue), and $7.5 billion in deportation costs).[49] Brannon and Albright wrote that their projections were \\"a conservative estimate due to the fact that many DACA immigrants are young and still acquiring education credentials that will boost wages later.\\" [49] The Immigrant Legal Resource Center estimated that deporting DACA-eligible individuals would reduce Social Security and Medicare tax revenue by $24.6 billion over a decade.[11] Peri argues that that DACA recipients likely have a significant net positive fiscal impact given that DACA-eligible individuals have similar characteristics as second-generation immigrants, and that research shows that second-generation immigrants have a net positive fiscal impact of $173,000 to $259,000 per immigrant.[46] Peri also notes that the U.S. public school system has already invested in educating these individuals, and they are at the point at which they can start contributing to the U.S. economy and public coffers; deporting them or increasing the likelihood that they be deported is economically counterproductive.[46] A 2017 study by the Center for American Progress estimated that that the loss of all DACA-eligible workers would reduce U.S. GDP by $433 billion over the next 10 years.[50][51]\\r\\nAccording to Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economist Pia Orrenius, due to their risk of deportation, it is likely that previously DACA-protected individuals will slip into the shadow economy or take low-profile jobs that pay less.[44]\\r\\nThe 2016 study in the Journal of Public Economics found that DACA had no significant effects on the likelihood of attending school.[3] The study only found \\"suggestive evidence that DACA pushed over 25,000 DACA-eligible individuals into obtaining their GED certificate in order to be eligible for DACA.\\"[3] Research by Roberto G. Gonzales, professor of education at Harvard University, shows that DACA led to increased educational attainment.[52]\\r\\nA 2017 study published in the journal Science found that DACA led to improved mental health outcomes for the children of DACA-eligible mothers.[7] A 2017 Lancet Public Health study found that DACA-eligible individuals had better mental health outcomes as a result of their DACA-eligibility.[8]\\r\\nFiveThirtyEight, summarizing the findings of past research, wrote that \\"the threat of deportation alone would likely have a negative impact on families. Immigration-related stress and anxiety have been shown to have negative health effects... Generally, researchers believe the stress that stems from the fear of having a parent deported has far-reaching, negative effects on the health of children.\\"[53] In an editorial for the New England Journal of Medicine, Atheendar S. Venkataramani, professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and Alexander C. Tsai, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, write \\"The evidence clearly indicates that rescinding DACA will have profound adverse population-level effects on mental health... DACA was never intended to be a public health program, but its population-level consequences for mental health have been significant and rival those of any large-scale health or social policies in recent history. Rescinding DACA therefore represents a threat to public mental health.\\"[54]\\r\\n21 percent of DACA-protected immigrants work in education and health services.[44] The American Medical Association has estimated that under DACA or similar legislation, 5,400 additional physicians would work in the United States in coming decades, alleviating a projected shortage of primary care physicians.[44]\\r\\nA 2016 study published in the journal International Migration found that DACA did not significantly impact the number of apprehensions of unaccompanied minors from Central America.[55] A 2015 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report assessing the reasons behind the surge in unaccompanied minors from Central America did not mention DACA, and cited crime and lack of economic opportunity as the main reasons behind the surge.[12]\\r\\nThe legality of DACA and its proposed expansions were challenged in court. But only the expansions were halted under a preliminary injunction. Legal experts are divided as to the constitutionality of DACA, but no court has yet to rule it unconstitutional.[56].\\r\\nOne of challenges against DACA was filed in August 2012 by ten agents from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).[57] The plaintiffs claimed that following the new lenient deportation policies established by DACA required them to violate the law. Almost a year later, Judge Reed O'Connor from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the court lacked jurisdiction to decide on what essentially was a dispute between federal employees and their employer, the U.S. government.[58] Nonetheless, in his decision to dismiss the case, the judge reiterated his view that DACA was inherently unlawful.[58] The plaintiffs then filed an appeal but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the dismissal on procedural grounds.\\r\\nThe first challenge against the DACA expansions was filed by Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, in November 2014. In the lawsuit, Arpaio claimed that DACA and its expansions were \\"unconstitutional, arbitrary and capricious, and invalid under the Administrative Procedure Act as, in effect, regulations that have been promulgated without the requisite opportunity for public notice and comment.\\"[59] The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia promptly dismissed the lawsuit ruling that Arpaio did not have standing. That decision was upheld unanimously by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on August 14, 2015. Arpaio then asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, but on January 19, 2016, the court denied that request.[60]\\r\\nThe challenge that was granted a preliminary injunction was filed on December 2014 by Texas and 25 other statesall with Republican governors. The group of states sued to enjoin the implementation of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA)another immigration policyand the DACA expansions announced by the Obama administration.[61][62][63] In the lawsuit, the states claimed that, by expanding DACA, the president failed to enforce the nations immigration laws in contravention to Article Two of the U.S. Constitution.[64][b] Moreover, the states claimed that the president unilaterally rewrote the law through his actions.[65] As part of the judicial process, in February 2015, Judge Andrew S. Hanen issued a preliminary injunction blocking the expansion from going into effect while the case, Texas v. United States, proceeded.[30][31] After progressing through the court system, an equally divided (4ÿ4) Supreme Court left the injunction in place, without setting any precedent.[32] The court's temporary injunction did not affect the existing DACA. At the time, individuals were allowed to continue to come forward and request an initial grant of DACA or renewal of DACA under the guidelines established in 2012.[39]\\r\\nRegardless of the outcome of the preliminary injunction, legal opinions on the lawfulness of DACA are divided. In United States v. Texas, for instance, the Obama administration argued that the policy was a lawful exercise of the enforcement discretion that Congress delegated to the executive branch in the Immigration and Nationality Act, which charges the executive with the administration and enforcement of the countrys immigration laws.[66] Conversely, Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, opined that DACA was unlawful by asserting that it unconstitutionally usurped Congress' role over immigration by illegally allowing certain classes of illegal aliens to violate U.S. immigration law with impunity.[67]\\r\\nState-level government officials are also divided on the issue. Those that support DACA claim that the government does not have the resources to target all undocumented immigrants and that the policy thus helps federal agencies in exerting prosecutorial discretionthat is, in enforcing the law selectively by focusing limited resources on criminal immigrants rather than on non-criminal ones such as those eligible for DACA.[68][69] Those that oppose the policy, however, claim that states would be forced to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on health care, education, law enforcement, and other public benefits associated with the immigrants receiving relief.[64] For instance, DACA opponents claim that Texas could assume up to $500 million in administrative costs for issuing new drivers licenses.[64]\\r\\nArizona became the first state to oppose President Obama's order for DACA when Governor Jan Brewer issued an order blocking those with deferred status from receiving any state benefits.[70] This caused controversy,[71] as eligible and approved applicants would still be unable to obtain a driver's license.[72] In May 2013, a federal district court held that this policy was likely unconstitutional. In 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a preliminary injunction against Brewer's ban, and in November 2014 held this ban was in violation of the law.[73]\\r\\nTo assist those eligible under the program,[74] the state of California has agreed to support those who receive a DACA grant by allowing access to a state driver's license,[75] provided that such individuals participate in specific state guidelines (such as paying income taxes). The state of California also allows DACA holding individuals to qualify for Medi-Cal.[76]\\r\\nMayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel has stated that he wants to make Chicago the \\"most immigrant-friendly city in the country\\".[77] In addition to offering in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, he has also made plans for a city ordinance that would prevent illegal immigrants with no criminal background from being turned over to immigration enforcement agencies.[77]\\r\\nIn 2012, the then-director of the Iowa Department of Transportation, Paul Trombino III (now nominee for Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration), announced a policy to deny driver licenses to Iowa residents who were part of the DACA program. The policy was reversed several weeks later.[78][79]\\r\\nIn 2016, mayor of Baltimore Stephanie Rawlings-Blake stated that Baltimore police would not check the citizenship status of people with whom they interact.[80]\\r\\nMaryland residents are eligible for in-state public tuition rates regardless of immigration status under certain conditions. A Maryland resident is eligible if they attended Maryland high schools for at least three of the previous twelve years and they graduated from a Maryland high school or received a Maryland GED within the previous ten years. They must have registered at a Maryland public college within four years of high school graduation or receiving a Maryland GED. They must have registered for Selective Service if male, and they must have filed Maryland income tax returns.[81]\\r\\nIn October 2012, the Michigan Secretary of State, Ruth Johnson, announced that Michigan will not issue drivers licenses or state identification of any kind to beneficiaries of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.[82] In making this decision, it was clear that the Secretary of State erroneously conflated the notion of \\"lawful presence,\\" which is required under Michigan Law to issue a driver's license, and \\"lawful status,\\" a different legal concept entirely.[83] USCIS has made it clear that DACA beneficiaries do not possess legal status, but does not state that DACA beneficiaries are unlawfully present; in fact, it states that DACA beneficiaries will not accrue unlawful presence time here while they are in this deferred action status.[84] The Secretary of State relied upon USCIS' own explanation, which discusses legal status, not lawful presence.[84] In response to this policy, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Johnson, alleging that the policy violated both Michigan law and the U.S. Constitution.[85] On January 18, 2013, USCIS updated their \\"Frequently Asked Questions\\" page about DACA, clarifying, among other things, that DACA beneficiaries are, in fact, lawfully present in the United States.[86] On February 1, 2013, Johnson reversed her policy and began issuing driver's licenses to DACA beneficiaries on February 19, 2013.[87]\\r\\nGovernor Dave Heineman opposed DACA and in 2012 directed the Nebraska Department of Motor Vehicles to not issue driver's licenses to people who received deferred action under DACA. Heineman \\" argued that it violated state law to provide benefits to illegal immigrants.\\"[88] In 2015, however, the unicameral Nebraska Legislature voted to change state law to allow qualified DACA recipients to receive licenses. Governor Pete Ricketts vetoed the bill, but the legislature voted 34-10 to override the veto. Nebraska was the last of the 50 states to allow deferred-action recipients to obtain licenses.[88]\\r\\nNorth Carolina briefly suspended giving out driver's licenses to DACA grantees while waiting for the state attorney generals opinion. The attorney general decided that even without formal immigration status the DACA grantees were to be granted legal presence. After that, the state once again continued to give out drivers licenses and allowed the DACA grantees to become legal members of North Carolina.[89]\\r\\nAlthough in-state tuition is still offered, Governor Rick Perry announced his opposition to DACA by distributing a letter to all state agencies, meant \\"to ensure that all Texas agencies understand that Secretary Napolitano's guidelines confer absolutely no legal status whatsoever to any illegal immigrant who qualifies for the federal 'deferred action' designation.[90]\\r\\nIn April 2014, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring sent a letter to the director of the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV), the presidents of Virginia public colleges and universities, and the chancellor of the Virginia Community College System, in response to inquiries from public institutions of higher education on whether DACA students are eligible for in-state tuition. The attorney general advised these institutions that under Virginia law, DACA students who meet Virginia's domicile requirements are eligible for in-state tuition.[91][92]\\r\\nWhile running for president, Donald Trump said that he intended to repeal DACA on \\"day one\\" of his presidency.[93]\\r\\nOn February 14, 2017, a CNN report on the detention of 23-year-old Daniel Ramirez Medina in Northwest Detention Center,[94] Tacoma, Washington following his arrest in his father's Des Moines, Washington home, observed that \\"The case raises questions about what it could mean\\" for the 750,000 Dreamers, who had \\"received permission to stay under DACA.\\"[94][95] On March 7, 22-year-old Daniela Vargas of Jackson, Mississippi, another DACA recipient was detained by ICE, further raising speculation about President Trump's commitment to Dreamers and questioning whether immigrants who speak out against the administration's policies should fear retaliation.[96] Vargas was released from LaSalle Detention Center on March 10, 2017,[97] and Ramirez Medina's release followed on March 29.[98]\\r\\nOn June 16, 2017, the United States Department of Homeland Security announced that it intended to repeal the executive order by the Barack Obama administration that expanded the DACA program, though the DACA program's overall existence would continue to be reviewed.[99]\\r\\nOn September 5, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the program is being repealed. Sessions said that the DACA-eligible individuals were lawbreakers who adversely impacted the wages and employment of native-born Americans.[100] Sessions also attributed DACA as a leading cause behind the surge in unaccompanied minors coming to the United States from Central America.[100] Trump said that \\"virtually all\\" \\"top legal experts\\" believed that DACA was unconstitutional.[100] Fact-checkers have said that only a few economists believe that DACA adversely affects native-born workers, that there is scant evidence that DACA caused the surge in unaccompanied minors, and that it is false that all \\"top legal experts\\" believe DACA to be unconstitutional.[12][13]\\r\\nSessions added that implementation would be suspended for six months; DACA status and Employment Authorization Documents (\\"EAD\\") that expire during the next six months would continue to be renewed. DACA recipients with a work permit set to expire on or before March 5, 2018 would have the opportunity to apply for a two-year renewal if their application was received by USCIS by October 5, 2017.[101] In a follow-up statement, Trump said \\"It is now time for Congress to act!\\"[2] The approximately 800,000 immigrants who qualified enrolled in DACA will become eligible for deportation by the end of those six months.[100] A White House memo said that DACA recipients should \\"use the time remaining on their work authorizations to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States.\\"[102]\\r\\nAccording to the New York Times, \\"Democrats and some Republicans, business executives, college presidents and immigration activists condemned the repeal as a coldhearted and shortsighted effort that was unfair to the young immigrants and could harm the economy.\\"[100] Former President Obama condemned the repeal as \\"cruel\\" and wrote:[103]\\r\\nThey were brought to this country by their parents, sometimes even as infants. They may not know a country besides ours. They may not even know a language besides English. They often have no idea they're undocumented until they apply for a job, or college, or a driver's license... Whatever concerns or complaints Americans may have about immigration in general, we shouldn't threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own, who pose no threat, who are not taking away anything from the rest of us... Kicking them out won't lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone's taxes, or raise anybody's wages.\\r\\nThe reaction was mixed among Republicans.[104] Several senior Republicans praised Trump's action, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.[105] Other Republicans, including Senator John McCain, Senator Jeff Flake, and Representative Illeana Ros-Lehtinen, condemned the Trump Administration's choice to rescind the executive order.[105] In a released statement Senator McCain said:[106]\\r\\nI strongly believe that children who were illegally brought into this country through no fault of their own should not be forced to return to a country they do not know. The 800,000 innocent young people granted deferred action under DACA over the last several years are pursuing degrees, starting careers, and contributing to our communities in important ways. While I disagreed with President Obamas unilateral action on this issue, I believe that rescinding DACA at this time is an unacceptable reversal of the promises and opportunities that have been conferred to these individuals.\\r\\nOrganizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union, Anti-Defamation League, and U.S. Chamber of Commerce condemned the repeal.[107] A number of religious organizations condemned the repeal, with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops describing it as \\"reprehensible\\". The Catholic University of Notre Dame also urged the president to not resciend DACA and announced it would stand by those affected.[108]The United Methodist Church said it was \\"not only unconscionable, but contrary to moral work and witness,\\" and the Evangelical Lutheran Church called on its members to \\"pray today for those that will suffer undue repercussions due to the end of this program.\\"[109] Asked about Trump's decision to rescind DACA, Pope Francis said that if Trump is truly \\"pro-life\\", he \\"he will understand that the family is the cradle of life and that it must be defended as a unit.\\"[110] Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, endorsed Trump's repeal.[109]\\r\\nThe September 2017 announcement sparked protests in many cities including Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Los Angeles. At a September 5 protest in New York outside of Trump Tower, more than 30 protesters were arrested.[111] On September 19, more protesters were arrested outside Trump Tower, including Democratic congressmen Ra~l Grijalva of Arizona, Luis Gutirrez of Illinois, and Adriano Espaillat of New York.[112]\\r\\nThe rescission was challenged in court by different entities. On September 6, 2017, for instance, fifteen states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit, titled New York v. Trump, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York seeking to stop the repeal.[113] A few days later, the California attorney general, Xavier Becerra, filed a separate lawsuit, which was joined by the states of Maine, Minnesota, and Maryland. Becerra stated that, as a quarter of the people in the DACA program live in California, he thinks that \\"everyone recognizes the scope and breadth of the Trump decision to terminate DACA hits hardest here.\\"[114] Not only have State Government's filled suit, but also six DREAMERs have filed suit against Trump in San Francisco.[115] The University of California, which currently has approximately 4,000 undocumented students, has also filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security which was filed in the Northern District of California.[116] Janet Napolitano, president of the UC system, called the rescission of DACA, unconstitutional, unjust, and unlawful\\". In a released statement Napolitano said:\\r\\nI am deeply troubled by President Trumps decision to effectively end the DACA program and uproot the lives of an estimated 800,000 Dreamers across the nation. This backward-thinking, far-reaching move threatens to separate families and derail the futures of some of this countrys brightest young minds, thousands of whom currently attend or have graduated from the University of California.[117]","input":"How young do you have to be to qualify for daca?"},{"output":"because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 { 3, 1 { 1 { 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3","context":"A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering. The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 { 3, 1 { 1 { 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3.\\r\\nThe property of being prime is called primality. A simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division. It consists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\sqrt {n}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n. Algorithms much more efficient than trial division have been devised to test the primality of large numbers. These include the MillerÿRabin primality test, which is fast but has a small probability of error, and the AKS primality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical. Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as Mersenne numbers. As of January 2016[update], the largest known prime number has 22,338,618 decimal digits.\\r\\nThere are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC. There is no known simple formula that separates prime numbers from composite numbers. However, the distribution of primes, that is to say, the statistical behaviour of primes in the large, can be modelled. The first result in that direction is the prime number theorem, proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the probability that a given, randomly chosen number n is prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits, or to the logarithm of n.\\r\\nMany questions regarding prime numbers remain open, such as Goldbach's conjecture (that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes), and the twin prime conjecture (that there are infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2). Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers. Primes are used in several routines in information technology, such as public-key cryptography, which makes use of properties such as the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. Prime numbers give rise to various generalizations in other mathematical domains, mainly algebra, such as prime elements and prime ideals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA natural number (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) is called a prime number (or a prime) if it has exactly two positive divisors, 1 and the number itself.[1] Natural numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are called composite.\\r\\nFor example, among the numbers 1 through 6, the numbers 2, 3, and 5 are the prime numbers, while 1, 4, and 6 are not prime. 1 is excluded as a prime number, for reasons explained below. 2 is a prime number, since the only natural numbers dividing it are 1 and 2. 3 is prime, as no numbers other than 1 and itself divide evenly into it. 4 is composite, since 2 is a number that divides evenly into it, in addition to 1 and itself. 5 is prime as only 1 and itself divide evenly into it. 6 is divisible by 2 and 3, therefore it is not prime.\\r\\nNo even number greater than 2 is prime because by definition, as any such even number n has at least three distinct divisors, namely 1, 2, and n. Accordingly, the term odd prime refers to any prime number greater than 2. Similarly, when written in the usual decimal system, all prime numbers larger than 5 would end in 1, 3, 7, or 9, since even numbers are multiples of 2, and numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5.\\r\\nIf n is a natural number, then 1 and n divide n without remainder. Therefore, the condition of being a prime can also be restated as: a number is prime if it is greater than one and if none of\\r\\ndivides n (without remainder). Yet another way to say the same is: a number n > 1 is prime if it cannot be written as a product of two integers a and b, both of which are larger than?1:\\r\\nIn other words, n is prime if n items cannot be divided up into smaller equal-size groups of more than one item.\\r\\nThe set of all primes is often denoted by P.\\r\\nThe first 168 prime numbers (all the prime numbers less than 1000) are:\\r\\nThe crucial importance of prime numbers to number theory and mathematics in general stems from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer larger than 1 can be written as a product of one or more primes in a way that is unique except for the order of the prime factors.[2] Primes can thus be considered the basic building blocks of the natural numbers. For example:\\r\\nAs in this example, the same prime factor may occur multiple times. A decomposition:\\r\\nof a number n into (finitely many) prime factors p1, p2, ... to pt is called prime factorization of n. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic can be rephrased so as to say that any factorization into primes will be identical except for the order of the factors. So, albeit there are many prime factorization algorithms to do this in practice for larger numbers, they all have to yield the same result.\\r\\nIf p is a prime number and p divides a product ab of integers, then p divides a or p divides b. This proposition is known as Euclid's lemma.[3] It is used in some proofs of the uniqueness of prime factorizations.\\r\\nMost early Greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number,[4] so they could not consider it to be a prime. By the Middle Ages and Renaissance many mathematicians included 1 as the first prime number.[5] In the mid-18th century Christian Goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with Leonhard Euler; however, Euler himself did not consider 1 to be a prime number. [6] In the 19th century many mathematicians still considered the number 1 to be a prime. For example, Derrick Norman Lehmer's list of primes up to 10,006,721, reprinted as late as 1956,[7] started with 1 as its first prime.[8] Henri Lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime.[9] By the early 20th century, mathematicians began to arrive at the consensus that 1 is not a prime number, but rather forms its own special category as a \\"unit\\".[5]\\r\\nA large body of mathematical work would still be valid when calling 1 a prime, but Euclid's fundamental theorem of arithmetic (mentioned above) would not hold as stated. For example, the number 15 can be factored as 3 { 5 and 1 { 3 { 5; if 1 were admitted as a prime, these two presentations would be considered different factorizations of 15 into prime numbers, so the statement of that theorem would have to be modified. Similarly, the sieve of Eratosthenes would not work correctly if 1 were considered a prime: a modified version of the sieve that considers 1 as prime would eliminate all multiples of 1 (that is, all other numbers) and produce as output only the single number?1. Furthermore, the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks, such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler's totient function or the sum of divisors function.[10]\\r\\nThere are hints in the surviving records of the ancient Egyptians that they had some knowledge of prime numbers: the Egyptian fraction expansions in the Rhind papyrus, for instance, have quite different forms for primes and for composites. However, the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the Ancient Greeks. Euclid's Elements (circa 300 BC) contain important theorems about primes, including the infinitude of primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Euclid also showed how to construct a perfect number from a Mersenne prime. The Sieve of Eratosthenes, attributed to Eratosthenes, is a simple method to compute primes, although the large primes found today with computers are not generated this way.\\r\\nAfter the Greeks, little happened with the study of prime numbers until the 17th century. In 1640 Pierre de Fermat stated (without proof) Fermat's little theorem (later proved by Leibniz and Euler). Fermat also conjectured that all numbers of the form 22n?+?1 are prime (they are called Fermat numbers) and he verified this up to n?=?4 (or 216?+?1). However, the very next Fermat number 232?+?1 is composite (one of its prime factors is?641), as Euler discovered later, and in fact no further Fermat numbers are known to be prime. The French monk Marin Mersenne looked at primes of the form 2p???1, with p a prime. They are called Mersenne primes in his honor.\\r\\nEuler's work in number theory included many results about primes. He showed the infinite series 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 + 1/11 +  is divergent. In 1747 he showed that the even perfect numbers are precisely the integers of the form 2p?1(2p???1), where the second factor is a Mersenne prime.\\r\\nAt the start of the 19th century, Legendre and Gauss independently conjectured that as x tends to infinity, the number of primes up to x is asymptotic to x/ln(x), where ln(x) is the natural logarithm of x. Ideas of Riemann in his 1859 paper on the zeta-function sketched a program that would lead to a proof of the prime number theorem. This outline was completed by Hadamard and de la Valle Poussin, who independently proved the prime number theorem in 1896.\\r\\nProving a number is prime is not done (for large numbers) by trial division. Many mathematicians have worked on primality tests for large numbers, often restricted to specific number forms. This includes Ppin's test for Fermat numbers (1877), Proth's theorem (around 1878), the LucasÿLehmer primality test (originated 1856),[11] and the generalized Lucas primality test. More recent algorithms like APRT-CL, ECPP, and AKS work on arbitrary numbers but remain much slower.\\r\\nFor a long time, prime numbers were thought to have extremely limited application outside of pure mathematics.[12] This changed in the 1970s when the concepts of public-key cryptography were invented, in which prime numbers formed the basis of the first algorithms such as the RSA cryptosystem algorithm.\\r\\nSince 1951 all the largest known primes have been found by computers. The search for ever larger primes has generated interest outside mathematical circles. The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search and other distributed computing projects to find large primes have become popular, while mathematicians continue to struggle with the theory of primes.\\r\\nThere are infinitely many prime numbers. Another way of saying this is that the sequence\\r\\nof prime numbers never ends. This statement is referred to as Euclid's theorem in honor of the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, since the first known proof for this statement is attributed to him. Many more proofs of the infinitude of primes are known, including an analytical proof by Euler, Goldbach's proof based on Fermat numbers,[13] Furstenberg's proof using general topology,[14] and Kummer's elegant proof.[15]\\r\\nEuclid's proof (Book IX, Proposition 20[16]) considers any finite set S of primes. The key idea is to consider the product of all these numbers plus one:\\r\\nLike any other natural number, N is divisible by at least one prime number (it is possible that N itself is prime).\\r\\nNone of the primes by which N is divisible can be members of the finite set S of primes with which we started, because dividing N by any one of these leaves a remainder of?1. Therefore, the primes by which N is divisible are additional primes beyond the ones we started with. Thus any finite set of primes can be extended to a larger finite set of primes.\\r\\nIt is often erroneously reported that Euclid begins with the assumption that the set initially considered contains all prime numbers, leading to a contradiction, or that it contains precisely the n smallest primes rather than any arbitrary finite set of primes.[17] Today, the product of the smallest n primes plus 1 is conventionally called the nth Euclid number.\\r\\nEuler's proof uses the partial sums of the reciprocals of primes,\\r\\nFor any arbitrary real number x, there exists a prime p for which this partial sum is bigger than x.[18] This shows that there are infinitely many primes, because if there were finitely many primes the sum would reach its maximum value at the biggest prime rather than being unbounded. More precisely, the growth rate of S(p) is doubly logarithmic, as quantified by Mertens' second theorem.[19] For comparison, the sum\\r\\ndoes not grow to infinity as n goes to infinity (see Basel problem). In this sense, prime numbers occur more often than squares of natural numbers. Brun's theorem states that the sum of the reciprocals of twin primes,\\r\\nis finite. Because of Brun's theorem, it is not possible to use Euler's method to solve the twin prime conjecture, that there exist infinitely many twin primes.\\r\\nThere are various methods to determine whether a given number n is prime. The most basic routine, trial division, is of little practical use because of its slowness. One group of modern primality tests is applicable to arbitrary numbers, while more efficient tests are available for particular numbers. Most such methods only tell whether n is prime or not. Routines also yielding one (or all) prime factors of n are called factorization algorithms.\\r\\nThe most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer n is called trial division. This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n. If the result of any of these divisions is an integer, then n is not a prime, otherwise it is a prime. Indeed, if \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n=\\r\\na\\r\\nb\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle n=ab}\\r\\n\\r\\n is composite (with a and b R 1) then one of the factors a or b is necessarily at most \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\sqrt {n}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n. For example, for \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n=\\r\\n37\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle n=37}\\r\\n\\r\\n, the trial divisions are by m = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. None of these numbers divides 37, so 37 is prime. This routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\sqrt {n}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n is knownthen trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime. For example, to check the primality of 37, only three divisions are necessary (m = 2, 3, and 5), given that 4 and 6 are composite.\\r\\nWhile a simple method, trial division quickly becomes impractical for testing large integers because the number of possible factors grows too rapidly as n increases. According to the prime number theorem explained below, the number of prime numbers less than \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\sqrt {n}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n is approximately given by \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\nln\\r\\n?\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\sqrt {n}}/\\\\ln({\\\\sqrt {n}})}\\r\\n\\r\\n, so the algorithm may need up to this number of trial divisions to check the primality of n. For n = 1020, this number is 450 milliontoo large for many practical applications.\\r\\nAn algorithm yielding all primes up to a given limit, such as required in the primes-only trial division method, is called a prime number sieve. The oldest example, the sieve of Eratosthenes (see above), is still the most commonly used. The sieve of Atkin is another option. Before the advent of computers, lists of primes up to bounds like 107 were also used.[20]\\r\\nModern primality tests for general numbers n can be divided into two main classes, probabilistic (or \\"Monte Carlo\\") and deterministic algorithms. Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.\\r\\nA particularly simple example of a probabilistic test is the Fermat primality test, which relies on the fact (Fermat's little theorem) that npn (mod p) for any n if p is a prime number. If we have a number b that we want to test for primality, then we work out nb (mod b) for a random value of n as our test. A flaw with this test is that there are some composite numbers (the Carmichael numbers) that satisfy the Fermat identity even though they are not prime, so the test has no way of distinguishing between prime numbers and Carmichael numbers. Carmichael numbers are substantially rarer than prime numbers, though, so this test can be useful for practical purposes. More powerful extensions of the Fermat primality test, such as the Baillie-PSW and Miller-Rabin tests, may fail at least some of the time when applied to a composite number.\\r\\nDeterministic algorithms do not erroneously report composite numbers as prime. In practice, the fastest such method is known as elliptic curve primality proving. Analyzing its run time is based on heuristic arguments, as opposed to the rigorously proven complexity of the more recent AKS primality test. Deterministic methods are typically slower than probabilistic ones, so the latter ones are typically applied first before a more time-consuming deterministic routine is employed.\\r\\nThe following table lists a number of prime tests. The running time is given in terms of n, the number to be tested and, for probabilistic algorithms, the number k of tests performed. Moreover,  is an arbitrarily small positive number, and log is the logarithm to an unspecified base. The big O notation means that, for example, elliptic curve primality proving requires a time that is bounded by a factor (not depending on n, but on ) times log5+(n).\\r\\nIn addition to the aforementioned tests that apply to any natural number n, there are very efficient (deterministic) primality tests if the complete factorization of either n ? 1 or n + 1 is known. For example, the Lucas' primality test requires the knowledge of the prime factors of n ? 1, while the LucasÿLehmer primality test needs the prime factors of n + 1. These tests can be applied to check whether\\r\\nare prime. Prime numbers of this form are known as factorial primes. Other primes where either p + 1 or p ? 1 is of a particular shape include the Sophie Germain primes (primes of the form 2p + 1 with p prime), primorial primes, Fermat primes and Mersenne primes, that is, prime numbers that are of the form 2p ? 1, where p is an arbitrary prime. The LucasÿLehmer test is particularly fast for numbers of this form. This is why the largest known prime has almost always been a Mersenne prime since the dawn of electronic computers.\\r\\nIf only a partial factorization of n ? 1 or n + 1 is known, there are extensions of these methods that may be able to prove that n is prime. [21]\\r\\nThe following table gives the largest known primes of the mentioned types. Some of these primes have been found using distributed computing. In 2009, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search project was awarded a US$100,000 prize for first discovering a prime with at least 10 million digits.[22] The Electronic Frontier Foundation also offers $150,000 and $250,000 for primes with at least 100 million digits and 1 billion digits, respectively.[23] Some of the largest primes not known to have any particular form (that is, no simple formula such as that of Mersenne primes) have been found by taking a piece of semi-random binary data, converting it to a number n, multiplying it by 256k for some positive integer k, and searching for possible primes within the interval [256kn + 1, 256k(n + 1) ? 1].[citation needed]\\r\\nGiven a composite integer n, the task of providing one (or all) prime factors is referred to as factorization of n. Elliptic curve factorization is an algorithm relying on arithmetic on an elliptic curve.\\r\\nIn 1975, number theorist Don Zagier commented that primes both\\r\\ngrow like weeds among the natural numbers, seeming to obey no other law than that of chance [but also] exhibit stunning regularity [and] that there are laws governing their behavior, and that they obey these laws with almost military precision.[30]\\r\\nThe distribution of primes in the large, such as the question how many primes are smaller than a given, large threshold, is described by the prime number theorem, but no efficient formula for the n-th prime is known.\\r\\nThere are arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive non-primes, as for every positive integer \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle n}\\r\\n\\r\\n the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle n}\\r\\n\\r\\n consecutive integers from \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\nn\\r\\n+\\r\\n1\\r\\n)\\r\\n!\\r\\n+\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle (n+1)!+2}\\r\\n\\r\\n to \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\nn\\r\\n+\\r\\n1\\r\\n)\\r\\n!\\r\\n+\\r\\nn\\r\\n+\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle (n+1)!+n+1}\\r\\n\\r\\n (inclusive) are all composite (as \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\nn\\r\\n+\\r\\n1\\r\\n)\\r\\n!\\r\\n+\\r\\nk\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle (n+1)!+k}\\r\\n\\r\\n is divisible by \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nk\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle k}\\r\\n\\r\\n for \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nk\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle k}\\r\\n\\r\\n between \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle 2}\\r\\n\\r\\n and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n+\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle n+1}\\r\\n\\r\\n).\\r\\nDirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, in its basic form, asserts that linear polynomials\\r\\nwith coprime integers a and b take infinitely many prime values. Stronger forms of the theorem state that the sum of the reciprocals of these prime values diverges, and that different such polynomials with the same b have approximately the same proportions of primes.\\r\\nThe corresponding question for quadratic polynomials is less well understood.\\r\\nThere is no known efficient formula for primes. For example, there is no non-constant polynomial, even in several variables, that takes only prime values. However, there are numerous expressions that do encode all primes, or only primes. One possible formula is based on Wilson's theorem and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once. There is also a set of Diophantine equations in 9 variables and one parameter with the following property: the parameter is prime if and only if the resulting system of equations has a solution over the natural numbers. This can be used to obtain a single formula with the property that all its positive values are prime.[31]\\r\\nOther examples of prime-generating formulas come from Mills' theorem and a theorem of Wright. These assert that there are real constants A > 1 and  such that\\r\\nare prime for any natural number n in the first formula, and any number of exponents in the second formula.[32] Here \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n?\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\lfloor -\\\\rfloor }\\r\\n\\r\\n represents the floor function, i.e., the largest integer not greater than the number in question. However, computing A or  requires the knowledge of infinitely many primes to begin with.[33]\\r\\nThe prime counting function (n) is defined as the number of primes not greater than n. For example, (11) = 5, since there are five primes less than or equal to 11. There are known algorithms to compute exact values of (n) faster than it would be possible to compute each prime up to n. The prime number theorem states that (n) satisfies\\r\\nwhich means that the ratio of (n) and the right hand fraction approaches 1 when n grows to infinity. This implies that the likelihood that a number less than n is prime is (approximately) inversely proportional to the number of digits in n. A more accurate estimate for (n) is given by the offset logarithmic integral\\r\\nThe prime number theorem also implies estimates for the size of the n-th prime number pn (i.e., p1 = 2, p2 = 3, etc.): up to a bounded factor, pn grows like n log(n).[34] In particular, the prime gaps, i.e. the differences pn ? pn?1 of two consecutive primes, become arbitrarily large. This latter statement can also be seen in a more elementary way by noting that the sequence n! + 2, n! + 3, , n! + n (for the notation n! read factorial) consists of n ? 1 composite numbers, for any natural number n. However, n ? 1 composite numbers do make up gaps much smaller than n!. For example, with n ? 1 = 7, the first prime gap of 8 is between the primes 89 and 97 while 8! = 40320.\\r\\nAn arithmetic progression is the set of natural numbers that give the same remainder when divided by some fixed number?q called modulus. For example,\\r\\nis an arithmetic progression modulo q = 9. Except for 3, none of these numbers is prime, since 3 + 9n = 3(1 + 3n) so that the remaining numbers in this progression are all composite. (In general terms, all prime numbers above q are of the form q#{n?+?m, where 0?<?m?<?q#, and m has no prime factor?P?q.) Thus, the progression\\r\\ncan have infinitely many primes only when a and q are coprime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is one. If this necessary condition is satisfied, Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions asserts that the progression contains infinitely many primes. The picture below illustrates this with q = 9: the numbers are \\"wrapped around\\" as soon as a multiple of 9 is passed. Primes are highlighted in red. The rows (=progressions) starting with a = 3, 6, or 9 contain at most one prime number. In all other rows (a = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8) there are infinitely many prime numbers. What is more, the primes are distributed equally among those rows in the long runthe density of all primes congruent a modulo?9 is?1/6.\\r\\nThe GreenÿTao theorem shows that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions consisting of primes.[35] An odd prime p is expressible as the sum of two squares, p = x2 + y2, exactly if p is congruent 1 modulo 4 (Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares).\\r\\nEuler noted that the function\\r\\nyields prime numbers for 0 P n < 40,[36][37] a fact leading into deep algebraic number theory: more specifically, Heegner numbers. For greater n, the expression also produces composite values. The Hardy-Littlewood conjecture F makes an asymptotic prediction about the density of primes among the values of quadratic polynomials (with integer coefficients a, b, and c),\\r\\nin terms of Li(n) and the coefficients a, b, and c. However, progress has been difficult. No quadratic polynomial (with a R 0) is known to take infinitely many prime values.\\r\\nThe Ulam spiral depicts all natural numbers in a spiral-like way. Primes cluster on certain diagonals and not others, suggesting that some quadratic polynomials take prime values more often than others. The example below displays concentrations of prime numbers (blue background) from 41 to 1001 arranged in an Ulam spiral with a start value of 41 (green background numbers are numbers with just 3 divisors, and red background are numbers with a large number of divisors).\\r\\nThe Riemann zeta function (s) is defined as an infinite sum\\r\\nwhere s is a complex number with real part bigger than 1. It is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that this sum agrees with the infinite product\\r\\nThe zeta function is closely related to prime numbers. For example, the aforementioned fact that there are infinitely many primes can also be seen using the zeta function: if there were only finitely many primes then (1) would have a finite value. However, the harmonic series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... diverges (i.e., exceeds any given number), so there must be infinitely many primes. Another example of the richness of the zeta function and a glimpse of modern algebraic number theory is the following identity (Basel problem), due to Euler,\\r\\nThe reciprocal of (2), 6/2, is the probability that two numbers selected at random are relatively prime.[38][39]\\r\\nThe unproven Riemann hypothesis, dating from 1859, states that except for s = ?2, ?4, ..., all zeroes of the -function have real part equal to 1/2. The connection to prime numbers is that it essentially says that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible.[clarification needed] From a physical viewpoint, it roughly states that the irregularity in the distribution of primes only comes from random noise. From a mathematical viewpoint, it roughly states that the asymptotic distribution of primes (about x/log x of numbers less than x are primes, the prime number theorem) also holds for much shorter intervals of length about the square root of x (for intervals near x). This hypothesis is generally believed to be correct. In particular, the simplest assumption is that primes should have no significant irregularities without good reason.\\r\\nIn addition to the Riemann hypothesis, many more conjectures revolving about primes have been posed. Often having an elementary formulation, many of these conjectures have withstood a proof for decades: all four of Landau's problems from 1912 are still unsolved. One of them is Goldbach's conjecture, which asserts that every even integer n greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes. As of February 2011[update], this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n = 2 { 1017.[40] Weaker statements than this have been proven, for example Vinogradov's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes. Chen's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime, the product of two primes. Also, any even integer can be written as the sum of six primes.[41] The branch of number theory studying such questions is called additive number theory.\\r\\nOther conjectures deal with the question whether an infinity of prime numbers subject to certain constraints exists. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many Fibonacci primes[42] and infinitely many Mersenne primes, but not Fermat primes.[43] It is not known whether or not there are an infinite number of Wieferich primes and of prime Euclid numbers.\\r\\nA third type of conjectures concerns aspects of the distribution of primes. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many twin primes, pairs of primes with difference 2 (twin prime conjecture). Polignac's conjecture is a strengthening of that conjecture, it states that for every positive integer n, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by?2n.[44] It is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form?n2?+?1.[45] These conjectures are special cases of the broad Schinzel's hypothesis H. Brocard's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2. Legendre's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n2 and (n?+?1)2 for every positive integer?n. It is implied by the stronger Cramr's conjecture.\\r\\nFor a long time, number theory in general, and the study of prime numbers in particular, was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics, with no applications outside of the self-interest of studying the topic with the exception of use of prime numbered gear teeth to distribute wear evenly. In particular, number theorists such as British mathematician G. H. Hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance.[46] However, this vision was shattered in the 1970s, when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of public key cryptography algorithms. Prime numbers are also used for hash tables and pseudorandom number generators.\\r\\nSome rotor machines were designed with a different number of pins on each rotor, with the number of pins on any one rotor either prime, or coprime to the number of pins on any other rotor. This helped generate the full cycle of possible rotor positions before repeating any position.\\r\\nThe International Standard Book Numbers work with a check digit, which exploits the fact that 11 is a prime.\\r\\nModular arithmetic modifies usual arithmetic by only using the numbers\\r\\nwhere n is a fixed natural number called modulus. Calculating sums, differences and products is done as usual, but whenever a negative number or a number greater than n???1 occurs, it gets replaced by the remainder after division by n. For instance, for n?=?7, the sum 3?+?5 is 1 instead of 8, since 8 divided by 7 has remainder?1. This is referred to by saying \\"3?+?5 is congruent to?1 modulo?7\\" and is denoted\\r\\nSimilarly, 6?+?1??0?(mod?7), 2???5??4?(mod?7), since ?3?+?7?=?4, and 3?{?4??5?(mod?7) as 12 has remainder 5. Standard properties of addition and multiplication familiar from the integers remain valid in modular arithmetic. In the parlance of abstract algebra, the above set of integers, which is also denoted Z/nZ, is therefore a commutative ring for any n. Division, however, is not in general possible in this setting. For example, for n = 6, the equation\\r\\na solution x of which would be an analogue of 2/3, cannot be solved, as one can see by calculating 3 { 0, ..., 3 { 5 modulo 6. The distinctive feature of prime numbers is the following: division is possible in modular arithmetic if and only if n is a prime. Equivalently, n is prime if and only if all integers m satisfying 2 P m P n ? 1 are coprime to n, i.e. their only common divisor is one. Indeed, for n = 7, the equation\\r\\nhas a unique solution, x = 3. Because of this, for any prime p, Z/pZ (also denoted Fp) is called a field or, more specifically, a finite field since it contains finitely many, namely p, elements.\\r\\nA number of theorems can be derived from inspecting Fp in this abstract way. For example, Fermat's little theorem, stating\\r\\nfor any integer a not divisible by p, may be proved using these notions. This implies\\r\\nGiuga's conjecture says that this equation is also a sufficient condition for p to be prime. Another consequence of Fermat's little theorem is the following: if p is a prime number other than 2 and 5, 1/p is always a recurring decimal, whose period is p ? 1 or a divisor of p ? 1. The fraction 1/p expressed likewise in base q (rather than base?10) has similar effect, provided that p is not a prime factor of?q. Wilson's theorem says that an integer p?>?1 is prime if and only if the factorial (p???1)!?+?1 is divisible by p. Moreover, an integer n > 4 is composite if and only if (n???1)! is divisible by?n.\\r\\nFermat primes are primes of the form\\r\\nwith k a natural number. They are named after Pierre de Fermat, who conjectured that all such numbers are prime. This was based on the evidence of the first five numbers in this series3, 5, 17, 257, and 65,537being prime. However, F5 is composite and so are all other Fermat numbers that have been verified as of 2015. A regular n-gon is constructible using straightedge and compass if and only if the odd prime factors of n (if any) are distinct Fermat primes.\\r\\nMany mathematical domains make great use of prime numbers. An example from the theory of finite groups are the Sylow theorems: if G is a finite group and pn is the highest power of the prime p that divides the order of G, then G has a subgroup of order pn. Also, any group of prime order is cyclic (Lagrange's theorem).\\r\\nSeveral public-key cryptography algorithms, such as RSA and the DiffieÿHellman key exchange, are based on large prime numbers (2048-bit primes are common). RSA relies on the assumption that it is much easier (i.e., more efficient) to perform the multiplication of two (large) numbers x and y than to calculate x and y (assumed coprime) if only the product xy is known. The DiffieÿHellman key exchange relies on the fact that there are efficient algorithms for modular exponentiation, while the reverse operation the discrete logarithm is thought to be a hard problem.\\r\\nThe evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus Magicicada make use of prime numbers.[47] These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas.[48] If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas.[49] Though small, this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects.\\r\\nThere is speculation[by whom?] that the zeros of the zeta function are connected to the energy levels of complex quantum systems.[50]\\r\\nThe concept of prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics. Generally, \\"prime\\" indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense. For example, the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1. It is either Q or the finite field with p elements, whence the name.[51] Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots. Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots.[52] Prime models and prime 3-manifolds are other examples of this type.\\r\\nPrime numbers give rise to two more general concepts that apply to elements of any commutative ring R, an algebraic structure where addition, subtraction and multiplication are defined: prime elements and irreducible elements. An element p of R is called prime element if it is neither zero nor a unit (i.e., does not have a multiplicative inverse) and satisfies the following requirement: given x and y in R such that p divides the product xy, then p divides x or y. An element is irreducible if it is not a unit and cannot be written as a product of two ring elements that are not units. In the ring Z of integers, the set of prime elements equals the set of irreducible elements, which is\\r\\nIn any ring R, any prime element is irreducible. The converse does not hold in general, but does hold for unique factorization domains.\\r\\nThe fundamental theorem of arithmetic continues to hold in unique factorization domains. An example of such a domain is the Gaussian integers Z[i], that is, the set of complex numbers of the form a?+?bi where i denotes the imaginary unit and a and b are arbitrary integers. Its prime elements are known as Gaussian primes. Not every prime (in Z) is a Gaussian prime: in the bigger ring Z[i], 2 factors into the product of the two Gaussian primes (1?+?i) and (1???i). Rational primes (i.e. prime elements in Z) of the form 4k?+?3 are Gaussian primes, whereas rational primes of the form 4k?+?1 are not.\\r\\nIn ring theory, the notion of number is generally replaced with that of ideal. Prime ideals, which generalize prime elements in the sense that the principal ideal generated by a prime element is a prime ideal, are an important tool and object of study in commutative algebra, algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. The prime ideals of the ring of integers are the ideals (0), (2), (3), (5), (7), (11),  The fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the LaskerÿNoether theorem, which expresses every ideal in a Noetherian commutative ring as an intersection of primary ideals, which are the appropriate generalizations of prime powers.[53]\\r\\nPrime ideals are the points of algebro-geometric objects, via the notion of the spectrum of a ring.[54] Arithmetic geometry also benefits from this notion, and many concepts exist in both geometry and number theory. For example, factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field, a basic problem of algebraic number theory, bears some resemblance with ramification in geometry. Such ramification questions occur even in number-theoretic questions solely concerned with integers. For example, prime ideals in the ring of integers of quadratic number fields can be used in proving quadratic reciprocity, a statement that concerns the solvability of quadratic equations\\r\\nwhere x is an integer and p and q are (usual) prime numbers.[55] Early attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem climaxed when Kummer introduced regular primes, primes satisfying a certain requirement concerning the failure of unique factorization in the ring consisting of expressions\\r\\nwhere a0, ..., ap?1 are integers and  is a complex number such that p = 1.[56]\\r\\nValuation theory studies certain functions from a field K to the real numbers R called valuations.[57] Every such valuation yields a topology on K, and two valuations are called equivalent if they yield the same topology. A prime of K (sometimes called a place of K) is an equivalence class of valuations. For example, the p-adic valuation of a rational number q is defined to be the integer vp(q), such that\\r\\nwhere both r and s are not divisible by p. For example, v3(18/7) = 2. The p-adic norm is defined as [58]\\r\\nIn particular, this norm gets smaller when a number is multiplied by p, in sharp contrast to the usual absolute value (also referred to as the infinite prime). While completing Q (roughly, filling the gaps) with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers, completing with respect to the p-adic norm |?|p yields the field of p-adic numbers.[59] These are essentially all possible ways to complete Q, by Ostrowski's theorem. Certain arithmetic questions related to Q or more general global fields may be transferred back and forth to the completed (or local) fields. This local-global principle again underlines the importance of primes to number theory.\\r\\nPrime numbers have influenced many artists and writers. The French composer Olivier Messiaen used prime numbers to create ametrical music through \\"natural phenomena\\". In works such as La Nativit du Seigneur (1935) and Quatre tudes de rythme (1949ÿ50), he simultaneously employs motifs with lengths given by different prime numbers to create unpredictable rhythms: the primes 41, 43, 47 and 53 appear in the third tude, \\"Neumes rythmiques\\". According to Messiaen this way of composing was \\"inspired by the movements of nature, movements of free and unequal durations\\".[60]\\r\\nIn his science fiction novel Contact, NASA scientist Carl Sagan suggested that prime numbers could be used as a means of communicating with aliens, an idea that he had first developed informally with American astronomer Frank Drake in 1975.[61] In the novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon, the narrator arranges the sections of the story by consecutive prime numbers.[62]\\r\\nMany films, such as Cube, Sneakers, The Mirror Has Two Faces and A Beautiful Mind reflect a popular fascination with the mysteries of prime numbers and cryptography.[63] Prime numbers are used as a metaphor for loneliness and isolation in the Paolo Giordano novel The Solitude of Prime Numbers, in which they are portrayed as \\"outsiders\\" among integers.[64]","input":"Why is 1 not the smallest prime number?"},{"output":"the fifth planet from the Sun","context":"by volume:\\r\\nIces:\\r\\nJupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity.[13] The Romans named it after their god Jupiter.[14] When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of ?2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows,[15] and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.\\r\\nJupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements,[16] but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons,[17] including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.\\r\\nJupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft, most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and later by the Galileo orbiter. In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno, which entered into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016.[18][19] Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarth and its neighbor planets may have formed from fragments of planets after collisions with Jupiter destroyed those super-Earths near the Sun. As Jupiter came toward the inner Solar System, in what theorists call the Grand Tack Hypothesis, gravitational tugs and pulls occurred causing a series of collisions between the super-Earths as their orbits began to overlap.[20]\\r\\nAstronomers have discovered nearly 500 planetary systems with multiple planets. Regularly these systems include a few planets with masses several times greater than Earth's (super-Earths), orbiting closer to their star than Mercury is to the Sun, and sometimes also Jupiter-mass gas giants close to their star.\\r\\nJupiter moving out of the inner Solar System would have allowed the formation of inner planets, including Earth.[21]\\r\\nJupiter is composed primarily of gaseous and liquid matter. It is the largest of the four giant planets in the Solar System and hence its largest planet. It has a diameter of 142,984?km (88,846?mi) at its equator. The average density of Jupiter, 1.326?g/cm3, is the second highest of the giant planets, but lower than those of the four terrestrial planets.\\r\\nJupiter's upper atmosphere is about 88ÿ92% hydrogen and 8ÿ12% helium by percent volume of gas molecules. A helium atom has about four times as much mass as a hydrogen atom, so the composition changes when described as the proportion of mass contributed by different atoms. Thus, Jupiter's atmosphere is approximately 75% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with the remaining one percent of the mass consisting of other elements. The atmosphere contains trace amounts of methane, water vapor, ammonia, and silicon-based compounds. There are also traces of carbon, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, neon, oxygen, phosphine, and sulfur. The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains crystals of frozen ammonia. The interior contains denser materials - by mass it is roughly 71% hydrogen, 24% helium, and 5% other elements.[22][23] Through infrared and ultraviolet measurements, trace amounts of benzene and other hydrocarbons have also been found.[24]\\r\\nThe atmospheric proportions of hydrogen and helium are close to the theoretical composition of the primordial solar nebula. Neon in the upper atmosphere only consists of 20 parts per million by mass, which is about a tenth as abundant as in the Sun.[25] Helium is also depleted to about 80% of the Sun's helium composition. This depletion is a result of precipitation of these elements into the interior of the planet.[26]\\r\\nBased on spectroscopy, Saturn is thought to be similar in composition to Jupiter, but the other giant planets Uranus and Neptune have relatively less hydrogen and helium and relatively more ices and are thus now termed ice giants.[27]\\r\\nJupiter's mass is 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combinedthis is so massive that its barycenter with the Sun lies above the Sun's surface at 1.068?solar radii from the Sun's center.[28] Jupiter is much larger than Earth and considerably less dense: its volume is that of about 1,321 Earths, but it is only 318 times as massive.[5][29] Jupiter's radius is about 1/10 the radius of the Sun,[30] and its mass is 0.001 times the mass of the Sun, so the densities of the two bodies are similar.[31] A \\"Jupiter mass\\" (MJ or MJup) is often used as a unit to describe masses of other objects, particularly extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs. So, for example, the extrasolar planet HD 209458 b has a mass of 0.69?MJ, while Kappa Andromedae b has a mass of 12.8?MJ.[32]\\r\\nTheoretical models indicate that if Jupiter had much more mass than it does at present, it would shrink.[33] For small changes in mass, the radius would not change appreciably, and above about 500?M? (1.6 Jupiter masses)[33] the interior would become so much more compressed under the increased pressure that its volume would decrease despite the increasing amount of matter. As a result, Jupiter is thought to have about as large a diameter as a planet of its composition and evolutionary history can achieve.[34] The process of further shrinkage with increasing mass would continue until appreciable stellar ignition was achieved, as in high-mass brown dwarfs having around 50 Jupiter masses.[35]\\r\\nAlthough Jupiter would need to be about 75 times as massive to fuse hydrogen and become a star, the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in radius than Jupiter.[36][37] Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun; the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives.[38] This additional heat is generated by the KelvinÿHelmholtz mechanism through contraction. This process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 2?cm each year.[39] When it was first formed, Jupiter was much hotter and was about twice its current diameter.[40]\\r\\nJupiter is thought to consist of a dense core with a mixture of elements, a surrounding layer of liquid metallic hydrogen with some helium, and an outer layer predominantly of molecular hydrogen.[39] Beyond this basic outline, there is still considerable uncertainty. The core is often described as rocky, but its detailed composition is unknown, as are the properties of materials at the temperatures and pressures of those depths (see below). In 1997, the existence of the core was suggested by gravitational measurements,[39] indicating a mass of from 12 to 45 times that of Earth, or roughly 4%ÿ14% of the total mass of Jupiter.[38][41] The presence of a core during at least part of Jupiter's history is suggested by models of planetary formation that require the formation of a rocky or icy core massive enough to collect its bulk of hydrogen and helium from the protosolar nebula. Assuming it did exist, it may have shrunk as convection currents of hot liquid metallic hydrogen mixed with the molten core and carried its contents to higher levels in the planetary interior. A core may now be entirely absent, as gravitational measurements are not yet precise enough to rule that possibility out entirely.[39][42]\\r\\nThe uncertainty of the models is tied to the error margin in hitherto measured parameters: one of the rotational coefficients (J6) used to describe the planet's gravitational moment, Jupiter's equatorial radius, and its temperature at 1 bar pressure. The Juno mission, which arrived in July 2016,[18] is expected to further constrain the values of these parameters for better models of the core.[43]\\r\\nThe core region may be surrounded by dense metallic hydrogen, which extends outward to about 78% of the radius of the planet.[38] Rain-like droplets of helium and neon precipitate downward through this layer, depleting the abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere.[26][44] Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur on Jupiter, as well as on Saturn[45] and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.[46]\\r\\nAbove the layer of metallic hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938?K.[47] In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phaseshydrogen is said to be in a supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1,000?km,[38] and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundarythe gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.[48][49]\\r\\nThe temperature and pressure inside Jupiter increase steadily toward the core, due to the KelvinÿHelmholtz mechanism. At the pressure level of 10?bars (1 MPa), the temperature is around 340?K (67?C; 152?F). At the phase transition region where hydrogenheated beyond its critical pointbecomes metallic, it is calculated the temperature is 10,000?K (9,700?C; 17,500?F) and the pressure is 200?GPa. The temperature at the core boundary is estimated to be 36,000?K (35,700?C; 64,300?F) and the interior pressure is roughly 3,000ÿ4,500?GPa.[38]\\r\\nJupiter has the largest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, spanning over 5,000?km (3,000?mi) in altitude.[50][51] Because Jupiter has no surface, the base of its atmosphere is usually considered to be the point at which atmospheric pressure is equal to 100?kPa (1.0?bar).\\r\\nJupiter is perpetually covered with clouds composed of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds are located in the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds of 100?m/s (360?km/h) are common in zonal jets.[52] The zones have been observed to vary in width, color and intensity from year to year, but they have remained sufficiently stable for scientists to give them identifying designations.[29]\\r\\nThe cloud layer is only about 50?km (31?mi) deep, and consists of at least two decks of clouds: a thick lower deck and a thin clearer region. There may also be a thin layer of water clouds underlying the ammonia layer. Supporting the idea of water clouds are the flashes of lightning detected in the atmosphere of Jupiter. These electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times as powerful as lightning on Earth.[53] The water clouds are assumed to generate thunderstorms in the same way as terrestrial thunderstorms, driven by the heat rising from the interior.[54]\\r\\nThe orange and brown coloration in the clouds of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that change color when they are exposed to ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the substances are thought to be phosphorus, sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons.[38][55] These colorful compounds, known as chromophores, mix with the warmer, lower deck of clouds. The zones are formed when rising convection cells form crystallizing ammonia that masks out these lower clouds from view.[56]\\r\\nJupiter's low axial tilt means that the poles constantly receive less solar radiation than at the planet's equatorial region. Convection within the interior of the planet transports more energy to the poles, balancing out the temperatures at the cloud layer.[29]\\r\\nThe best known feature of Jupiter is the Great Red Spot,[57] a persistent anticyclonic storm that is larger than Earth, located 22 south of the equator. It is known to have been in existence since at least 1831,[58] and possibly since 1665.[59][60] Images by the Hubble Space Telescope have shown as many as two \\"red spots\\" adjacent to the Great Red Spot.[61][62] The storm is large enough to be visible through Earth-based telescopes with an aperture of 12?cm or larger.[63] The oval object rotates counterclockwise, with a period of about six days.[64] The maximum altitude of this storm is about 8?km (5?mi) above the surrounding cloudtops.[65]\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot is large enough to accommodate Earth within its boundaries.[67] Mathematical models suggest that the storm is stable and may be a permanent feature of the planet.[68] However, it has significantly decreased in size since its discovery. Initial observations in the late 1800s showed it to be approximately 41,000?km (25,500?mi) across. By the time of the Voyager flybys in 1979, the storm had a length of 23,300?km (14,500?mi) and a width of approximately 13,000?km (8,000?mi).[69] Hubble observations in 1995 showed it had decreased in size again to 20,950?km (13,020?mi), and observations in 2009 showed the size to be 17,910?km (11,130?mi). As of 2015[update], the storm was measured at approximately 16,500 by 10,940?km (10,250 by 6,800?mi),[69] and is decreasing in length by about 930?km (580?mi) per year.[67][70]\\r\\nStorms such as this are common within the turbulent atmospheres of giant planets. Jupiter also has white ovals and brown ovals, which are lesser unnamed storms. White ovals tend to consist of relatively cool clouds within the upper atmosphere. Brown ovals are warmer and located within the \\"normal cloud layer\\". Such storms can last as little as a few hours or stretch on for centuries.\\r\\nEven before Voyager proved that the feature was a storm, there was strong evidence that the spot could not be associated with any deeper feature on the planet's surface, as the Spot rotates differentially with respect to the rest of the atmosphere, sometimes faster and sometimes more slowly.\\r\\nIn 2000, an atmospheric feature formed in the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the Great Red Spot, but smaller. This was created when several smaller, white oval-shaped storms merged to form a single featurethese three smaller white ovals were first observed in 1938. The merged feature was named Oval BA, and has been nicknamed Red Spot Junior. It has since increased in intensity and changed color from white to red.[71][72][73]\\r\\nIn April 2017, scientists reported the discovery of a \\"Great Cold Spot\\" in Jupiter's thermosphere at its north pole that is 24,000?km (15,000?mi) across, 12,000?km (7,500?mi) wide, and 200?C (360?F) cooler than surrounding material. The feature was discovered by researchers at the Very Large Telescope in Chile, who then searched archived data from the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility between 1995 and 2000. They found that, while the Spot changes size, shape and intensity over the short term, it has maintained its general position in the atmosphere across more than 15 years of available data. Scientists believe the Spot is a giant vortex similar to the Great Red Spot and also appears to be quasi-stable like the vortices in Earth's thermosphere. Interactions between charged particles generated from Io and the planet's strong magnetic field likely resulted in redistribution of heat flow, forming the Spot.[74][75][76][77]\\r\\nJupiter's magnetic field is fourteen times as strong as that of Earth, ranging from 4.2?gauss (0.42 mT) at the equator to 10ÿ14 gauss (1.0ÿ1.4 mT) at the poles, making it the strongest in the Solar System (except for sunspots).[56] This field is thought to be generated by eddy currentsswirling movements of conducting materialswithin the liquid metallic hydrogen core. The volcanoes on the moon Io emit large amounts of sulfur dioxide forming a gas torus along the moon's orbit. The gas is ionized in the magnetosphere producing sulfur and oxygen ions. They, together with hydrogen ions originating from the atmosphere of Jupiter, form a plasma sheet in Jupiter's equatorial plane. The plasma in the sheet co-rotates with the planet causing deformation of the dipole magnetic field into that of magnetodisk. Electrons within the plasma sheet generate a strong radio signature that produces bursts in the range of 0.6ÿ30?MHz.[78]\\r\\nAt about 75 Jupiter radii from the planet, the interaction of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheatha region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.[38]\\r\\nThe magnetosphere of Jupiter is responsible for intense episodes of radio emission from the planet's polar regions. Volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io (see below) injects gas into Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing a torus of particles about the planet. As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates Alfvn waves that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through a cyclotron maser mechanism, and the energy is transmitted out along a cone-shaped surface. When Earth intersects this cone, the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the solar radio output.[79]\\r\\nJupiter is the only planet whose barycenter with the Sun lies outside the volume of the Sun, though by only 7% of the Sun's radius.[80] The average distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778 million?km (about 5.2 times the average distance between Earth and the Sun, or 5.2 AU) and it completes an orbit every 11.86?years. This is approximately two-fifths the orbital period of Saturn, forming a near orbital resonance between the two largest planets in the Solar System.[81] The elliptical orbit of Jupiter is inclined 1.31 compared to Earth. Because the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.048, Jupiter's distance from the Sun varies by 75 million?km between its nearest approach (perihelion) and furthest distance (aphelion).\\r\\nThe axial tilt of Jupiter is relatively small: only 3.13. As a result, it does not experience significant seasonal changes, in contrast to, for example, Earth and Mars.[82]\\r\\nJupiter's rotation is the fastest of all the Solar System's planets, completing a rotation on its axis in slightly less than ten hours; this creates an equatorial bulge easily seen through an Earth-based amateur telescope. The planet is shaped as an oblate spheroid, meaning that the diameter across its equator is longer than the diameter measured between its poles. On Jupiter, the equatorial diameter is 9,275?km (5,763?mi) longer than the diameter measured through the poles.[49]\\r\\nBecause Jupiter is not a solid body, its upper atmosphere undergoes differential rotation. The rotation of Jupiter's polar atmosphere is about 5?minutes longer than that of the equatorial atmosphere; three systems are used as frames of reference, particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies from the latitudes 10?N to 10?S; its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II applies at all latitudes north and south of these; its period is 9h 55m 40.6s. System III was first defined by radio astronomers, and corresponds to the rotation of the planet's magnetosphere; its period is Jupiter's official rotation.[83]\\r\\nJupiter is usually the fourth brightest object in the sky (after the Sun, the Moon and Venus);[56] at times Mars appears brighter than Jupiter. Depending on Jupiter's position with respect to the Earth, it can vary in visual magnitude from as bright as ?2.9 at opposition down to ?1.6 during conjunction with the Sun. The angular diameter of Jupiter likewise varies from 50.1 to 29.8 arc seconds.[5] Favorable oppositions occur when Jupiter is passing through perihelion, an event that occurs once per orbit.\\r\\nEarth overtakes Jupiter every 398.9 days as it orbits the Sun, a duration called the synodic period. As it does so, Jupiter appears to undergo retrograde motion with respect to the background stars. That is, for a period Jupiter seems to move backward in the night sky, performing a looping motion.\\r\\nBecause the orbit of Jupiter is outside that of Earth, the phase angle of Jupiter as viewed from Earth never exceeds 11.5. That is, the planet always appears nearly fully illuminated when viewed through Earth-based telescopes. It was only during spacecraft missions to Jupiter that crescent views of the planet were obtained.[84] A small telescope will usually show Jupiter's four Galilean moons and the prominent cloud belts across Jupiter's atmosphere.[85] A large telescope will show Jupiter's Great Red Spot when it faces Earth.\\r\\nThe planet Jupiter has been known since ancient times. It is visible to the naked eye in the night sky and can occasionally be seen in the daytime when the Sun is low.[86] To the Babylonians, this object represented their god Marduk. They used Jupiter's roughly 12-year orbit along the ecliptic to define the constellations of their zodiac.[29][87]\\r\\nThe Romans named it after Jupiter (Latin: Iuppiter, Ipiter) (also called Jove), the principal god of Roman mythology, whose name comes from the Proto-Indo-European vocative compound *Dyu-p?ter (nominative: *Dyus-p?tr, meaning \\"Father Sky-God\\", or \\"Father Day-God\\").[88] In turn, Jupiter was the counterpart to the mythical Greek Zeus (??), also referred to as Dias (?ϫ?), the planetary name of which is retained in modern Greek.[89]\\r\\nThe astronomical symbol for the planet, , is a stylized representation of the god's lightning bolt. The original Greek deity Zeus supplies the root zeno-, used to form some Jupiter-related words, such as zenographic.[d]\\r\\nJovian is the adjectival form of Jupiter. The older adjectival form jovial, employed by astrologers in the Middle Ages, has come to mean \\"happy\\" or \\"merry\\", moods ascribed to Jupiter's astrological influence.[90]\\r\\nThe Chinese, Koreans and Japanese called it the \\"wood star\\" (Chinese: Jx; pinyin: mxؐng), based on the Chinese Five Elements.[91][92][93] Chinese Taoism personified it as the Fu star. The Greeks called it ϫ?Ĳ (Phaethon, meaning \\"blazing\\"). In Vedic astrology, Hindu astrologers named the planet after Brihaspati, the religious teacher of the gods, and often called it \\"Guru\\", which literally means the \\"Heavy One\\".[94]\\r\\nIn Germanic mythology, Jupiter is equated to Thor, whence the English name Thursday for the Roman dies Jovis.[95]\\r\\nIn the Central Asian-Turkic myths, Jupiter is called Erendiz or Erentz, from eren (of uncertain meaning) and yultuz (\\"star\\"). There are many theories about the meaning of eren. These peoples calculated the period of the orbit of Jupiter as 11 years and 300 days. They believed that some social and natural events connected to Erentz's movements on the sky.[96]\\r\\nThe observation of Jupiter dates back to at least the Babylonian astronomers of the 7th or 8th century BC.[97] The ancient Chinese also observed the orbit of Suxؐng (?qx) and established their cycle of 12 earthly branches based on its approximate number of years; the Chinese language still uses its name (simplified as ) when referring to years of age. By the 4th century BC, these observations had developed into the Chinese zodiac,[98] with each year associated with a Tai Sui star and god controlling the region of the heavens opposite Jupiter's position in the night sky; these beliefs survive in some Taoist religious practices and in the East Asian zodiac's twelve animals, now often popularly assumed to be related to the arrival of the animals before Buddha. The Chinese historian Xi Zezong has claimed that Gan De, an ancient Chinese astronomer, discovered one of Jupiter's moons in 362?BC with the unaided eye. If accurate, this would predate Galileo's discovery by nearly two millennia.[99][100] In his 2nd century work the Almagest, the Hellenistic astronomer Claudius Ptolemaeus constructed a geocentric planetary model based on deferents and epicycles to explain Jupiter's motion relative to Earth, giving its orbital period around Earth as 4332.38?days, or 11.86?years.[101] In 499, Aryabhata, a mathematicianÿastronomer from the classical age of Indian mathematics and astronomy, also used a geocentric model to estimate Jupiter's period as 4332.2722?days, or 11.86?years.[102][verification needed]\\r\\nIn 1610, Galileo Galilei discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter (now known as the Galilean moons) using a telescope; thought to be the first telescopic observation of moons other than Earth's. One day after Galileo, Simon Marius independently discovered moons around Jupiter, though he did not publish his discovery in a book until 1614.[103] It was Marius's names for the four major moons, however, that stuckIo, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. These findings were also the first discovery of celestial motion not apparently centered on Earth. The discovery was a major point in favor of Copernicus' heliocentric theory of the motions of the planets; Galileo's outspoken support of the Copernican theory placed him under the threat of the Inquisition.[104]\\r\\nDuring the 1660s, Giovanni Cassini used a new telescope to discover spots and colorful bands on Jupiter and observed that the planet appeared oblate; that is, flattened at the poles. He was also able to estimate the rotation period of the planet.[105] In 1690 Cassini noticed that the atmosphere undergoes differential rotation.[38]\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot, a prominent oval-shaped feature in the southern hemisphere of Jupiter, may have been observed as early as 1664 by Robert Hooke and in 1665 by Cassini, although this is disputed. The pharmacist Heinrich Schwabe produced the earliest known drawing to show details of the Great Red Spot in 1831.[106]\\r\\nThe Red Spot was reportedly lost from sight on several occasions between 1665 and 1708 before becoming quite conspicuous in 1878. It was recorded as fading again in 1883 and at the start of the 20th century.[107]\\r\\nBoth Giovanni Borelli and Cassini made careful tables of the motions of Jupiter's moons, allowing predictions of the times when the moons would pass before or behind the planet. By the 1670s, it was observed that when Jupiter was on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth, these events would occur about 17?minutes later than expected. Ole R?mer deduced that light does not travel instantaneously (a conclusion that Cassini had earlier rejected),[23] and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the speed of light.[108]\\r\\nIn 1892, E. E. Barnard observed a fifth satellite of Jupiter with the 36-inch (910?mm) refractor at Lick Observatory in California. The discovery of this relatively small object, a testament to his keen eyesight, quickly made him famous. This moon was later named Amalthea.[109] It was the last planetary moon to be discovered directly by visual observation.[110]\\r\\nIn 1932, Rupert Wildt identified absorption bands of ammonia and methane in the spectra of Jupiter.[111]\\r\\nThree long-lived anticyclonic features termed white ovals were observed in 1938. For several decades they remained as separate features in the atmosphere, sometimes approaching each other but never merging. Finally, two of the ovals merged in 1998, then absorbed the third in 2000, becoming Oval BA.[112]\\r\\nIn 1955, Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin detected bursts of radio signals coming from Jupiter at 22.2?MHz.[38] The period of these bursts matched the rotation of the planet, and they were also able to use this information to refine the rotation rate. Radio bursts from Jupiter were found to come in two forms: long bursts (or L-bursts) lasting up to several seconds, and short bursts (or S-bursts) that had a duration of less than a hundredth of a second.[113]\\r\\nScientists discovered that there were three forms of radio signals transmitted from Jupiter.\\r\\nSince 1973 a number of automated spacecraft have visited Jupiter, most notably the Pioneer 10 space probe, the first spacecraft to get close enough to Jupiter to send back revelations about the properties and phenomena of the Solar System's largest planet.[116][117] Flights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or delta-v. Entering a Hohmann transfer orbit from Earth to Jupiter from low Earth orbit requires a delta-v of 6.3?km/s[118] which is comparable to the 9.7?km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit.[119] Fortunately, gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required to reach Jupiter, albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration.[120]\\r\\nBeginning in 1973, several spacecraft have performed planetary flyby maneuvers that brought them within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter and the amount of polar flattening.[29][122]\\r\\nSix years later, the Voyager missions vastly improved the understanding of the Galilean moons and discovered Jupiter's rings. They also confirmed that the Great Red Spot was anticyclonic. Comparison of images showed that the Red Spot had changed hue since the Pioneer missions, turning from orange to dark brown. A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io's orbital path, and volcanoes were found on the moon's surface, some in the process of erupting. As the spacecraft passed behind the planet, it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere.[29][123]\\r\\nThe next mission to encounter Jupiter was the Ulysses solar probe. It performed a flyby maneuver to attain a polar orbit around the Sun. During this pass, the spacecraft conducted studies on Jupiter's magnetosphere. Ulysses has no cameras so no images were taken. A second flyby six years later was at a much greater distance.[121]\\r\\nIn 2000, the Cassini probe flew by Jupiter on its way to Saturn, and provided some of the highest-resolution images ever made of the planet.[124]\\r\\nThe New Horizons probe flew by Jupiter for a gravity assist en route to Pluto. Its closest approach was on February 28, 2007.[125] The probe's cameras measured plasma output from volcanoes on Io and studied all four Galilean moons in detail, as well as making long-distance observations of the outer moons Himalia and Elara.[126] Imaging of the Jovian system began September 4, 2006.[127][128]\\r\\nThe first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter was the Galileo probe, which entered orbit on December 7, 1995.[34] It orbited the planet for over seven years, conducting multiple flybys of all the Galilean moons and Amalthea. The spacecraft also witnessed the impact of Comet ShoemakerÿLevy 9 as it approached Jupiter in 1994, giving a unique vantage point for the event. Its originally designed capacity was limited by the failed deployment of its high-gain radio antenna, although extensive information was still gained about the Jovian system from Galileo.[129]\\r\\nA 340-kilogram titanium atmospheric probe was released from the spacecraft in July 1995, entering Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7.[34] It parachuted through 150?km (93?mi) of the atmosphere at a speed of about 2,575?km/h (1600?mph)[34] and collected data for 57.6?minutes before the signal was lost at a pressure of about 23 atmospheres at a temperature of 153?C.[130] It melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized. The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003 at a speed of over 50?km/s to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and possibly contaminating Europa, a moon which has been hypothesized to have the possibility of harboring life.[129]\\r\\nData from this mission revealed that hydrogen composes up to 90% of Jupiter's atmosphere.[34] The recorded temperature was more than 300?C (>570?F) and the windspeed measured more than 644?km/h (>400?mph) before the probes vapourised.[34]\\r\\nNASA's Juno mission arrived at Jupiter on July 4, 2016, and is expected to complete 37 orbits over the next 20 months.[18] The mission plan called for Juno to study the planet in detail from a polar orbit.[131] On August 27, 2016, the spacecraft completed its first fly-by of Jupiter and sent back the first-ever images of Jupiters north pole.[132]\\r\\nThe next planned mission to the Jovian system will be the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), due to launch in 2022,[133] followed by NASA's Europa Clipper mission in 2025.[134]\\r\\nThere has been great interest in studying the icy moons in detail because of the possibility of subsurface liquid oceans on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Funding difficulties have delayed progress. NASA's JIMO (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter) was cancelled in 2005.[135] A subsequent proposal was developed for a joint NASA/ESA mission called EJSM/Laplace, with a provisional launch date around 2020. EJSM/Laplace would have consisted of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter and the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter.[136] However, ESA had formally ended the partnership by April 2011, citing budget issues at NASA and the consequences on the mission timetable. Instead, ESA planned to go ahead with a European-only mission to compete in its L1 Cosmic Vision selection.[137]\\r\\nJupiter has 69 known natural satellites.[138] Of these, 53 are less than 10?kilometres in diameter and have only been discovered since 1975. The four largest moons, visible from Earth with binoculars on a clear night, known as the \\"Galilean moons\\", are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.\\r\\nThe moons discovered by GalileoIo, Europa, Ganymede, and Callistoare among the largest satellites in the Solar System. The orbits of three of them (Io, Europa, and Ganymede) form a pattern known as a Laplace resonance; for every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter, Europa makes exactly two orbits and Ganymede makes exactly one. This resonance causes the gravitational effects of the three large moons to distort their orbits into elliptical shapes, because each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbors at the same point in every orbit it makes. The tidal force from Jupiter, on the other hand, works to circularize their orbits.[139]\\r\\nThe eccentricity of their orbits causes regular flexing of the three moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away. This tidal flexing heats the moons' interiors by friction. This is seen most dramatically in the extraordinary volcanic activity of innermost Io (which is subject to the strongest tidal forces), and to a lesser degree in the geological youth of Europa's surface (indicating recent resurfacing of the moon's exterior).\\r\\nBefore the discoveries of the Voyager missions, Jupiter's moons were arranged neatly into four groups of four, based on commonality of their orbital elements. Since then, the large number of new small outer moons has complicated this picture. There are now thought to be six main groups, although some are more distinct than others.\\r\\nA basic sub-division is a grouping of the eight inner regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator and are thought to have formed with Jupiter. The remainder of the moons consist of an unknown number of small irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits, which are thought to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. Irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.[140][141]\\r\\nJupiter has a faint planetary ring system composed of three main segments: an inner torus of particles known as the halo, a relatively bright main ring, and an outer gossamer ring.[143] These rings appear to be made of dust, rather than ice as with Saturn's rings.[38] The main ring is probably made of material ejected from the satellites Adrastea and Metis. Material that would normally fall back to the moon is pulled into Jupiter because of its strong gravitational influence. The orbit of the material veers towards Jupiter and new material is added by additional impacts.[144] In a similar way, the moons Thebe and Amalthea probably produce the two distinct components of the dusty gossamer ring.[144] There is also evidence of a rocky ring strung along Amalthea's orbit which may consist of collisional debris from that moon.[145]\\r\\nAlong with the Sun, the gravitational influence of Jupiter has helped shape the Solar System. The orbits of most of the system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System's history.[146]\\r\\nAlong with its moons, Jupiter's gravitational field controls numerous asteroids that have settled into the regions of the Lagrangian points preceding and following Jupiter in its orbit around the Sun. These are known as the Trojan asteroids, and are divided into Greek and Trojan \\"camps\\" to commemorate the Iliad. The first of these, 588 Achilles, was discovered by Max Wolf in 1906; since then more than two thousand have been discovered.[147] The largest is 624 Hektor.\\r\\nMost short-period comets belong to the Jupiter familydefined as comets with semi-major axes smaller than Jupiter's. Jupiter family comets are thought to form in the Kuiper belt outside the orbit of Neptune. During close encounters with Jupiter their orbits are perturbed into a smaller period and then circularized by regular gravitational interaction with the Sun and Jupiter.[148]\\r\\nDue to the magnitude of Jupiter's mass, the center of gravity between it and the Sun lies just above the Sun's surface.[149] Jupiter is the only body in the Solar System for which this is true.\\r\\nJupiter has been called the Solar System's vacuum cleaner,[151] because of its immense gravity well and location near the inner Solar System. It receives the most frequent comet impacts of the Solar System's planets.[152] It was thought that the planet served to partially shield the inner system from cometary bombardment.[34] However, recent computer simulations suggest that Jupiter does not cause a net decrease in the number of comets that pass through the inner Solar System, as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them.[153] This topic remains controversial among scientists, as some think it draws comets towards Earth from the Kuiper belt while others think that Jupiter protects Earth from the alleged Oort cloud.[154] Jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.[34]\\r\\nA 1997 survey of early astronomical records and drawings suggested that a certain dark surface feature discovered by astronomer Giovanni Cassini in 1690 may have been an impact scar. The survey initially produced eight more candidate sites as potential impact observations that he and others had recorded between 1664 and 1839. It was later determined, however, that these candidate sites had little or no possibility of being the results of the proposed impacts.[155]\\r\\nMore recent discoveries include the following:\\r\\nSolar System?L Local Interstellar Cloud?L Local Bubble?L Gould Belt?L Orion Arm?L Milky Way?L Milky Way subgroup?L Local Group?L Virgo Supercluster?L Laniakea Supercluster?L Observable universe?L Universe\\r\\nEach arrow (L) may be read as \\"within\\" or \\"part of\\".","input":"What number planet is jupiter in the solar system?"},{"output":"the Unknown Soldier from World War I","context":"The Arc de Triomphe de l'toile (French pronunciation:?[a?k d? t?ij??f d? letwal]?(?listen), Triumphal Arch of the Star) is one of the most famous monuments in Paris, standing at the western end of the Champs-lyses at the center of Place Charles de Gaulle, formerly named Place de l'toile  the toile or \\"star\\" of the juncture formed by its twelve radiating avenues.\\r\\nThe Arc de Triomphe should not be confused with a smaller arch, the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, which stands west of the Louvre. The Arc de Triomphe honours those who fought and died for France in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, with the names of all French victories and generals inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces. Beneath its vault lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I.\\r\\nAs the central cohesive element of the Axe historique (historic axis, a sequence of monuments and grand thoroughfares on a route running from the courtyard of the Louvre to the Grande Arche de la Dfense), the Arc de Triomphe was designed by Jean Chalgrin in 1806, and its iconographic program pits heroically nude French youths against bearded Germanic warriors in chain mail. It set the tone for public monuments with triumphant patriotic messages.\\r\\nInspired by the Arch of Titus in Rome, Italy, the Arc de Triomphe has an overall height of 50 metres (164?ft), width of 45?m (148?ft), and depth of 22?m (72?ft), while its large vault is 29.19?m (95.8?ft) high and 14.62?m (48.0?ft) wide. The smaller transverse vaults are 18.68?m (61.3?ft) high and 8.44?m (27.7?ft) wide. Three weeks after the Paris victory parade in 1919 (marking the end of hostilities in World War I), Charles Godefroy flew his Nieuport biplane under the arch's primary vault, with the event captured on newsreel.[3][4][5]\\r\\nParis's Arc de Triomphe was the tallest triumphal arch until the completion of the Monumento a la Revoluci܇n in Mexico City in 1938, which is 67 metres (220?ft) high. The Arch of Triumph in Pyongyang, completed in 1982, is modelled on the Arc de Triomphe and is slightly taller at 60?m (197?ft).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Arc is located on the right bank of the Seine at the centre of a dodecagonal configuration of twelve radiating avenues. It was commissioned in 1806 after the victory at Austerlitz by Emperor Napoleon at the peak of his fortunes. Laying the foundations alone took two years and, in 1810, when Napoleon entered Paris from the west with his bride Archduchess Marie-Louise of Austria, he had a wooden mock-up of the completed arch constructed. The architect, Jean Chalgrin, died in 1811 and the work was taken over by Jean-Nicolas Huyot. During the Bourbon Restoration, construction was halted and it would not be completed until the reign of King Louis-Philippe, between 1833 and 1836, by the architects Goust, then Huyot, under the direction of Hricart de Thury. On 15 December 1840, brought back to France from Saint Helena, Napoleon's remains passed under it on their way to the Emperor's final resting place at the Invalides.[6] Prior to burial in the Panthon, the body of Victor Hugo was displayed under the Arc during the night of 22 May 1885.\\r\\nThe sword carried by the Republic in the Marseillaise relief broke off on the day, it is said, that the Battle of Verdun began in 1916. The relief was immediately hidden by tarpaulins to conceal the accident and avoid any undesired ominous interpretations.[7] On 7 August 1919, Charles Godefroy successfully flew his biplane under the Arc.[8] Jean Navarre was the pilot who was tasked to make the flight, but he died on 10 July 1919 when he crashed near Villacoublay while training for the flight.\\r\\nFollowing its construction, the Arc de Triomphe became the rallying point of French troops parading after successful military campaigns and for the annual Bastille Day Military Parade. Famous victory marches around or under the Arc have included the Germans in 1871, the French in 1919, the Germans in 1940, and the French and Allies in 1944[9] and 1945. A United States postage stamp of 1945 shows the Arc de Triomphe in the background as victorious American troops march down the Champs-lyses and U.S. airplanes fly overhead on 29 August 1944. After the interment of the Unknown Soldier, however, all military parades (including the aforementioned post-1919) have avoided marching through the actual arch. The route taken is up to the arch and then around its side, out of respect for the tomb and its symbolism. Both Hitler in 1940 and de Gaulle in 1944 observed this custom.\\r\\nBy the early 1960s, the monument had grown very blackened from coal soot and automobile exhaust, and during 1965ÿ1966 it was cleaned through bleaching.\\r\\nIn the prolongation of the Avenue des Champs-lyses, a new arch, the Grande Arche de la Dfense, was built in 1982, completing the line of monuments that forms Paris's Axe historique. After the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel and the Arc de Triomphe de l'toile, the Grande Arche is the third arch built on the same perspective.\\r\\nIn 1995, the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria placed a bomb near the Arc de Triomphe which wounded 17 people as part of a campaign of bombings.[10]\\r\\nThe astylar design is by Jean Chalgrin (1739ÿ1811), in the Neoclassical version of ancient Roman architecture (see, for example, the triumphal Arch of Titus). Major academic sculptors of France are represented in the sculpture of the Arc de Triomphe: Jean-Pierre Cortot; Fran?ois Rude; Antoine tex; James Pradier and Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire. The main sculptures are not integral friezes but are treated as independent trophies applied to the vast ashlar masonry masses, not unlike the gilt-bronze appliqus on Empire furniture. The four sculptural groups at the base of the Arc are The Triumph of 1810 (Cortot), Resistance and Peace (both by Antoine tex) and the most renowned of them all, Departure of the Volunteers of 1792 commonly called La Marseillaise (Fran?ois Rude). The face of the allegorical representation of France calling forth her people on this last was used as the belt buckle for the honorary rank of Marshal of France. Since the fall of Napoleon (1815), the sculpture representing Peace is interpreted as commemorating the Peace of 1815.\\r\\nIn the attic above the richly sculptured frieze of soldiers are 30 shields engraved with the names of major French victories in the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars.[11] The inside walls of the monument list the names of 660 people, among which are 558 French generals of the First French Empire;[12] The names of those generals killed in battle are underlined. Also inscribed, on the shorter sides of the four supporting columns, are the names of the major French victories in the Napoleonic Wars. The battles that took place in the period between the departure of Napoleon from Elba to his final defeat at Waterloo are not included.\\r\\nFor four years from 1882 to 1886, a monumental sculpture by Alexandre Falguire topped the arch. Titled Le triomphe de la Rvolution (\\"The Triumph of the Revolution\\"), it depicted a chariot drawn by horses preparing \\"to crush Anarchy and Despotism\\". It remained there only four years before falling in ruins.\\r\\nInside the monument, a permanent exhibition conceived by the artist Maurice Benayoun and the architect Christophe Girault opened in February 2007.[13] The steel and new media installation interrogates the symbolism of the national monument, questioning the balance of its symbolic message during the last two centuries, oscillating between war and peace.\\r\\nBeneath the Arc is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I. Interred on Armistice Day 1920,[14] it has the first eternal flame lit in Western and Eastern Europe since the Vestal Virgins' fire was extinguished in the fourth century. It burns in memory of the dead who were never identified (now in both world wars).\\r\\nA ceremony is held at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier every 11 November on the anniversary of the armistice signed by the Entente Powers and Germany in 1918. It was originally decided on 12 November 1919 to bury the unknown soldier's remains in the Panthon, but a public letter-writing campaign led to the decision to bury him beneath the Arc de Triomphe. The coffin was put in the chapel on the first floor of the Arc on 10 November 1920, and put in its final resting place on 28 January 1921. The slab on top bears the inscription ICI REPOSE UN SOLDAT FRAN?AIS MORT POUR LA PATRIE 1914ÿ1918 (\\"Here lies a French soldier who died for the fatherland 1914ÿ1918\\").\\r\\nIn 1961, American President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy paid their respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, accompanied by French President Charles de Gaulle. After the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy, Mrs Kennedy remembered the eternal flame at the Arc de Triomphe and requested that an eternal flame be placed next to her husband's grave at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. President Charles de Gaulle went to Washington to attend the state funeral, and witnessed Jacqueline Kennedy lighting the eternal flame that had been inspired by her visit to France.\\r\\nLe Dpart de 1792 (La Marseillaise)\\r\\nLe Triomphe de 1810\\r\\nLa Rsistance de 1814\\r\\nLa Paix de 1815\\r\\nLes funrailles du gnral Marceau, 20 September 1796\\r\\nLa bataille d'Aboukir,\\r\\n25 July 1799\\r\\nLa bataille de Jemmappes,\\r\\n6 November 1792\\r\\nLe passage du pont d'Arcole,\\r\\n15 November 1796\\r\\nLa prise d'Alexandrie,\\r\\n3 July 1798\\r\\nLa bataille d'Austerlitz,\\r\\n2 December 1805\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNORTH pillar\\r\\nSOUTH pillar\\r\\nEAST pillar\\r\\nWEST pillar\\r\\nFirst World War monument\\r\\nPermanent exhibition about the design of the Arch\\r\\nDe Gaulle speech plaque\\r\\nProclamation of Republic plaque\\r\\nThe Arc de Triomphe is accessible by the RER and Mtro, with exit at the Charles de Gaulletoile station. Because of heavy traffic on the roundabout of which the Arc is the centre, it is recommended that pedestrians use one of two underpasses located at the Champs lyses and the Avenue de la Grande Arme. A lift will take visitors almost to the top ÿ to the attic, where there is a small museum which contains large models of the Arc and tells its story from the time of its construction. Another 46 steps remain to climb in order to reach the top, the terrasse, from where one can enjoy a panoramic view of Paris.[citation needed]","input":"Who is buried under the arc de triomphe?"},{"output":"Prince William Sound, Alaska","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Exxon Valdez oil spill occurred in Prince William Sound, Alaska, March 24, 1989, when Exxon Valdez, an oil tanker owned by Exxon Shipping Company, bound for Long Beach, California, struck Prince William Sound's Bligh Reef at 12:04?am[1][2] local time and spilled 10.8?million US gallons (260,000?bbl; 41,000?m3) of crude oil over the next few days.[3] It is considered to be one of the most devastating human-caused environmental disasters.[4] The Valdez spill is the second largest in US waters, after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, in terms of volume released.[5] Prince William Sound's remote location, accessible only by helicopter, plane, or boat, made government and industry response efforts difficult and severely taxed existing response plans. The region is a habitat for salmon, sea otters, seals and seabirds. The oil, originally extracted at the Prudhoe Bay oil field, eventually covered 1,300 miles (2,100?km) of coastline,[3] and 11,000 square miles (28,000?km2) of ocean.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to official reports, the ship was carrying 53.09451?million US gallons (1,264,155?bbl; 200,984.6?m3) of oil, of which about 10.8?million US gallons (260,000?bbl; 41,000?m3) were spilled into the Prince William Sound.[1][8] An approximate figure of 11?million US gallons (260,000?bbl; 42,000?m3) was a commonly accepted estimate of the spill's volume and has been used by the State of Alaska's Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council,[3] the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and environmental groups such as Greenpeace and the Sierra Club.[5][9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nMultiple factors have been identified as contributing to the incident:\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Joseph Hazelwood, who was widely reported to have been drinking heavily that night, was not at the controls when the ship struck the reef. However, as the senior officer, he was in command of the ship even though he was asleep in his bunk. In light of the other findings, investigative reporter Greg Palast stated in 2008, \\"Forget the drunken skipper fable. As to Captain Joe Hazelwood, he was below decks, sleeping off his bender. At the helm, the third mate never would have collided with Bligh Reef had he looked at his RAYCAS radar. But the radar was not turned on. In fact, the tanker's radar was left broken and disabled for more than a year before the disaster, and Exxon management knew it. It was just too expensive to fix and operate.\\"[14] Exxon blamed Captain Hazelwood for the grounding of the tanker.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther factors, according to an MIT course entitled \\"Software System Safety\\" by Professor Nancy G. Leveson,[15] included:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis disaster resulted in International Maritime Organization introducing comprehensive marine pollution prevention rules (MARPOL) through various conventions. The rules were ratified by member countries and, under International Ship Management rules, the ships are being operated with a common objective of \\"safer ships and cleaner oceans\\".[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, Exxon Valdez Captain Joseph Hazelwood offered a \\"heartfelt apology\\" to the people of Alaska, suggesting he had been wrongly blamed for the disaster: \\"The true story is out there for anybody who wants to look at the facts, but that's not the sexy story and that's not the easy story,\\" he said. Hazelwood said he felt Alaskans always gave him a fair shake.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nChemical dispersant, a surfactant and solvent mixture, was applied to the slick by a private company on March 24 with a helicopter. But the helicopter missed the target area. Scientific data on its toxicity were either thin or incomplete. In addition, public acceptance of a new, widespread chemical treatment was lacking. Landowners, fishing groups, and conservation organizations questioned the use of chemicals on hundreds of miles of shoreline when other alternatives may have been available.\\"[21][22][22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a report by David Kirby for TakePart, the main component of the Corexit formulation used during cleanup, 2-butoxyethanol, was identified as \\"one of the agents that caused liver, kidney, lung, nervous system, and blood disorders among cleanup crews in Alaska following the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nMechanical cleanup was started shortly afterwards using booms and skimmers, but the skimmers were not readily available during the first 24 hours following the spill, and thick oil and kelp tended to clog the equipment. Despite civilian insistence for a complete clean, only 10% of total oil was actually completely cleaned.[1]  Exxon was widely  criticized for its slow response to cleaning up the disaster and John Devens, the mayor of Valdez, has said his community felt betrayed by Exxon's inadequate response to the crisis.[25] More than 11,000 Alaska residents, along with some Exxon employees, worked throughout the region to try to restore the environment. \\r\\n\\r\\nBecause Prince William Sound contained many rocky coves where the oil collected, the decision was made to displace it with high-pressure hot water. However, this also displaced and destroyed the microbial populations on the shoreline; many of these organisms (e.g. plankton) are the basis of the coastal marine food chain, and others (e.g. certain bacteria and fungi) are capable of facilitating the biodegradation of oil.  At the time, both scientific advice and public pressure was to clean everything, but since then, a much greater understanding of natural and facilitated remediation processes has developed, due somewhat in part to the opportunity presented for study by the Exxon Valdez spill. Despite the extensive cleanup attempts, less than ten percent of the oil was recovered and a study conducted by NOAA determined that as of early 2007 more than 26?thousand U.S. gallons (98?m3) of oil remain in the sandy soil of the contaminated shoreline, declining at a rate of less than 4% per year.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the long-term and short-term effects of the oil spill have been studied.[28] Immediate effects included the deaths of 100,000 to as many as 250,000 seabirds, at least 2,800 sea otters, approximately 12 river otters, 300 harbor seals, 247 bald eagles, and 22 orcas, and an unknown number of salmon and herring.[8][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, fourteen years after the spill, a team from the University of North Carolina found that the remaining oil was lasting far longer than anticipated, which in turn had resulted in more long-term loss of many species than had been expected.  The researchers found that at only a few parts per billion, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  caused a long-term increase in mortality rates.  They reported that \\"species as diverse as sea otters, harlequin ducks and killer whales suffered large, long-term losses and that oiled mussel beds and other tidal shoreline habitats will take an estimated 30 years to recover.\\"[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, a study done by the National Marine Fisheries Service in Juneau found that about 6 miles (9.7?km) of shoreline around Prince William Sound was still affected by the spill, with 101.6 tonnes of oil remaining in the area. Exxon Mobil denied any concerns over any remaining oil, stating that they anticipated a remaining fraction that they assert will not cause any long-term ecological impacts, according to the conclusions of the studies they had done: \\"We've done 350 peer-reviewed studies of Prince William Sound, and those studies conclude that Prince William Sound has recovered, it's healthy and it's thriving.\\"[31] However, in 2007 a  NOAA study concluded that this contamination can produce chronic low-level exposure, discourage subsistence where the contamination is heavy, and decrease the \\"wilderness character\\" of the area.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effects of the spill continued to be felt for many years afterwards. As of 2010 there were an estimated 23,000 US gallons (87?m3) of Valdez crude oil still in Alaska's sand and soil, breaking down at a rate estimated at less than 4% per year.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 24, 2014, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the spill, NOAA scientists reported that some species seem to have recovered, with the sea otter the latest creature to return to pre-spill numbers.  Scientists who have monitored the spill area for the last 25 years report that concern remains for one of two pods of local orca whales, with fears that one pod may eventually die out.[33]  Federal scientists estimate that between 16,000 and 21,000 US gallons (61 to 79 m3) of oil remains on beaches in Prince William Sound and up to 450 miles (725?km) away. Some of the oil does not appear to have biodegraded at all.  A USGS scientist who analyses the remaining oil along the coastline states that it remains among rocks and between tide marks.  \\"The oil mixes with seawater and forms an emulsion...Left out, the surface crusts over but the inside still has the consistency of mayonnaise ÿ or mousse.\\"[34]  Alaska state senator Berta Gardner is urging Alaskan politicians to demand that the US government force ExxonMobil  to pay the final $92 million (S57 million) still owed from the court settlement.  The  major part of the money would be spent to finish cleaning up oiled beaches and attempting to restore the crippled herring population.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of Exxon v. Baker, an Anchorage jury awarded $287?million for actual damages and $5?billion for punitive damages. To protect itself in case the judgment was affirmed, Exxon obtained a $4.8?billion credit line from J.P. Morgan & Co., who created the first modern credit default swap so that they would not have to hold as much money in reserve against the risk of Exxon's default.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Exxon appealed the ruling, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the trial judge, Russel Holland, to reduce the punitive damages. On December 6, 2002, Holland announced that he had reduced the damages to $4?billion, which he concluded was justified by the facts of the case and was not grossly excessive. Exxon appealed again and the case returned to Holland to be reconsidered in light of a recent Supreme Court ruling in a similar case. Holland increased the punitive damages to $4.5?billion, plus interest.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter more appeals, in December 2006 the damages award was cut to $2.5?billion. The court of appeals cited recent Supreme Court rulings relative to limits on punitive damages.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nExxon appealed again. On May 23, 2007, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied ExxonMobil's request for a third hearing and let stand its ruling that Exxon owed $2.5?billion in punitive damages. Exxon then appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.[37] On February 27, 2008, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments. Justice Samuel Alito, who at the time, owned between $100,000 and $250,000 in Exxon stock, recused himself from the case.[38] In a decision issued June 25, 2008, written by Justice David Souter, the court vacated the $2.5?billion award and remanded the case back to the lower court, finding that the damages were excessive with respect to maritime common law. Exxon's actions were deemed \\"worse than negligent but less than malicious.\\"[39] The punitive damages were further reduced to an amount of  $507.5?million.[40] The Court's ruling was that maritime punitive damages should not exceed the compensatory damages,[40] supported by a precedent dating from 1818.[41] Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy has decried the ruling as \\"another in a line of cases where this Supreme Court has misconstrued congressional intent to benefit large corporations.\\"[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nExxon's official position was that punitive damages greater than $25?million were not justified because the spill resulted from an accident, and because Exxon spent an estimated $2?billion cleaning up the spill and a further $1?billion to settle related civil and criminal charges. Attorneys for the plaintiffs contended that Exxon bore responsibility for the accident because the company \\"put a drunk in charge of a tanker in Prince William Sound.\\"[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nExxon recovered a significant portion of clean-up and legal expenses through insurance claims associated with the grounding of the Exxon Valdez.[44][45] Also, in 1991, Exxon made a quiet, separate financial settlement of damages with a group of seafood producers known as the Seattle Seven for the disaster's effect on the Alaskan seafood industry. The agreement granted $63.75?million to the Seattle Seven, but stipulated that the seafood companies would have to repay almost all of any punitive damages awarded in other civil proceedings. The $5?billion in punitive damages was awarded later, and the Seattle Seven's share could have been as high as $750?million if the damages award had held. Other plaintiffs have objected to this secret arrangement,[46] and when it came to light, Judge Holland ruled that Exxon should have told the jury at the start that an agreement had already been made, so the jury would know exactly how much Exxon would have to pay.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of December 15, 2009, Exxon had paid the entire $507.5 million in punitive damages, including lawsuit costs, plus interest, which were further distributed to thousands of plaintiffs.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1989, Exxon filed suit against the State of Alaska, charging that the state had interfered with Exxon's attempts to clean up the spill by refusing to approve the use of dispersant chemicals until the night of the 26th. The state disputed the claim, stating that there was a long-standing agreement to allow the use of dispersants to clean up spills, thus Exxon did not require permission to use them, and that in fact Exxon had not had enough dispersant on hand to effectively handle a spill of the size created by the Valdez.[49] Exxon filed claims in October 1990 against the Coast Guard, asking to be reimbursed for cleanup costs and damages awarded to plaintiffs in any lawsuits filed by the State of Alaska or the federal government against Exxon. The company claimed that the Coast Guard was \\"wholly or partially responsible\\" for the spill, because they had granted mariners' licenses to the crew of the Valdez, and because they had given the Valdez permission to leave regular shipping lanes to avoid ice. They also reiterated the claim that the Coast Guard had delayed cleanup by refusing to give permission to immediately use chemical dispersants on the spill.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe  Oil Spill Recovery Institute was formed after United States Congress approved it to seek a solution. Collaborating with InnoCentive they found a partial solution for the flow of oil.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nA report by the US National Response Team summarized the event and made a number of recommendations, such as changes to the work patterns of Exxon crew in order to address the causes of the accident.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the spill, the United States Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA). The legislation included a clause that prohibits any vessel that, after March 22, 1989, has caused an oil spill of more than 1?million US gallons (3,800?m3) in any marine area, from operating in Prince William Sound.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 1998, the company argued in a legal action against the Federal government that the ship should be allowed back into Alaskan waters. Exxon claimed OPA was effectively a bill of attainder, a regulation that was unfairly directed at Exxon alone.[53] In 2002, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Exxon. As of 2002, OPA had prevented 18 ships from entering Prince William Sound.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nOPA also set a schedule for the gradual phase in of a double hull design, providing an additional layer between the oil tanks and the ocean. While a double hull would likely not have prevented the Valdez disaster, a Coast Guard study estimated that it would have cut the amount of oil spilled by 60 percent.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Exxon Valdez supertanker was towed to San Diego, arriving on July 10. Repairs began on July 30. Approximately 1,600 short tons (1,500?t) of steel were removed and replaced. In June 1990 the tanker, renamed S/R Mediterranean, left harbor after $30?million of repairs.[54] It was still sailing as of January 2010, registered in Panama. The vessel was then owned by a Hong Kong company, who operated it under the name Oriental Nicety. In August 2012, it was beached at Alang, India and dismantled.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the spill, Alaska governor Steve Cowper issued an executive order requiring two tugboats to escort every loaded tanker from Valdez out through Prince William Sound to Hinchinbrook Entrance. As the plan evolved in the 1990s, one of the two routine tugboats was replaced with a 210-foot (64?m) Escort Response Vehicle (ERV). Tankers at Valdez are no longer single-hulled.  Congress enacted legislation requiring all tankers to be double-hulled as of 2015.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991, following the collapse of the local marine population (particularly clams, herring and seals) the Chugach Alaska Corporation, an Alaska Native Corporation, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  It has since recovered.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to several studies funded by the state of Alaska, the spill had both short-term and long-term economic effects. These included the loss of recreational sports, fisheries, reduced tourism, and an estimate of what economists call \\"existence value\\", which is the value to the public of a pristine Prince William Sound.[58][59][60][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economy of the city of Cordova, Alaska was adversely affected after the spill damaged stocks of salmon and herring in the area.[62][63] The village of Chenega was transformed into an emergency base and media outlet.The local villagers had to cope with a tripling of their population from 80 to 250. When asked how they felt about the situation, a village councillor noted that they were too shocked and busy to be depressed; others emphasized the human costs of leaving children unattended while their parents worked to clean up.[64] Many Native Americans were worried that too much time was spent on the fishery and not enough on the land that supports subsidence hunting.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, a CNN report alleged that many oil spill cleanup workers involved in the Exxon Valdez response had subsequently become sick. Anchorage lawyer Dennis Mestas found that this was true of 6,722 of 11,000 worker files he was able to inspect. Access to the records was controlled by Exxon. Exxon responded in a statement to CNN:   \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 20 years, there is no evidence suggesting that either cleanup workers or the residents of the communities affected by the Valdez spill have had any adverse health effects as a result of the spill or its cleanup.[65][66]\\r\\nIn 1992, Exxon released a video titled Scientists and the Alaska Oil Spill, to be distributed to schools. Dr. Michael Fry called it a piece of \\"corporate propaganda\\".[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1994, the Unabomber assassinated Burson-Marsteller executive Thomas Mosser, accusing him of having \\"helped Exxon clean up its public image after the Exxon Valdez incident\\". The PR company claimed not to have been contracted during the actual crisis.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral weeks after the spill, Saturday Night Live aired a pointed sketch featuring Kevin Nealon, Phil Hartman, and Victoria Jackson as cleanup workers struggling to scrub the oil off of animals and rocks on a beach in Prince William Sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1995 film Waterworld, the Exxon Valdez is the flagship of the movie's villain, \\"The Deacon,\\" the leader of a band of scavenging raiders. In the ship is a portrait of their patron saint, Joseph Hazelwood.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second Forrest Gump novel, Gump and Co. by Winston Groom, Gump commandeers the Exxon Valdez and accidentally crashes it.[69]","input":"Where did the 1989 exxon valdez oil spill occur?"},{"output":"the late 1970s","context":"Streetwear is a style of street fashion rooted in Californian surf and skate culture. It has grown to encompass elements of hip hop fashion, Japanese street fashion, and modern haute couture fashion. In 2011 Complex Magazine named Stssy, Supreme and A Bathing Ape as the top streetwear brands.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movement is generally accepted to have been born out of the Los Angeles surf culture of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Brands included BlauGrun, Ocean Pacific, Hobie, Off Shore, Gotcha and Life's a Beach. Local surfboard designer Shawn Stussy began selling printed T-shirts featuring the same trademark signature he placed on his custom surfboards. Initially selling the items from his own car, Stussy expanded sales to boutiques once popularity increased.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nStssy's move into exclusive sales firmed up the baseline definition of streetwear: taking \\"a multi-faceted, subculturally diverse, Southern California lifestyle-based T-shirt brand and [mimicking] the limited feel of a high-end luxury brand....those are the two most integral components of what makes a brand streetwear: T-shirts and exclusivity.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly streetwear brands took inspiration from the DIY aesthetic of punk, new wave, heavy metal and later hip hop cultures. Established sportswear and fashion brands attached themselves to the emerging early 1980s hip hop scene such as Kangol and Adidas.\\r\\n\\r\\nNike's capture of soon-to-be basketball superstar Michael Jordan from rival Adidas in 1984 proved to be a huge turning point, as Nike dominated the urban streetwear sneaker market in the late 80's and early 90's.[citation needed] Other clothing brands such as Champion, Carhartt and Timberland were very closely associated with the scene, particularly on the East coast with hip hop acts such as Wu-Tang Clan and Mobb Deep sporting the look.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mid to late 90's saw the professional American sports franchises have a huge impact on the look of the scene, from the Los Angeles Raiders and Chicago Bulls caps and jackets in the early to the oversized team jerseys.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the advent of \\"bling\\" culture, the turn of the century saw an increase in established luxury brands beginning to make in roads into the market such as Burberry, Gucci and Fendi all making appearances in hip hop videos and films. The most popular shoe of the era was the Nike Air Force One, immortalized in the song by Nelly.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrand launches by the chief executives of record companies followed, with Russell Simmons of Def Jam launching his Phat Farm label, Sean Combs of Bad Boy with Sean John, and Jay-Z and Damon Dash of Roc-a-Fella Records launching Rocawear. Rap superstar 50 Cent a few years later launched his G-Unit clothing label, with the sneaker rights given to Reebok.\\r\\n\\r\\nSportswear fashion is a fashion trend which mixes the high and low, formal and active style in one look. They emphasize being casual and comfortable. Contemporary people can go directly from gym to shopping, without a change of their looks. Sporty outfits have transformed into street style, they no longer just emphasize on the garments functionality. Instead, the trend has an increasing diversified style, which may allow people to dress trendily even in sportswear. Common sportswear worn in contemporary street styles are like hoodies, bomber jackets, tennis-style skirts, luxe track pants, leggings, and sneakers, etc. Sportswear in trend can be seen as revival from the 1990s hip-hop fashion, which also contain elements such as the bomber jacket and baseball cap.\\r\\n\\r\\nContemporary streetwear is usually influenced by the generic sporty twists and sleek athletic lines. In earlier stages of sportswear fashion, femininity was usually expressed with the lines becoming cleaner, and silhouettes becoming minimal. Later, bold volumes in sportswear started to develop, hi-tech fabrics and old-school approaches were used in styling. In general, relaxed silhouettes, clean shapes, little embellishments, and an overall sophisticated feel would be observed in the looks of the trend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe decline of formal wear led to the rise of streetwear fashion. High-end and luxury brands are starting to develop luxury sportswear, for example Alexander Wang, Gucci, and DKNY. Among this type of luxury sportswear, luxe fabrics were used to produce their sportswear fashion for a high contrast on the sporty silhouette. Fabrics like silk organza, washed satin, leather, neoprene, and wool crepe were used to produce the luxury sportswear. These types of fabrics may help experiment a garment with texture, and may assist in capturing a modern-sports spirit of the season. Details of the designs in luxury sportswear looks are pulled directly from actual active wear. The two words, luxury and minimalism were first used together for sportswear in fashion, to interpret a fresh sports look which is sleek and clean, but bearing recognizable athletic influences. Common mix-and-match combination of luxury sportswear on streetwear are track pants under basketball shorts, with bold patterns and sumptuous fabrics for men; And light colored pencil skirts, with bomber jackets and sleek tops, which is cut in satin or tweed for women.\\r\\n\\r\\nSportswear in streetwear designs also change according to season. For example, with the drop of temperature, sports silhouette tends to turn slouchier, volumes become more exaggerated. Solid fabrics such as fur, velvet, wool and leather would become predominant, and quilted detailing on windbreakers, sporty skirts and vests may sometimes be seen in winter. Typical winter look can be voluminous sweatshirt with satin boxer shorts, or a brocade bomber worn on top of a laid-back dress featuring mesh detailing. In contrast, sportswear in summer usually look more light-weighted and simple. The summer look can be a combination of easy crop tops, sleek dresses and gym-shorts.","input":"When did streetwear start as a fashion trend?"},{"output":"30 miles","context":"Alvin is a city in the U.S. state of Texas within the Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land metropolitan area and Brazoria County.

Located in Midtown Manhattan between 7th and 8th Avenues from 31st to 33rd Streets, it is situated atop Pennsylvania Station. It is the fourth venue to bear the name \\"Madison Square Garden\\", the first two (1879 and 1890) were located on Madison Square, on East 26th Street and Madison Avenue, with the third Madison Square Garden (1925) further uptown at Eighth Avenue and 50th Street. The Garden is used for professional basketball and ice hockey, as well as boxing, concerts, ice shows, circuses, professional wrestling and other forms of sports and entertainment. It is close to other midtown Manhattan landmarks, including the Empire State Building, Koreatown, and Macy's at Herald Square. It is home to the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL), the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and since 1997, the New York Liberty (WNBA).\\r\\nThe Garden opened on February 11, 1968, and is the oldest major sporting facility in the New York metropolitan area. It is the oldest arena in the National Hockey League and the second-oldest arena in the National Basketball Association. In 2016, MSG was the second-busiest music arena in the world in terms of ticket sales, behind The O2 Arena in London.[6] Including two major renovations, its total construction cost is approximately $1.1?billion, and it has been ranked as one of the 10 most expensive stadium venues ever built.[7] It is part of the Pennsylvania Plaza office and retail complex. Several other operating entities related to the Garden share its name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMadison Square is formed by the intersection of 5th Avenue and Broadway at 23rd Street in Manhattan. It was named after James Madison, fourth President of the United States.[8]\\r\\nTwo venues called Madison Square Garden were located just northeast of the square, the first from 1879 to 1890, and the second from 1890 to 1925. The first Garden, leased to P. T. Barnum,[9] had no roof and was inconvenient to use during inclement weather, so it was demolished after 11 years. Madison Square Garden II was designed by noted architect Stanford White. The new building was built by a syndicate which included J. P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, P. T. Barnum,[10] Darius Mills, James Stillman and W. W. Astor. White gave them a Beaux-Arts structure with a Moorish feel, including a minaret-like tower modeled after Giralda, the bell tower of the Cathedral of Seville[10] ÿ soaring 32 stories ÿ the city's second tallest building at the time ÿ dominating Madison Square Park. It was 200 feet (61?m) by 485 feet (148?m), and the main hall, which was the largest in the world, measured 200 feet (61?m) by 350 feet (110?m), with permanent seating for 8,000 people and floor space for thousands more. It had a 1,200-seat theatre, a concert hall with a capacity of 1,500, the largest restaurant in the city and a roof garden cabaret.[9] The building cost $3 million.[9] Madison Square Garden II was unsuccessful like the first Garden,[11] and the New York Life Insurance Company, which held the mortgage on it, decided to tear it down in 1925 to make way for a new headquarters building, which would become the landmark Cass Gilbert-designed New York Life Building.\\r\\nA third Madison Square Garden opened in a new location, on 8th Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, from 1925 to 1968. Groundbreaking on the third Madison Square Garden took place on January 9, 1925.[12] Designed by the noted theater architect Thomas W. Lamb, it was built at the cost of $4.75 million in 249 days by boxing promoter Tex Rickard;[9] the arena was dubbed \\"The House That Tex Built.\\"[13] The arena was 200 feet (61?m) by 375 feet (114?m), with seating on three levels, and a maximum capacity of 18,496 spectators for boxing.[9] Demolition commenced in 1968 after the opening of the current Garden.[14] It finished up in early 1969, and the site is now where One Worldwide Plaza is located.\\r\\nThe fourth and current Madison Square Garden opened on February 11, 1968, after Irving Mitchell Felt, who purchased the air rights from the Pennsylvania Railroad, tore down the above-ground portions of the original Pennsylvania Station.[15][16] The new structure was one of the first of its kind to be built above the platforms of an active railroad station. It was an engineering feat constructed by Robert E. McKee of El Paso, Texas. Public outcry over the demolition of the Pennsylvania Station structurean outstanding example of Beaux-Arts architectureled to the creation of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The Garden is located in the office and entertainment complex formally addressed as Pennsylvania Plaza and commonly known as Penn Plaza, named for the railroad station.\\r\\nIn 1972, Felt proposed moving the Knicks and Rangers to a then incomplete venue in the New Jersey Meadowlands, the Meadowlands Sports Complex. The Garden was also the home arena for the NY Raiders/NY Golden Blades of the World Hockey Association. The Meadowlands would eventually host its own NBA and NHL teams, the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils, respectively. The New York Giants and Jets of the National Football League (NFL) also relocated there. Felt's efforts fueled controversy between the Garden and New York City over real estate taxes. The disagreement again flared in 1980 when the Garden again challenged its tax bill. The arena, since the 1980s, has since enjoyed tax-free status, under the condition that all Knicks and Rangers home games must be hosted at MSG, lest it lose this exemption.[17]\\r\\nGarden owners spent $200?million in 1991 to renovate facilities and add 89 suites in place of hundreds of upper-tier seats. The project was designed by Ellerbe Becket. In 2004ÿ2005, Cablevision battled with the City of New York over the proposed West Side Stadium, which was cancelled. Cablevision then announced plans to raze the Garden, replace it with high-rise commercial buildings, and build a new Garden one block away at the site of the James Farley Post Office. Meanwhile, a new project to renovate and modernize the Garden completed phase one in time for the Rangers and Knicks' 2011ÿ12 seasons,[18] though the vice president of the Garden says he remains committed to the installation of an extension of Penn Station at the Farley Post Office site. While the Knicks and Rangers were not displaced, the New York Liberty played at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey during the renovation.\\r\\nMadison Square Garden is the last of the NBA and NHL arenas to not be named after a corporate sponsor.[19]\\r\\nIn 1984, the four streets immediately surrounding the Garden were designated as Joe Louis Plaza, in honor of boxer Joe Louis, who made eight successful title defenses in the previous Madison Square Garden.[20][21]\\r\\nMadison Square Garden's $1 billion second renovation took place mainly over three offseasons. It was set to begin after the 2009ÿ10 hockey/basketball seasons, but was delayed until after the 2010ÿ11 seasons. Renovation was done in phases with the majority of the work done in the summer months to minimize disruptions to the NHL and NBA seasons. While the Rangers and Knicks were not displaced,[22][23] the Liberty played their home games through the 2013 season at Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, during the renovation.[24][25]\\r\\nNew features include a larger entrance with interactive kiosks, retail, climate-controlled space, and broadcast studio; larger concourses; new lighting and LED video systems with HDTV; new seating; two new pedestrian walkways suspended from the ceiling to allow fans to look directly down onto the games being played below; more dining options; and improved dressing rooms, locker rooms, green rooms, upgraded roof, and production offices. The lower bowl concourse, called the Madison Concourse, remains on the 6th floor. The upper bowl concourse was relocated to the 8th floor and it is known as the Garden Concourse. The 7th floor houses the new Madison Suites and the Madison Club. The upper bowl was built on top of these suites. The rebuilt concourses are wider than their predecessors, and include large windows that offer views of the city streets around the Garden.[26]\\r\\nConstruction of the lower bowl (Phase 1) was completed for the 2011ÿ2012 NHL season and the 2011ÿ12 NBA lockout shortened season. An extended off-season for the Garden permitted some advanced work to begin on the new upper bowl, which was completed in time for the 2012ÿ2013 NBA season and the 2012ÿ13 NHL lockout-shortened NHL season. This advance work included the West Balcony on the 10th floor, taking the place of sky-boxes, and new end-ice 300 level seating. The construction of the upper bowl along with the Madison Suites and the Madison Club (Phase 2) were completed for the 2012ÿ2013 NHL and NBA seasons. The construction of the new lobby known as Chase Square, along with the Chase Bridges and the new scoreboard (Phase 3) were completed for the 2013ÿ2014 NHL and NBA seasons.\\r\\nMadison Square Garden is seen as an obstacle in the renovation and future expansion of Penn Station, which is already expanding through the James Farley Post Office, and some have proposed moving MSG to other sites in western Manhattan. On February 15, 2013, Manhattan Community Board 5 voted 36ÿ0 against granting a renewal to MSG's operating permit in perpetuity and proposed a 10-year limit instead in order to build a new Penn Station where the arena is currently standing. Manhattan borough president Scott Stringer said, \\"Moving the arena is an important first step to improving Penn Station.\\" The Madison Square Garden Company responded by saying that \\"[i]t is incongruous to think that M.S.G. would be considering moving.\\"[27]\\r\\nIn May 2013, four architecture firms?ÿ SHoP Architects, SOM, H3 Hardy Collaboration Architecture, and Diller Scofidio + Renfro?ÿ submitted proposals for a new Penn Station. SHoP Architects recommended moving Madison Square Garden to the Morgan Postal Facility a few blocks southwest, as well as removing 2 Penn Plaza and redeveloping other towers, and an extension of the High Line to Penn Station.[28] Meanwhile, SOM proposed moving Madison Square Garden to the area just south of the James Farley Post Office, and redeveloping the area above Penn Station as a mixed-use development with commercial, residential, and recreational space.[28] H3 Hardy Collaboration Architecture wanted to move the arena to a new pier west of Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, four blocks west of the current station/arena. Then, according to H3's plan, four skyscrapers at each of the four corners of the new Penn Station superblock, with a roof garden on top of the station; the Farley Post Office would become an education center.[28] Finally, Diller Scofidio + Renfro proposed a mixed-use development on the site, with spas, theaters, a cascading park, a pool, and restaurants; Madison Square Garden would be moved two blocks west, next to the post office. DS+F also proposed high-tech features in the station, such as train arrival and departure boards on the floor, and apps that would inform waiting passengers of ways to occupy their time until they board their trains.[28] Madison Square Garden rejected the notion that it would be relocated, and called the plans \\"pie-in-the-sky\\".[28]\\r\\nIn June 2013, the New York City Council Committee on Land Use voted unanimously to give the Garden a ten-year permit, at the end of which period the owners will either have to relocate, or go back through the permission process.[29] On July 24, the City Council voted to give the Garden a 10-year operating permit by a vote of 47 to 1. \\"This is the first step in finding a new home for Madison Square Garden and building a new Penn Station that is as great as New York and suitable for the 21st century\\", said City Council speaker Christine Quinn. \\"This is an opportunity to reimagine and redevelop Penn Station as a world-class transportation destination.\\"[30]\\r\\nIn October 2014, the Morgan facility was selected as the most ideal area for Madison Square Garden to be moved, following the 2014 MAS Summit in New York City. More plans for the station were discussed.[31][32] Then, in January 2016, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a redevelopment plan for Penn Station that would involve the removal of The Theater at Madison Square Garden, but would otherwise leave the arena intact.[33][34]\\r\\nMadison Square Garden hosts approximately 320 events a year. It is the home to the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League, the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association, and the New York Liberty of the Women's National Basketball Association. The New York Rangers, New York Knicks, New York Liberty, and the Madison Square Garden arena itself are all owned by the Madison Square Garden Company. The arena is also host to the Big East Men's Basketball Conference Tournament and the finals of the National Invitation Tournament. It also hosts selected home games for the St. John's men's Red Storm (college basketball), the annual pre- and postseason NIT tournaments, the Millrose Games track and field meet, and almost any other kind of indoor activity that draws large audiences, such as the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and the 2004 Republican National Convention. The Garden is the former home of the NBA Draft and the former New York City home of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus and Disney on Ice; all three events are now held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. It served the New York Cosmos for half of their home games during the 1983ÿ84 NASL Indoor season.[35]\\r\\nMany of boxing's biggest fights were held at Madison Square Garden, including the Roberto DurnÿKen Buchanan affair, and the first Muhammad Ali ÿ Joe Frazier bout. Before promoters such as Don King and Bob Arum moved boxing to Las Vegas, Nevada Madison Square Garden was considered the mecca of boxing. The original 18?' G 18?' (5.6 m G 5.6 m) ring, which was brought from the second and third generation of the Garden, was officially retired on September 19, 2007, and donated to the International Boxing Hall of Fame after 82 years of service. A 20' G 20' (6 m G 6 m) ring replaced it beginning on October 6 of that same year.\\r\\nMadison Square Garden hosts more high-profile concert events than any other venue in New York City. It has been the venue for George Harrison's The Concert for Bangladesh, The Concert for New York City following the September 11 attacks, John Lennon's final concert appearance (during an Elton John concert on Thanksgiving Night, 1974) before his murder in 1980, and Elvis Presley, who gave four sold out performances in 1972, his first and last ever in New York City. Parliament-Funkadelic headlined numerous sold out shows in 1977 and 1978. Led Zeppelin's 3 night stand in July 1973 was recorded and released as both a film and album titled The Song Remains The Same. The Police played their final show of their reunion tour at the Garden in 2008.\\r\\nAt one point, Elton John held the all-time record for greatest number of appearances at the Garden with 64 shows. In a 2009 press release, John was quoted as saying \\"Madison Square Garden is my favorite venue in the whole world. I chose to have my 60th birthday concert there, because of all the incredible memories I've had playing the venue.\\"[36] Billy Joel, who broke the record, stated \\"Madison Square Garden is the center of the universe as far as I'm concerned. It has the best acoustics, the best audiences, the best reputation, and the best history of great artists who have played there. It is the iconic, holy temple of rock and roll for most touring acts and, being a New Yorker, it holds a special significance to me.\\"[36]\\r\\nMadonna performed at this venue a total of 31 concerts, the first two being during her 1985 Virgin Tour, on June 10 and 11, and the most recent being the two-nights stay during her Rebel Heart Tour on September 16 and 17, 2015.\\r\\nU2 performed at the arena 25 times: the first one was on April 1, 1985 during their Unforgettable Fire Tour, in front of a crowd of 19,000 people. The second and the third were on September 28 and 29, 1987 during their Joshua Tree Tour, in front of 39,510 people. The fourth was on March 20, 1992 during their Zoo TV Tour, in front of a crowd of 18,179 people. The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth was on June 17 and 19 and October 24, 25 and 27, 2001 during their Elevation Tour, in front of 91,787 people. The 10th, the 11th, the 12th, the 13th, the 14th, the 15th, the 16th and the 17th were on May 21, October 7, 8, 10, 11 and 14 and November 21 and 22, 2005 during their Vertigo Tour, in front of a total sold out crowd of 149,004 people. The band performed their following eight performances at the arena on July 18, 19, 22, 23, 26, 27, 30 and 31, 2015 as part of their Innocence + Experience Tour.\\r\\nIn the summer of 2017, Phish performed 13 consecutive concerts at the venue, which the Garden commemorated by adding a Phish themed banner to the rafters.[37] The \\"Bakers' Dozen\\" brought the total number of Phish shows at MSG to 52.[38]\\r\\nIt has previously hosted the 1976 Democratic National Convention, 1980 Democratic National Convention, 1992 Democratic National Convention, and the 2004 Republican National Convention, and hosted the NFL Draft for many years (now held at Garden-leased Radio City Music Hall). From 1982 to 1990, the Church of God in Christ in New York under the leadership of Bishop F.D. Washington used Madison Square Garden for its Annual Holy Convocation.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe New York Police Academy, Baruch College/CUNY and Yeshiva University also hold their annual graduation ceremonies at Madison Square Garden. It hosted the Grammy Awards in 1972, 1997, 2003 and 2018 (which are normally held in Los Angeles) as well as the Latin Grammy Awards of 2006.\\r\\nThe group and Best in Show competitions of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show are held every February for two days at MSG.\\r\\nThe Garden hosted the Stanley Cup Finals and NBA Finals simultaneously on two occasions: in 1972 and 1994.\\r\\nMSG has hosted the following All-Star Games:\\r\\nIn 1985, the Garden hosted the inaugural WrestleMania presented by the World Wrestling Federation. In 1988 it hosted the WWF's inaugural SummerSlam PPV.\\r\\nSeating in Madison Square Garden was initially arranged in six ascending levels, each with its own color. The first level, which was available only for basketball games, boxing and concerts, and not for hockey games and ice shows, was known as the \\"Rotunda\\" (\\"ringside\\" for boxing and \\"courtside\\" for basketball), had beige seats, and bore section numbers of 29 and lower (the lowest number varying with the different venues, in some cases with the very lowest sections denoted by letters rather than numbers). Next above this was the \\"Orchestra\\" (red) seating, sections 31 through 97, followed by the 100-level \\"First Promenade\\" (orange) and 200-level \\"Second Promenade\\"(yellow), the 300-level (green) \\"First Balcony\\", and the 400-level (blue) \\"Second Balcony.\\" The rainbow-colored seats were replaced with fuchsia and teal seats[39] during the 1990s renovation (in part because the blue seats had acquired an unsavory reputation, especially during games in which the New York Rangers hosted their cross-town rivals, the New York Islanders) which installed the 10th floor sky-boxes around the entire arena and the 9th floor sky-boxes on the 7th avenue end of the arena, taking out 400-level seating on the 7th Avenue end in the process.\\r\\nBecause all of the seats, except the 400 level, were in one monolithic grandstand, horizontal distance from the arena floor was significant from the ends of the arena. Also, the rows rose much more gradually than other North American arenas, which caused impaired sight lines, especially when sitting behind tall spectators or one of the concourses. This arrangement, however, created an advantage over newer arenas in that seats had a significantly lower vertical distance from the arena floor.\\r\\nAs part of the 2011ÿ2013 renovation, the club sections, 100-level and 200-level have been combined to make a new 100-level lower bowl. The 300-level and 400-level were combined and raised 17 feet closer, forming a new 200-level upper bowl. All skyboxes but those on the 7th Avenue end were removed and replaced with balcony seating (8th Avenue) and Chase Bridge Seating (31st Street and 33rd Street). The sky-boxes on the 9th floor were remodeled and are now called the Signature Suites. The sky-boxes on the 7th Avenue end of the 10th Floor are now known as the Lounges. One small section of the 400-level remains near the west end of the arena, and features blue seats. The media booths have been relocated to the 31st Street Chase Bridge.\\r\\nThe Theater at Madison Square Garden seats between 2,000 and 5,600 for concerts and can also be used for meetings, stage shows, and graduation ceremonies. It was the home of the NFL Draft until 2005, when it moved to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center after MSG management opposed a new stadium for the New York Jets. It also hosted the NBA Draft from 2001 to 2010. The theater also occasionally hosts boxing matches on nights when the main arena is unavailable. The fall 1999 Jeopardy! Teen Tournament as well as a Celebrity Jeopardy! competition were held at the theater. Wheel of Fortune did tapings at the theater twice in 1999 and 2013. In 2004, it was the venue of the Survivor: All-Stars finale. No seat is more than 177 feet (54?m) from the 30' G 64' stage. The theatre has a relatively low 20-foot (6.1?m) ceiling at stage level[42] and all of its seating except for boxes on the two side walls is on one level slanted back from the stage. There is an 8,000-square-foot (740?m2) lobby at the theater.\\r\\nMadison Square Garden sits directly atop a major transportation hub in Pennsylvania Station, featuring access to commuter rail service from the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit, as well as Amtrak. The Garden is also accessible via the New York City Subway. The A, ?C and ?E trains stop at 8th Avenue and the 1, ?2, and ?3 trains at 7th Avenue in Penn Station. The Garden can also be reached from nearby Herald Square with the B, ?D, ?F, ?M?, N, ?Q, ?R, and ?W trains at the 34th Street ÿ Herald Square station as well as PATH train service from the 33rd Street station.","input":"How did madison square garden get its name?"},{"output":"Phineas Quimby","context":"In the New Thought philosophy, the Law of Attraction is the belief that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, people can bring positive or negative experiences into their life.[1][2] The belief is based on the idea that people and their thoughts are both made from \\"pure energy\\", and that through the process of \\"like energy attracting like energy\\" a person can improve their own health, wealth, and personal relationships.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Law of Attraction is among the most popular of the \\"Universal Laws\\".[3] Advocates of this mind-power paradigm generally combine cognitive reframing techniques with affirmations and creative visualization to replace limiting or self-destructive (\\"negative\\") thoughts with more empowered, adaptive (\\"positive\\") thoughts. A key component of the philosophy is that in order to effectively change one's negative thinking patterns, one must also \\"feel\\" (through creative visualization) that the desired changes have already occurred. This combination of positive thought and positive emotion is believed to allow one to \\"attract\\" positive experiences and opportunities by achieving resonance with the proposed energetic \\"Law\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Law of Attraction has no scientific basis[5] and has been dubbed a pseudoscience.[6] A number of researchers have criticized the misuse of scientific concepts by its proponents.[5][7][8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Thought movement (Law of Attraction Origins) grew out of the teachings of Phineas Quimby in the early 19th century. Early in his life, Quimby was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Unfortunately, medicinal treatment wasn't working, so he began carriage riding through his hometown, Lebanon, New Hampshire. He then regained his health and recovered, an event that prompted his study of \\"mind over body\\".[10]  Although he never used the words 'Law of Attraction', he explained this in a statement that captured the concept in the field of health: \\r\\nthe trouble is in the mind, for the body is only the house for the mind to dwell in, and we put a value on it according to its worth. Therefore if your mind has been deceived by some invisible enemy into a belief, you have put it into the form of a disease, with or without your knowledge. By my theory or truth, I come in contact with your enemy and restore you to your health and happiness. This I do partly mentally and partly by talking till I correct the wrong impressions and establish the Truth, and the Truth is the cure.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1877, the term 'Law of Attraction' appeared in print for the first time in a book written by the Russian occultist Helena Blavatsky, in a context alluding to an attractive power existing between elements of spirit.[12] (Her book Isis Unveiled discusses esoteric mysteries of ancient theosophy.[13][14])\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the one who really first articulated the Law as general principle was Prentice Mulford. Mulford, a pivotal figure in the development of New Thought thinking, discusses the Law of Attraction at length in, for example, his essay \\"The Law of Success\\",[15] published 1886-1887. In this, Mulford was followed by other New Thought authors, such as Henry Wood (starting with his Gods Image in Man,[16] 1892), and Ralph Waldo Trine (starting with his first book, What All the World's A-Seeking,[17] 1896). For these authors, the Law of Attraction is concerned not only about health but every aspect of life.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 20th century saw a surge in interest in the subject with many books being written about it, amongst which are two of the best-selling books of all time; Think and Grow Rich (1937) by Napoleon Hill and You Can Heal Your Life (1984) by Louise Hay.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if the New Age movement adopted many New Thought ideas, including that of the Law of Attraction, the Law of Attraction remains a new thought philosophical concept.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, the concept of the Law of Attraction gained a lot of renewed exposure with the release of the film The Secret (2006) which was then developed into a book of the same title in 2007. The movie and book gained widespread media coverage.[1][21][22] Rhonda Byrne's book also has influenced the creation of an untitled fiction film based on The Secret, starring Katie Holmes.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Thought authors believe that the Law of Attraction is always in operation and that it brings to each person the conditions and experiences that they predominantly think about, or which they desire or expect.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Haanel wrote in The Master Key System (1912):\\r\\n\\r\\nThe law of attraction will certainly and unerringly bring to you the conditions, environment, and experiences in life, corresponding with your habitual, characteristic, predominant mental attitude.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph Trine wrote in In Tune With The Infinite (1897):\\r\\n\\r\\nThe law of attraction works universally on every plane of action, and we attract whatever we desire or expect. If we desire one thing and expect another, we become like houses divided against themselves, which are quickly brought to desolation. Determine resolutely to expect only what you desire, then you will attract only what you wish for.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\n Rhonda Byrne published in 2006 the film The Secret wherein she emphasized thinking about what each person wants to obtain, but also to infuse the thought with the maximum possible amount of emotion. She claims the combination of thought and feeling is what attracts the desire.[26] The Secret says your subconscious mind can control everything that happens around you, including both positive experiences, like having someone call you from miles away, and negative experiences, like death. The Byrne underlines the power of the subconscious mind by asking the reader to take full control of these thoughts, in order to achieve things in life, with the mind, as much as with action. Another similar book is James Redfield's The Celestine Prophecy, which says reality can be manifested by man.[27] Man and the universe have a force of attraction between them similar to a magnetic attraction. The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy, says readers can achieve seemingly impossible goals by learning how to bring the mind itself under control. The Power by Rhonda Byrne, The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, and The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle are similar. While personal testimonies claim the secret and the law to have worked for them, a number of skeptics have criticized Rhonda Byrne's film and book. One New York Times book review calls the secret pseudoscience and an \\"illusion of knowledge\\".[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Thought concept of the Law of Attraction is rooted in ideas that come from various philosophical and religious traditions.  In particular, it has been inspired by Hermeticism, New England transcendentalism, specific verses from the Bible, and Hinduism, \\r\\n[29][30][31][32][33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nHermeticism influenced the development of European thought in the Renaissance. Its ideas were transmitted partly through alchemy. In the 18th century, Franz Mesmer studied the works of alchemists such as Paracelsus[35] and van Helmont.[36] Van Helmont was a 17th-century Flemish physician who proclaimed the curative powers of the imagination.[36][37][38] This lead Mesmer to develop his ideas about Animal magnetism which Phineas Quimby, the founder of New Thought, studied.[36][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Transcendentalist movement developed in the United States immediately before the emergence of New Thought and is thought to have had a great influence on it. George Ripley, an important figure in that movement, stated that its leading idea was \\"the supremacy of mind over matter\\".[36][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Thought authors often quote certain verses from the Bible in the context of the Law of Attraction. An example is Mark 11:24: \\"Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.\\"[41][42][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 19th century Swami Vivekananda traveled to the United States and gave lectures on Hinduism. These talks greatly influenced the New Thought movement and in particular, William Walker Atkinson who was one of New Thought's pioneers.[44][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nSkeptical Inquirer magazine criticized the lack of falsifiability and testability of these claims.[46] Critics have asserted that the evidence provided is usually anecdotal and that, because of the self-selecting nature of the positive reports, as well as the subjective nature of any results, these reports are susceptible to confirmation bias and selection bias.[47] Physicist Ali Alousi, for instance, criticized it as unmeasurable and questioned the likelihood that thoughts can affect anything outside the head.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Law of Attraction has been popularized in the early 21st century by books and films such as The Secret. This 2006 film and the subsequent book[48] use interviews with New Thought authors and speakers to explain the principles of the proposed metaphysical law that one can attract anything that one thinks about consistently. Writing for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, Mary Carmichael and Ben Radford wrote that \\"neither the film nor the book has any basis in scientific reality\\", and that its premise contains \\"an ugly flipside: if you have an accident or disease, it's your fault\\".[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers have questioned the references to modern scientific theory, and have maintained, for example, that the Law of Attraction misrepresents the electrical activity of brainwaves.[49] Victor Stenger and Leon Lederman are critical of attempts to use quantum mysticism to bridge any unexplained or seemingly implausible effects, believing these to be traits of modern pseudoscience.[50][8][9]","input":"Who is the founder of law of attraction?"},{"output":"33,636","context":"","input":"How many gun deaths in the united states each year?"},{"output":"devastating burdens on the U.S. economy and the American people","context":"The Embargo Act of 1807 was a general embargo enacted by the United States Congress against Great Britain and France during the Napoleonic Wars.\\r\\nThe embargo was imposed in response to violations of the United States neutrality, in which American merchantmen and their cargo were seized as contraband of war by the belligerent European navies. The British Royal Navy, in particular, resorted to impressment, forcing thousands of American seamen into service on their warships. Britain and France, engaged in the Napoleonic Wars, rationalized the plunder of U.S. shipping as incidental to war and necessary for their survival. Americans saw the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair as a particularly egregious example of a British violation of American neutrality. Perceived diplomatic insults and unwarranted official orders issued in support of these actions by European powers were argued by some to be grounds for a U.S. declaration of war.\\r\\nPresident Thomas Jefferson acted with restraint as these antagonisms mounted, weighing public support for retaliation. He recommended that Congress respond with commercial warfare, rather than with military mobilization. The Embargo Act was signed into law on December 22, 1807. The anticipated effect of this measure ÿ economic hardship for the belligerent nations ÿ was expected to chasten Great Britain and France, and force them to end their molestation of American shipping, respect U.S. neutrality, and cease the policy of impressment. The embargo turned out to be impractical as a coercive measure, and was a failure both diplomatically and economically. As implemented, the legislation inflicted devastating burdens on the U.S. economy and the American people.\\r\\nWidespread evasion of the maritime and inland trade restrictions by American merchants, as well as loopholes in the legislation, greatly reduced the impact of the embargo on the intended targets in Europe. British merchant marine appropriated the lucrative trade routes relinquished by U.S. shippers due to the embargo. Demand for English goods rose in South America, offsetting losses suffered as a result of Non-Importation Acts. The embargo undermined national unity in the U.S., provoking bitter protests, especially in New England commercial centers. The issue vastly increased support for the Federalist Party and led to huge gains in their representation in Congress and in the electoral college in 1808. The embargo had the effect of simultaneously undermining American citizens' faith that their government could execute its own laws fairly, and strengthening the conviction among America's enemies that her republican form of government was inept and ineffectual. At the end of 15 months, the embargo was revoked on March 1, 1809, in the last days of Jefferson's presidency. Tensions with Britain continued to grow, leading to the War of 1812.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the short truce in 1802ÿ1803 the European wars resumed and continued until the defeat of Napoleon in 1814.[1] The war caused American relations with both Britain and France to deteriorate rapidly. There was grave risk of war with one or the other. With Britain supreme on the sea, and France on the land, the war developed into a struggle of blockade and counterblockade. This commercial war peaked in 1806 and 1807. Britain's Royal Navy shut down most European harbors to American ships unless they first traded through British ports. France declared a paper blockade of Britain (which it lacked a navy to enforce) and seized American ships that obeyed British regulations. The Royal Navy needed large numbers of sailors, and saw the U.S. merchant fleet as a haven for British sailors.[2]\\r\\nThe British system of impressment humiliated and dishonored the U.S. because it was unable to protect its ships and their sailors.[3] This British practice of taking British deserters, and often Americans, from American ships and forcing them into the Royal Navy increased greatly after 1803, and caused bitter anger in the United States.\\r\\nOn June 21, 1807 the American warship USS Chesapeake was attacked and boarded on the high seas off the coast of Norfolk, VA[4] by the British warship HMS Leopard. Three Americans were dead and 18 wounded; the British impressed four seamen with American papers as alleged deserters. The outraged nation demanded action; President Jefferson ordered all British ships out of American waters.[5]\\r\\nPassed on December 22, 1807, the Act:[6]\\r\\nThis shipping embargo was a cumulative addition to the Non-importation Act of 1806 (2 Stat. 379), this earlier act being a \\"Prohibition of the Importation of certain Goods and Merchandise from the Kingdom of Great Britain\\"; the prohibited imported goods being defined where their chief value which consists of leather, silk, hemp or flax, tin or brass, wool, glass; in addition paper goods, nails, hats, clothing, and beer.[7]\\r\\nThe Embargo Act of 1807 is codified at 2 Stat. 451 and formally titled \\"An Embargo laid on Ships and Vessels in the Ports and Harbours of the United States\\". The bill was drafted at the request of President Thomas Jefferson and subsequently passed by the Tenth U.S. Congress, on December 22, 1807, during Session 1; Chapter 5. Congress initially acted to enforce a bill prohibiting imports, but supplements to the bill eventually banned exports as well.\\r\\nThe embargo, which lasted from December 1807 to March 1809 effectively throttled American overseas trade. All areas of the United States suffered. In commercial New England and the Middle Atlantic states, ships rotted at the wharves, and in the agricultural areas, particularly in the South, farmers and planters could not sell their crops on the international market. For New England, and especially for the Middle Atlantic states, there was some consolation, for the scarcity of European goods meant that a definite stimulus was given to the development of American industry.\\r\\nThe embargo was a financial disaster for the Americans because the British were still able to export goods to America: initial loopholes overlooked smuggling by coastal vessels from Canada, whaling ships and privateers from overseas; and widespread disregard of the law meant enforcement was difficult.[8]\\r\\nA case study of Rhode Island shows the embargo devastated shipping-related industries, wrecked existing markets, and caused an increase in opposition to the Democratic-Republican Party. Smuggling was widely endorsed by the public, who viewed the embargo as a violation of their rights. Public outcry continued, helping the Federalists regain control of the state government in 1808ÿ09. The case is a rare example of American national foreign policy altering local patterns of political allegiance. Despite its unpopular nature, the Embargo Act did have some limited, unintended benefits to the Northeastern region especially as it drove capital and labor into New England textile and other manufacturing industries, lessening America's reliance on the British.[9]\\r\\nIn Vermont, the embargo was doomed to failure on the Lake Champlain-Richelieu River water route because of Vermont's dependence on a Canadian outlet for produce. At St. John, Lower Canada, S140,000 worth of goods smuggled by water were recorded there in 1808 ÿ a 31% increase over 1807. Shipments of ashes (used to make soap) nearly doubled to S54,000, but lumber dropped 23% to S11,200. Manufactured goods, which had expanded to S50,000 since Jay's Treaty of 1795, fell over 20%, especially articles made near Tidewater. Newspapers and manuscripts recorded more lake activity than usual, despite the theoretical reduction in shipping that should accompany an embargo. The smuggling was not restricted to water routes, as herds were readily driven across the uncontrollable land border. Southbound commerce gained two-thirds overall, but furs dropped a third. Customs officials maintained a stance of vigorous enforcement throughout and Gallatin's Enforcement Act (1809) was a party issue. Many Vermonters preferred the embargo's exciting game of revenuers versus smugglers, bringing high profits, versus mundane, low-profit normal trade.[10]\\r\\nThe New England merchants who evaded the embargo were imaginative, daring, and versatile in their violation of federal law. Gordinier (2001) examines how the merchants of New London, Connecticut, organized and managed the cargoes purchased and sold, and the vessels used during the years before, during, and after the embargo. Trade routes and cargoes, both foreign and domestic, along with the vessel types, and the ways their ownership and management were organized show the merchants of southeastern Connecticut evinced versatility in the face of crisis.[11]\\r\\nGordinier (2001) concludes the versatile merchants sought alternative strategies for their commerce, and to a lesser extent, for their navigation. They tried extra-legal activities, a reduction in the size of the foreign fleet, and the re-documentation of foreign trading vessels into domestic carriage. Most importantly, they sought new domestic trading partners, and took advantage of the political power of Jedidiah Huntington, the Customs Collector. Huntington was an influential member of the Connecticut leadership class (called \\"the Standing Order\\"); he allowed scores of embargoed vessels to depart for foreign ports under the guise of \\"special permission.\\" Old modes of sharing vessel ownership in order to share the risk proved to be hard to modify. Instead established relationships continued through the embargo crisis, in spite of numerous bankruptcies.[12]\\r\\nJefferson's Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin was against the entire embargo, foreseeing correctly the impossibility of enforcing the policy and the negative public reaction. \\"As to the hope that it may...induce England to treat us better,\\" wrote Gallatin to Jefferson shortly after the bill had become law, \\"I think is entirely groundless...government prohibitions do always more mischief than had been calculated; and it is not without much hesitation that a statesman should hazard to regulate the concerns of individuals as if he could do it better than themselves.\\"[13]:368\\r\\nSince the bill hindered U.S. ships from leaving American ports bound for foreign trade; it had the side-effect of hindering American exploration.\\r\\nJust weeks later, on January 8, 1808, legislation again passed the Tenth U.S. Congress, Session 1; Chapter 8: \\"An Act supplementary...\\" to the Embargo Act (2 Stat. 453). As historian Forrest McDonald wrote, \\"A loophole had been discovered\\" in the initial enactment, \\"namely that coasting vessels, and fishing and whaling boats\\" had been exempt from the embargo, and they had been circumventing it, primarily via Canada. This supplementary act extended the bonding provision (i.e. Section 2 of the initial Embargo Act) to those of purely domestic trades:[14]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Jefferson requested authorization from Congress to raise 30,000 troops from the current standing army of 2,800. Congress refused. With their harbors for the most part unusable in the winter anyway, New England and the north ports of the mid-Atlantic states had paid little notice to the previous embargo acts. That was to change with the spring thaw, and the passing of yet another embargo act.[13]:147\\r\\nWith the coming of the spring, the effect of the previous acts were immediately felt throughout the coastal states, especially in New England. An economic downturn turned into a depression and caused increasing unemployment. Protests occurred up and down the eastern coast. Most merchants and shippers simply ignored the laws. On the CanadaÿUS border, especially in upstate New York and Vermont, the embargo laws were openly flouted. Federal officials believed parts of Maine, such as Passamaquoddy Bay on the border with British-held New Brunswick, were in open rebellion. By March, an increasingly frustrated Jefferson was resolved to enforce the embargo to the letter.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn March 12, 1808, Congress passed and Jefferson signed into law yet another supplement to the Embargo Act. This supplement[citation needed] prohibited, for the first time, all exports of any goods, whether by land or by sea. Violators were subject to a fine of US$10,000, plus forfeiture of goods, per offense. It granted the President broad discretionary authority to enforce, deny, or grant exceptions to the embargo.[13]:144 Port authorities were authorized to seize cargoes without a warrant and to try any shipper or merchant who was thought to have merely contemplated violating the embargo.\\r\\nDespite the added penalties, citizens and shippers openly ignored the embargo. Protests continued to grow; and so it was that the Jefferson administration requested and Congress rendered yet another embargo act.\\r\\nThe Embargo was hurting the United States as much as Britain or France. Britain, expecting to suffer most from the American regulations, built up a new South American market for its exports, and the British shipowners were pleased that American competition had been removed by the action of the U.S. government.\\r\\nJefferson placed himself in a strange position with his Embargo policy. Though he had so frequently and eloquently argued for as little government intervention as possible, he now found himself assuming extraordinary powers in an attempt to enforce his policy. The presidential election of 1808, in which James Madison defeated Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, showed that the Federalists were regaining strength, and helped to convince Jefferson and Madison that the Embargo would have to be removed.[15]\\r\\nShortly before leaving office, in March 1809, Jefferson signed the repeal of the failed Embargo. Despite its unpopular nature, the Embargo Act did have some limited, unintended benefits, especially as entrepreneurs and workers responded by bringing in fresh capital and labor into New England textile and other manufacturing industries, lessening America's reliance on the British merchants.[16][17]\\r\\nOn March 1, 1809, Congress passed the Non-Intercourse Act, a law that enabled the President, once the wars of Europe ended, to declare the country sufficiently safe and to allow foreign trade with certain nations.[18]\\r\\nIn 1810 the government was ready to try yet another tactic of economic coercion, in the desperate measure known as Macon's Bill Number 2.[19] This bill became law on May 1, 1810, and replaced the Non-Intercourse Act. It was an acknowledgment of the failure of economic pressure to coerce the European powers. Trade with both Britain and France was now thrown open, and the United States attempted to bargain with the two belligerents. If either power would remove her restrictions on American commerce, the United States would reapply non-intercourse against the power that had not so acted. Napoleon quickly took advantage of this opportunity. He promised that his Berlin and Milan Decrees would be repealed, and Madison reinstated non-intercourse against Britain in the fall of 1810. Though Napoleon did not fulfill his promise, strained Anglo-American relations prevented his being brought to task for his duplicity.[20]\\r\\nThe attempt of Jefferson and Madison to resist aggression by peaceful means gained a belated success in June 1812 when Britain finally promised to repeal her Orders in Council. The British concession was too late, for by the time the news reached America the United States had already declared the War of 1812 against Britain.\\r\\nThe entire series of events was ridiculed in the press as Dambargo, Mob-Rage, Go-bar-'em or O-grab-me (\\"Embargo\\" spelled backward); there was a cartoon ridiculing the Act as a snapping turtle, named \\"O' grab me\\", grabbing at American shipping.\\r\\nAmerica's declaration of war, in mid-June 1812, was followed shortly by the Enemy Trade Act of 1812 on July 6, which employed similar restrictions as previous legislation; it was likewise ineffective and tightened in December 1813, and debated for further tightening in December 1814. After existing embargoes expired with the onset of war, the Embargo Act of 1813 was signed into law December 17, 1813. Four new restrictions were included: An embargo prohibiting all American ships and goods from leaving port; a complete ban on certain commodities customarily produced in the British Empire; a ban against foreign ships trading in American ports unless 75% of the crew were citizens of the ship's flag; and a ban on ransoming ships. The Embargo of 1813 was the nation's last great trade restriction. Never again would the US government cut off all its trade to achieve a foreign policy objective.[21] The act particularly hurt the northeastern states, since the British kept a tighter blockade on the south, and thus encouraged American opposition to the administration. To make his point, the act was not lifted by Madison until after the defeat of Napoleon, and the point was moot. On February 15, 1815, Madison signed the Enemy Trade Act of 1815; it was tighter than any previous trade restriction including the Enforcement Act of 1809 (January 9) and the Embargo of 1813, but it would expire two weeks later when official word of peace from Ghent was received.[22]","input":"What was the result of the embargo act?"},{"output":"murder","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boston Massacre, known as the Incident on King Street by the British,[2] was a confrontation on March 5, 1770, in which British Army soldiers shot and killed five people while under harassment by locals. The incident was heavily publicized by leading Patriots, such as Paul Revere and Samuel Adams, to encourage rebellion against the British authorities.[3][4][5] British troops had been stationed in Boston, capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, since 1768 in order to protect and support crown-appointed colonial officials attempting to enforce unpopular Parliamentary legislation. \\r\\n\\r\\nAmid ongoing tense relations between the population and the soldiers, a mob formed around a British sentry, who was subjected to verbal abuse and harassment. He was eventually supported by eight additional soldiers, who were subjected to verbal threats and repeatedly hit by clubs, stones and snowballs. They fired into the crowd, without orders, instantly killing three people and wounding others. Two more people died later of wounds sustained in the incident.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd eventually dispersed after Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson promised an inquiry, but the crowd re-formed the next day, prompting the withdrawal of the troops to Castle Island. Eight soldiers, one officer, and four civilians were arrested and charged with murder. Defended by lawyer and future American president John Adams, six of the soldiers were acquitted, while the other two were convicted of manslaughter and given reduced sentences. The men found guilty of manslaughter were sentenced to branding on their hand. \\r\\n\\r\\nDepictions, reports, and propaganda about the event, notably the colored engraving produced by Paul Revere (shown at top-right), further heightened tensions throughout the Thirteen Colonies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoston, the capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and an important shipping town, was a major center of resistance to unpopular acts of taxation by the British Parliament in the 1760s.[6] In 1768, the Townshend Acts were placed upon the colonists, by which a variety of common items that were manufactured in Britain and exported to the colonies were subjected to import tariffs. Colonists objected that the Townshend Acts were a violation of the natural, charter, and constitutional rights of British subjects in the colonies.[6] The Massachusetts House of Representatives began a campaign against the Townshend Acts by sending a petition to King George III asking for the repeal of the Townshend Revenue Act. The House also sent what became known as the Massachusetts Circular Letter to other colonial assemblies, asking them to join the resistance movement,[6] and called for a boycott of merchants importing the affected goods.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Great Britain, Lord Hillsborough, who had recently been appointed to the newly created office of Colonial Secretary, was alarmed by the actions of the Massachusetts House. In April 1768 he sent a letter to the colonial governors in America, instructing them to dissolve the colonial assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also ordered Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to direct the Massachusetts House to rescind the letter. The house refused to comply.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoston's chief customs officer, Charles Paxton, wrote to Hillsborough, asking for military support because \\"the Government is as much in the hands of the people as it was in the time of the Stamp Act.\\"[9] Commodore Samuel Hood responded by sending the fifty-gun warship HMS?Romney, which arrived in Boston Harbor in May 1768.[10] On June 10, 1768, customs officials seized Liberty, a sloop owned by leading Boston merchant John Hancock, on allegations that the ship had been involved in smuggling. Bostonians, already angry because the captain of Romney had been impressing local sailors, began to riot.[11] Customs officials fled to Castle William for protection.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nExcerpt from A Short Narrative, suggesting the soldiers were contemplating violence against the colonists[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the unstable state of affairs in Massachusetts, Hillsborough instructed General Thomas Gage, Commander-in-Chief, North America, to send \\"such Force as You shall think necessary to Boston\\".[14] On October 1, 1768, the first of four British Army regiments began disembarking in Boston.[15] Two regiments were removed from Boston in 1769, but the 14th and the 29th Regiments of Foot remained.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Journal of Occurrences, an anonymously written series of newspaper articles, chronicled clashes between civilians and soldiers while troops were stationed in Boston, feeding tensions with its sometimes exaggerated accounts of the events. Tensions rose markedly after Christopher Seider, \\"a young lad about eleven Years of Age\\", was killed by a customs employee on February 22, 1770.[16] Seider's death was glorified in the Boston Gazette, and his funeral was described as one of the largest of the time in Boston. The killing and subsequent propaganda inflamed tensions, with gangs of colonists looking for soldiers to harass, and soldiers also on occasion looking for confrontation.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the evening of March 5, Private Hugh White, a British soldier, stood on guard duty outside the Custom house on King Street, today known as State Street. A young wigmaker's apprentice named Edward Garrick called out to a British officer, Captain-Lieutenant John Goldfinch, that Goldfinch had not paid a bill due to Garrick's master. Goldfinch had in fact settled his account and ignored the insult.[19] Private White called out to Garrick that he should be more respectful of the officer. Garrick exchanged insults with Private White. Then, after Garrick started poking the officer in the chest with his finger, the officer left his post, challenged the boy, and struck him on the side of the head with his musket. As Garrick cried in pain, one of his companions, Bartholomew Broaders, began to argue with White. This attracted a larger crowd.[20] Henry Knox, a 19-year-old bookseller (who would later serve as a general in the revolution), came upon the scene and warned White, \\"if he fired he must die for it.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the evening progressed, the crowd around Private White grew larger and more boisterous. Church bells were rung, which usually signified a fire, bringing more people out. Over fifty Bostonians pressed around White, led by a mixed-race former slave named Crispus Attucks, throwing objects at the sentry and challenging him to fire his weapon. White, who had taken up a somewhat safer position on the steps of the Custom House, sought assistance. Runners alerted the nearby barracks and Captain Thomas Preston, the officer of the watch.[21][22] According to his report, Preston dispatched a non-commissioned officer and six privates of the 29th Regiment of Foot, with fixed bayonets, to relieve White.[23][24] The soldiers Preston sent were Corporal William Wemms, Hugh Montgomery, John Carroll, William McCauley, William Warren, and Matthew Kilroy. Accompanied by Preston, they pushed their way through the crowd. En route, Henry Knox, again trying to reduce tensions, warned Preston, \\"For God's sake, take care of your men. If they fire, you must die.\\"[clarification needed] Captain Preston responded \\"I am aware of it.\\"[25] When they reached Private White on the custom house stairs, the soldiers loaded their muskets, and arrayed themselves in a semicircular formation. Preston shouted at the crowd, estimated to number between three and four hundred, to disperse.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd continued to press around the soldiers, taunting them by yelling, \\"Fire!\\", by spitting at and throwing snowballs and other small objects at them.[27] Richard Palmes, a local innkeeper who was carrying a cudgel, came up to Preston and asked if the soldiers' weapons were loaded. Preston assured him they were, but that they would not fire unless he ordered it, and (according to his own deposition) that he was unlikely to do so, since he was standing in front of them. A thrown object then struck Private Montgomery, knocking him down and causing him to drop his musket. He recovered his weapon, and was thought to angrily shout \\"Damn you, fire!\\", then discharged it into the crowd although no command was given. Palmes swung his cudgel first at Montgomery, hitting his arm, and then at Preston. He narrowly missed Preston's head, striking him on the arm instead.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a pause of uncertain length (eyewitness estimates ranged from several seconds to two minutes), after which the soldiers fired into the crowd. Rather than a disciplined volley (Preston gave no orders to fire), a ragged series of shots was fired, which hit eleven men.[28] Three Americansropemaker Samuel Gray, mariner James Caldwell, and Attucksdied instantly.[29] Samuel Maverick, an apprentice ivory turner of seventeen,[30] was struck by a ricocheting musket ball at the back of the crowd, and died a few hours later, in the early morning of the next day. An Irish immigrant, Patrick Carr, died two weeks later.[29] Christopher Monk, another apprentice, was one of those seriously wounded in the attack.[31] Although he recovered to some extent, he was crippled and eventually died in 1780, purportedly due to the injuries he had sustained in the attack a decade earlier.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd moved away from the immediate area of the custom house, but continued to grow in nearby streets.[34] Captain Preston immediately called out most of the 29th Regiment, which adopted defensive positions in front of the state house.[35] Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson was summoned to the scene, and was forced by the movement of the crowd into the council chamber of the state house. From its balcony he was able to minimally restore order, promising there would be a fair inquiry into the shootings if the crowd dispersed.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nHutchinson immediately began investigating the affair, and by morning, Preston and the eight soldiers had been arrested.[37] In a meeting of the governor's council held late the morning after the shootings, Boston's selectmen asked Hutchinson to order the removal of troops from the city to Castle William on Castle Island,[36] while a town meeting at Faneuil Hall met to discuss the affair. The governor's council was at first opposed to ordering the troop withdrawal, with Hutchinson correctly claiming he did not have the authority to order the troops to move. Lieutenant Colonel William Dalrymple, commander of the troops, did not offer to move them.[38] The town meeting, however, became more restive when it learned of this. Under an imminent threat of further violence, the council changed its position, and unanimously (\\"under duress\\", according to Hutchinson's report) agreed to request the troops' removal.[39] Secretary of State Andrew Oliver reported that, had the troops not been removed, \\"that they would probably be destroyed by the people  should it be called rebellion, should it incur the loss of our charter, or be the consequence what it would.\\"[40] This decision left the governor without effective means to police the town.[40] The 14th was transferred to Castle Island without incident about a week later, with the 29th following shortly after.[41] The first four victims were buried amid great ceremony on March 8; Patrick Carr, the fifth and final victim, died on March 14 and was buried with them on March 17 in the Granary Burying Ground, one of Boston's oldest burial grounds..[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nExcerpt from A Fair Account, suggesting the colonists planned the attack on the soldiers[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 27 the eight soldiers, Captain Preston, and four civilians who were in the Customs House and were alleged to have fired shots, were all indicted for murder.[44] Bostonians continued to be hostile to the troops and their dependents. General Gage, convinced the troops were doing more harm than good, ordered the 29th Regiment out of the province in May.[45] Governor Hutchinson took advantage of the ongoing high tensions to orchestrate delays of the trials until later in the year.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the days and weeks following the incident, a propaganda battle was waged between Boston's radicals and supporters of the government. Both sides published pamphlets that told strikingly different stories, which were principally published in London in a bid to influence opinion there. The Boston Gazette's version of events, for example, characterized the massacre as part of an ongoing scheme to \\"quell a Spirit of Liberty\\", and harped on the negative consequences of quartering troops in the city.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nA young Boston artist, Henry Pelham, half-brother of the celebrated portrait painter John Singleton Copley, depicted the event. Silversmith and engraver Paul Revere closely copied Pelham's image, and is often credited as its originator. In order to further public outrage, the engraving contained several inflammatory details. Captain Preston is shown ordering his men to fire, and a musket is seen shooting out of the window of the customs office, which is labeled \\"Butcher's Hall.\\"[48] Artist Christian Remick hand-colored some prints.[1] Some copies of the print show a man with two chest wounds and a somewhat darker face, matching descriptions of Attucks; others show no victim as a person of color. The image was published in the Boston Gazette, circulating widely, and became an effective piece of anti-British propaganda. The image of bright red \\"lobster backs\\" and wounded men with red blood was hung in farmhouses across New England.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnonymous pamphlets were published describing the event from significantly different perspectives. A Short Narrative of the Horrid Massacre, published under the auspices of the Boston town meeting, was principally written by James Bowdoin, a member of the governor's council and a vocal opponent of British colonial policy, along with Samuel Pemberton, and Joseph Warren.[50] It described the shooting and other lesser incidents that took place in the days before as unprovoked attacks on peaceful, law-abiding inhabitants, and was, according to historian Neal Langley York, probably the most influential description of the event.[51] The account it provided was drawn from more than 90 depositions taken after the event, and it included accusations that the soldiers sent by Captain Preston had been deployed with the intention of causing harm.[52] In the interest of minimizing impact on the jury pool, city leaders held back local distribution of the pamphlet, but sent copies to other colonies and to London, where they knew depositions collected by Governor Hutchinson were en route.[53] A second pamphlet, Additional Observations on the Short Narrative, furthered the attack on crown officials by complaining that customs officials (one of whom had left Boston to carry Hutchinson's gathered depositions to London) were abandoning their posts under the pretense that it was too dangerous for them to do their duties.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe depositions that Hutchinson collected and sent to London were eventually published in a pamphlet entitled A Fair Account of the Late Unhappy Disturbance in Boston.[55] Drawn mainly from depositions by soldiers, its account of affairs sought to blame selfish Bostonians for denying the validity of Parliamentary laws. It also blamed the city's hoodlums and gangs for the lawlessness preceding the event, and claimed that they set up an ambush of the soldiers.[56] However, as it was not published until well after the first pamphlet had arrived in London, it ended up having a much smaller impact on the public debate there.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Part I took in Defence of Cptn.

As the Evidence was, the Verdict of the Jury was exactly right.\\r\\nThis however is no Reason why the Town should not call the Action of that Night a Massacre, nor is it any Argument in favour of the Governor or Minister, who caused them to be sent here. But it is the strongest Proofs of the Danger of Standing Armies.\\r\\nThe government was determined to give the soldiers a fair trial so there could be no grounds for retaliation from the British and so moderates would not be alienated from the Patriot cause. After several lawyers with Loyalist leanings refused to defend him, Preston sent a request to John Adams, pleading for him to work on the case. Adams, who was already a leading Patriot and who was contemplating a run for public office, agreed to help, in the interest of ensuring a fair trial.[58] Adams was joined by Josiah Quincy II after the latter was assured that the Sons of Liberty would not oppose his appointment, and by Robert Auchmuty, a Loyalist.[59] They were assisted by Sampson Salter Blowers, whose chief duty was to investigate the jury pool, and Paul Revere, who drew a detailed map of the bodies to be used in the trial of the British soldiers held responsible.[60][61] Massachusetts Solicitor General Samuel Quincy and private attorney Robert Treat Paine, hired by the town of Boston, handled the prosecution.[62] Preston was tried separately in late October 1770. He was acquitted after the jury was convinced that he had not ordered the troops to fire.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trial of the eight soldiers opened on November 27, 1770.[64] Adams told the jury to look beyond the fact the soldiers were British. He argued that if the soldiers were endangered by the mob, which he called \\"a motley rabble of saucy boys, negroes, and molattoes, Irish teagues and outlandish jack tarrs [i.e. sailors]\\",[65] they had the legal right to fight back, and so were innocent. If they were provoked but not endangered, he argued, they were at most guilty of manslaughter.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jury agreed with Adams and acquitted six of the soldiers after two and one-half hours' deliberation. Two of the soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter because there was overwhelming evidence that they had fired directly into the crowd. The jury's decisions suggest that they believed the soldiers had felt threatened by the crowd, but should have delayed firing.[67] The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences by pleading benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of the thumb in open court.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nCarr's deathbed account of the event is regarded as the most important piece of evidence exonerating the eight defendants of murder charges. Carr testified that the soldiers were provoked by the crowd and that the soldiers were much more restrained against the colonists compared to their usual tactics against the people of his native country of Ireland. He claimed that the Boston mob began to throw dangerous projectiles, and that the soldiers fired their muskets in self-defense. The testimony of Samuel Hemmingway is reprinted below:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Justices Edmund Trowbridge and Peter Oliver instructed the jury, Oliver specifically addressed Carr's testimony, stating: \\"this Carr was not upon oath, it is true, but you will determine whether a man just stepping into eternity is not to be believed, especially in favor of a set of men by whom he had lost his life\\". Carr's testimony is one of the earliest recorded uses of the dying declaration exception to the inadmissibility of hearsay evidence in United States legal code.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nCarr's deathbed testimony was used by defense attorney, and future U.S. President, John Adams to exonerate six of the eight defendants on all charges. The other two defendants had their conviction charges reduced from murder to manslaughter, avoiding capital punishment. Adams was further able to circumvent mandated imprisonment for manslaughter through benefit of clergy laws. The two soldiers were subsequently branded on their right thumbs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Carr's evidence was determined admissible by the court, Samuel Adams was purported to be outraged. Adams proclaimed that Carr's testimony could not be trusted, since Carr had been Roman Catholic.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four civilians were tried on December 13.[71] The principal prosecution witness, a servant of one of the accused, made claims that were easily rebutted by defense witnesses. In the face of this weak testimony, as well as waning public interest, the prosecution allegedly failed to press its case very hard. The civilians were all acquitted, and the servant was eventually convicted of perjury, whipped, and banished from the province.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boston Massacre is considered one of the most important events that turned colonial sentiment against King George III and British Parliamentary authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoward Zinn argues that Boston was full of class anger. He reports that in 1763, the Boston Gazette published that \\"a few persons in power\\" were promoting political projects \\"for keeping the people poor in order to make them humble.\\"[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Adams wrote that the \\"foundation of American independence was laid\\" on March 5, 1770, and Samuel Adams and other Patriots used annual commemorations (Massacre Day) of the event to fulminate against British rule.[74] Christopher Monk, the boy who was wounded in the attack and died in 1780, was paraded before the crowds as a reminder of British hostility.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater events, such as the Boston Tea Party, further illustrated the crumbling relationship between Britain and its colonies. Although five years passed between the massacre and outright revolution, and direct connections between the massacre and the later war are (according to historian Neil Langley York) somewhat tenuous,[75][clarification needed] it is widely perceived as a significant event leading to the violent rebellion that followed.[76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe massacre was remembered in 1858 in a celebration organized by William Cooper Nell, an African American abolitionist who saw the death of Crispus Attucks as an opportunity to demonstrate the role of African Americans in the Revolutionary War.[78] Partly because of this activism, artwork commemorating the massacre was produced that changed the color of a victim's skin to black (which in Revere's original engraving was white) to emphasize Attucks' claimed martyrdom.[79] In 1888, a monument was erected on the Boston Common to the men killed in the massacre, and the five victims, along with Christopher Seider, were reinterred in a prominent grave in the Granary Burying Ground.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe massacre is reenacted annually on March 5[81] under the auspices of the Bostonian Society.[82][83] The Old State House, the massacre site, and the Granary Burying Ground are all part of Boston's Freedom Trail, connecting sites important in the city's revolutionary-era history.[80]","input":"What were the soldiers in the boston massacre charged with?"},{"output":"August 2, 1956","context":"Albert Henry Woolson (February 11, 1850 ÿ August 2, 1956) was the last surviving member of the Union Army who served in the American Civil War.

Carrots are a domesticated form of the wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and southwestern Asia. The plant probably originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the greens are sometimes eaten as well. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.\\r\\nThe carrot is a biennial plant in the umbellifer family Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars are harvested four months later (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are a good source of vitamin K and vitamin B6, but the belief that eating carrots improves night vision is a myth put forward by the British in World War II to mislead the enemy about their military capabilities.\\r\\nThe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that world production of carrots and turnips (these plants are combined by the FAO) for the calendar year 2013 was 37.2 million tonnes; almost half (~45%) were grown in China. Carrots are widely used in many cuisines, especially in the preparation of salads, and carrot salads are a tradition in many regional cuisines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word is first recorded in English circa 1530 and was borrowed from Middle French carotte,[1] itself from Late Latin carta, from Greek ϫ߶?or karton, originally from the Indo-European root *ker- (horn), due to its horn-like shape. In Old English, carrots (typically white at the time) were not clearly distinguished from parsnips: the two were collectively called moru or more (from Proto-Indo-European *mork- \\"edible root\\", cf. German M?hre).\\r\\nVarious languages still use the same word for \\"carrot\\" as they do for \\"root\\"; e.g. Dutch wortel.[2]\\r\\nBoth written history and molecular genetic studies indicate that the domestic carrot has a single origin in Central Asia.[3] Its wild ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of which are now Iran and Afghanistan), which remains the centre of diversity for the wild carrot Daucus carota. A naturally occurring subspecies of the wild carrot was presumably bred selectively over the centuries to reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced the familiar garden vegetable.[4][5]\\r\\nWhen they were first cultivated, carrots were grown for their aromatic leaves and seeds rather than their roots. Carrot seeds have been found in Switzerland and Southern Germany dating back to 2000ÿ3000 BC.[7] Some close relatives of the carrot are still grown for their leaves and seeds, such as parsley, cilantro, coriander, fennel, anise, dill and cumin. The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century[8]; the Romans ate a root vegetable called pastinaca,[9] which may have been either the carrot or the closely related parsnip.[10][11]\\r\\nThe plant is depicted and described in the Eastern Roman Juliana Anicia Codex, a 6th-century AD Constantinopolitan copy of the Greek physician Dioscorides' 1st-century pharmacopoeia of herbs and medicines, De Materia Medica. Three different types of carrots are depicted, and the text states that \\"the root can be cooked and eaten\\".[12]\\r\\nThe plant was introduced into Spain by the Moors in the 8th century.[13] In the 10th century, roots from West Asia, India and Europe were purple.[14] The modern carrot originated in Afghanistan at about this time.[8] The 11th-century Jewish scholar Simeon Seth describes both red and yellow carrots,[15] as does the 12th-century Arab-Andalusian agriculturist, Ibn al-'Awwam.[16] Cultivated carrots appeared in China in the 14th century, and in Japan in the 18th century.[8]\\r\\nOrange-coloured carrots appeared in the Netherlands in the 17th century,[17] which has been related to the fact that the Dutch flag at the time included orange.[14] These modern carrots were described by the English antiquary John Aubrey (1626ÿ1697): \\"Carrots were first sown at Beckington in Somersetshire. Some very old Man there [in 1668] did remember their first bringing hither.\\"[18] European settlers introduced the carrot to colonial America in the 17th century.[19]\\r\\nOutwardly purple carrots, still orange on the inside, were sold in British stores beginning in 2002.[14]\\r\\nDaucus carota is a biennial plant. In the first year, its rosette of leaves produces large amounts of sugars, which are stored in the taproot to provide energy for the plant to flower in the second year.\\r\\nSoon after germination, carrot seedlings show a distinct demarcation between taproot and stem: the stem is thicker and lacks lateral roots. At the upper end of the stem is the seed leaf. The first true leaf appears about 10ÿ15 days after germination. Subsequent leaves are alternate (with a single leaf attached to a node), spirally arranged, and pinnately compound, with leaf bases sheathing the stem. As the plant grows, the bases of the seed leaves, near the taproot, are pushed apart. The stem, located just above the ground, is compressed and the internodes are not distinct. When the seed stalk elongates for flowering, the tip of the stem narrows and becomes pointed, and the stem extends upward to become a highly branched inflorescence up to 60ÿ200?cm (20ÿ80?in) tall.[20]\\r\\nMost of the taproot consists of a pulpy outer cortex (phloem) and an inner core (xylem). High-quality carrots have a large proportion of cortex compared to core. Although a completely xylem-free carrot is not possible, some cultivars have small and deeply pigmented cores; the taproot can appear to lack a core when the colour of the cortex and core are similar in intensity. Taproots are typically long and conical, although cylindrical and nearly-spherical cultivars are available. The root diameter can range from 1?cm (0.4?in) to as much as 10?cm (4?in) at the widest part. The root length ranges from 5 to 50?cm (2 to 20?in), although most are between 10 and 25?cm (4 and 10?in).[20]\\r\\nFlower development begins when the flat meristem changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical meristem capable of producing stem elongation and a cluster of flowers. The cluster is a compound umbel, and each umbel contains several smaller umbels (umbellets). The first (primary) umbel occurs at the end of the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels. A large, primary umbel can contain up to 50 umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent umbels have fewer flowers. Individual flowers are small and white, sometimes with a light green or yellow tint. They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx. The stamens usually split and fall off before the stigma becomes receptive to receive pollen. The stamens of the brown, male, sterile flowers degenerate and shrivel before the flower fully opens. In the other type of male sterile flower, the stamens are replaced by petals, and these petals do not fall off. A nectar-containing disc is present on the upper surface of the carpels.[20]\\r\\nFlowers change sex in their development, so the stamens release their pollen before the stigma of the same flower is receptive. The arrangement is centripetal, meaning the oldest flowers are near the edge and the youngest flowers are in the center. Flowers usually first open at the outer edge of the primary umbel, followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels. The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30ÿ50 days. The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects. After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.[20]\\r\\nThe fruit that develops is a schizocarp consisting of two mericarps; each mericarp is a true seed. The paired mericarps are easily separated when they are dry. Premature separation (shattering) before harvest is undesirable because it can result in seed loss. Mature seeds are flattened on the commissural side that faced the septum of the ovary. The flattened side has five longitudinal ribs. The bristly hairs that protrude from some ribs are usually removed by abrasion during milling and cleaning. Seeds also contain oil ducts and canals. Seeds vary somewhat in size, ranging from less than 500 to more than 1000 seeds per gram.[20]\\r\\nThe carrot is a diploid species, and has nine relatively short, uniform-length chromosomes (2n=18).[3] The genome size is estimated to be 473 mega base pairs, which is four times larger than Arabidopsis thaliana, one-fifth the size of the maize genome, and about the same size as the rice genome.[21]\\r\\nPolyacetylenes can be found in Apiaceae vegetables like carrots where they show cytotoxic activities.[22][23] Falcarinol and falcarindiol (cis-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diyne-3,8-diol)[24] are such compounds. This latter compound shows antifungal activity towards Mycocentrospora acerina and Cladosporium cladosporioides.[24] Falcarindiol is the main compound responsible for bitterness in carrots.[25]\\r\\nOther compounds such as pyrrolidine (present in the leaves),[26] 6-hydroxymellein,[27] 6-methoxymellein, eugenin, 2,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde (gazarin) or (Z)-3-acetoxy-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diin-8-ol (falcarindiol 3-acetate) can also be found in carrot.\\r\\nCarrots are grown from seed and can take up to four months (120 days) to mature, but most cultivars mature within 70 to 80 days under the right conditions.[28] They grow best in full sun but tolerate some shade.[29] The optimum temperature is 16 to 21?C (61 to 70?F).[30] The ideal soil is deep, loose and well-drained, sandy or loamy, with a pH of 6.3 to 6.8.[31] Fertilizer should be applied according to soil type because the crop requires low levels of nitrogen, moderate phosphate and high potash. Rich or rocky soils should be avoided, as these will cause the roots to become hairy and/or misshapen.[32] Irrigation is applied when needed to keep the soil moist. After sprouting, the crop is eventually thinned to a spacing of 8 to 10?cm (3 to 4?in) and weeded to prevent competition beneath the soil.[28][33]\\r\\nThere are several diseases that can reduce the yield and market value of carrots. The most devastating carrot disease is Alternaria leaf blight, which has been known to eradicate entire crops. A bacterial leaf blight caused by Xanthomonas campestris can also be destructive in warm, humid areas. Root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne species) can cause stubby or forked roots, or galls.[34] Cavity spot, caused by the oomycetes Pythium violae and Pythium sulcatum, results in irregularly shaped, depressed lesions on the taproots.[35]\\r\\nPhysical damage can also reduce the value of carrot crops. The two main forms of damage are splitting, whereby a longitudinal crack develops during growth that can be a few centimetres to the entire length of the root, and breaking, which occurs postharvest. These disorders can affect over 30% of commercial crops. Factors associated with high levels of splitting include wide plant spacing, early sowing, lengthy growth durations, and genotype.[36]\\r\\nCarrots benefit from strongly scented companion plants. The pungent odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root fly,[31] and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, as well as the herbs rosemary and sage.[37] Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy.[31] They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.[38]\\r\\nCarrot cultivars can be grouped into two broad classes, eastern carrots and western carrots.[39] A number of novelty cultivars have been bred for particular characteristics.\\r\\n\\"Eastern\\" (a European and American continent reference) carrots were domesticated in Persia (probably in the lands of modern-day Iran and Afghanistan within West Asia) during the 10th century, or possibly earlier. Specimens of the \\"eastern\\" carrot that survive to the present day are commonly purple or yellow, and often have branched roots. The purple colour common in these carrots comes from anthocyanin pigments.[40]\\r\\nThe western carrot emerged in the Netherlands in the 17th century,[41] There is a popular belief that its orange colour making it popular in those countries as an emblem of the House of Orange and the struggle for Dutch independence, although there is little evidence for this.[42] The orange colour results from abundant carotenes in these cultivars.\\r\\nWestern carrot cultivars are commonly classified by their root shape. The four general types are:\\r\\nOne particular cultivar lacks the usual orange pigment due to carotene, and owing its white colour to a recessive gene for tocopherol (vitamin E).[44] Derived from Daucus carota L. and patented at the University of WisconsinÿMadison,[44] the cultivar is intended to supplement the dietary intake of Vitamin E.[45]\\r\\nCarrots are one of the ten most economically important vegetable crops in the world.[47] In 2014, world production of carrots (combined with turnips) was 38.8 million tonnes, with China producing 45% of the world total (17.3 million tonnes, table).[46] Other major producers were Uzbekistan and Russia (5% and 4% of world total, respectively), the United States (4%) and Ukraine (2%).[46]\\r\\nCarrots can be stored for several months in the refrigerator or over winter in a moist, cool place. For long term storage, unwashed carrots can be placed in a bucket between layers of sand, a 50/50 mix of sand and wood shavings, or in soil. A temperature range of 32 to 40?F (0 to 5?C) is best.[48][49]\\r\\nCarrots can be eaten in a variety of ways. Only 3 percent of the -carotene in raw carrots is released during digestion: this can be improved to 39% by pulping, cooking and adding cooking oil.[50] Alternatively they may be chopped and boiled, fried or steamed, and cooked in soups and stews, as well as baby and pet foods. A well-known dish is carrots julienne.[51] Together with onion and celery, carrots are one of the primary vegetables used in a mirepoix to make various broths.[52]\\r\\nThe greens are edible as a leaf vegetable, but are rarely eaten by humans;[53] some sources suggest that the greens contain toxic alkaloids.[54][55] When used for this purpose, they are harvested young in high-density plantings, before significant root development, and typically used stir-fried, or in salads.[53] Some people are allergic to carrots. In a 2010 study on the prevalence of food allergies in Europe, 3.6 percent of young adults showed some degree of sensitivity to carrots.[56] Because the major carrot allergen, the protein Dauc c 1.0104, is cross-reactive with homologues in birch pollen (Bet v 1) and mugwort pollen (Art v 1), most carrot allergy sufferers are also allergic to pollen from these plants.[57]\\r\\nIn India carrots are used in a variety of ways, as salads or as vegetables added to spicy rice or dal dishes. A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated and cooked in milk until the whole mixture is solid, after which nuts and butter are added.[58] Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil. Carrots can also be cut in thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.[59]\\r\\nSince the late 1980s, baby carrots or mini-carrots (carrots that have been peeled and cut into uniform cylinders) have been a popular ready-to-eat snack food available in many supermarkets.[60] Carrots are pured and used as baby food, dehydrated to make chips, flakes, and powder, and thinly sliced and deep-fried, like potato chips.[61]\\r\\nThe sweetness of carrots allows the vegetable to be used in some fruit-like roles. Grated carrots are used in carrot cakes, as well as carrot puddings, an English dish thought to have originated in the early 19th century.[62] Carrots can also be used alone or blended with fruits in jams and preserves. Carrot juice is also widely marketed, especially as a health drink, either stand-alone or blended with juices extracted from fruits and other vegetables.[63]\\r\\nHighly excessive consumption over a period of time results in a condition of carotenemia which is a yellowing of the skin caused by a build up of carotenoids.\\r\\nThe carrot gets its characteristic, bright orange colour from -carotene, and lesser amounts of ϫ-carotene, -carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin.[64] ϫ- and -carotenes are partly metabolized into vitamin A,[65][66] providing more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving of carrots (right table). Carrots are also a good source of vitamin K (13% DV) and vitamin B6 (11% DV), but otherwise have modest content of other essential nutrients (right table).[67]\\r\\nCarrots are 88% water, 4.7% sugar, 0.9% protein, 2.8% dietary fiber, 1% ash and 0.2% fat.[67] Carrot dietary fiber comprises mostly cellulose, with smaller proportions of hemicellulose, lignin and starch.[61] Free sugars in carrot include sucrose, glucose and fructose.[67]\\r\\nThe lutein and zeaxanthin carotenoids characteristic of carrots are studied for their potential roles in vision and eye health.[64][68]\\r\\nThe provitamin A beta-carotene from carrots does not actually help people to see in the dark unless they suffer from a deficiency of vitamin A.[69] This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was actually used to disguise advances in radar technology and the use of red lights on instrument panels.[70] Nevertheless, the consumption of carrots was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign. A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food.[71] The British public during WWII generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000 ton surplus of carrots from the extra production.[72]","input":"What part of a plant is a carrot?"},{"output":"In the fifth \\"act\\"","context":"Homestuck is a webcomic written, illustrated and animated by Andrew Hussie as part of MS Paint Adventures. The series centers on a group of teenagers who unwittingly bring about the end of the world through the installation of a beta copy of an upcoming computer game. Homestuck features a complex story and a large cast of characters, starring the four children John Egbert, Rose Lalonde, Dave Strider, and Jade Harley. Hussie invented an alien species, called trolls, that have a unique culture. Homestuck characters are particularly popular at anime conventions to cosplay.[1]\\r\\nAccording to Lauren Rae Orsini writing for The Daily Dot, there existed 128 named characters in Homestuck in September 2012, with more still being introduced.[2] The cast of Homestuck features a large quantity of LGBT characters, and a major theme of the webcomic is how many characters die throughout the story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first few acts of Homestuck centers around four 13-year-old children. Early pages of Homestuck were experiments in \\"fan-sourced storytelling\\", where Hussie allowed readers of Homestuck to name its characters and make story suggestions. The main characters of Homestuck were all named by fans.[3] The four main characters are presented as internet friends who have technically never met one another, but interact through an online chat application.[4][5]\\r\\nJohn Egbert is the main protagonist of Homestuck and the first character that is introduced. He is portrayed as a loyal \\"leader\\" of the group of kids, despite also being described as a \\"stereotypical mischief-making teen.\\"[6] Described by blogger Subdee as a \\"shoujo heroine\\", John's character is notably fond of bad films and has a seemingly irrational revulsion to the Betty Crocker brand.[7]\\r\\nRose Lalonde is portrayed as an \\"intellectual\\", both through her obsession of Lovecraftian literature and through her organizing and planning the group's movement during the story. Besides having an interest in magic, the character enjoys knitting and uses her knitting needles as her go-to weapons.[6] Rose forms a same-gendered relationship with Kanaya Maryam during Homestuck's run.\\r\\nDave Strider is a boy \\"so cool he only appreciates things ironically.\\" He copied this behavior from his older brother, who he assumes collects puppets and katanas on an ironic level.[8] Dave has been described as \\"smart-cynical\\" and is John's best friend. Surrounded by bad video games and junk food,[7] he wears aviator sunglasses, obscuring his eyes entirely, and wields katanas into combat situations.[9]\\r\\nDave is the fictional creator of Hussie's spin-off webcomic Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff, in-jokes of which are featured frequently in Homestuck. Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff is intentionally poorly made, featuring unsteady lines, liberal use of the spray-paint tool, and the unpopular font Comic Sans.[8]\\r\\nFirst shown on-screen during Homestuck's third act, Shaenon Garrity described Jade as \\"the most recalcitrant\\" of the four kids.[10] Jade Harley lives on a remote island together with her dog, who has \\"infinite dimensional powers\\".

While the first few acts of Homestuck focused on a more realistic theme of what it is like for a group of kids to be friends on the internet, the trolls took on more explicit representations of facets of Internet culture. Hussie stated that each troll represents a kind of internet behavior that is \\"marginalized or controversial, or something most people just want nothing to do with.\\" Homestuck aims to normalize and humanize internet cultures that are usually disfavored and rejected.[5]\\r\\nTrolls chat with unique typing quirks, inserting clues concerning the speaker's identity in their chat patterns. For example, Vriska, a troll with spider-like attributes, replaces the letter \\"B\\" with the number \\"8\\" and uses emoticons with eight eyes.[11] Troll culture features a complex system of romance featuring four \\"quadrants\\", that was specifically designed to encourage shipping among Homestuck fans.[5] Homestuck trolls are by default bi- or pansexual; this normalization has been described by a fan as \\"incredible for all the bi and gay kids out there ... seeing loads of couples that dont think twice about how theyre dating somebody of the same gender of themselves.\\"[12]\\r\\nThe names of the twelve trolls were also suggested by Homestuck readers, but they were the last instance of user input, as Homestuck's readership had expanded significantly at this point.[13] In an interview with Comics Alliance, Hussie remembered how \\"the moment it went crazy was really unmistakable ... it was when I brought the trolls into the picture,\\" saying that Homestuck became a \\"contagious phenomenon\\" about halfway through the sub-arc introducing the characters.[5]\\r\\nPortrayed as a powerful psychic, Aradia is responsible for recovering the code for the Troll-version of SBURB from some ruins. She is a burgundy blood, the lowest ranking blood color on the hemospectrum with the shortest lifespan of all trolls but the most likely to have psychic powers. Her star sign is Aries. She used to enjoy archaeology, but has mysteriously lost interest in everything she used to enjoy. This happened on the night she lost her Lusus and began to hear 'the voices of the dead' more clearly, and is eventually revealed to have made her a ghost.[14][15]\\r\\nTavros, who uses a wheelchair, deals with self-esteem issues throughout his character-arc. He is a bronze blood and is shown to have an interest in fantasy stories, notably Pupa Pan, the Alternian equivalent of Peter Pan,[16] and also has the ability to talk to animals. His star sign is Taurus. Tavros' ancestral figure, Rufioh, was inspired by the character Rufio from the 1991 film Hook. Dante Basco, who played Rufio in Hook, started reading Homestuck because his character made an appearance in it, and he later stated that Tavros is his favorite Homestuck character because of his relation to Rufioh. Rufioh's typing quirks and personality are based on those of Basco.[17]\\r\\nSollux is a computer programmer whose personality is associated with ideas of duality, due to his star sign being Gemini.[18] Sollux is a mustard blood, a caste known for great psychic power. Sollux has the ability to talk to the recently deceased,[19] who inform him that Alternia will be annihilated. He also claims that he is destined to go blind before dying,[20] a claim which later proves to be true.\\r\\nKarkat is the de facto \\"leader\\" of the troll team, with his introduction in Act 5 mirroring that of John at the start of the webcomic. His star sign is Cancer. He is easily tempered, loud, and often rude, but has a strong sense of justice, and is good at heart. His blood colour is candy-red, which is considered a mutant colour on Alternia, giving him the unshakeable fear of persecution, causing him to be self-conscious and leading him to believe that hiding his blood colour would be for the best.\\r\\nNepeta is an olive blood, considered the \\"middle class\\" of the hemospectrum. She lives in a cave with her lusus, and is known for acting like a cat, linking to her star sign Leo. She embodies an interest in both furries and shipping, a combination Hussie described as \\"for the sake of efficiency.\\"[5] She is also Equius' moirail, helping to pacify his aggressive tendencies, and has a crush on Karkat.\\r\\nKanaya is a jade blood. She has a great interest in fashion, and is thematically strongly influenced by the virgin Mary, hence her star sign being Virgo, with her taking on a motherly role towards the other trolls, particularly Karkat. She becomes a vampire (referred to as a rainbow drinker amongst the trolls) during the course of the story. Kanaya's romantic relationship with Rose Lalonde is one of the most popular canon same-sex relationships in the webcomic.[12]\\r\\nTerezi guides Dave through the earlier acts of Homestuck. The character is blind and able to visualize the world through her sense of smell and taste.[21] She is teal-blooded and portrayed as an avid role-player and has a strong sense of justice[6][21], hence her star sign being Libra, represented by the scales. Terezi was the first of three Homestuck character to be introduced in Namco Bandai's dating simulator Namco High, of which Andrew Hussie was the creative director.[22]\\r\\nVriska is cerulean-blooded and takes on the role of anti-hero in Homestuck.[12] Being raised by a giant spider, Vriska uses a spider-themed typing quirk and aspires to be a pirate. Her weapon is a set of legendary eight-sided dice, which, depending on what they roll, can cause devastating attacks. Her star sign is Scorpio. The character is described as \\"ruthless, manipulative [and] powerful\\", and was considered among the \\"most hardcore\\" eyepatch-wearing fictional characters by The Mary Sue.[23]\\r\\nEquius is presented as an indigo-blooded robotics expert with an unnatural amount of strength. Despite his thorough belief in Troll-culture's hemocaste system, he has an unhealthily obsessive adoration for Aradia Megido, who is of the lowest of the twelve castes. His star sign is Sagittarius, and he is Nepetas moirail, a companion who is seen as a platonic soulmate and helps pacify their more aggressive tendencies.[24]\\r\\nGamzee is a troll of the purple caste with strong ties to his religious faith, referred to as the \\"Cult of the Mirthful Messiahs\\". This religion is similar to that of the Juggalo: he has an obsession with Faygo and believes firmly in miracles and the coming of the Dark Carnival.[6] His star sign is Capricorn.\\r\\nEridan is shown as an aristocrat with a genocidal superiority complex.[25] He has a strong desire to kill all land-dwelling Trolls and had commissioned a doomsday device from Vriska to that effect.[26] He is a violet blood, making him part of the two castes that make up the sea-dwellers, a sub-race of trolls \\"distinct from the commoners by mutation and habitat\\", as it is put in his introductory page[25], which relates to his star sign Aquarius.\\r\\nA sea-dweller like Eridan, as well as his moirail. Her star sign is Pisces. Feferi is the heir apparent for Alternian rulership, which puts her at risk from Her Imperious Condescension, the Empress of Alternia, who would make an attempt on her life if it weren't for her lusus' protection.[27] She is fuchsia-blooded, the highest ranking blood caste, being that of royalty, but is shown to be much more passive than other high bloods, wanting to coddle low bloods rather than \\"culling\\" them.[27]\\r\\nOther characters featured in Homestuck include another group of four kids (named Jane, Jake, Roxy, and Dirk), as well as another group of twelve trolls, the nearly-all-powerful antagonist Lord English,[28] a \\"wayward vagabond\\" whose story is told in the Earth's post-apocalyptic future,[10] and a pair of \\"diametrically opposed twins living inside the same body\\" named Calliope and Caliborn (the latter who becomes Lord English). Andrew Hussie also inserted himself into Homestuck's story as a character, where he offers detailed summaries and ends up in \\"bizarre in-world encounters.\\"[3] After Ryan North asked why \\"MS Paint Adventures\\" doesn't follow the adventures of a \\"Ms. Paint\\", Hussie included a minor character to Homestuck with that name.[29]\\r\\nLate in the webcomic, Hussie introduced Davepetasprite^2, a fusion of the characters Dave Strider and Nepeta Leijon. The character is notable for having had a short-lived crisis with regards to their gender identity, but was quickly defined as non-binary.[12]\\r\\nAccording to Lilian Min of The Atlantic, Homestuck's greatest strength is Andrew Hussie's \\"gift for character-building\\", and that the characters are unique and \\"strangely relatable\\".[3] Elliott Dunstan of Monkeys Fighting Robots said that \\"the sheer number of characters and possible interactions can get overwhelming\\", and that each fan ends up with a favorite castmember.[30] The characters of Homestuck are particularly popular among cosplayers,[31] with cosplay events such as San Diegostuck being held for Homestuck cosplay specifically.[32]\\r\\nMary Kinney of the New York University wrote that Homestuck, which is heavily stylized as an adventure game, features an \\"implied character\\" as the player. This \\"nebulous\\" actor changes the Homestuck world. For example, on the first page of the webcomic, the player is prompted to enter the protagonist's name. After clicking to go to the following page, the reader's sense of control dissipates as they are not actually allowed to enter a name. The relationship between the player and the reader of the story fluctuates from page to page, and the player character may switch from avatar to avatar. In this way, the reader experiences Homestuck's narrative through the experiences of various characters.[4]\\r\\nIn an interview with The Daily Dot, Homestuck guest artist Shelby Cragg praised Hussie's webcomic for its 50/50 gender ratio and large number of well-written female characters.[33] Creatrix Tiara of Autostraddle noted that Hussie was highly successful with creating a diverse LGBT cast, by writing the characters in a \\"realistic, non-fetishistic manner.\\" A large number of LGBT readers have stated to have been strongly affected by the representation of diverse sexualities and gender identities in the webcomic.[12]\\r\\nCharacters frequently die within the plot of Homestuck, which Andrew Hussie described as a necessity of a story with such a large cast. Though Hussie used death as \\"the line between relevance and irrelevance\\", characters generally remain relevant in some way in the story, as there exist various video game-style constructs that allow a character to be revived.[34] Rebecca Peterson of The Martlet described how \\"characters are gleefully killed off, brought back, and killed again\\" in a manner that makes it difficult to follow which characters are still alive. Characters may even have multiple versions of themselves active in the story simultaneously, both dead and alive.[35] In an interview with Big Shiny Robot, Hussie said the following on this topic:\\r\\n[Homestuck] seems to combine all the meaningless deaths of a trial-and-error game journey with the way death is treated dramatically in other media, where unlike [the] oblivious Mario, the characters are aware and afraid of the many deaths they must experience before finally winning the game.\\r\\nDeath is presented as a \\"leveling up step\\" for the characters in Homestuck, it being the only way for characters to gain God Tier powers. According to Autostraddle, many characters reach a greater importance after their death, as they can contribute to the story as ghosts or helper sprites. Many readers of the webcomic see this implementation of death as a subversion of the \\"bury your gays\\"-trope, as homosexual characters frequently get killed off in American media.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwhy","input":"When do the trolls first appear in homestuck?"},{"output":"Chamber of Princes in the Parliament building where the previous Federal Court of India sat","context":"Sanctioned strength= 31(30+1)\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of India is the highest judicial forum and final court of appeal under the Constitution of India, the highest constitutional court, with the power of constitutional review. Consisting of the Chief Justice of India and 30 sanctioned other judges, it has extensive powers in the form of original, appellate and advisory jurisdictions.\\r\\nAs the final court of appeal of the country, it takes up appeals primarily against verdicts of the High Courts of various states of the Union and other courts and tribunals. It safeguards fundamental rights of citizens and settles disputes between various governments in the country. As an advisory court, it hears matters which may specifically be referred to it under the Constitution by the President of India. It also may take cognisance of matters on its own (or 'suo moto'), without anyone drawing its attention to them. The law declared by the Supreme Court becomes binding on all courts within India.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1861 the Indian High Courts Act 1861 was enacted to create High Courts for various provinces and abolished Supreme Courts at Calcutta, Madras and Bombay and also the Sadar Adalats in Presidency towns which had acted as the highest court in their respective regions. These new High Courts had the distinction of being the highest Courts for all cases till the creation of Federal Court of India under the Government of India Act 1935. The Federal Court had jurisdiction to solve disputes between provinces and federal states and hear appeal against judgements of the High Courts. The first CJI of India was Shri. Manak Goel.[3]\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of India came into being on 28 January 1950.[4] It replaced both the Federal Court of India and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council which were then at the apex of the Indian court system.\\r\\nSupreme Court initially had its seat at Chamber of Princes in the Parliament building where the previous Federal Court of India sat from 1937 to 1950. The first Chief Justice of India was Sir H J Kania. In 1958, the Supreme Court moved to its present premises.[4] Originally, Constitution of India envisaged a Supreme Court with a Chief Justice and seven Judges; leaving it to Parliament to increase this number.[5] In formative years, the Supreme Court met from 10 to 12 in the morning and then 2 to 4 in the afternoon for 28 days in a month.[6]\\r\\nThe building is shaped to symbolize scales of justice with its centre-beam being the Central Wing of the building comprising the Chief Justices court, the largest of the courtrooms, with two court halls on either side. The Right Wing of the structure has the bar ÿ room, the offices of the Attorney General of India and other law officers and the library of the court. The Left Wing has the offices of the court. In all, there are 15 courtrooms in the various wings of the building.[3][4][7]\\r\\nThe foundation stone of the supreme court's building was laid on 29 October 1954 by Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India. The main block of the building has been built on a triangular plot of 17 acres and has been designed in an Indo-British style by the chief architect Ganesh Bhikaji Deolalikar, the first Indian to head the Central Public Works Department. The Court moved into the building in 1958. In 1979, two new wings ÿ the East Wing and the West Wing ÿ were added to the complex. 1994 saw the last extension.[4]\\r\\nOn 20 February 1980, a black bronze sculpture of 210-centimeter height was installed in the lawn of the Supreme Court. It portrays Mother India in the form of the figure of a lady, sheltering the young Republic of India represented by the symbol of a child, who is upholding the laws of land symbolically shown in the form of an open book. On the book, a balance beam is shown, which represents dispensation of equal justice to all. The sculpture was made by the renowned artist Chintamoni Kar. The sculpture is just behind the idol of Mahatma Gandhi.\\r\\nThe design of the Court's seal is reproduced from the wheel that appears on the abacus of the Sarnath Lion capital of Asoka with 24 spokes. The inscription in Sanskrit \\"yatodharmastato jayah\\"(??? ????????? ???) means \\"whence law (dharma), thence victory\\". It is also referred to ÿ as the wheel of righteousness, encompassing truth, goodness and equity.[3]\\r\\nThe registry of the Supreme Court is headed by the Secretary-General who is assisted by 8 registrars, several additional and deputy registrars, etc., with 1770 employees in all (221 gazetted officers, 805 non-gazetted and 744 Class IV employees)[8] Article 146 of the Constitution deals with the appointments of officers and servants of the Supreme Court registry.[9][10]\\r\\nSupreme Court Rules, 2013[11] entitle only those advocates who are registered with the supreme court, called 'Advocates-on-Record' to appear, act and plead for a party in the court. Those advocates who are designated as 'Senior Advocates' by the Supreme Court or any of the High Courts can appear for clients along with an Advocate-on-Record. Any other advocate can appear for a party along with or under instructions from an Advocate-on-Record.\\r\\nAs originally enacted, the Constitution of India provided for a Supreme Court with a Chief Justice and 7 judges. In the early years, a full bench of the Supreme Court sat together to hear the cases presented before them. As the work of the Court increased and cases began to accumulate, Parliament increased the number of judges from the original 8 in 1950 to 10 in 1956, 13 in 1960, 17 in 1977, 26 in 1986 and 31 in 2008 (current strength). As the number of the judges has increased, they sit in smaller benches of two or three (referred to as a division bench)?[12] coming together in larger benches of five or more (referred to as a constitution bench) when required to settle fundamental questions of law. A bench may refer a case before it to a larger bench, should the need arise.[13]\\r\\nA citizen of India[14] who has been\\r\\nis eligible to be recommended for appointment, a judge of the supreme court.\\r\\nIn practice, judges of the supreme court have been selected so far, mostly from amongst judges of the high courts. Barely six ÿ Justices S. M. Sikri, S. Chandra Roy, Kuldip Singh, Santosh Hegde, R. F. Nariman, U. U. Lalit and L. Nageshwara Rao have been appointed to the supreme court directly from the bar (i.e. who were practising advocates).[17][18]\\r\\nThe supreme court saw its first woman judge when Justice M. Fathima Beevi was sworn into office in 1989.[19] The sixth and the most recent woman judge in the court is Justice R. Banumathi.[20][21] In 1968, Justice Mohammad Hidayatullah became the first Muslim Chief Justice of India. In 2000, Justice K. G. Balakrishnan became the first judge from the dalit community. In 2007 he also became the first dalit Chief Justice of India. In 2010, Justice S. H. Kapadia coming from a Parsi minority community became the Chief Justice of India.[15][22] In 2017, Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar became the first Sikh Chief Justice of India.\\r\\nThe Constitution seeks to ensure the independence of Supreme Court Judges in various ways.\\r\\nAs per the Constitution, as held by the court in the Three Judges' Cases ÿ (1982, 1993, 1998), a judge is appointed to the Supreme Court by the President of India on the recommendation of the collegium ? a closed group of the Chief Justice of India, the four most senior judges of the court and the senior-most judge hailing from the high court of a prospective appointee.[23] This has resulted in a Memorandum of Procedure being followed, for the appointments.\\r\\nJudges used to be appointed by the President on the advice of the Union Cabinet. After 1993 (the Second Judges' Case), no minister, or even the executive collectively, can suggest any names to the President,[24][25] who ultimately decides on appointing them from a list of names recommended only by the collegium of the judiciary. Simultaneously, as held in that judgment, the executive was given the power to reject a recommended name. However, according to some, the executive has not been diligent in using this power to reject the names of bad candidates recommended by the judiciary.[26][27][28]\\r\\nThe collegium system has come under a fair amount of criticism.[25] In 2015, the Parliament passed a law to replace the collegium with a National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC). This was struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, in the Fourth Judges' Case, as the new system would undermine the independence of the judiciary.[29] Putting the old system of the collegium back, the court invited suggestions, even from the general public, on how to improve the collegium system, broadly along the lines of ÿ setting up an eligibility criteria for appointments, a permanent secretariat to help the collegium sift through material on potential candidates, infusing more transparency into the selection process, grievance redressal and any other suggestion not in these four categories, like transfer of judges.[30] This resulted in the court asking the government and the collegium to finalize the Memorandum of Procedure incorporating the above.[31]\\r\\nOnce, in 2009, the recommendation for the appointment of a judge of a high court made by the collegium of that court, had come to be challenged in the supreme court. The court held that who could become a judge was a matter of fact, and any person had a right to question it. But who should become a judge was a matter of opinion and could not be questioned. As long as an effective consultation took place within a collegium in arriving at that opinion, the content or material placed before it to form the opinion could not be called for scrutiny in court.[32]\\r\\nSupreme Court judges retire at the age of 65. However, there have been suggestions from the judges of the Supreme Court of India to provide for a fixed term for the judges including the Chief Justice of India.[33]\\r\\nArticle 125 of the Indian Constitution leaves it to the Indian Parliament to determine the salary, other allowances, leave of absence, pension, etc. of the Supreme Court judges. However, the Parliament cannot alter any of these privileges and rights to the judge's disadvantage after his/her appointment.[34] A judge gets ?90,000 (US$1,400) per month, the Chief Justice earns an additional ?10,000 (US$160).[35]\\r\\nA judge of the Supreme Court can be removed under the Constitution only on grounds of proven misconduct or incapacity and by an order of the President of India, after a notice signed by at least 100 members of the Lok Sabha (House of the People) or 50 members of the Rajya Sabha (Council of the States) is passed by a two-third majority in each House of the Parliament.[36][37]\\r\\nA Person who has retired as a Judge of the Supreme Court is debarred from practicing in any court of law or before any other authority in India.\\r\\nArticle 137 of the Constitution of India lays down provision for the power of the Supreme Court to review its own judgements. As per this Article, subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament or any rules made under Article 145, the Supreme Court shall have power to review any judgment pronounced or order made by it.[38]\\r\\nUnder Order XL of the Supreme Court Rules, that have been framed under its powers under Article 145 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court may review its judgment or order but no application for review is to be entertained in a civil proceeding except on the grounds mentioned in Order XLVII, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\\r\\nUnder Articles 129 and 142 of the Constitution the Supreme Court has been vested with power to punish anyone for contempt of any court in India including itself. The Supreme Court performed an unprecedented action when it directed a sitting Minister of the state of Maharashtra, Swaroop Singh Naik,[39] to be jailed for 1-month on a charge of contempt of court on 12 May 2006. This was the first time that a serving Minister was ever jailed.[40][41]\\r\\nThe Constitution of India under Article 145 empowers the Supreme Court to frame its own rules for regulating the practice and procedure of the Court as and when required (with the approval of the President of India). Accordingly, \\"Supreme Court Rules, 1950\\" were framed. The 1950 Rules were replaced by the Supreme Court Rules, 1966.\\r\\n[42] In 2014, Supreme Court notified the Supreme Court Rules, 2013 replacing the 1966 Rules effective from 19 August 2014.[11]\\r\\nSupreme Court Reports is the official journal of Reportable Supreme Court Decisions. It is published under the authority of the Supreme Court of India by the Controller of Publications, Government of India, Delhi.[43] In addition, there are many other reputed private journals that report Supreme Court decisions. Some of these other important journals are: SCR (The Supreme Court Reports), SCC(Supreme Court Cases), AIR (All India Reporter), SCALE, etc.\\r\\nLegal-aid,[44][45][46] court-fee vendors, first-aid post, dental clinic, physiotherapy unit and pathology lab; rail-reservation counter, canteen, post office and a branch and 3 ATMs of UCO Bank, Supreme Court Museum[8] can be availed by litigants and visitors.\\r\\nAfter some of the courts overturned state laws for redistributing land from zamindar (landlord) estates on the ground that the laws violated the zamindars' fundamental rights, the Parliament passed the 1st amendment to the Constitution in 1951, followed by the 4th amendment in 1955, to uphold its authority to redistribute land. The Supreme Court countered these amendments in 1967 when it ruled in Golaknath v. State of Punjab[47] that the Parliament did not have the power to abrogate fundamental rights, including the provisions on private property. The 25th amendment to the Constitution in 1971 curtailed the right of a citizen to property as a fundamental right and gave authority to the government to infringe private property, which led to a furor amongst the zamindars.\\r\\nThe independence of judiciary was severely curtailed[48] during the Indian Emergency (1975ÿ1977) of Indira Gandhi. The constitutional rights of imprisoned persons were restricted under Preventive detention laws passed by the parliament. In the case of Shiva Kant Shukla Additional District Magistrate of Jabalpur v. Shiv Kant Shukla, popularly known as the Habeas Corpus case, a bench of five seniormost judges of Supreme court ruled in favour of state's right for unrestricted powers of detention during the emergency. Justices A.N. Ray, P. N. Bhagwati, Y. V. Chandrachud, and M.H. Beg, stated in the majority decision:[49]\\r\\nThe only dissenting opinion was from Justice H. R. Khanna, who stated:\\r\\nIt is believed that before delivering his dissenting opinion, Justice Khanna had mentioned to his sister: \\"I have prepared my judgment, which is going to cost me the Chief Justice-ship of India.\\"[50] In January 1977, Justice Khanna was superseded despite being the most senior judge at the time and thereby Government broke the convention of appointing only the senior most judge to the position of Chief Justice of India. Justice Khanna remains a legendary figure among the legal fraternity in India for this decision.\\r\\nThe New York Times, wrote of this opinion: \\"The submission of an independent judiciary to absolutist government is virtually the last step in the destruction of a democratic society; and the Indian Supreme Court's decision appears close to utter surrender.\\"\\r\\nDuring the emergency period, the government also passed the 39th amendment, which sought to limit judicial review for the election of the Prime Minister; only a body constituted by Parliament could review this election.[51] Subsequently, the parliament, with most opposition members in jail during the emergency, passed the 42nd Amendment which prevented any court from reviewing any amendment to the constitution with the exception of procedural issues concerning ratification. A few years after the emergency, however, the Supreme court rejected the absoluteness of the 42nd amendment and reaffirmed its power of judicial review in the Minerva Mills case (1980).\\r\\nAfter Indira Gandhi lost elections in 1977, the new government of Morarji Desai, and especially law minister Shanti Bhushan (who had earlier argued for the detenues in the Habeas Corpus case), introduced a number of amendments making it more difficult to declare and sustain an emergency, and reinstated much of the power to the Supreme Court. It is said that the Basic Structure doctrine, created in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, was strengthened in Indira Gandhi's case and set in stone in [Minerva Mills v. Union of India].[52]\\r\\nThe Supreme Court's creative and expansive interpretations of Article 21 (Life and Personal Liberty), primarily after the Emergency period, have given rise to a new jurisprudence of public interest litigation that has vigorously promoted many important economic and social rights (constitutionally protected but not enforceable) including, but not restricted to, the rights to free education, livelihood, a clean environment,[53] food and many others. Civil and political rights (traditionally protected in the Fundamental Rights chapter of the Indian Constitution) have also been expanded and more fiercely protected. These new interpretations have opened the avenue for litigation on a number of important issues.\\r\\nAmong the important pronouncements of the Supreme Court post 2000 is the Coelho case I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu (Judgment of 11 January 2007). A unanimous Bench of 9 judges reaffirmed the basic structure doctrine. It held that a constitutional amendment which entails violation of any fundamental rights which the Court regards as forming part of the basic structure of the Constitution, then the same can be struck down depending upon its impact and consequences. The judgment clearly imposes further limitations on the constituent power of Parliament with respect to the principles underlying certain fundamental rights. The judgment in Coelho has in effect restored the decision in Golak Nath regarding non-amendability of the Constitution on account of infraction of fundamental rights, contrary to the judgment in the Kesavananda Bharati case.\\r\\nAnother important decision was of the five-judge Bench in Ashoka Kumara Thakur v. Union of India; where the constitutional validity of Central Educational Institutions (Reservations in Admissions) Act, 2006 was upheld, subject to the \\"creamy layer\\" criteria. Importantly, the Court refused to follow the 'strict scrutiny' standards of review followed by the United States Supreme Court. At the same time, the Court has applied the strict scrutiny standards in Anuj Garg v. Hotel Association of India (2007) ([1])\\r\\nThe Supreme Court declared allotment of spectrum as \\"unconstitutional and arbitrary\\" and quashed all the 122 licenses issued in 2008 during tenure of A. Raja (then minister for communications & IT), the main official accused in the 2G scam case.[54]\\r\\nThe government refused to disclose details of about 18 Indians holding accounts in LGT Bank, Liechtenstein, evoking a sharp response from a Bench comprising Justices B Sudershan Reddy and S S Nijjar.

Our society often ridicules and abuses the Transgender community and in public places like railway stations, bus stands, schools, workplaces, malls, theatres, hospitals, they are sidelined and treated as untouchables, forgetting the fact that the moral failure lies in the society's unwillingness to contain or embrace different gender identities and expressions, a mindset which we have to change.\\r\\nJustice Radhakrishnan said that transgender people should be treated consistently with other minorities under the law, enabling them to access jobs, healthcare and education.[65] He framed the issue as one of human rights, saying that, \\"These TGs, even though insignificant in numbers, are still human beings and therefore they have every right to enjoy their human rights\\", concluding by declaring that:[64]\\r\\n(1) Hijras, eunuchs, apart from binary gender, be treated as \\"third gender\\" for the purpose of safeguarding their rights under Part III of our Constitution and the laws made by the Parliament and the State Legislature.\\r\\n(2) Transgender persons' right to decide their self-identified gender is also upheld and the Centre and State Governments are directed to grant legal recognition of their gender identity such as male, female or as third gender.\\r\\nIn B.Prabhakara Rao vs. State of A.P. involved sudden reduction in age of superannuation from 58 years to 55 years of over 35,000 public servants of State Government, public sector undertakings, statutory bodies, educational institutions and Tirupathi-Tirumalai Devasthanams (TTD).

G. Balakrishnan invited a lot of criticism for his comments on his post not being that of a public servant, but that of a constitutional authority.[73] He later went back on this stand.[74] The judiciary has come in for serious criticisms from former Presidents of India Pratibha Patil and A. P. J. Abdul Kalam for failure in handling its duties.[75] Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, has stated that corruption is one of the major challenges facing the judiciary, and suggested that there is an urgent need to eradicate this menace.[76]\\r\\nThe Cabinet Secretary of the Indian government introduced the Judges Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2008 in Parliament for setting up of a panel called the National Judicial Council, headed by the Chief Justice of India, that will probe into allegations of corruption and misconduct by High Court and Supreme Court judges.[77][78]\\r\\nAccording to Supreme Court newsletter, there are 58,519 cases pending in the Supreme Court, out of which 37,385 are pending for more than a year, at the end of 2011.

Lodha, proposed to make Indian judiciary work throughout the year (instead of the present system of having long vacations, specially in the higher courts) in order to reduce pendency of cases in Indian courts; however, as per this proposal there is not going to be any increase in the number of working days or working hours of any of the judges and it only meant that different judges would be going on vacation during different periods of the year as per their choice; but, the Bar Council of India rejected this proposal mainly because it would have inconvenienced the advocates who would have to work throughout the year.[81]","input":"Where was the first supreme court of india established?"},{"output":"February 2, 1848","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (Tratado de Guadalupe Hidalgo in Spanish), officially titled the Treaty of Peace, Friendship, Limits and Settlement between the United States of America and the Mexican Republic,[1] is the peace treaty signed on February 2, 1848, in the Villa de Guadalupe Hidalgo (now a neighborhood of Mexico City) between the United States and Mexico that ended the MexicanÿAmerican War (1846ÿ1848). The treaty came into force on July 4, 1848.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the defeat of its army and the fall of its capital, Mexico entered into negotiations to end the war. The treaty called for the U.S. to pay US$15 million to Mexico and to pay off the claims of American citizens against Mexico up to US$5 million. It gave the United States the Rio Grande as a boundary for Texas, and gave the U.S. ownership of California and a large area comprising roughly half of New Mexico, most of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah, and parts of Wyoming and Colorado. Mexicans in those annexed areas had the choice of relocating to within Mexico's new boundaries or receiving American citizenship with full civil rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Senate advised and consented to ratification of the treaty by a vote of 38ÿ14.  The opponents of this treaty were led by the Whigs, who had opposed the war and rejected Manifest destiny in general, and rejected this expansion in particular. The amount of land gained by the United States from Mexico was increased as a result of the Gadsden Purchase of 1853, which ceded parts of present-day southern Arizona and New Mexico to the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peace talks were negotiated by Nicholas Trist, chief clerk of the US State Department, who had accompanied General Winfield Scott as a diplomat and President Polk's representative. Trist and General Scott, after two previous unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a treaty with General Jos Joaqun de Herrera, determined that the only way to deal with Mexico was as a conquered enemy. Nicholas Trist negotiated with a special commission representing the collapsed government led by Don Jos Bernardo Couto, Don Miguel de Atristain, and Don Luis Gonzaga Cuevas of Mexico.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Mexico ceded Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo Mxico, the text of the treaty[4] did not list territories to be ceded, and avoided the disputed issues that were causes of war: the validity of the 1836 secession of the Republic of Texas, Texas's unenforced boundary claims as far as the Rio Grande, and the 1845 annexation of Texas by the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, Article V of the treaty simply described the new U.S.ÿMexico border.  From east to west, the border consisted of the Rio Grande northwest from its mouth to the point Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico (roughly 32 degrees north), as shown in the Disturnell map, then due west from this point to the 110th meridian west, then north along the 110th Meridian to the Gila River and down the river to its mouth. Unlike the New Mexico segment of the boundary, which depended partly on unknown geography, \\"in order to preclude all difficulty in tracing upon the ground the limit separating Upper from Lower California\\", a straight line was drawn from the mouth of the Gila to one marine league south of the southernmost point of the port of San Diego, slightly north of the previous Mexican provincial boundary at Playas de Rosarito.\\r\\n\\r\\nComparing the boundary in the AdamsÿOns Treaty to the Guadalupe Hidalgo boundary, Mexico conceded about 55% of its pre-war, pre-Texas territorial claims[5] and now has an area of 1,972,550?km2 (761,606 sq mi).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the 1.36 million km2 (525,000 square miles) of the area between the Adams-Onis and Guadalupe Hidalgo boundaries outside the 1,007,935?km2 (389,166?sq?mi) claimed by the Republic of Texas is known as the Mexican Cession.  That is to say, the Mexican Cession is construed not to include any territory east of the Rio Grande, while the territorial claims of the Republic of Texas included no territory west of the Rio Grande.  The Mexican Cession included essentially the entirety of the former Mexican territory of Alta California, but only the western portion of Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico, and includes all of present-day California, Nevada and Utah, most of Arizona, and western portions of New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticles VIII and IX ensured safety of existing property rights of Mexican citizens living in the transferred territories. Despite assurances to the contrary, the property rights of Mexican citizens were often not honored by the U.S. in accordance with modifications to and interpretations of the Treaty.[6][7][8] The U.S. also agreed to assume $3.25 million (equivalent to $91.9 million today) in debts that Mexico owed to United States citizens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe residents had one year to choose whether they wanted American or Mexican citizenship; Over 90% chose American citizenship.  The others returned to Mexico (where they received land), or in some cases in New Mexico were allowed to remain in place as Mexican citizens.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle XII engaged the United States to pay, \\"In consideration of the extension acquired\\", 15 million dollars (equivalent to $420 million today),[11] in annual installments of 3 million dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle XI of the treaty was important to Mexico.  It provided that the United States would prevent and punish raids by Indians into Mexico, prohibited Americans from acquiring property, including livestock, taken by the Indians in those raids, and stated that the U.S. would return captives of the Indians to Mexico.  Mexicans believed that the United States had encouraged and assisted the Comanche and Apache raids that had devastated northern Mexico in the years before the war.  This article promised relief to them. [12]\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle XI, however, proved unenforceable.  Destructive Indian raids continued despite a heavy U.S. presence near the Mexican border.  Mexico filed 366 claims with the U.S. government for damages done by Comanche and Apache raids between 1848 and 1853.[13]  In 1853, in the Treaty of Mesilla concluding the Gadsden Purchase, Article XI was annulled.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe land that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo brought into the United States became, between 1850 and 1912, all or part of ten states: California (1850), Nevada (1869), Utah (1896), and Arizona (1912), as well as, depending upon interpretation, the entire state of Texas (1845), which then included part of Kansas (1861); Colorado (1876); Wyoming (1890); Oklahoma (1907); and New Mexico (1912). The remainder (the southern parts) of New Mexico and Arizona were peacefully purchased under the Gadsden Purchase, which was carried out in 1853. In this purchase the United States paid an additional $10 million (equivalent to $290 million today[when?]), for land intended to accommodate a transcontinental railroad.  However, the American Civil War delayed construction of such a route, and it was not until 1881 that the Southern Pacific Railroad finally was completed, fulfilling the purpose of the acquisition.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nMexico had claimed the area in question since winning its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. The Spanish Empire had conquered part of the area from the American Indian tribes over the preceding three centuries, but there remained powerful and independent indigenous nations within that northern region of Mexico. Most of that land was too dry (low rainfall) and too mountainous to support many people, until the advent of new technology after about 1880: means for damming and distributing water from the few rivers to irrigated farmland; the telegraph; the railroad; the telephone; and electrical power.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 80,000 Mexicans inhabited California, New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas during the period 1845 to 1850, with far fewer in Nevada, southern and western Colorado, and Utah.[16] On 1 March 1845, U.S. President John Tyler signed legislation to authorize the United States to annex the Republic of Texas, effective on 29 December 1845. The Mexican government, which had never recognized the Republic of Texas as an independent country, had warned that annexation would be viewed as an act of war. The United Kingdom and France, both of which recognized the independence of the Republic of Texas, repeatedly tried to dissuade Mexico from declaring war against its northern neighbor. British efforts to mediate the quandary proved fruitless, in part because additional political disputes (particularly the Oregon boundary dispute) arose between Great Britain (as the ruler of Canada) and the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 November 1845, before the outbreak of hostilities, President James K. Polk sent his envoy, John Slidell, to Mexico. Slidell had instructions to offer Mexico around $5 million for the territory of Nuevo Mxico and up to $40 million for Alta California.[17] The Mexican government dismissed Slidell, refusing to even meet with him.[18] Earlier in that year, Mexico had broken off diplomatic relations with the United States, based partly on its interpretation of the AdamsÿOns Treaty of 1819, under which newly-independent Mexico claimed it had inherited rights. In that agreement, the United States had \\"renounced forever\\" all claims to Spanish territory.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither side took any further action to avoid a war. Meanwhile, Polk settled a major territorial dispute with Britain via the Oregon Treaty, which was signed on 15 June 1846. By avoiding any chance of conflict with Great Britain, the U.S was given a free hand in regard to Mexico. After the Thornton Affair of 25ÿ26 April, when Mexican forces attacked an American unit in the disputed area, with the result that 11 Americans were killed, five wounded and 49 captured, Congress passed declaration of war, which Polk signed on 13 May 1846. The Mexican Congress responded with its own war declaration on 7 July 1846.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia and New Mexico were quickly occupied by American forces in the summer of 1846, and fighting there ended on 13 January 1847 with the signing of the \\"Capitulation Agreement\\" at \\"Campo de Cahuenga\\" and end of the Taos Revolt.[21] By the middle of September 1847, U.S. forces had successfully invaded central Mexico and occupied Mexico City.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Eastern Democrats called for complete annexation of Mexico and claimed that some Mexican liberals would welcome this,[22] but President Polk's State of the Union address in December 1847 upheld Mexican independence and argued at length that occupation and any further military operations in Mexico were aimed at securing a treaty ceding California and New Mexico up to approximately the 32nd parallel north and possibly Baja California and transit rights across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite its lengthy string of military defeats, the Mexican government was reluctant to agree to the loss of California and New Mexico. Even with its capital under enemy occupation, the Mexican government was inclined to consider factors such as the unwillingness of the U.S. administration to annex Mexico outright and what appeared to be deep divisions in domestic U.S. opinion regarding the war and its aims, which gave it reason to conclude that it was actually in a far better negotiating position than the military situation might have suggested. A further consideration was the Mexican government's opposition to slavery and its awareness of the well-known and growing sectional divide in the U.S. over the issue of slavery. It therefore made sense for Mexico to negotiate with a goal of pandering to Northern U.S. interests at the expense of Southern U.S. interests.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mexicans proposed peace terms that offered only sale of Alta California north of the 37th parallel north? north of Santa Cruz, California and Madera, California and the southern boundaries of today's Utah and Colorado. This territory was already dominated by Anglo-American settlers, but perhaps more importantly from the Mexican point of view, it represented the bulk of pre-war Mexican territory north of the Missouri Compromise line of parallel 3630 north? lands that, if annexed by the U.S., would have been presumed by Northerners to be forever free of slavery. The Mexicans also offered to recognize the U.S. annexation of Texas, but held to its demand of the Nueces River as a boundary.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Mexican government could not reasonably have expected the Polk Administration to accept such terms, it would have had reason to hope that a rejection of peace terms so favorable to Northern interests might have the potential to provoke sectional conflict in the United States, or perhaps even a civil war that would fatally undermine the U.S. military position in Mexico. Instead, these terms combined with other Mexican demands (in particular, for various indemnities) only provoked widespread indignation throughout the U.S. without causing the sectional conflict the Mexicans were hoping for.\\r\\n\\r\\nJefferson Davis advised Polk that if Mexico appointed commissioners to come to the U.S., the government that appointed them would probably be overthrown before they completed their mission, and they would likely be shot as traitors on their return; so that the only hope of peace was to have a U.S. representative in Mexico.[23] Nicholas Trist, chief clerk of the State Department under President Polk, finally negotiated a treaty with the Mexican delegation after ignoring his recall by President Polk in frustration with failure to secure a treaty.[24] Notwithstanding that the treaty had been negotiated against his instructions, given its achievement of the major American aim, President Polk passed it on to the Senate.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed by Nicholas Trist (on behalf of the U.S.) and Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto and Miguel Atristain as plenipotentiary representatives of Mexico on 2 February 1848, at the main altar of the old Basilica of Guadalupe at Villa Hidalgo (within the present city limits) as U.S. troops under the command of Gen. Winfield Scott were occupying Mexico City.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe version of the treaty ratified by the United States Senate eliminated Article X,[25] which stated that the U.S. government would honor and guarantee all land grants awarded in lands ceded to the U.S. to citizens of Spain and Mexico by those respective governments. Article VIII guaranteed that Mexicans who remained more than one year in the ceded lands would automatically become full-fledged United States citizens (or they could declare their intention of remaining Mexican citizens); however, the Senate modified Article IX, changing the first paragraph and excluding the last two. Among the changes was that Mexican citizens would \\"be admitted at the proper time (to be judged of by the Congress of the United States)\\" instead of \\"admitted as soon as possible\\", as negotiated between Trist and the Mexican delegation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn amendment by Jefferson Davis giving the U.S. most of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le܇n, all of Coahuila and a large part of Chihuahua was supported by both senators from Texas (Sam Houston and Thomas Jefferson Rusk), Daniel S. Dickinson of New York, Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, Edward A. Hannegan of Indiana, and one each from Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Ohio, Missouri and Tennessee. Most of the leaders of the Democratic party, Thomas Hart Benton, John C. Calhoun, Herschel V. Johnson, Lewis Cass, James Murray Mason of Virginia and Ambrose Hundley Sevier were opposed and the amendment was defeated 44ÿ11.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn amendment by Whig Sen. George Edmund Badger of North Carolina to exclude New Mexico and California lost 35ÿ15, with three Southern Whigs voting with the Democrats. Daniel Webster was bitter that four New England senators made deciding votes for acquiring the new territories.\\r\\n\\r\\nA motion to insert into the treaty the Wilmot Proviso (banning slavery from the acquired territories) failed 15ÿ38 on sectional lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe treaty was subsequently ratified by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 38 to 14 on 10 March 1848 and by Mexico through a legislative vote of 51 to 34 and a Senate vote of 33 to 4, on 19 May 1848. News that New Mexico's legislative assembly had just passed an act for organization of a U.S. territorial government helped ease Mexican concern about abandoning the people of New Mexico.[27] The treaty was formally proclaimed on 4 July 1848.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 May 1848, when the two countries exchanged ratifications of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, they further negotiated a three-article protocol to explain the amendments. The first article stated that the original Article IX of the treaty, although replaced by Article III of the Treaty of Louisiana, would still confer the rights delineated in Article IX. The second article confirmed the legitimacy of land grants pursuant to Mexican law.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe protocol further noted that said explanations had been accepted by the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Mexican Government,[29] and was signed in Santiago de Quertaro by A. H. Sevier, Nathan Clifford and Luis de la Rosa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. would later go on to ignore the protocol on the grounds that the U.S. representatives had over-reached their authority in agreeing to it.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Treaty of Mesilla, which concluded the Gadsden purchase of 1854, had significant implications for the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Article II of the treaty annulled article XI of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and article IV further annulled articles VI and VII of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Article V however reaffirmed the property guarantees of Guadalupe Hidalgo, specifically those contained within articles VIII and IX.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the sale of land, the treaty also provided for the recognition of the Rio Grande as the boundary between the state of Texas and Mexico.[32] The land boundaries were established by a survey team of appointed Mexican and American representatives,[24] and published in three volumes as The United States and Mexican Boundary Survey. On 30 December 1853, the countries by agreement altered the border from the initial one by increasing the number of border markers from 6 to 53.[24] Most of these markers were simply piles of stones.[24] Two later conventions, in 1882 and 1889, further clarified the boundaries, as some of the markers had been moved or destroyed.[24] Photographers were brought in to document the location of the markers. These photographs are in Record Group 77, Records of the Office of the Chief Engineers, in the National Archives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe southern border of California was designated as a line from the junction of the Colorado and Gila rivers westward to the Pacific Ocean, so that it passes one Spanish league south of the southernmost portion of San Diego Bay. This was done to ensure that the United States received San Diego and its excellent natural harbor, without relying on potentially inaccurate designations by latitude.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe treaty extended the choice of U.S. citizenship to Mexicans in the newly purchased territories, before many African Americans, Asians and Native Americans were eligible. If they chose to, they had to declare to the U.S. government within a year the Treaty was signed; otherwise, they could remain Mexican citizens, but they would have to relocate. [5] Between 1850 and 1920, the U.S. Census counted most Mexicans as racially \\"white\\".[33] Nonetheless, racially tinged tensions persisted in the era following annexation, reflected in such things as the Greaser Act in California, as tens of thousands of Mexican nationals suddenly found themselves living within the borders of the United States. Mexican communities remained segregated de facto from and also within other U.S. communities, continuing through the Mexican migration right up to the end of the 20th century throughout the Southwest.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunity property rights in California are a legacy of the Mexican era. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be kept inviolate. The early Californians felt compelled to continue the community property system regarding the earnings and accumulation of property during a marriage, and it became incorporated into the California constitution.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nBorder disputes continued.  The U.S.'s desire to expand its territory continued unabated and Mexico's economic problems persisted,[35] leading to the controversial Gadsden Purchase in 1854 and William Walker's Republic of Lower California filibustering incident in that same year.[citation needed]  The Channel Islands of California and Farallon Islands are not mentioned in the Treaty.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe border was routinely crossed by the armed forces of both countries. Mexican and Confederate troops often clashed during the American Civil War, and the U.S. crossed the border during the war of French intervention in Mexico.  In March 1916 Pancho Villa led a raid on the U.S. border town of Columbus, New Mexico, which was followed by the Pershing expedition.  The shifting of the Rio Grande would much later cause a dispute over the boundary between purchase lands and those of the state of Texas, called the Country Club Dispute.[citation needed] Controversy over community land grant claims in New Mexico persists to this day.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nDisputes about whether to make all this new territory into free states or slave-holding states contributed heavily to the rise in North-South tensions that led to the American Civil War just over a decade later. The treaty was leaked to John Nugent before the U.S. Senate could approve it. Nugent published his article in the New York Herald and, afterward, was questioned by Senators. Nugent did not reveal his source.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo led to the establishment in 1889 of the International Boundary and Water Commission to maintain the border, and pursuant to newer treaties to allocate river waters between the two nations, and to provide for flood control and water sanitation.  Once viewed as a model of international cooperation, in recent decades the IBWC has been heavily criticized as an institutional anachronism, by-passed by modern social, environmental and political issues.[38]","input":"When did the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo happen?"},{"output":"along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in the Middle East","context":"A river civilization or river culture is an agricultural nation or civilization situated beside and drawing sustenance from a river. A river gives the inhabitants a reliable source of water for drinking and agriculture. Additional benefits include fishing, fertile soil due to annual flooding, and ease of transportation. The first great civilizations all grew up in river valleys.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCivilization first began in 3500 BCE, which along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in the Middle East; the name given to that civilization, Mesopotamia, means \\"land between the rivers\\". The Nile valley in Egypt had been home to agricultural settlements as early as 5500 BCE, but the growth of Egypt as a civilization began around 3100 BCE. A third civilization grew up along the Indus River around 2600 BCE, in parts of what are now India and Pakistan. The fourth great river civilization emerged around 1700 BCE along the Yellow River in China, also known as the Huang-He River Civilization.[1][2]\\r\\nCivilizations tended to grow up in river valleys for a number of reasons. The most obvious is access to a usually reliable source of water for agriculture and human needs. Plentiful water, and the enrichment of the soil due to annual floods, made it possible to grow excess crops beyond what was needed to sustain an agricultural village. This allowed for some members of the community to engage in non-agricultural activities such as construction of buildings and cities (the root of the word \\"civilization\\"), metal working, trade, and social organization.[3][4] Boats on the river provided an easy and efficient way to transport people and goods, allowing for the development of trade and facilitating central control of outlying areas.[5]\\r\\nMesopotamia was the earliest river valley civilization, starting to form around 3500 BCE. The civilization was created after regular trading started relationships between multiple cities and states around the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Mesopotamian cities became self-run civil governments. One of the cities within this civilization, Uruk, was the first literate society in history. Eventually, they all joined together to irrigate the two rivers in order to make their dry land fertile for agricultural growth. The increase in successful farming in this civilization allowed population growth throughout the cities and states within Mesopotamia.[6]\\r\\nEgypt also created irrigation systems from its local river, the Nile River, more intricate than previous systems. The Egyptians would rotate legumes with cereal which would stop salt buildup from the fresh water and enhance the fertility of their fields. The Nile River also allowed easier travel among the civilization, eventually resulting in the creation of two kingdoms in the north and south areas of the river until both were unified into one society by 3000 BCE.[7]\\r\\nMuch of the history of the Indus valley civilization, discovered in the 1920s, is unknown. Discovered in the 1920s, Harappan society remains a mystery because the Harappan system of writing has not yet been deciphered. It was larger than either Egypt or Mesopotamia. Historians have found no evidence of violence or a ruling class; there are no distinctive burial sites and there is not a lot of evidence to suggest a formal military. However, historians believe that the lack of knowledge about the ruling class and the military is mainly due to the inability to read Harappan writing.[8]\\r\\nThe Yellow River (Huang He) area became settled around 4000 BC.[9] Many tribes settled along the river, sixth longest in the world, which was distinguished by its heavy load of yellow silt and its periodic devastating floods. Recorded Chinese history begins with the first great wall, the Xia Dynasty, which went through the Yellow River valley from 2100 to 1600 BC. A major impetus for the tribes to unite into a single kingdom was the desire to find a solution to the frequent deadly floods. The Xia dug canals to channel excess water away from the area, resulting in a strong civilization with bountiful harvests and powerful leaders.

The aircraft was described as airworthy at the time of the accident.[3]\\r\\nThe captain was Benjamin Adekunle Adebayo, a 48 year old Nigerian with a total flying experience of 10,050 hours with 1,900 of them on the DC-9. He had his last simulator training at Pan Am International Flight Academy in Miami on 7 July 2005. The first officer was Gerad Yakubu Andan, a 33 year old Ghanaian with a total flying experience of 920 hours which 670 hours were on the type. He had his last simulator training on August 2005 with a result of 'satisfying'.[4]\\r\\nAll seven crew members and 101 of the 103 passengers died in the crash, or later from their injuries. The two surviving passengers Kechi Okwuchi and Bunmi Amusan were seriously injured. Many passengers survived the initial impact and died in the resulting fire. Port Harcourt Airport had one fire truck and no ambulances.[5][6]\\r\\nAmong the passengers were about sixty-one secondary school students from Loyola Jesuit College in the Federal Capital Territory region of Nigeria.[7] At first Loyola Jesuit College students from Port Harcourt traveled between school and their homes via buses using the roads. Rising crime along roads during the 1990s made parents believe that road travel was too dangerous. In 2001, when Sosoliso Airlines began services between Port Harcourt and Abuja parents placed their children on the flights.[2]\\r\\nAmong the victims were two volunteers for Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders en route to work in Port Harcourt, Hawah Kamara and Thomas Lamy, as well as televangelist Bimbo Odukoya, pastor of the Fountain of Life Church, who succumbed to her injuries the day after the accident.[8][9] Pastor Odukoya's personal assistant, Bunmi Amusan (now Bunmi Adams) survived the plane crash and got married a year later.[10]\\r\\nThe other survivor, Okwuchi, was badly burned and treated at Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa as of 14 December 2005,[11] and at Shriners Hospitals for Children in Galveston, Texas, United States as of 6 September 2007.[12] Kechi later went on to take part in the twelfth season of America's Got Talent in 2017 as a singer.\\r\\nThe Nigerian Accident Investigation Bureau found out that the data from satellite imagery by Boeing Aircraft Company in USA suggested that at 13:00 UTC, a sea breeze front, possibly reinforced by an outflow, pushed inland in the vicinity of Port Harcourt. The leading edge of the boundary, in theory, could have included an abrupt increase in wind speed and significant horizontal and/or vertical windshear. Rain showers and thunderstorm was also likely occurred as warm and moist air were lifted into the atmosphere.[13]\\r\\nData from Nigerian Meteorological Agency showed that there was a change in the wind speed and direction as the aircraft approached the airport. The weather was deteriorating fast, and visibility was limited. The change of wind speed and direction created a perfect environment for wind-shear occurring in the airport.[13]\\r\\nAs the Flight Data Recorder and the Cockpit Voice Recorder were retrieved by investigators, it was revealed that both black boxes had been damaged. The FDR had a slight damage, and was downloaded by investigators in a file. However, the situation was different for the CVR. The CVR coaxial spools were under tension during its normal operating flight. When the tape was severed, the spool would have spun freely which resulted in the release of additional tape into the transport area. There were some problems with both black boxes, but the data was filtered several times until the audio became reasonably intelligible.[13]\\r\\nFrom the FDR data, it was revealed that the flight was uneventful until its final approach. Thirty seconds before the crash, the aircraft descended for seven seconds and leveled off at an altitude of 204?ft, which was below the Decision Altitude of 307?ft. The airspeed then decreased to 145 knots. A few seconds later, there was an increase of speed to 151 knots, indicating that flight crew called for a go-around and initiated it. However, the aircraft had descended well below 204?ft and headed to the left. The crew was unable to recover the plane, and the data ceased functioning when the aircraft speed was at 160 knots.[13]\\r\\nFrom the CVR data, 16 seconds before the crash, the Captain called for a go-around, gear up and flaps before the crash. A warning horn then sounded followed by a 'too low gear' aural sound. Apparently, the pilots had difficulty in sighting the runway and should have carried a missed approach on the Decision Altitude of 307?ft instead of continuing descent below 204?ft. The flaps were retracted and the gear was extended. But the gear was locked. The 'too low gear' warning then appeared again, and a Ground Proximity Warning System followed.[13]\\r\\nInvestigators conducted an interview with an eyewitness of the crash. The eyewitness was a Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) security guard stationed about 1?km from the runway. He stated that the conditions at the airport were dark skies and light precipitation. He saw the aircraft coming and stated that the aircraft was not stable as it passed over him. He further stated that the approach lights were not on and everywhere was dark and raining. Seconds later, he heard a loud bang, with fire and thick smoke. Another eyewitness, a Sosoliso Airlines pilot departing to Enugu, also reported adverse weather condition in the airport. Firemen in the airport handling the crash also stated bad weather conditions were present, and they were forced to reposition their equipment due to high wind. This implies that the flight crew wasn't prepared to execute a missed approach at the decision altitude as the aircraft descended below the decision altitude. Apparently, the crew didn't follow the right procedure for a missed approach. Even if they conducted a recovery from adverse weather associated with windshear, the procedure adopted by the crew was improper.[13]\\r\\nNigeria Accident Investigation Bureau finally concluded that the probable cause of the crash was due to the crew's decision to continue the approach beyond the Decision Altitude without having the runway in sight. The adverse weather condition was listed as a contributing factor.[13]\\r\\nAndy and Ify Ilabor, the parents of crash victims Chuka, Nkem, and Busonma \\"Buso\\" Ilabor, started a foundation called the Ilabor Angels to assist orphans and AIDS victims.[5]\\r\\nLoyola Jesuit dedicated a Memorial Hall to the deceased students.[5]\\r\\nThe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) mandates that each family of an air crash victim is entitled to only 3?million naira or US$18,157 from the airline. In January 2009 Harold Demuren, the director general of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), said that the families of the air crash victims would be compensated and that Sosoliso had already paid $2.3 million into an escrow account to compensate the families.[14]\\r\\nCoordinates: 447N 700E? / ?4.783N 7.000E? / 4.783; 7.000","input":"Who were the survivors of the sosoliso plane crash?"},{"output":"Granada Hills National Little League","context":"The 1963 Little League World Series took place between August 20 and August 24 in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.

Immediately fearing the worst and anxious that a royal attack by King Louis XVI was imminent, the deputies congregated in a nearby indoor Jeu de paume court in the Saint-Louis district of the city of Versailles, near the Palace of Versailles.\\r\\nThere, 576 of the 577 members from the Third Estate took a collective oath \\"not to separate, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the constitution of the kingdom is established\\".[2] The only person who did not join was Joseph Martin-Dauch from Castelnaudary, who would only execute decisions made by the king.[3]\\r\\nBefore the Revolution, French societyaside from royaltywas divided into three Estates. The First Estate comprised the clergy; the Second Estate was the nobility. The entire rest of Francesome 97% of the populationwas the Third Estate, which ranged from very wealthy city merchants to impoverished rural farmers. The three estates met from time to time in the Estates General, a legislative assembly.[4]\\r\\nAlthough the Third Estate was the overwhelming majority of the French population, the makeup of the Estates General was such that the Third Estate comprised a bare majority of the delegates.[citation needed] A simple majority was sufficientas long as the delegates' votes were cast all together. The First and Second Estates preferred to divide the vote in some way. A proposal might need to receive approval from each Estate, or there might be two \\"houses\\" of the Estates General (one for the first two Estates, and one for the Third), and a bill would need to be passed by both houses. Either way, the First and Second Estate could exercise veto power over proposals enjoying widespread support among the Third Estate, but not the others, such as reforms that threatened the privileges of the nobility and clergy.[clarification needed]\\r\\nThis oath would come to have major significance in the revolution as the Third Estate would constantly continue to protest to have more representation.[5] Some historians have argued that, given political tensions in France at that time, the deputies' fears, even if wrong, were reasonable and that the importance of the oath goes above and beyond its context.[6]\\r\\nThe oath was both a revolutionary act, and an assertion that political authority derived from the people and their representatives rather than from the monarch himself. Their solidarity forced Louis XVI to order the clergy and the nobility to join with the Third Estate in the National Assembly in order to give the illusion that he controlled the National Assembly.[1] This oath would prove vital to the Third Estate as a step of protest that would eventually lead to more power in the Estates General, and every governing body thereafter.[7]\\r\\nThe Oath signified for the first time that French citizens formally stood in opposition to Louis XVI, and the National Assembly's refusal to back down forced the king to make concessions. It was foreshadowed by, and drew considerably from, the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence, especially the preamble. The Oath also inspired a wide variety of revolutionary activity in the months afterwards, ranging from rioting across the French countryside to renewed calls for a written French constitution. Likewise, it reinforced the Assembly's strength and forced the King to formally request that voting occur based on head, not power.[citation needed] The Tennis Court Oath, which was taken in June 1789, preceded the 4 August 1789 abolition of feudalism and the 26 August 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen.\\r\\nCoordinates: 484804N 20726E? / ?48.8010N 2.1239E? / 48.8010; 2.1239","input":"What was the oath of the tennis court?"},{"output":"viceroy","context":"The viceroy (Limenitis archippus) is a North American butterfly that ranges through most of the contiguous United States as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. The westernmost portion of its range extends from the Northwest Territories along the eastern edges of the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada mountains, southwards into central Mexico. Its easternmost range extends along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America from Nova Scotia into Texas.[1]\\r\\nThe viceroy was named the state butterfly of Kentucky in 1990.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIts wings feature an orange and black pattern, and over most of its range it is a Mllerian mimic[3] with the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). The viceroy's wingspan is between 53 and 81?mm.[4] It can be distinguished from the monarch by its smaller size and the postmedian black line that runs across the veins on the hindwing.[4]\\r\\nIn Florida, Georgia, and the American Southwest, viceroys share the pattern of the queen (Danaus gilippus) and in Mexico they share the pattern of the soldier (Danaus eresimus). In all three areas, the local Danaus population mimic the coloration of the viceroy species. It was originally believed that the viceroy was a Batesian mimic of the three other species, and presumed edible or only mildly unpalatable to predators, but this has since proven not to be true.[3] In an experiment with both the monarch's and viceroy's wings removed, birds were discovered to think the viceroy was just as unpalatable as the monarchs.[3]\\r\\nThe caterpillar feeds on trees in the willow family Salicaceae, including willows (Salix), and poplars and cottonwoods (Populus). The caterpillars sequester the salicylic acid in their bodies, which makes them bitter, and upsets predators' stomachs. As further protection, the caterpillars, as well as their chrysalis stage, resemble bird droppings.[5]\\r\\nAdults are strictly diurnal, flying preferentially in the late morning and early afternoon.[6] Adult viceroys nectar on milkweeds, thistles and other common flowers.[5]\\r\\nAdult\\r\\nCaterpillar\\r\\nPupa\\r\\nThe world is divided into eight biogeographic areas called ecozones: Palearctic, Nearctic, Afrotropic, Neotropic, Australasia, Indo-Malaya, Oceania, and Antarctica. Palearctic includes most of Eurasia and North Africa while Nearctic includes most of North America. Limenitis butterfly wing patterns are much more diverse in the Nearctic than the Palearctic. Three lineages of mimetic butterflies occur in North America and the evolution of mimicry may have played a large role in the diversification of this group.[7] For butterflies to travel from the Palearctic region to the Nearctic region of the world, the migration must have occurred during a time period when Beringia, the land bridge between Eurasia and North America, was still above water.[8] Based on crude divergence rate calculations,[9] the colonization of the Nearctic Leminitis dates back approximately four million years.[7] Whether the migration event was a single or multiple occurrence event has a significant effect on how we look at the evolution of mimicry. A history of multiple migrations would suggest that speciation occurred before the evolution of mimicry, meaning mimicry was the result of speciation instead of the driver of speciation.\\r\\nHowever, much evidence supports that a single event colonization is the best explanation. One theory of Nearctic colonization states that the reason for the colonization was a larvae host plant shift. The position of the poplar admiral (L. populi), a Palearctic species, in a phylogenetic tree confirms that the poplar is the closest existing relative of the Nearctic taxa and is consistent with the theory that the host plant had a large effect on the evolution of North American admirals. Just like the wing-pattern of the Palearctic butterflies has little evidence of divergence, the host plant use of these species also shows no sign of divergence. These species only feed on different species of honeysuckle (Lonicera ssp.) The exception is the poplar that feeds exclusively on aspen (Populus tremulus of the willow family).[7] All North American Limenitis feed on members of the willow family as well, suggesting that an (ancestral host plant shift) expansion of a novel host plant across the Bering land bridge could have driven the colonization of the Nearctic. Species level phylogenies based on the mitochondrial gene COI and the gene EFI-ϫ of Nearctic and Palearctic species also indicate a single colonization of the Nearctic species.[7] The phylogenies produced indicate that a white-banded ancestor similar to the species L. arthemis.[10] established itself in North America and resulted in several major lineages, three of which involved mimicry independently of each other. Given the present monophyly of the Nearctic species, it is likely that a single migration and subsequent expansion of the population was the foundation of the Nearctic butterflies.\\r\\nColor warnings in viceroy butterflies have been shaped by natural selection in an evolutionary relationship between prey and predator.[11] The viceroy's main predators ÿ like many other butterflies ÿ consist mostly of birds.\\r\\nThe viceroy's wing color ranges from tawny orange (resembling monarchs) in the north to dark mahogany (resembling queens) in the south.[12] It has been argued that selective pressures from predators have given rise to \\"model switching\\"[12] in the viceroy, with each subspecies choosing to copy the color pattern of the locally dominant Danaine subspecies. When the monarch's breeding range overlaps with the viceroy, the viceroy will adopt the lighter shades of orange. Towards the south, the viceroy mostly displayed darker orange phenotypes in response to the larger population of queens. It is important to note that the differences between these two morphs is only the color of the wings and the line drawn through the viceroy's lower wings; other features, such as body size and wing-pattern elements, are identical.[12]\\r\\nIt had been long accepted that the viceroy practiced Batesian mimicry, with the monarch and the queen serving as models. Batesian mimicry is a type of defensive behavior in which a palatable species closely resembles unpalatable or toxic species to avoid predation.\\r\\nEarly experiments suggested that the viceroys use Batesian mimicry to defend themselves against predators. In these experiments, birds that had not been exposed to monarchs willingly ate viceroys, but those that had tasted the unpalatable monarch refused to touch the mimic.[13] In addition, when given the choice between a mimic and non-mimic after being exposed to an unpalatable model, avian predators never ate the viceroy mimic.[14]\\r\\nRecent research has argued that the viceroy may be unpalatable to avian predators. If that is the case, then the viceroy butterfly displays Mllerian mimicry, and both viceroy and monarch are co-mimics of each other.[15]\\r\\nSome literature suggests that the queen-viceroy may not be a good model-mimic pair for Batesian mimicry. Experimental evidence has shown that avian predators express aversion to the queen butterfly after being exposed to viceroys.[16] That the avian predators avoided the queen butterfly implies that the queen does not serve as a model and the viceroy as a parasitic mimic; rather, they may be Mllerian co-mimics.[16]\\r\\nWhen avian predators were exposed to butterfly abdomens without the wings, many avian predators rejected the viceroy after a single peck. Furthermore, they exhibited distress behavior similar to that displayed when eating other, known, unpalatable species.[15]\\r\\nInterestingly, when palatability was measured by looking at avian responses to butterfly abdomen, it was found that the viceroy butterfly was significantly more unpalatable than the queen.[15] The queen-viceroy relationship is too asymmetrical for them to be considered real co-mimics of each other. Instead, mathematical models have suggested that the queen enjoys the benefits of mimicry at the viceroy's expense, and that the model-mimic dynamic between the two should be switched.[15]\\r\\nIn light of this new interpretation, it has been speculated that different food plants in different geographical locations influence the palatability of the viceroy.[16] Further investigation is needed to clarify the relationship between the viceroy and its purported models.\\r\\nBased on phylogenic evidence, it is known that mimicry in the North American admirals was a driver of speciation. An essential condition for the evolution of mimicry was the presence and abundance of unpalatable models. Mimetic evolution also involved direct selection with the model acting as a \\"starting block\\" for the mimic to evolve against.[17] The drive behind this type of evolution must be predation. Eventually, the mimetic population undergoes phenotypic fixation, usually at a point where the wing pattern and colors of the mimic have reached the closest superficial resemblance of its model.[17] As these processes continued, the subspecies divergences began occurring as the mimetic species expanded their geographical range and began mimicking other species of butterfly. Determining what part of the butterfly genome controls wing color and pattern is also a major component that must be taken into account when trying to understand the evolution of mimicry. Each individual stripe or spot on a wing has a distinct identity that can be traced from species to species within a family.[18]\\r\\nA fascinating feature of pattern genetics is that the dramatic phenotypic changes are primarily due to small changes in the gene that determines the sizes and positions of pattern elements.[18] This discovery is in accord with the principal theory for the evolution of mimicry. The theory proposes that initial mimicry is achieved by a single mutation that has a large effect on the phenotype, which immediately gives the organism some protection, and is then refined by so-called modifier genes with lesser phenotypic effects.[18] Consequently, if the genes for wing pattern and color were normal functioning genes, a single mating would produce several phenyotypically different offspring, making the ability for mimicry to evolve very difficult.\\r\\nThis unique puzzle led to proposal of a possible supergene. A supergene is a tight cluster of loci that facilitate the co-segregation of adaptive variation, providing integrated control of complex adaptive phenotypes.[19] Different genomic rearrangements have tightened the genetic linkage between different color and pattern loci with complete suppression of recombination in experimental crosses in a 400,000 base section containing at least 18 genes.[19] This single supergene locus controls differences in a complex phenotype like wing coloration that can involve modifications of wing pattern, shape, and body color. Mimetic patterns have high fitness correlated to locally abundant wing patterns and low fitness when the offspring have recombinant, non-mimetic phenotypes.[19] This tight-linked area of wing pattern genes explains how mimetic phenotypes are not broken up during recombination during sexual reproduction.\\r\\nViceroys display geographic color polymorphism, which occurs when the viceroy butterflies are observed having different color forms in different regions of their territory. Color polymorphism is hypothesized to be affected by interaction between the viceroy, monarch and queen's overlapping environments. In the northern areas of their region, where monarchs predominate, viceroys are lighter, while in southern Florida, they are darker due to queens being more abundant than monarchs.[20]","input":"What are the little butterflies that look like monarchs?"},{"output":"over nine years","context":"","input":"How long was the russian war in afghanistan?"},{"output":"26 June 1997","context":"","input":"When was the first book in jk rowling's harry potter series published?"},{"output":"a Jew","context":"","input":"What is a person who practices judaism called?"},{"output":"eight","context":"Gandhi is a 1982 British-Indian epic historical drama film based on the life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, the leader of India's non-violent, non-cooperative independence movement against the United Kingdom's rule of the country during the 20th century. Gandhi was written by John Briley and produced and directed by Richard Attenborough. It stars Ben Kingsley in the title role.\\r\\nThe film covers Gandhi's life from a defining moment in 1893, as he is thrown off a South African train for being in a whites-only compartment, and concludes with his assassination and funeral in 1948. Although a practising Hindu, Gandhi's embracing of other faiths, particularly Christianity and Islam, is also depicted.\\r\\nGandhi was released in India on 30 November 1982, in the United Kingdom on 3 December, and in the United States on 10 December.[3] It was nominated for Academy Awards in eleven categories, winning eight, including Best Picture and Best Director for Attenborough, Best Actor for Ben Kingsley, and Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Briley. The film was screened retrospectively on 12 August 2016 as the Opening Film at the Independence Day Film Festival jointly presented by the Indian Directorate of Film Festivals and Ministry of Defence, commemorating 70th Indian Independence Day.[4][5] The screenplay of Gandhi is available as a published book.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 January 1948,[7]:18ÿ21 after an evening prayer, an elderly Gandhi is helped out for his evening walk to meet a large number of greeters and admirers. One visitor, Nathuram Godse, shoots him point blank in the chest. Gandhi exclaims, \\"Oh, God!\\", and then falls dead.\\r\\nIn 1893, the 23-year-old Gandhi is thrown off a South African train for being an Indian sitting in a first-class compartment despite having a first-class ticket.[8] Realising the laws are biased against Indians, he then decides to start a nonviolent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa. After numerous arrests and unwelcome international attention, the government finally relents by recognising some rights for Indians.[9]\\r\\nIn 1915, as a result of his victory in South Africa, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence, (Swaraj, Quit India) from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a nonviolent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment. The 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre is also depicted in the film.\\r\\nNevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. In 1930, Gandhi protests against the British-imposed salt tax via the highly symbolic Salt March. He also travels to London for a conference concerning Britain's possible departure from India; this, however, proves fruitless. After the Second World War,[10] Britain finally grants Indian independence.[11] Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. The country is subsequently divided by religion. It is decided that the northwest area and the eastern part of India (current-day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan. It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India,[12] but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nationwide violence. Horrified, Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops.[13] The fighting does stop eventually.\\r\\nGandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom (Godse) is involved in a conspiracy to assassinate him.[14] Gandhi is cremated and his ashes are scattered on the holy Ganga.[15] As this happens, viewers hear Gandhi in another voiceover from earlier in the film.\\r\\nThis film had been Richard Attenborough's dream project, although two previous attempts at filming had failed. In 1952, Gabriel Pascal secured an agreement with the Prime Minister of India (Pandit Nehru) to produce a film of Gandhi's life. However, Pascal died in 1954 before preparations were completed.[16]\\r\\nIn 1962 Attenborough was contacted by Motilal Kothari, an Indian-born civil servant working with the Indian High Commission in London and a devout follower of Gandhi. Kothari insisted that Attenborough meet him to discuss a film about Gandhi.[17][18] Attenborough agreed, after reading Louis Fischer's biography of Gandhi and spent the next 18 years attempting to get the film made. He was able to meet prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter Indira Gandhi through a connection with Lord Louis Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India. Nehru approved of the film and promised to help support its production, but his death in 1964 was one of the film's many setbacks. Attenborough would dedicate the film to the memory of Kothari, Mountbatten, and Nehru.\\r\\nDavid Lean and Sam Spiegel had planned to make a film about Gandhi after completing The Bridge on the River Kwai, reportedly with Alec Guinness as Gandhi. Ultimately, the project was abandoned in favour of Lawrence of Arabia (1962).[19] Attenborough reluctantly approached Lean with his own Gandhi project in the late 1960s, and Lean agreed to direct the film and offered Attenborough the lead role. Instead Lean began filming Ryan's Daughter, during which time Motilai Kothari had died and the project fell apart.[20]\\r\\nAttenborough again attempted to resurrect the project in 1976 with backing from Warner Brothers. Then prime minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India and shooting would be impossible. Co-producer Rani Dube persuaded prime minister Indira Gandhi to provide the first $10 million from the National Film Development Corporation of India, chaired by D. V. S. Raju at that time, on the back of which the remainder of the funding was finally raised.[21][22] Finally in 1980 Attenborough was able to secure the remainder of the funding needed to make the film. Screenwriter John Briley had introduced him to Jake Eberts, the chief executive at the new Goldcrest production company that raised approximately two-thirds of the film's budget.\\r\\nShooting began on 26 November 1980 and ended on 10 May 1981. Over 300,000 extras were used in the funeral scene, the most for any film according to Guinness World Records.[23]\\r\\nDuring pre-production, there was much speculation as to who would play the role of Gandhi.[24][25] The choice was Ben Kingsley, who is partly of Indian heritage (his father was Gujarati and his birth name is Krishna Bhanji).[26]\\r\\nGandhi premiered in New Delhi, India on 30 November 1982. Two days later, on 2 December, it had a Royal Premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London[27] in the presence of Prince Charles and Princess Diana.[28][29] The film had a limited release in the US on 8 December 1982, followed by a wider release in January 1983.[2]\\r\\nIn North America, Gandhi grossed a total of US$52,767,889.[2] It became the 12th highest-grossing film of 1982 there.[30]\\r\\nOutside of North America, the film grossed US$75 million in the rest of the world. It was the year's third highest-grossing film outside of North America.[2]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the film grossed S22.3?million[31] ($38,955,367).[32] It was the year's highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom, and is one of the top ten highest-grossing British independent films of all time.[31]\\r\\nIn India, it was one of the highest-grossing films of all-time (and the highest for a foreign film) during the time of its release by earning over ?100 crore or 1?billion rupees. At today's exchange rate, that amounts to US$14.9 million, still making it one of the highest-grossing imported films in the country. It was shown tax free in Bombay (known as Mumbai since 1995) and Delhi.[33]\\r\\nReviews were broadly positive not only domestically (in India) but also internationally.[33] The film was discussed or reviewed in Newsweek,[24] Time,[34] the Washington Post,[35][36] The Public Historian,[37] Cross Currents,[38] The Journal of Asian Studies,[39] Film Quarterly,[40] The Progressive,[41] The Christian Century[41] and elsewhere.[42] Ben Kingsley's performance was especially praised. Among the few who took a more negative view of the film, historian Lawrence James called it \\"pure hagiography\\"[43] while anthropologist Akhil Gupta said it \\"suffers from tepid direction and a superficial and misleading interpretation of history.\\"[44] The film was also criticised by some right-wing commentators who objected to the film's advocacy of nonviolence, including Pat Buchanan, Emmett Tyrrell, and especially Richard Grenier.[41][45]\\r\\nIn Time, Richard Schickel wrote that in portraying Gandhi's \\"spiritual presence...

Sir Richard Attenborough's Gandhi is one of them.\\"[24] The movie \\"deals with a subject of great importance... with a mixture of high intelligence and immediate emotional impact... [and] Ben Kingsley... gives what is possibly the most astonishing biographical performance in screen history.\\" Kroll stated that the screenplay's \\"least persuasive characters are Gandhi's Western allies and acolytes\\" such as an English cleric and an American journalist, but that \\"Attenborough's 'old-fashioned' style is exactly right for the no-tricks, no-phony-psychologizing quality he wants.\\"[24] Furthermore, Attenborough\\r\\nmounts a powerful challenge to his audience by presenting Gandhi as the most profound and effective of revolutionaries, creating out of a fierce personal discipline a chain reaction that led to tremendous historical consequences. At a time of deep political unrest, economic dislocation and nuclear anxiety, seeing \\"Gandhi\\" is an experience that will change many minds and hearts.[24]\\r\\nAccording to the Museum of Broadcast Communications there was \\"a cycle of film and television productions which emerged during the first half of the 1980s, which seemed to indicate Britain's growing preoccupation with India, Empire and a particular aspect of British cultural history\\".[48] In addition to Gandhi, this cycle also included Heat and Dust (1983), Octopussy (1983), The Jewel in the Crown (1984), The Far Pavilions (1984) and A Passage to India (1984).\\r\\nPatrick French negatively reviewed the film, writing in The Telegraph:\\r\\n\\"An important origin of one myth about Gandhi was Richard Attenboroughs 1982 film. Take the episode when the newly arrived Gandhi is ejected from a first-class railway carriage at Pietermaritzburg after a white passenger objects to sharing space with a coolie (an Indian indentured labourer). In fact, Gandhi's demand to be allowed to travel first-class was accepted by the railway company. Rather than marking the start of a campaign against racial oppression, as legend has it, this episode was the start of a campaign to extend racial segregation in South Africa. Gandhi was adamant that respectable Indians should not be obliged to use the same facilities as raw Kaffirs. He petitioned the authorities in the port city of Durban, where he practised law, to end the indignity of making Indians use the same entrance to the post office as blacks, and counted it a victory when three doors were introduced: one for Europeans, one for Asiatics and one for Natives.\\"[49]\\r\\nRichard Grenier in his 1983 article, The Gandhi Nobody Knows, which was also the title of the book of the same name and topic, also criticised the film, arguing it misportrayed him as a \\"saint\\". He also alleged the Indian government admitted to financing about a third of the film's budget.[50] Grenier's book later became an inspiration for G. B. Singh's book Gandhi: Behind the Mask of Divinity. Parts of the book also discuss the film negatively. Singh, a long term critic of Gandhi, also went on to co-author Gandhi Under Cross Examination with Timothy Watson.\\r\\nIn the DVD edition of the 1998 film Jinnah, the director's commentary of the film makes mention of the 1982 film. In the commentary, both Sir Christopher Lee, who portrayed the older Muhammed Ali Jinnah, and director Jamil Dehlavi criticised the film Gandhi for its portrayal of Jinnah, arguing it to be demonising and historically inaccurate.\\r\\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 53 reviews and judged 85% of them to be positive, with an average rating of 8/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Director Richard Attenborough is typically sympathetic and sure-handed, but it's Ben Kingsley's magnetic performance that acts as the linchpin for this sprawling, lengthy biopic.\\"[51] Metacritic gave the film a score of 79 out of 100 based on 16 critical reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[52] CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare \\"A+\\" grade.[53] In 2010, the Independent Film & Television Alliance selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years[54]","input":"How many oscars did the movie gandhi won?"},{"output":"George Washington","context":" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President of the United States is the elected head of state and head of government of the United States. The president leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The president is indirectly elected to a four-year term by the people through the Electoral College.\\r\\nSince the office was established in 1789, 44 men have served as president. The first, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College. Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms in office, and is counted as the nation's 22nd and 24th presidents; the incumbent, Donald Trump, is therefore the 45th president. There are currently five living former presidents. The most recent death of a former president was on December 26, 2006 with the death of Gerald Ford.\\r\\nWilliam Henry Harrisons presidency was the shortest in American history. He died 31 days after taking office in 1841. Franklin D. Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms. Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.[1]\\r\\nOf the elected presidents, four died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon). John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with his own presidency, as opposed to a caretaker president. The Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution put Tyler's precedent into law in 1967. It also established a mechanism by which a mid-term vacancy in the vice presidency could be filled. Richard Nixon was the first president to fill a vacancy under this Provision when he appointed Gerald Ford to the office. Later, Ford became the second to do so when he appointed Nelson Rockefeller to succeed him. Previously, a mid-term vacancy was left unfilled.\\r\\nThroughout most of its history, American politics has been dominated by political parties. The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, there were no parties. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, factions began rallying around dominant Washington Administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Greatly concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never affiliated with a political party.[2] Since Washington, every president has been affiliated with a political party at the time they assumed office.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFour presidents held other high U.S. federal offices after leaving the presidency.\\r\\nSeveral presidents campaigned unsuccessfully for other U.S. state or federal elective offices after leaving the presidency.\\r\\nAdditionally, one former president, John Tyler, served in the government of the Confederate States during the American Civil War. Tyler served in the Provisional Confederate Congress from 1861 to 1862. He was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives in November 1861, but died before he could take his seat.","input":"Who was the 1st president of the us?"},{"output":"Chicago-based Montgomery Ward","context":"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, popularly known as \\"Santa's ninth reindeer\\", is a fabled reindeer created by Robert Lewis May. Rudolph is usually depicted as the lead reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve, though he is a young buck who has only adolescent antlers and a glowing red nose. Though he receives scrutiny for it, the luminosity of his nose is so great that it illuminates the team's path through harsh winter weather.\\r\\nRudolph first appeared in a 1939 booklet written by Robert L. May and published by Montgomery Ward, the department store.[1][2][3]\\r\\nThe story is owned by The Rudolph Company, LP and has been adapted in numerous forms including a popular song, the iconic 1964 television special and sequels, and a feature film and sequel. Character Arts, LLC manages the licensing for the Rudolph Company, LP. In many countries, Rudolph has become a figure of Christmas folklore. 2014 marked the 75th anniversary of the character[4] and the 50th anniversary of the television special.[5] A series of postage stamps featuring Rudolph was issued by the United States Postal Service on November 6, 2014.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert L. May created Rudolph in 1939 as an assignment for Chicago-based Montgomery Ward. The retailer had been buying and giving away coloring books for Christmas every year and it was decided that creating their own book would save money. May considered naming the reindeer \\"Rollo\\" or \\"Reginald\\" before deciding upon using the name \\"Rudolph.\\"[8] In its first year of publication, Montgomery Ward distributed 2.4 million copies of Rudolph's story.[9] The story is written as a poem in anapestic tetrameter, the same meter as \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\\" (also known as \\"'Twas the Night Before Christmas\\").[citation needed] Publication and reprint rights for the book Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer are controlled by Pearson PLC.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhile May was pondering how best to craft a Christmas story about a reindeer, while staring out his office window in downtown Chicago, a thick fog from Lake Michigan blocked his viewgiving him a flash of inspiration. \\"Suddenly I had it!\\" he recalled. \\"A nose! A bright red nose that would shine through fog like a spotlight.\\"[10]\\r\\nThe cultural significance of a red nose has changed since the story's publication. In 1930's popular culture, a bright red nose was closely associated with chronic alcoholism and drunkards, so the story idea was initially rejected. May asked his illustrator friend at Montgomery Ward, Denver Gillen, to draw \\"cute reindeer\\", using zoo deer as models. The alert, bouncy character Gillen developed convinced management to support the idea.[11]\\r\\nMaxton Books published the first mass-market edition of Rudolph in 1947[citation needed] and a sequel, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer Shines Again, in 1954.[citation needed] In 1992, Applewood Books published Rudolph's Second Christmas, an unpublished sequel that Robert May wrote in 1947.[citation needed] In 2003, Penguin Books issued a reprint version of the original Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer with new artwork by Lisa Papp.[citation needed] Penguin also reprinted May's sequels, Rudolph Shines Again and Rudolph's Second Christmas (now retitled Rudolph to the Rescue).[12]\\r\\nThe story chronicles the experiences of Rudolph, a youthful reindeer buck (male) who possesses an unusual luminous red nose. Mocked and excluded by his peers because of this trait, Rudolph proves himself one Christmas Eve with poor visibility due to inclement weather after Santa Claus catches sight of Rudolph's nose and asks Rudolph to lead his sleigh for the evening. Rudolph agrees and is finally favored by his fellow reindeer for his heroism and accomplishment.\\r\\nRudolph made his first screen appearance in 1948, in a cartoon short produced by Max Fleischer for the Jam Handy Corporation that was more faithful to May's original story than Marks' song, which had not yet been written.[13] It was reissued in 1951 with the song added.[13]\\r\\nMay's brother-in-law, Johnny Marks, adapted the story of Rudolph into a song. Gene Autry's recording of the song hit No. 1 on the Billboard pop singles chart the week of Christmas 1949. Autry's recording sold 2.5 million copies the first year, eventually selling a total of 25 million, and it remained the second best-selling record of all time until the 1980s.[14]\\r\\nDC Comics, then known as National Periodical Publications, published a series of 13 annuals titled Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer from 1950 to 1962.[15][16] Rube Grossman drew most of the 1950s stories.[17]\\r\\nIn 1972, DC Comics published a 14th edition in an extra-large format. Subsequently, they published six more in that format: Limited Collectors' Edition C-24, C-33, C-42, C-50[18] and All-New Collectors' Edition C-53, C-60.[19]\\r\\nAdditionally, one digest format edition was published as The Best of DC #4 (MarchÿApril 1980).[20] The 1970s Rudolph stories were written and drawn by Sheldon Mayer.[21][22]\\r\\nIn 1958, Little Golden Books published an illustrated storybook, adapted by Barbara Shook Hazen and illustrated by Richard Scarry. The book, similar in story to the Max Fleischer cartoon short, is no longer in print,[citation needed] but a revised Little Golden Books version of the storybook was reissued in 1972.\\r\\nPerhaps the most well-known version of all the Rudolph adaptations is the Rankin/Bass Productions version of 1964.[citation needed] Filmed in Japan, with all sound recordings done in Toronto, Canada, the show premired on NBC. As the producers of the special only had the song as source material and did not have a copy of the original book, they interpolated an original story around the central narrative of the song, one that differed from the book. This re-telling chronicles Rudolph's social rejection among his peers and his decision to run away from home. Rudolph is accompanied by a similarly outcast elf named Hermey, who skipped elf practice to become a dentist, along with a loud, boisterous, eager prospector named Yukon Cornelius who was in search of wealth. Additional original characters include Rudolph's love interest, Clarice; the antagonistic \\"Abominable Snow Monster\\"; and, as narrator, the living Sam the Snowman, voiced by Burl Ives.\\r\\nIn the 1964 stop-motion movie, Rudolph is born to Donder the Reindeer and Donder's wife. He is discovered by Santa to have a shiny, glowing red nose. Donder, regardless of Rudolph's defect, trains him to be a normal reindeer with skills such as gathering food and hiding from the \\"Abominable Snow Monster\\", a giant, furry white beast. To hide Rudolph's nose, Donder puts dirt on it to cover it with a black coating. This causes Rudolph to talk in a funny accent, as told by the Rudolph's peers. A short time later, Rudolph joins his peers at the Reindeer Games, where he meets Fireball, who is initially friendly and has a shock of strawberry blond hair on his head, and Clarice, a female spectator who takes a liking to Rudolph. Clarice's flirtation inspires Rudolph to perform better than all of his peers at flying, but in his excitement he knocks the black cover off his nose, revealing a red glow that causes Fireball and the others to turn against him; this distraction, in turn, prompts the coach (Comet) to ban Rudolph from the Reindeer Games. Clarice remains loyal to him, only to be ordered by her father not to shame the family by associating with \\"a red-nosed reindeer.\\"\\r\\nRudolph soon runs into Hermey, an elf who was forced out of his job at the North Pole's toy factory; Hermey showed a total lack of interest in the toymaking and singing aspects of being an elf and instead wanted to pursue dentistry. They come to the conclusion that they're both misfits and decide to run away together. On their aimless journey, they run into Yukon Cornelius, the self-described \\"greatest prospector of the North\\" who nevertheless seems to never find any silver or gold, and attempt to stay away from the Bumble, a huge abominable snow monster. Their journey leads them to the Island of Misfit Toys, where sentient but unorthodox toys go when they are abandoned by their owners. King Moonracer, the winged lion that lords over the Island, refuses to let them stay there permanently, instead telling the trio to return home and tell Santa Claus of the toys' plight, in exchange for one night's stay on the island. Rudolph refuses the offer and, fearing for his friends' life, runs off alone.\\r\\nA now older Rudolph, still unable to find a place in the world, returns home to the North Pole, only to find that his family and Clarice had left to look for him and are now about to be eaten by the Bumble. With the help of Hermey and Yukon (who arrived separately), they lure the Bumble away and pacify him by knocking him unconscious and allowing Hermey (with dental skills he has acquired by reading books) to remove his sharp teeth. Everyone eventually returns to Santa's workshop, where a dismayed Santa Claus breaks the bad news that the weather is too bad to take the sleigh out and that Christmas would be canceled. Santa changes his mind when he notices Rudolph's red nose and asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh team, which he happily accepts.\\r\\nAfter the story's initial broadcast, its closing credits were revised. Images of wrapped presents being dropped from Santa's sleigh were replaced by a scene in which Santa stops to pick up the Misfit Toys and delivers them to the homes of children below, where they were found by children who loved them. The changes were prompted by viewer feedback pleading for a happy ending for each toy. The special now airs annually on CBS, rather than NBC, and is hailed as a classic by many. The special's original assortment of characters have acquired iconic status, and an uncertainty surrounding an error in the special's copyright has allowed the special to be widely parodied and imitated in the decades since its original airing.\\r\\nThe sequel Rudolph's Shiny New Year (premier air date December 10, 1976) continued the reindeer's journeys, and the series was made into a trilogy with the 1979 feature-length film Christmas in July, which integrated the Rudolph universe into that of Rankin/Bass's adaptation of Frosty the Snowman.\\r\\nRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Movie (1998) is an animated feature film. It received only a limited theatrical release before debuting on home video. Its inclusion of a villain, a love interest, a sidekick, and a strong protector are more derivative of the Rankin/Bass adaptation of the story than the original tale and song (the characters of Stormella, Zoey, Arrow, Slyly, and Leonard parallel the Rankin/Bass characters of the Bumble, Clarice, Fireball, Hermey, and Yukon, respectively). The movie amplifies the early backstory of Rudolph's harassment by his schoolmates (primarily his cousin Arrow) during his formative years.\\r\\nGoodTimes Entertainment, the producers of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Movie, brought back most of the same production team for a CGI animated sequel, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys (2001). Unlike the previous film, the sequel featured the original characters from the Rankin/Bass special (as GoodTimes soon learned that Rankin/Bass had made a copyright error that made the characters unique to their special free to use).\\r\\nA live-action version of Rudolph (complete with glowing nose) along with Donder and Blitzen appears in the Doctor Who Christmas special, \\"Last Christmas\\" which was broadcast on BBC One on 25 December 2014.[23] In this special, Santa is able to park him like a car and turn off his nose.\\r\\nNathaniel Dominy, an anthropology professor at Dartmouth College (Robert L. May's alma mater), published a scholarly paper on Rudolph's red nose in the open access online journal Frontiers for Young Minds in 2015. In the paper, Dominy noted that reindeer eyes can perceive shorter wavelengths of light than humans, allowing them to see ultraviolet light; ultraviolet light, however, is much more easily scattered in fog, which would blind reindeer. Thus, Rudolph's red nose, emitting longer-wavelength red light, would penetrate the fog more easily. A summary of Dominy's findings was released in an Associated Press article on December 22.[24]\\r\\nThree BBC animations carry on the legend by introducing Rudolph's son, Robbie the Reindeer. However, Rudolph is never directly mentioned by name (references are replaced by the first and second films' villain Blitzen interrupting with the phrase, \\"Don't say that name!\\", or something similar, presumably for copyright reasons.)\\r\\nRudolph is also given a younger brother, Rusty Reindeer, in the American special, Holidaze: The Christmas That Almost Didn't Happen (2006). Unlike in the \\"Robbie the Reindeer\\" cartoons, Rudolph's name is mentioned in the film.\\r\\nMichael Fry and T. Lewis have given Rudolph another brother in a series of Over the Hedge comic strips: an overweight, emotionally damaged reindeer named Ralph, the Infra-Red nosed Reindeer, who is referred to as Rudolph's older brother. Ralph's red nose is good for defrosting Santa's sleigh and warming up toast and waffles; he enviously complains about his brother Rudolph's publicity and his own anonymity.","input":"What company originally created rudolph the red-nosed reindeer as a christmas promotion?"},{"output":"the 1980s","context":"","input":"When did the internet first become available to the public?"},{"output":"66 by 660 feet","context":"The acre is a unit of land area used in the imperial and US customary systems.

The most commonly used acre today is the international acre. In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use, but differ by only two parts per million; see below. The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land. One international acre is defined as exactly 4,046.8564224?square metres.\\r\\nAn acre was defined in the Middle Ages as the area of land that could be ploughed in one day by a yoke of oxen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne acre equals 0.0015625?square miles, 4,840?square yards, 43,560 square feet[1] or about 4,047 square metres (0.4047 hectares) (see below). While all modern variants of the acre contain 4,840?square yards, there are alternative definitions of a yard, so the exact size of an acre depends on which yard it is based. Originally, an acre was understood as a selion of land sized at forty perches (660?ft, or 1?furlong) long and four perches (66?ft) wide;[2] this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plough in one day. A square enclosing one acre is approximately 69.57?yards, or 208?feet 9?inches (63.63 metres) on a side. As a unit of measure, an acre has no prescribed shape; any area of 43,560?square feet is an acre.\\r\\nIn the international yard and pound agreement of 1959 the United States and five countries of the Commonwealth of Nations defined the international yard to be exactly 0.9144?metres.[3] Consequently, the international acre is exactly 4,046.8564224?square metres.\\r\\nBoth the international acre and the US survey acre contain ?1?640 of a square mile or 4,840?square yards, but alternative definitions of a yard are used (see survey foot and survey yard), so the exact size of an acre depends upon which yard it is based. The US survey acre is about 4,046.872609874252 square metres; its exact value (4046?13,525,426/15,499,969?m2) is based on an inch defined by 1?metre = 39.37?inches exactly, as established by the Mendenhall Order. Surveyors in the United States use both international and survey feet, and consequently, both varieties of acre.[4]\\r\\nSince the difference between the US survey acre and international acre is only about a quarter of the size of an A4 sheet of paper (0.016?square metres, 160 square centimetres or 24.8?square inches), it is usually not important which one is being discussed. Areas are seldom measured with sufficient accuracy for the different definitions to be detectable.[5]\\r\\nThe acre is commonly used by Antigua and Barbuda,[6] American Samoa,[7] the Bahamas,[8] Belize,[9] the British Virgin Islands,[10] the Cayman Islands,[11] Canada,[12] Dominica,[13] the Falkland Islands,[14] Grenada,[15] Ghana,[16] Guam,[17] the Northern Mariana Islands,[18] India,[citation needed] Sri Lanka,[citation needed] Bangladesh,[citation needed] Nepal,[citation needed] Ireland,[19] Jamaica,[20] Montserrat,[21] Myanmar,[citation needed] Pakistan,[citation needed] Samoa,[22] St. Lucia,[23] St. Helena,[24] St. Kitts and Nevis,[25] St. Vincent and the Grenadines,[26] Turks and Caicos,[27] the United Kingdom, the United States[citation needed] and the US Virgin Islands.[28]\\r\\nIn India, residential plots are measured in cents or decimal, which is one hundredth of an acre, or 435.60 square feet (40.469?m2).

The full field, including the end zones, covers about 1.32 acres (0.53?ha).\\r\\nFor residents of other countries, the acre might be envisioned as approximately half of a 105-m-long by 68-m-wide association football (soccer) pitch.\\r\\nIt may also be remembered as 44,000?square feet, less 1%.\\r\\nThe word \\"acre\\" is derived from Old English ?cer originally meaning \\"open field\\", cognate to west coast Norwegian ?kre and Swedish ?ker, German Acker, Dutch akker, Latin ager, Sanskrit ajr, and Greek ϫ?? (agros). In English, it was historically spelled aker.\\r\\nThe acre was roughly the amount of land tillable by a yoke of oxen in one day.[30] This explains one definition as the area of a rectangle with sides of length one chain and one furlong. A long, narrow strip of land is more efficient to plough than a square plot, since the plough does not have to be turned so often. The word \\"furlong\\" itself derives from the fact that it is one furrow long.\\r\\nBefore the enactment of the metric system, many countries in Europe used their own official acres. These were differently sized in different countries, for instance, the historical French acre was 4,221?square metres, whereas in Germany as many variants of \\"acre\\" existed as there were German states.\\r\\nStatutory values for the acre were enacted in England, and subsequently, the United Kingdom, by acts of:\\r\\nHistorically, the size of farms and landed estates in the United Kingdom was usually expressed in acres (or acres, roods, and perches), even if the number of acres was so large that it might conveniently have been expressed in square miles. For example, a certain landowner might have been said to own 32,000?acres of land, not 50?square miles of land.\\r\\nThe acre is related to the square mile, with 640?acres making up one square mile. One mile is 5280?feet (1760?yards). In western Canada and the western United States, divisions of land area were typically based on the square mile, and fractions thereof. If the square mile is divided into quarters, each quarter has a side length of ?1?2 mile (880?yards) and is ?1?4 square mile in area, or 160?acres. These subunits would typically then again be divided into quarters, with each side being ?1?4 mile long, and being ?1?16 of a square mile in area, or 40?acres. In the United States, farmland was typically divided as such, and the phrase \\"the back 40\\" would refer to the 40-acre parcel to the back of the farm.

Bunker, a main character of the series, is a World War II veteran, blue-collar worker, and family man. Described as a \\"lovable bigot\\", he was first seen by the American public when All in the Family premiered on January 12, 1971, where he was depicted as the head of the Bunker family. In 1979, the show was retooled and renamed Archie Bunker's Place; it finally went off the air in 1983. Bunker lived at the fictional address of 704 Hauser Street in the borough of Queens, in New York City.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in the Family got many of its laughs by playing on Archie's bigotry, although the dynamic tension between Archie and his liberal son-in-law, Mike, provided an ongoing political and social sounding board for a variety of topics. Archie appears in all but seven episodes of the series (three were missed because of a contract dispute between Carroll O'Connor and Norman Lear in Season 5).\\r\\n\\r\\nArchie was modeled after Norman Lear's father Herman Lear[1] and  on Alf Garnett from the BBC1 sitcom Till Death Us Do Part. In 1999, TV Guide ranked Archie Bunker number 5 on its 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time list.[2] In 2005, Archie Bunker was listed as number 1 on Bravo's 100 Greatest TV Characters,[3] defeating runners-up such as Ralph Kramden, Lucy Ricardo, Fonzie, and Homer Simpson. Archie's chair is in the permanent collection of the National Museum of American History.\\r\\n\\r\\nArchie has a gruff, overbearing demeanor, largely defined by his bigotry towards a diverse group of individualsblacks, Hispanics, \\"Commies\\", gays, hippies, Jews, Asians, Catholics, \\"women's libbers\\", and Polish-Americans are frequent targets of his barbs. As the show progresses, it becomes apparent that Archie's prejudice is not motivated by malice, but is rather a combination of the era and environment in which he was raised and a generalized misanthropy. Archie himself is depicted as a hard worker, loving father, and basically decent man; nevertheless, he is bad-tempered and frequently tells his long-suffering wife Edith to \\"stifle yourself\\" and \\"dummy up\\". Series creator Norman Lear admitted that this is how his father treated Lear's mother.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the series progressed, Archie mellowed somewhat, albeit often out of necessity. In one episode, he expresses revulsion for a Ku Klux Klan-like organization which he accidentally joins.[5] On another occasion, when asked to speak at the funeral of his friend Stretch Cunningham, Archiesurprised to learn that his friend was Jewishovercomes his initial discomfort and delivers a moving eulogy, closing with a heartfelt \\"Shalom\\". In 1978, the character became the guardian of Edith's stepcousin Floyd's nine-year-old daughter, Stephanie (Danielle Brisebois) and came to accept her Jewish faith, even buying her a Star of David pendant.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nArchie was also known for his frequent malapropisms and spoonerisms. For example, he refers to Edith's gynecologist as a \\"groinacologist\\" and to Catholic priests who go around sprinkling \\"incest\\" (incense) on their congregation. Archie repeatedly called Richard M. Nixon \\"Richard E. Nixon\\".  By the show's second season, these had become dubbed \\"Bunkerisms\\", \\"Archie Bunkerisms\\", or simply \\"Archie-isms\\".[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actor who played Bunker, Carroll O'Connor, is Irish Catholic, and Norman Lear modeled the character on his Jewish father, but Bunker's own ethnicity is never explicitly stated, other than identifying him as a WASP; over the course of the series, he mocks or belittles not just most minorities (including blacks, Hispanics, Latinos, Jews, and Asians), but also most white ethnic groups as well, including the English, Germans, Irish, and Polish.\\r\\n\\r\\nArchie, a Christian belonging to the Episcopalian denomination, often misquotes the Bible. He takes pride in being religious, although he rarely attends church services and constantly mispronounces the name of his minister, Reverend Felcher, as \\"Reverend Fletcher\\". (When Edith inevitably corrects him, he dismisses the error with \\"Whatever\\".)\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is a compulsive gambler, who, in earlier years, frequently lost his entire weekly paycheck in poker games, as related by Edith in 1973 episode \\"Archie the Gambler\\"; he quit only when Edith threatened to leave him, taking then three-year old Gloria with her.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe inspiration for Archie Bunker was Alf Garnett, the character from the BBC1 sitcom  Till Death Us Do Part, on which All in the Family was based.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen first introduced on All in the Family in 1971, Archie is the head of a family consisting of his wife Edith (Jean Stapleton), his adult daughter Gloria (Sally Struthers), and his liberal son-in-law, college student Michael \\"Mike\\" Stivic (Rob Reiner), with whom Archie disagrees on virtually everything; Archie frequently characterizes Mike as a \\"dumb Polack\\" and usually addresses him as \\"Meathead\\" because, in Archie's words, he is \\"dead from the neck up\\".  During the show's first five seasons, Mike and Gloria are living with Archie and Edith, so that Mike could put himself through college. Upon Mike's graduation, he and Gloria move into their own home next door, allowing Archie and Mike to interact nearly as much as they had when they were living in the same house.\\r\\n\\r\\nArchie was born on May 20, 1924 (EDIT: in the episode \\"Archie & the Miracle\\" Archie explains to Mike that he believes he has the winning church raffle ticket #18 because \\" the Lord saved me on the 18th, I was born on the 18th of the month...\\")  in Baltimore [10] to parents David and Sarah.[11] Information on his siblings is inconsistent, as three are mentioned, and Archie is seen talking on the phone to his younger brother Fred in \\"Cousin Oscar\\" (as well as Fred's daughter Debbie Marie), but during season 6 episode \\"Archie Finds a Friend\\", he states that he is an only child. Two later episodes (one during season 8 and another during season 9) feature Fred (played by Richard McKenzie) and it is now suggested that Fred is Archie's only sibling. Another of Fred's daughters, Linda, visited during the third season (she briefly dated the Bunkers' neighbor Lionel in \\"Lionel Steps Out\\"). Archie's father David is said to be the only child while his mother Sarah has one brother named Roy Longstreet that Archie liked more than his own parents.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo of Archie's cousins are depicted: Oscar, who dies off-camera in the Bunker house during a visit, and cousin Bertha (played by Peggy Rea, who appears in the same episode), apparently a somewhat distant cousin, as Archie does not recognize her.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nArchie celebrates his 50th birthday in a 1974 episode and the character is last seen on the final episode of Archie Bunker's Place, on April 4, 1983.[which?] He is a Taurus.[12] In Season 5, during a three-episode stretch where Archie's whereabouts are unknown, it is revealed that he attended Flushing High School and lettered in baseball.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile locked in the storeroom of Archie's Place with Mike, in the season 8 All in the Family episode \\"Two's a Crowd\\", a drunk Archie confides that as a child, his family was desperately poor, and he was teased in school because he wore one shoe on one foot and a boot on the other, so kids nicknamed him \\"Shoe-Booty\\". In the same episode, Mike learns that Archie was mentally and physically abused by his father, who was the source of his bigoted views. Yet, Archie then goes on to vehemently defend his father, who he claims loved him and taught him \\"to do good\\".  It is revealed that Archie's father was a brakeman for The Long Island Railroad, when Archie receives his father's pocket watch from his formerly long-estranged brother, Alfred (\\"Fred\\"), who later appeared in two All in the Family episodes, \\"Archie's Brother\\" and \\"The Return of Archie's Brother\\", and the Archie Bunker's Place episode \\"Father Christmas\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFred and Archie, as it is learned when Fred visits Archie in the \\"Archie's Brother\\" episode, had not seen each other in the 29 years since Archie and Edith's wedding, although they apparently had communicated over the years via phone (two early episodes -- \\"Cousin Oscar\\" and \\"Lionel Steps Out\\"depict phone conversations between Archie and Fred), their long estrangement fueled because of a petty argument, apparently out of a sibling rivalry of sorts going back to their childhood. Fred visits Archie for support, because he is about to go into the hospital for a major operation, and the two apparently seem to patch things up between them. However, in Fred's return trip to visit Archie and Edith, he arrives with a beautiful 18-year-old wife named Katherine. This leads to a heated discussion, which erupts into argument between Archie and Fred over MayÿSeptember romances and places another strain on the relationship between Archie and Fred, who storms angrily out of the Bunker home with his teen bride. Archie and Fred apparently are estranged for the next three-plus years. Putting a further strain on the relationship was the 1981 arrival of Fred's 18-year-old daughter, Barbara (\\"Billie\\") Denise Miller, who is also upset over her father's marriage to someone not even three years older than she is (although in Archie Bunker's Place, Billie begins dating someone 15 years her senior). Fred visits again for Christmas in 1982, finally revealing to everyone why he left his first wife and found love with Katherine.\\r\\n\\r\\nArchie is a World War II veteran who had been based in Foggia, Italy for 22 months. During a doctor's appointment it is stated that Archie had an undistinguished military record for his non-combat ground role in the Air Corps, later called the Army Air Forces, which at the time was a branch of the United States Army. Archie often insisted that he was a member of the Air Corps. He received the Good Conduct Medal,[13] and in the All in the Family episode \\"Archie's Civil Rights\\", it is disclosed he also received the Purple Heart for being hit in his buttocks by shrapnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe married Edith Bunker 22 years before the first season. Later recollections of their mid-1940s courtship do not result in a consistent timeline. On the flashback episode showing Mike and Gloria's wedding, Archie indicates to Mike that his courtship of Edith lasted two years and hints that their relationship was not consummated until a month after their wedding night. Edith elsewhere recollects that Archie fell asleep on their wedding night and blurts out that their sex life has not been very active in recent years. On another occasion, Edith reveals Archie's history of gambling addiction, which caused problems in the early years of their marriage.  Archie also reveals that when Edith was in labor with Gloria, he took her to Bayside Hospital on the Q5 bus because \\"the subway don't run to Bayside\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Edith, Archie's resentment of Mike stemmed primarily from the fact that Mike was attending college, while Archie had been forced to drop out of high school during the Great Depression to help support his family. Archie does not take advantage of the GI Bill to further his education, although he does attend night school to earn a high school diploma in 1973.[citation needed] Archie is also revealed to have been an outstanding baseball player in his youth: his dream was to pitch for the New York Yankees. He had to give up this dream when he left high school to enter the workforce. His uncle got him a job on a loading dock after World War II, and by the 1970s he was a foreman.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Protestant, Archie seldom attends church, despite professing strong Christian views. The original pilot mentions that in the 22 years Archie and Edith were married, Archie had only attended church seven times (including their wedding day) and that Archie had walked out of the sermon the most recent time, disgusted with the preacher's message (which he perceived as leftist).[citation needed]  Archie's religiosity often translates into knee-jerk opposition to atheism or agnosticism (which Mike and Gloria variously espoused), Catholicism (despite Carroll O'Connor being a devout Catholic), and, until late in the series, Judaism.\\r\\n\\r\\nArchie is a Republican[14] and an outspoken supporter of Richard Nixon, as well as an early (1976) supporter of Ronald Reagan, who correctly predicted Reagan's election in 1980. During the Vietnam War, Archie dismisses peace protesters as unpatriotic and has little good to say about the Civil Rights Movement. Despite having an adversarial relationship with his black neighbors, the Jeffersons, he forms an unlikely friendship with their son Lionel, who performs various odd jobs for the Bunkers and responds to Archie's patronizing racial views with sarcastic quips that usually go over Archie's head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe later spinoff series 704 Hauser features a new, black family moving into Bunker's old home. The series is set in 1994 but does not indicate whether Bunker, who would have been 70 by this time, is still alive. His now-adult grandson, Joey Stivic, appears briefly in the first episode of the series and references his grandfather, but doesn't state whether he's still alive at this point.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the name recognition and societal influence of the Bunker character that by 1972, commentators were discussing the \\"Archie Bunker vote\\" (i.e., the voting bloc comprising urban, white, working-class men) in that year's presidential election. In the same year, there was a parody election campaign, complete with T-shirts, campaign buttons, and bumper stickers, advocating \\"Archie Bunker for President\\".[15][16] In May 1973, RCA Records' trade advertisement for Archie and Edith's debut single, a recording of \\"Oh, Babe, What Would You Say?\\", carried the tagline \\"John and Yoko, move over\\", referring to the artist-activists John Lennon and Yoko Ono.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character's imprint on American culture is such that Archie Bunker's name was still being used in the media in 2008, to describe a certain group of voters who voted in that year's U.S. presidential election.[15][16] Commentating on BBC Newsnight, political commentator Conrad Black referred to Donald Trump as having secured the \\"Archie Bunker vote\\" during the 2016 presidential election.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorman Lear originally intended that Bunker be strongly disliked by audiences. Lear was shocked when Bunker quietly became a beloved figure to much of middle America. Lear thought that Bunker's opinions on race, sex, marriage, and religion were so wrong as to represent a parody of right-wing bigotry.\\r\\n\\r\\nSammy Davis, Jr., who was both black and Jewish, genuinely liked the character. He felt that Bunker's bigotry was based on his rough, working-class life experiences and that Bunker was honest and forthright in his opinions, showing an openness to changing his views if an individual treated him right. In 1972, Davis appeared in episode 21 of season 2 of All in the Family, and later appeared in episode 19 of season 1 of spin-off Archie Bunker's Place.\\r\\n\\r\\nBunker's racist and misogynistic views were the template for the creation of Eric Cartman, one of the characters in the adult animated sitcom South Park.[18]","input":"What was archie bunker's daughter's name?"},{"output":"Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt","context":"","input":"Who set up the first formal psychology lab in leipzig germany?"},{"output":"Daily Commercial News (now Lloyd's List Australia)","context":"There are 2 national and 10 state/territory daily newspapers, 35 regional dailies and 470 other regional and suburban newspapers in Australia.

However, its intrinsic activity at the receptor is quite weak, and on account of that, due to competition for binding with full agonists like testosterone, it can actually behave more like an antagonist depending on circulating testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, and hence, like an antiandrogen. However, its affinity for the receptor is very low, and for that reason, is unlikely to be of much significance under normal circumstances.[22][23]\\r\\nIn addition to its affinity for the androgen receptor, DHEA has also been found to bind to and activate the ERϫ and ER estrogen receptors with Ki values of 1.1 M and 0.5 M, respectively, and EC50 values of >1 M and 200 nM, respectively. Though it was found to be a partial agonist of the ERϫ with a maximal efficacy of 30ÿ70%, the concentrations required for this degree of activation make it unlikely that the activity of DHEA at this receptor is physiologically meaningful. Remarkably however, DHEA acts as a full agonist of the ER with a maximal response similar to or actually slightly greater than that of estradiol, and its levels in circulation and local tissues in the human body are high enough to activate the receptor to the same degree as that seen with circulating estradiol levels at somewhat higher than their maximal, non-ovulatory concentrations; indeed, when combined with estradiol with both at levels equivalent to those of their physiological concentrations, overall activation of the ER was doubled. As such, it has been proposed that DHEA may be an important and potentially major endogenous estrogen in the body.[10][22]\\r\\nDHEA does not bind to or activate the progesterone, glucocorticoid, or mineralocorticoid receptors.[22][24] Other nuclear receptor targets of DHEA besides the androgen and estrogen receptors include the PPARϫ, PXR, and CAR.[25] However, whereas DHEA is a ligand of the PPARϫ and PXR in rodents, it is not in humans.[26] In addition to direct interactions, DHEA is thought to regulate a handful of other proteins via indirect, genomic mechanisms, including the enzymes CYP2C11 and 11-HSD1 ÿ the latter of which is essential for the biosynthesis of the glucocorticoids such as cortisol and has been suggested to be involved in the antiglucocorticoid effects of DHEA ÿ and the carrier protein IGFBP1.[22][27]\\r\\nDHEA has been found to directly act on several neurotransmitter receptors, including acting as a positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor, as a negative allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, and as an agonist of the 1 receptor.[28][25]\\r\\nIn 2011, the surprising discovery was made that DHEA, as well as DHEA-S, directly bind to and activate the TrkA and p75NTR, receptors of neurotrophins like nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), with high affinity.[25][29] DHEA was subsequently also found to bind to the TrkB and TrkC with high affinity, though it notably activated the TrkC but not the TrkB.[25][30] DHEA and DHEA-S bound to these receptors with affinities that were in the low nanomolar range (around 5?nM), although the affinities were nonetheless approximately two orders of magnitude lower relative to highly potent polypeptide neurotrophins like NGF (0.01ÿ0.1?nM).[25][29][30] In any case, DHEA and DHEA-S both circulate at requisite concentrations to activate these receptors and were thus identified as important endogenous neurotrophic factors.[25][29] They have since been labeled \\"steroidal microneurotrophins\\", due to their small-molecule and steroidal nature relative to their polypeptide neurotrophin counterparts.[31] Subsequent research has suggested that DHEA and/or DHEA-S may in fact be phylogenetically ancient \\"ancestral\\" ligands of the neurotrophin receptors from early on in the evolution of the nervous system.[25][30] The findings that DHEA binds to and potently activates neurotrophin receptors may explain the positive association between decreased circulating DHEA levels with age and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.[25][29]\\r\\nSimilarly to pregnenolone, its synthetic derivative 3-methoxypregnenolone (MAP-4343), and progesterone, DHEA has been found to bind to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), specifically the MAP2C subtype (Kd = 27?M).[25] However, it is unclear whether DHEA increases binding of MAP2 to tubulin like pregnenolone.[25]\\r\\nDHEA is an uncompetitive inhibitor of G6PDH (Ki = 17?M; IC50 = 18.7?M), and is able to lower NADPH levels and reduce NADPH-dependent free radical production.[32][33] It is thought that this action may possibly be responsible for much of the antiinflammatory, antihyperplastic, chemopreventative, antihyperlipidemic, antidiabetic, and antiobesic, as well as certain immunomodulating activities of DHEA (with some experimental evidence to support this notion available).[32][33][34][35] However, it has also been said that inhibition of G6PDH activity by DHEA in vivo has not been observed and that the concentrations required for DHEA to inhibit G6PDH in vitro are very high, thus making the possible contribution of G6PDH inhibition to the effects of DHEA uncertain.[33]\\r\\nDHEA has been found to competitively inhibit TRPV1.[28]\\r\\nDHEA is produced in the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex under the control of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and by the gonads under the control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).[37][38] It is also produced in the brain.[39] DHEA is synthesized from cholesterol via the enzymes cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1; P450scc) and 17ϫ-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), with pregnenolone and 17ϫ-hydroxypregnenolone as intermediates.[40] It is derived mostly from the adrenal cortex, with only about 10% being secreted from the gonads.[41][42][43] Approximately 50 to 70% of circulating DHEA originates from desulfation of DHEA-S in peripheral tissues.[41] DHEA-S itself originates almost exclusively from the adrenal cortex, with 95 to 100% being secreted from the adrenal cortex in women.[37][43]\\r\\nRegular exercise is known to increase DHEA production in the body.[44][45] Calorie restriction has also been shown to increase DHEA in primates.[46] Some theorize that the increase in endogenous DHEA brought about by calorie restriction is partially responsible for the longer life expectancy known to be associated with calorie restriction.[47] Catalpol and a combination of acetyl-carnitine and propionyl-carnitine on 1:1 ratio also improves endogenous DHEA production and release due to direct cholinergic stimulation of CRH release and an increase of IGF-1 expression respectively.\\r\\nIn the circulation, DHEA is mainly bound to albumin, with a small amount bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).[48][49] The small remainder of DHEA not associated with albumin or SHBG is unbound and free in the circulation.[48]\\r\\nDHEA easily crosses the bloodÿbrain barrier into the central nervous system.[39]\\r\\nDHEA is transformed into DHEA-S by sulfation at the C3 position via the sulfotransferase enzymes SULT2A1 and to a lesser extent SULT1E1.[40][50][51] This occurs naturally in the adrenal cortex and during first-pass metabolism in the liver and intestines when exogenous DHEA is administered orally.[citation needed] Levels of DHEA-S in circulation are approximately 250 to 300 times those of DHEA.[19] DHEA-S in turn can be converted back into DHEA in peripheral tissues via steroid sulfatase (STS).[52][53]\\r\\nThe terminal half-life of DHEA is short at only 15 to 30?minutes.[54] In contrast, the terminal half-life of DHEA-S is far longer, at 7 to 10?hours.[54] As DHEA-S can be converted back into DHEA, it serves as a circulating reservoir for DHEA, thereby extending the duration of DHEA.[55][19]\\r\\nMetabolites of DHEA include DHEA-S, 7ϫ-hydroxy-DHEA, 7-hydroxy-DHEA, 7-keto-DHEA, 7ϫ-hydroxyepiandrosterone, and 7-hydroxyepiandrosterone, as well as androstenediol and androstenedione.[5]\\r\\nDuring pregnancy, DHEA-S is metabolized into the sulfates of 16ϫ-hydroxy-DHEA and 15ϫ-hydroxy-DHEA in the fetal liver as intermediates in the production of the estrogens estriol and estetrol, respectively.\\r\\nPrior to puberty, DHEA and DHEA-S levels elevate upon differentiation of the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex.[25] Peak levels of DHEA and DHEA-S are observed around age 20, which is followed by an age-dependent decline throughout life eventually back to prepubertal concentrations.[25] Plasma levels of DHEA in adult men are 10ÿ25?nM, in premenopausal women are 5ÿ30?nM, and in postmenopausal women are 2ÿ20?nM.[25] Conversely, DHEA-S levels are an order of magnitude higher at 1ÿ10?M.[25] Levels of DHEA and DHEA-S decline to the lower nanomolar and micromolar ranges in men and women aged 60 to 80?years.[25]\\r\\nAs almost all DHEA is derived from the adrenal glands, blood measurements of DHEA-S/DHEA are useful to detect excess adrenal activity as seen in adrenal cancer or hyperplasia, including certain forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome tend to have elevated levels of DHEA-S.[56]\\r\\nDHEA, also known as androst-5-en-3-ol-17-one, is a naturally occurring androstane steroid and a 17-ketosteroid. It is closely related structurally to androstenediol (androst-5-ene-3,17-diol), androstenedione (androst-4-ene-3,17-dione), and testosterone (androst-4-en-17-ol-3-one). DHEA is the 5-dehydro analogue of epiandrosterone (5ϫ-androstan-3-ol-17-one) and is also known as 5-dehydroepiandrosterone or as Ѵ5-epiandrosterone.\\r\\nThe term \\"dehydroepiandrosterone\\" is ambiguous chemically because it does not include the specific positions within epiandrosterone at which hydrogen atoms are missing. DHEA itself is 5,6-didehydroepiandrosterone or 5-dehydroepiandrosterone. A number of naturally occurring isomers also exist and may have similar activities. Some isomers of DHEA are 1-dehydroepiandrosterone (1-androsterone) and 4-dehydroepiandrosterone. These isomers are also technically \\"DHEA\\", since they are dehydroepiandrosterones in which hydrogens are removed from the epiandrosterone skeleton.\\r\\nDehydroandrosterone (DHA) is the 3ϫ-epimer of DHEA and is also an endogenous androgen.\\r\\nDHEA was first isolated from human urine in 1934 by Adolf Butenandt and Kurt Tscherning.[57]","input":"What type of chemicals are dhea and androstenedione?"},{"output":"Andrew Barton (Banjo) Paterson","context":"The Australian ten dollar banknote was issued when the currency was changed from the Australian pound to the Australian dollar on 17 February 1966; it replaced the S5 note which had similar blue colouration.

The initial cells in this pathway are called spermatogonia, which yield primary spermatocytes by mitosis. The primary spermatocyte divides meiotically (Meiosis I) into two secondary spermatocytes; each secondary spermatocyte divides into two spermatids by Meiosis II. These develop into mature spermatozoa, also known as sperm cells. Thus, the primary spermatocyte gives rise to two cells, the secondary spermatocytes, and the two secondary spermatocytes by their subdivision produce four spermatozoa.[1]\\r\\nSpermatozoa are the mature male gametes in many sexually reproducing organisms. Thus, spermatogenesis is the male version of gametogenesis, of which the female equivalent is oogenesis. In mammals it occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the male testes in a stepwise fashion. Spermatogenesis is highly dependent upon optimal conditions for the process to occur correctly, and is essential for sexual reproduction. DNA methylation and histone modification have been implicated in the regulation of this process.[2] It starts at puberty and usually continues uninterrupted until death, although a slight decrease can be discerned in the quantity of produced sperm with increase in age (see Male infertility).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpermatogenesis produces mature male gametes, commonly called sperm but more specifically known as spermatozoa, which are able to fertilize the counterpart female gamete, the oocyte, during conception to produce a single-celled individual known as a zygote. This is the cornerstone of sexual reproduction and involves the two gametes both contributing half the normal set of chromosomes (haploid) to result in a chromosomally normal (diploid) zygote.\\r\\nTo preserve the number of chromosomes in the offspring ÿ which differs between species ÿ each gamete must have half the usual number of chromosomes present in other body cells. Otherwise, the offspring will have twice the normal number of chromosomes, and serious abnormalities may result. In humans, chromosomal abnormalities arising from incorrect spermatogenesis results in congenital defects and abnormal birth defects (Down Syndrome, Klinefelter's Syndrome) and in most cases, spontaneous abortion of the developing foetus.\\r\\nSpermatogenesis takes place within several structures of the male reproductive system. The initial stages occur within the testes and progress to the epididymis where the developing gametes mature and are stored until ejaculation. The seminiferous tubules of the testes are the starting point for the process, where spermatogonial stem cells adjacent to the inner tubule wall divide in a centripetal directionbeginning at the walls and proceeding into the innermost part, or lumento produce immature sperm. Maturation occurs in the epididymis. The location [Testes/Scrotum] is specifically important as the process of spermatogenesis requires a lower temperature to produce viable sperm, specifically 1-8?C lower than normal body temperature of 37?C (98.6?F).[3] Clinically, small fluctuations in temperature such as from an athletic support strap, causes no impairment in sperm viability or count.[4]\\r\\nFor humans, the entire process of spermatogenesis is variously estimated as taking 74 days[5][6] (according to tritium-labelled biopsies) and approximately 120 days[7] (according to DNA clock measurements). Including the transport on ductal system, it takes 3 months. Testes produce 200 to 300 million spermatozoa daily.[8] However, only about half or 100 million of these become viable sperm.[9]\\r\\nThe entire process of spermatogenesis can be broken up into several distinct stages, each corresponding to a particular type of cell in humans. In the following table, ploidy, copy number and chromosome/chromatid counts are for one cell, generally prior to DNA synthesis and division (in G1 if applicable). The primary spermatocyte is arrested after DNA synthesis and prior to division.\\r\\nSpermatocytogenesis is the male form of gametocytogenesis and results in the formation of spermatocytes possessing half the normal complement of genetic material. In spermatocytogenesis, a diploid spermatogonium, which resides in the basal compartment of the seminiferous tubules, divides mitotically, producing two diploid intermediate cells called primary spermatocytes. Each primary spermatocyte then moves into the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous tubules and duplicates its DNA and subsequently undergoes meiosis I to produce two haploid secondary spermatocytes, which will later divide once more into haploid spermatids. This division implicates sources of genetic variation, such as random inclusion of either parental chromosomes, and chromosomal crossover, to increase the genetic variability of the gamete.\\r\\nEach cell division from a spermatogonium to a spermatid is incomplete; the cells remain connected to one another by bridges of cytoplasm to allow synchronous development. It should also be noted that not all spermatogonia divide to produce spermatocytes; otherwise, the supply of spermatogonia would run out. Instead, spermatogonial stem cells divide mitotically to produce copies of themselves, ensuring a constant supply of spermatogonia to fuel spermatogenesis.[10]\\r\\nSpermatidogenesis is the creation of spermatids from secondary spermatocytes. Secondary spermatocytes produced earlier rapidly enter meiosis II and divide to produce haploid spermatids. The brevity of this stage means that secondary spermatocytes are rarely seen in histological studies.\\r\\nDuring spermiogenesis, the spermatids begin to form a tail by growing microtubules on one of the centrioles, which turns into basal body. These microtubules form an axoneme. Later the centriole is modified in the process of centrosome reduction.[11] The anterior part of the tail (called midpiece) thickens because mitochondria are arranged around the axoneme to ensure energy supply. Spermatid DNA also undergoes packaging, becoming highly condensed. The DNA is packaged firstly with specific nuclear basic proteins, which are subsequently replaced with protamines during spermatid elongation. The resultant tightly packed chromatin is transcriptionally inactive. The Golgi apparatus surrounds the now condensed nucleus, becoming the acrosome.\\r\\nMaturation then takes place under the influence of testosterone, which removes the remaining unnecessary cytoplasm and organelles. The excess cytoplasm, known as residual bodies, is phagocytosed by surrounding Sertoli cells in the testes. The resulting spermatozoa are now mature but lack motility, rendering them sterile. The mature spermatozoa are released from the protective Sertoli cells into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule in a process called spermiation.\\r\\nThe non-motile spermatozoa are transported to the epididymis in testicular fluid secreted by the Sertoli cells with the aid of peristaltic contraction. While in the epididymis the spermatozoa gain motility and become capable of fertilization. However, transport of the mature spermatozoa through the remainder of the male reproductive system is achieved via muscle contraction rather than the spermatozoon's recently acquired motility.\\r\\nAt all stages of differentiation, the spermatogenic cells are in close contact with Sertoli cells which are thought to provide structural and metabolic support to the developing sperm cells. A single Sertoli cell extends from the basement membrane to the lumen of the seminiferous tubule, although the cytoplasmic processes are difficult to distinguish at the light microscopic level.\\r\\nSertoli cells serve a number of functions during spermatogenesis, they support the developing gametes in the following ways:\\r\\nThe intercellular adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and soluble ICAM-1 have antagonistic effects on the tight junctions forming the blood-testis barrier.[13] ICAM-2 molecules regulate spermatid adhesion on the apical side of the barrier (towards the lumen).[13]\\r\\nThe process of spermatogenesis is highly sensitive to fluctuations in the environment, particularly hormones and temperature. Testosterone is required in large local concentrations to maintain the process, which is achieved via the binding of testosterone by androgen binding protein present in the seminiferous tubules. Testosterone is produced by interstitial cells, also known as Leydig cells, which reside adjacent to the seminiferous tubules.\\r\\nSeminiferous epithelium is sensitive to elevated temperature in humans and some other species, and will be adversely affected by temperatures as high as normal body temperature. Consequently, the testes are located outside the body in a sack of skin called the scrotum. The optimal temperature is maintained at 2 C (man)ÿ8?C (mouse) below body temperature. This is achieved by regulation of blood flow[14] and positioning towards and away from the heat of the body by the cremasteric muscle and the dartos smooth muscle in the scrotum.\\r\\nDietary deficiencies (such as vitamins B, E and A), anabolic steroids, metals (cadmium and lead), x-ray exposure, dioxin, alcohol, and infectious diseases will also adversely affect the rate of spermatogenesis.[citation needed] In addition, the male germ line is susceptible to DNA damage caused by oxidative stress, and this damage likely has a significant impact on fertilization and pregnancy.[15] Exposure to pesticides also affects spermatogenesis.[16]\\r\\nHormonal control of spermatogenesis varies among species. In humans the mechanism is not completely understood; however it is known that initiation of spermatogenesis occurs at puberty due to the interaction of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and Leydig cells. If the pituitary gland is removed, spermatogenesis can still be initiated by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone.[17] In contrast to FSH, LH appears to have little role in spermatogenesis outside of inducing gonadal testosterone production.[17][18]\\r\\nFSH stimulates both the production of androgen binding protein (ABP) by Sertoli cells, and the formation of the blood-testis barrier. ABP is essential to concentrating testosterone in levels high enough to initiate and maintain spermatogenesis. Intratesticular testosterone levels are 20ÿ100 or 50ÿ200 times higher than the concentration found in blood, although there is variation over a 5- to 10-fold range amongst healthy men.[19][20] FSH may initiate the sequestering of testosterone in the testes, but once developed only testosterone is required to maintain spermatogenesis.[17] However, increasing the levels of FSH will increase the production of spermatozoa by preventing the apoptosis of type A spermatogonia. The hormone inhibin acts to decrease the levels of FSH. Studies from rodent models suggest that gonadotropins (both LH and FSH) support the process of spermatogenesis by suppressing the proapoptotic signals and therefore promote spermatogenic cell survival.[21]\\r\\nThe Sertoli cells themselves mediate parts of spermatogenesis through hormone production. They are capable of producing the hormones estradiol and inhibin. The Leydig cells are also capable of producing estradiol in addition to their main product testosterone. Estrogen has been found to be essential for spermatogenesis in animals.[22][23] However, a man with estrogen insensitivity syndrome (a defective ERϫ) was found produce sperm with a normal sperm count, albeit abnormally low sperm viability; whether he was sterile or not is unclear.[24] Levels of estrogen that are too high can be detrimental to spermatogenesis due to suppression of gonadotropin secretion and by extension intratesticular testosterone production.[25] Prolactin also appears to be important for spermatogenesis.[18]","input":"How often does spermatogeneisthe production of spermoccur?"},{"output":"\\"Shape of You\\"","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California.

Fewer than two percent of South Africans speak a first language other than an official one.[2] Most South Africans can speak more than one language.[3] Dutch and English were the first official languages of South Africa from 1910 to 1925. Afrikaans was added as a part of Dutch in 1925, although in practice, Afrikaans effectively replaced Dutch, which fell into disuse. When South Africa became a republic in 1961, the official relationship changed such that Afrikaans was considered to include Dutch,[4] and Dutch was dropped in 1984, so between 1984 and 1994, South Africa had two official languages: English and Afrikaans.[5]\\r\\nDifferent government departments and official bodies use different terms to denote Northern Sotho.[6][7] In South Africa, Southern Ndebele is known simply as Ndebele, as most speakers of Northern Ndebele live in Zimbabwe.\\r\\nSince taking power in the 1994 election, the ANC has promoted English as the main language of government, even if South Africans often take pride in using indigenous languages for any purpose. Afrikaans also features prominently in commerce together with English, as the languages with the highest number of fluent speakers are Afrikaans and English.\\r\\nIn terms of linguistic classification, the official languages include two West Germanic languages (English and Afrikaans) and nine Southern Bantu languages. Four of these are Nguni languages (Zulu, Xhosa, Swati and Ndebele) and three are SothoÿTswana languages (Northern Sotho, Southern Sotho, and Tswana). Tsonga is a TswaÿRonga language.[8]\\r\\nSouth African Sign Language is understood across the country, though sometimes sign-language interpreters use manually coded language.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common language spoken as a first language by South Africans is Zulu (23 percent), followed by Xhosa (16 percent), and Afrikaans (14 percent). English is the fourth most common first language in the country (9.6%), but is understood in most urban areas and is the dominant language in government and the media.[9]\\r\\nThe majority of South Africans speak a language from one of the two principal branches of the Bantu languages represented in South Africa: the SothoÿTswana branch (Sesotho, Northern Sotho, Tswana), or the Nguni branch (Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi, Ndebele). For each of the two groups, the languages within that group are for the most part intelligible to a native speaker of any other language within that group.\\r\\nThe nine indigenous African languages of South Africa can be divided into two geographical zones, with Nguni languages being predominant in the south-eastern third of the country (Indian Ocean coast) and Sesotho languages being predominant in the northern third of the country located further inland, as also in Botswana and Lesotho. Gauteng is the most linguistically heterogeneous province, with roughly equal numbers of Nguni, Sesotho and Indo-European language speakers. This has resulted in the spread of an urban argot, Tsotsitaal, in large urban townships in the province.\\r\\nAfrikaans, a language derived from Dutch, is the most widely spoken language in the western half of the country (Western and Northern Cape). It is spoken as first language by approximately 61 percent of whites and 76 percent of Coloured (multiracial) people in the country.[2] Afrikaans is also spoken widely across the centre and north of the country, as a second (or third or even fourth) language by Black South Africans living in farming areas.\\r\\nThe 2011 census recorded the following distribution of first language speakers:[2]\\r\\nOther languages spoken in South Africa, though not mentioned in the Constitution, include Fanagalo, Lobedu (Khilobedu), Northern Ndebele (Sindebele), Phuthi (Siphuthi). Lobedu has been variously claimed to be a dialect of Northern Sotho and an autonomous language. Fanagalo is a pidgin often used as a lingua franca in the mining industry.\\r\\nSignificant numbers of immigrants from Europe, elsewhere in Africa, and the Indian subcontinent means that a wide variety of other languages can also be found in parts of South Africa. In the older immigrant communities there are: Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Portuguese, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, Yiddish, Italian and smaller numbers of Dutch, French and German speakers.\\r\\nThese non-official languages may be used in limited semi-official use where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. More importantly, these languages have significant local functions in specific communities whose identity is tightly bound around the linguistic and cultural identity that these non-official SA languages signal.\\r\\nThe fastest growing non-official language is Portuguese[citation needed] ÿ first spoken by black and white settlers and refugees from Angola and Mozambique after they won independence from Portugal and now by more recent immigrants from those countries again ÿ and increasingly French, spoken by immigrants and refugees from Francophone Central Africa.\\r\\nMore recently, speakers of North, Central and West Africa languages have arrived in South Africa, mostly in the major cities, especially in Johannesburg and Pretoria, but also Cape Town and Durban.\\r\\nChapter 1 (Founding Provisions), Section 6 (Languages) of the Constitution of South Africa is the basis for government language policy.\\r\\nThe English text of the constitution signed by president Nelson Mandela on 16 December 1996 uses (mostly) the names of the languages expressed in those languages themselves. Sesotho refers to Southern Sotho, and isiNdebele refers to Southern Ndebele. Controversy surrounds the designation of Northern Sesotho as Sepedi (its main dialect) instead of the comprehensive Sesotho sa Leboa (which had been the wording in the Interim Constitution of 1993).[10] The spelling of Venda is also incorrectly rendered as Tshivenda instead of the correct Tshiven?a.\\r\\nThe constitution mentions \\"sign language\\" in the generic sense rather than South African Sign Language specifically.","input":"What is the primary language in south africa?"},{"output":"8-week program","context":"Officer Training School (OTS) is a United States Air Force commissioning program located at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. It is the current de facto officer candidate school (OCS) program for the U.S. Air Force, analogous to the OCS programs operated by the other branches of the U.S. armed forces.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficer Training School is a part of the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accession and Citizen Development, formerly the Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS). Named for the late Major General Jeanne M. Holm, the Holm Center falls under Air University (AU), which, in turn, falls under the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), an Air Force major command (MAJCOM).\\r\\nIn addition to OTS, the Holm Center also has oversight responsibilities for the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) pre-commissioning program on U.S. colleges and universities, the Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFJROTC) citizen development program in U.S. high schools, and the entire Civil Air Patrol, both its senior member program as the U.S. Air Force Auxiliary (focused on search and rescue and other emergency services and disaster support), and its aerospace education and citizen development cadet program (similar to the AFJROTC cadet program) via its HQ CAP-USAF activity.\\r\\nThe current Commander of the Holm Center (Holm/CC) is Brigadier General Steven D. Garland, USAF[1] and the current Commandant of OTS (OTS/CMDT) is Colonel Stephen P. Frank, USAF.[2]\\r\\nDuring peacetime, OTS is usually the smallest commissioning source in the USAF, producing fewer officers per year than AFROTC and the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA). However, it possesses the capability to surge when USAF requirements dictate and exceed the combined annual officer production of both USAFA and AFROTC. Given its shorter lead time for officer production (currently 9 weeks versus the typically 4-year pre-commissioning process for USAFA and AFROTC cadets), OTS is the commissioning source used to balance out USAF officer manning as deemed necessary by the Air Force.[3]\\r\\nThe number of officers commissioned through OTS fluctuates wildly as their numbers are largely influenced by the number of graduating cadets through the USAF Academy and AFROTC, as well as being the first place the Air Force cuts when they have a surplus of cadets through the other two sources. Given this reality, OTS has often surpassed USAFA officer production during wartime periods such as during the Vietnam War in the 1960s and early 1970s or the Reagan defense buildup of the 1980s.[4] Conversely, OTS can be hard to get into during years of contraction within the national defense establishment in general and the Air Force in particular, such as the mid and late 1970s following the end of the Vietnam War and associated USAF force structure reductions or the post-Cold War era and its associated defense reductions of the early and mid-1990s.[5][6] During these periods of contractions, OTS produces few officers, making selection for the OTS program particularly difficult and competitive for college graduates, especially those with no prior enlisted service, particularly USAF enlisted service.[7]\\r\\nOTS is divided into two parallel programs:\\r\\nTotal Force Officer Training (TFOT) is the more traditional 8-week pre-commissioning program. Previously a 13-week program later reduced to 10 weeks, the re-named TFOT track transitioned to a 9-week program in 2014 and the legacy system of Officer Trainees (OT) being designated as lower classmen in the early part of the program and upper classmen in the latter part, similar to their USAFA and AFROTC counterparts, was eliminated. This was further reduced to the current 8-week program in 2017 by removing the Total Force Indoctrination Training (TFIT) from the first week of the course in which Military Training Instructors (MTIs) would teach the customs and standards of the Air Force as well as the basics of marching and drill and ceremonies. Officer Trainees were also re-designated as Cadets in 2015, again on par with USAFA and AFROTC and reminiscent of the Aviation Cadet program in operation in USAF and its predecessor incarnations (e.g., USAAS, USAAC, USAAF, etc.) from 1907 until 1965. TFOT is for 4-year university and college graduates without prior military service (commonly known as non-prior service), as well as Active Component enlisted, Air Force Reserve enlisted, Air National Guard enlisted and former enlisted personnel from any of the five U.S. armed services with college degrees at the baccalaureate level degree or higher who wish to become Air Force officers. TFOT serves all Active Component and Reserve Component line officers except judge advocates.\\r\\nCommissioned Officer Training (COT) is a 5-week program, primarily focused on terminal-degreed professionals (e.g., medical, lawyers, chaplains, as well as undergraduate degreed nurses) directly accessed into the USAF officer ranks. COT serves all Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard non-line officers and judge advocates who did not previously serve as line officers in other career fields or who were not commissioned via USAFA or AFROTC.\\r\\nInterested applicants for OTS typically contact Air Force recruiters specializing in officer (versus enlisted) accessions. Recruiters will screen candidates, provide application details and schedule applicants for the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT). The AFOQT covers numerous test batteries assessing math, verbal, and analytical skills, as well as measuring pilot and navigator/combat systems officer potential for those applicants aspiring to be aeronautically rated officers. AFOQT scores, college GPA, previous enlisted performance evaluations if a current or former enlisted member, and, if applicable, previous pilot skills as either an FAA-certified civilian pilot and/or as a U.S. Army warrant officer / Army Aviator will all figure into the selection process, although the selection process strives to employ a composite or \\"whole person\\" approach.\\r\\nOTS applicants will be given an opportunity to apply for Air Force career fields that correspond with the applicants' expertise and/or desires and will be interviewed by active duty Air Force officers as well as receive a military medical examination for flying or non-flying duty as appropriate. Applicants will then be screened by a centralized, periodic, OTS Selection Board conducted by the Air Force Recruiting Service, a component of the Air Education and Training Command.[8] Applicants will be notified of acceptance or rejection by their recruiter pending release of the board results.\\r\\nIf not already on active duty as enlisted personnel in the armed forces, selectees for OTS will subsequently enlist in the Air Force Reserve via the Delayed Enlistment Program and will be assigned an OTS class date. Non-prior service college graduates will enlist in the rank of Airman 1st Class (E-3) while prior service enlisted personnel will be enlisted in their current or highest prior pay grade. Upon arrival at OTS, all personnel will be advanced to pay grade E-5 (unless prior enlisted already holding a higher pay grade), but will hold the rank of Cadet versus USAF Staff Sergeant.\\r\\nOTS is highly competitive, with selection rates varying dependent on the needs of the Air Force. For example, boards conducted circa 2010 - 2012 had selection rates in the 20% range due to budgetary reductions / force reductions being imposed on the Air Force at that time. However, by 2017, selection rates had increased to the 65% range or greater, reflecting the increased commissioned officer needs of the service.[9][10]\\r\\nPer Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2013, personnel attending Total Force Officer Training must have a baccalaureate level degree or higher[11] in either technical or non-technical fields. Technical fields may include any ABET-accredited engineering degree or other fields in high demand by the Air Force. Non-technical degrees are more common, and therefore applying with a degree in such a field is very competitive. Applicants can apply for aeronautically rated or non-rated Line Officer of the Air Force (LAF) positions. Rated positions are flying related -- Pilot, Combat Systems Officer (previously known as Navigator), Remotely-Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Pilot, or Air Battle Manager. Non-rated positions fall into two categories: non-rated operations, such as missiles, intelligence, space, cyber, or weather, and non-rated support, such as aircraft maintenance, missile maintenance, logistics, civil engineer, security forces, or communications.\\r\\nAreas of instruction at OTS include military customs and courtesies, military history, Air Force traditions and culture, leadership, field exercises, drill and ceremonies, small arms training, and combatives.\\r\\nThe first few weeks of training are geared toward orienting the cadet with Air Force standards. The focus is on physical training, drill and ceremonies, and academics. Cadets will be expected to work with their fellow flight and squadron members to accomplish specific tasks as required by their Flight Commander and the Cadet Wing. They will also attend multiple classes in an academic environment. Later in the program they will attend field training exercises, projects, small arms training, and building team skills by overcoming challenges in a simulated deployment environment.\\r\\nTo graduate, cadets must meet or exceed physical standards, academic standards, and military bearing standards. Military bearing includes the ability to write and verbally brief, lead the flight, and perform duties within the Cadet Wing.\\r\\nUpon graduation, OTS graduates may receive either Regular or Reserve commissions as Second Lieutenants in the Regular United States Air Force, the Air Force Reserve, or the Air National Guard, as appropriate to their original source of entry and contract. The new second lieutenants will be appointed in either pay grade O-1, or O-1E if they have prior cumulative active service as a warrant officer or as an enlisted servicemember in any branch or component of the U.S. armed forces for at least 4 years and 1 day. If any portion of their prior service was in a reserve component and not served in an active duty status, then inactive duty reserve retirement points may be used to qualify for O-1E. If the combination of creditable active duty days and inactive duty points equals 1,460 (equivalent to exactly 4 years and 1 day of cumulative qualifying active and inactive duty), the pay grade O-1E is assigned, which is a significantly higher starting basic pay level than O-1, and remains higher until promoted to O-4.[12]\\r\\nCOT is a 5-week course for professionals who have received a direct commission. Typically, these officers have degrees, such as MDiv, MD, DO, DPM, OD, DDS, DMD, PharmD, PhD, PsyD, BSN or MSN, MSW, or JD, in the case of chaplains, physicians, podiatrists, optometrists, dentists, pharmacists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, and lawyers, respectively. They often enter at an advanced rank, such as First Lieutenant (O-2) and sometimes as Captain (O-3) in compensation for their higher levels of education, and in some cases, experience. Officers can be commissioned up to the rank of Colonel (O-6) if they possess the level of experience necessary.\\r\\nWith the exception of those officers previously commissioned as line officers through USAFA, AFROTC, and the BOT program of OTS, or the Air Force Nurse program of AFROTC, most chaplains, judge advocates general (i.e., lawyers), and medical personnel go through COT.\\r\\nCommissioned Officer Training (COT) is responsible for developing medical, legal, and chaplain personnel into professional officers by instilling character, knowledge, and motivation essential to serve in the United States Air Force. The 23rd Training Squadron (23 TRS) provides a 23-training day Commissioned Officer Training course to instill leadership and officership skills in newly commissioned medical officers, judge advocates, and chaplains. The 23 TRS also conducts a 13-training day Reserve Commissioned Officer Training (RCOT) program for hard-to-recruit medical officers in the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard.\\r\\nWhen the Aviation Cadet (AvCad) Program proved insufficient to meet wartime commissioned officer requirements, the United States Army Air Forces established the Officer Candidate School (OCS) on 23 February 1942 at Miami Beach, Florida,[13] its mission being to train and commission members from the enlisted ranks.\\r\\nOCS moved to the San Antonio Aviation Cadet Center (now Lackland AFB), Texas, in 1944 and gained the additional mission of training officers directly from civilian status in September 1951.[14]\\r\\nOTS was organized at Lackland AFB, Texas, in November 1959, with the first OTS class (60-A) composed of 89 officer trainees, including 11 women, who graduated and were commissioned as 2nd Lieutenants on 9 February 1960. The number of OTS graduates has varied over the years, from 323 the first year to a high of 7,894 officers in 1967.[15]\\r\\nWith the establishment of OTS, Air Force OCS closed its doors and conducted its last graduation in June 1963. Concurrently, the Air Force also commenced a phaseout of its long-standing Aviation Cadet (AvCad) Program at Lackland AFB. Unlike OTS, AvCad was limited to pilot and navigator candidates. In addition, AvCads had to successfully complete either undergraduate pilot training or undergraduate navigator training before they could be commissioned as Second Lieutenants. The last AvCad pilot was commissioned in October 1961 at the former Reese AFB, Texas, and the last AvCad navigator was commissioned in March 1965, at the former James Connally AFB, Texas.[16][17] OTS then became the sole organization for training future Air Force officers at Lackland AFB.\\r\\nOn 1 July 1993, Air Training Command (ATC) merged with Air University (AU) to form the new Air Education and Training Command (AETC), with Air University becoming a direct reporting unit (DRU) under AETC. OTS, which was formerly under ATC, and Air Force ROTC, which was formerly under AU, were then realigned under both AETC and AU.\\r\\nUntil 22 September 1993, Officer Training School was located on the Medina Annex of Lackland AFB, Texas, with the last OTS class, Class 93-06, graduating from that location on that date. During the spring and summer of 1993, OTS gradually relocated to Maxwell AFB, Alabama, commencing operations in interim facilities on 25 September 1993.[18]\\r\\nHistorically, the USAF Academy had been (and continues to be) headed by a lieutenant general and Air Force ROTC had been headed by a major general or brigadier general, while OTS had been headed by a colonel. In February 1997, in an effort to reduce duplication of effort and streamline administrative and reporting procedures within AU, AFROTC and OTS realigned under a newly created umbrella organization, Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS). Under this restructuring, OTS and AFROTC were placed under the leadership of individual USAF colonels (AFJROTC and CAP were also placed under individual USAF colonels), while general officer oversight for both OTS and AFROTC, representing three-quarters of Air Force officer production, was placed under one command, the AFOATS commander, a brigadier general.[15]\\r\\nIn the late 1990s, a $52 million military construction (MILCON) project commenced to build a new, dedicated OTS campus at Maxwell AFB to replace the interim facilities initially occupied in late 1993. The majority of this MILCON project was completed in 2001 and all projects relating to the Maxwell AFB OTS campus were completed by 2004.[18] AFROTC, which had previously conducted its summer Field Training (FT) program for their cadets between their sophomore and junior academic years at various air force bases around the United States, also consolidated its summer FT program at the OTS facilities at Maxwell AFB circa 2008.\\r\\nAs part of another organizational restructuring of AU, AFOATS was later renamed the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accession and Citizen Development, while still retaining oversight of OTS, Air Force ROTC, Air Force Junior ROTC, and the Civil Air Patrol.","input":"How long is air force officer basic training?"},{"output":"a major Italian poet of the Late Middle Ages","context":"Durante degli Alighieri (Italian:?[du?rante de?? ali?j??ri]), commonly known as Dante Alighieri or simply Dante (Italian:?[?dante], UK: /?d?nti/, US: /?d?nte?/; c. 1265 ÿ 1321), was a major Italian poet of the Late Middle Ages. His Divine Comedy, originally called Comeda (modern Italian: Commedia) and later christened Divina by Giovanni Boccaccio, is widely considered the most important poem of the Middle Ages and the greatest literary work in the Italian language.[1][2]\\r\\nIn the late Middle Ages, most poetry was written in Latin, accessible only to the most educated readers. In De vulgari eloquentia (On Eloquence in the Vernacular), however, Dante defended use of the vernacular in literature. He would even write in the Tuscan dialect for works such as The New Life (1295) and the Divine Comedy; this highly unorthodox choice set a precedent that important later Italian writers such as Petrarch and Boccaccio would follow.\\r\\nDante was instrumental in establishing the literature of Italy, and his depictions of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven provided inspiration for the larger body of Western art.[3][4] He is cited as an influence on John Milton, Geoffrey Chaucer and Alfred Tennyson, among many others. In addition, the first use of the interlocking three-line rhyme scheme, or the terza rima, is attributed to him. In Italy, he is often referred to as il Sommo Poeta (\\"the Supreme Poet\\") and il Poeta; he, Petrarch, and Boccaccio are also called \\"the three fountains\\" or \\"the three crowns\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDante was born in Florence, Republic of Florence, present-day Italy. The exact date of his birth is unknown, although it is generally believed to be around 1265. This can be deduced from autobiographic allusions in the Divine Comedy. Its first section, the Inferno, begins, \\"Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita\\" (\\"Midway upon the journey of our life\\"), implying that Dante was around 35 years old, since the average lifespan according to the Bible (Psalm 89:10, Vulgate) is 70 years; and since his imaginary travel to the nether world took place in 1300, he was most probably born around 1265. Some verses of the Paradiso section of the Divine Comedy also provide a possible clue that he was born under the sign of Gemini: \\"As I revolved with the eternal twins, I saw revealed, from hills to river outlets, the threshing-floor that makes us so ferocious\\" (XXII?151ÿ154). In 1265, the sun was in Gemini between approximately May?11 and June?11 (Julian calendar).[5]\\r\\nGiovanni Boccaccio described Dante's appearance and demeanor as follows: \\"the poet was of middle height, and in his later years he walked somewhat bent over, with a grave and gentle gait. He was clad always in most seemly attire, such as befitted his ripe years. His face was long, his nose aquiline, and his eyes big rather than small. His jaws were large, and his lower lip protruded. He had a brown complexion, his hair and beard were thick, black, and curly, and his countenance was always melancholy and thoughtful.\\"[6]\\r\\nDante claimed that his family descended from the ancient Romans (Inferno, XV, 76), but the earliest relative he could mention by name was Cacciaguida degli Elisei (Paradiso, XV, 135), born no earlier than about 1100. Dante's father, Alaghiero[7] or Alighiero di Bellincione, was a White Guelph who suffered no reprisals after the Ghibellines won the Battle of Montaperti in the middle of the 13th?century. This suggests that Alighiero or his family may have enjoyed some protective prestige and status, although some suggest that the politically inactive Alighiero was of such low standing that he was not considered worth exiling.[8]\\r\\nDante's family was loyal to the Guelphs, a political alliance that supported the Papacy and which was involved in complex opposition to the Ghibellines, who were backed by the Holy Roman Emperor. The poet's mother was Bella, likely a member of the Abati family.[7] She died when Dante was not yet ten years old, and Alighiero soon married again, to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi. It is uncertain whether he really married her, since widowers were socially limited in such matters, but this woman definitely bore him two children, Dante's half-brother Francesco and half-sister Tana (Gaetana). When Dante was 12, he was promised in marriage to Gemma di Manetto Donati, daughter of Manetto Donati, member of the powerful Donati family.[7] Contracting marriages at this early age was quite common and involved a formal ceremony, including contracts signed before a notary. But by this time Dante had fallen in love with another, Beatrice Portinari (known also as Biceps), whom he first met when he was only nine. Years after his marriage to Gemma he claims to have met Beatrice again; he wrote several sonnets to Beatrice but never mentioned Gemma in any of his poems. The exact date of his marriage is not known: the only certain information is that, before his exile in 1301, he had three children (Pietro, Jacopo and Antonia).[7]\\r\\nDante fought with the Guelph cavalry at the Battle of Campaldino (June?11, 1289).[9] This victory brought about a reformation of the Florentine constitution. To take any part in public life, one had to enroll in one of the city's many commercial or artisan guilds, so Dante entered the Physicians' and Apothecaries' Guild. In the following years, his name is occasionally recorded as speaking or voting in the various councils of the republic. A substantial portion of minutes from such meetings in the years 1298ÿ1300 was lost, however, so the true extent of Dante's participation in the city's councils is uncertain.\\r\\nGemma bore Dante several children. Although several others subsequently claimed to be his offspring, it is likely that only Jacopo, Pietro, Giovanni, and Antonia were his actual children. Antonia later became a nun, taking the name Sister Beatrice.\\r\\nNot much is known about Dante's education; he presumably studied at home or in a chapter school attached to a church or monastery in Florence. It is known that he studied Tuscan poetry and that he admired the compositions of the Bolognese poet Guido Guinizelliwhom in Purgatorio XXVI he characterized as his \\"father\\"at a time when the Sicilian school (Scuola poetica Siciliana), a cultural group from Sicily, was becoming known in Tuscany. His interests brought him to discover the Proven?al poetry of the troubadours, such as Arnaut Daniel, and the Latin writers of classical antiquity, including Cicero, Ovid and especially Virgil.[10]\\r\\nDante said he first met Beatrice Portinari, daughter of Folco Portinari, at age nine, and claimed to have fallen in love with her \\"at first sight\\", apparently without even talking with her.[11] He saw her frequently after age 18, often exchanging greetings in the street, but never knew her well. In effect, he set an example of so-called courtly love, a phenomenon developed in French and Proven?al poetry of prior centuries. Dante's experience of such love was typical, but his expression of it was unique. It was in the name of this love that Dante left his imprint on the dolce stil novo (sweet new style, a term which Dante himself coined), and he would join other contemporary poets and writers in exploring never-before-emphasized aspects of love (Amore). Love for Beatrice (as Petrarch would show for Laura somewhat differently) would be his reason for poetry and for living, together with political passions. In many of his poems, she is depicted as semi-divine, watching over him constantly and providing spiritual instruction, sometimes harshly. When Beatrice died in 1290, Dante sought refuge in Latin literature.[12] The Convivio chronicles his having read Boethius's De consolatione philosophiae and Cicero's De Amicitia. He then dedicated himself to philosophical studies at religious schools like the Dominican one in Santa Maria Novella. He took part in the disputes that the two principal mendicant orders (Franciscan and Dominican) publicly or indirectly held in Florence, the former explaining the doctrines of the mystics and of St. Bonaventure, the latter expounding on the theories of St. Thomas Aquinas.[13]\\r\\nAt 18, Dante met Guido Cavalcanti, Lapo Gianni, Cino da Pistoia and soon after Brunetto Latini; together they became the leaders of the dolce stil novo. Brunetto later received special mention in the Divine Comedy (Inferno, XV, 28) for what he had taught Dante: Nor speaking less on that account I go With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are his most known and most eminent companions.[14] Some fifty poetical commentaries by Dante are known (the so-called Rime, rhymes), others being included in the later Vita Nuova and Convivio. Other studies are reported, or deduced from Vita Nuova or the Comedy, regarding painting and music.\\r\\nDante, like most Florentines of his day, was embroiled in the GuelphÿGhibelline conflict. He fought in the Battle of Campaldino (June 11, 1289), with the Florentine Guelphs against Arezzo Ghibellines;[9][15] then in 1294 he was among the escorts of Charles Martel of Anjou (grandson of Charles?I of Naples, more commonly called Charles of Anjou) while he was in Florence. To further his political career, he became a pharmacist. He did not intend to practice as one, but a law issued in 1295 required nobles aspiring to public office to be enrolled in one of the Corporazioni delle Arti e dei Mestieri, so Dante obtained admission to the Apothecaries' Guild. This profession was not inappropriate since at that time books were sold from apothecaries' shops. As a politician, he accomplished little but held various offices over some years in a city rife with political unrest.\\r\\nAfter defeating the Ghibellines, the Guelphs divided into two factions: the White Guelphs (Guelfi Bianchi)Dante's party, led by Vieri dei Cerchiand the Black Guelphs (Guelfi Neri), led by Corso Donati. Although the split was along family lines at first, ideological differences arose based on opposing views of the papal role in Florentine affairs, with the Blacks supporting the Pope and the Whites wanting more freedom from Rome. The Whites took power first and expelled the Blacks. In response, Pope Boniface VIII planned a military occupation of Florence. In 1301, Charles of Valois, brother of King Philip IV of France, was expected to visit Florence because the Pope had appointed him peacemaker for Tuscany. But the city's government had treated the Pope's ambassadors badly a few weeks before, seeking independence from papal influence. It was believed that Charles had received other unofficial instructions, so the council sent a delegation to Rome to ascertain the Pope's intentions. Dante was one of the delegates.\\r\\nPope Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time (November 1, 1301), Charles of Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs, who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies. A new Black Guelph government was installed, and Cante de' Gabrielli da Gubbio was appointed podest of the city. In March 1302, Dante, a White Guelph by affiliation, along with the Gherardini family, was condemned to exile for two years and ordered to pay a large fine.[16] Dante was accused of corruption and financial wrongdoing by the Black Guelphs for the time that Dante was serving as city prior (Florence's highest position) for two months in 1300.[17] The poet was still in Rome in 1302 where the Pope, who had backed the Black Guelphs, had \\"suggested\\" that Dante stay. Florence under the Black Guelphs therefore considered Dante an absconder.[18] Dante did not pay the fine, in part because he believed he was not guilty and in part because all his assets in Florence had been seized by the Black Guelphs. He was condemned to perpetual exile; if he returned to Florence without paying the fine, he could have been burned at the stake. (In June 2008, nearly seven centuries after his death, the city council of Florence passed a motion rescinding Dante's sentence.)[19]\\r\\nHe took part in several attempts by the White Guelphs to regain power, but these failed due to treachery. Dante, bitter at the treatment he received from his enemies, also grew disgusted with the infighting and ineffectiveness of his erstwhile allies and vowed to become a party of one. He went to Verona as a guest of Bartolomeo I della Scala, then moved to Sarzana in Liguria. Later he is supposed to have lived in Lucca with a woman called Gentucca, who made his stay comfortable (and was later gratefully mentioned in Purgatorio, XXIV, 37). Some speculative sources claim he visited Paris between 1308 and 1310, and other sources even less trustworthy took him to Oxford: these claims, first occurring in Boccaccio's book on Dante several decades after his death, seem inspired by readers who were impressed with the poet's wide learning and erudition. Evidently, Dante's command of philosophy and his literary interests deepened in exile and when he was no longer busy with the day-to-day business of Florentine domestic politics, and this is evidenced in his prose writings in this period, but there is no real evidence that he ever left Italy. Dante's Immensa Dei dilectione testante to Henry VII of Luxembourg confirms his residence \\"beneath the springs of Arno, near Tuscany\\" in March 1311.\\r\\nIn 1310, Holy Roman Emperor Henry VII of Luxembourg marched into Italy at the head of 5,000 troops. Dante saw in him a new Charlemagne who would restore the office of the Holy Roman Emperor to its former glory and also retake Florence from the Black Guelphs. He wrote to Henry and several Italian princes, demanding that they destroy the Black Guelphs. Mixing religion and private concerns in his writings, he invoked the worst anger of God against his city and suggested several particular targets that were also his personal enemies. It was during this time that he wrote De Monarchia, proposing a universal monarchy under Henry VII.\\r\\nAt some point during his exile, he conceived of the Comedy, but the date is uncertain. The work is much more assured and on a larger scale than anything he had produced in Florence; it is likely he would have undertaken such a work only after he realized his political ambitions, which had been central to him up to his banishment, had been halted for some time, possibly forever. It is also noticeable that Beatrice has returned to his imagination with renewed force and with a wider meaning than in the Vita Nuova; in Convivio (written c.1304ÿ07) he had declared that the memory of this youthful romance belonged to the past.\\r\\nAn early outside indication that the poem was underway is a notice by Francesco da Barberino, tucked into his Documenti d'Amore (Lessons of Love), written probably in 1314 or early 1315. Speaking of Virgil, Francesco notes in appreciative words that Dante followed the Roman classic in a poem called \\"Comedy\\" and that the setting of this poem (or part of it) was the underworld; i.e., hell.[20] The brief note gives no incontestable indication that he himself had seen or read even the Inferno or that this part had been published at the time, but it indicates composition was well underway and that the sketching of the poem might have begun some years before. (It has been suggested that a knowledge of Dante's work also underlies some of the illuminations in Francesco da Barberino's earlier Officiolum [c. 1305ÿ08], a manuscript that came to light only in 2003.[21]) We know that the Inferno had been published by 1317; this is established by quoted lines interspersed in the margins of contemporary dated records from Bologna, but there is no certainty as to whether the three parts of the poem were each published in full or, rather, a few cantos at a time. Paradiso seems to have been published posthumously.\\r\\nIn Florence, Baldo d'Aguglione pardoned most of the White Guelphs in exile and allowed them to return. However, Dante had gone too far in his violent letters to Arrigo (Henry VII) and his sentence was not revoked.\\r\\nIn 1312 Henry assaulted Florence and defeated the Black Guelphs, but there is no evidence that Dante was involved. Some say he refused to participate in the assault on his city by a foreigner; others suggest that he had become unpopular with the White Guelphs, too, and that any trace of his passage had carefully been removed. Henry VII died (from a fever) in 1313, and with him any hope for Dante to see Florence again. He returned to Verona, where Cangrande I della Scala allowed him to live in certain security and, presumably, in a fair degree of prosperity. Cangrande was admitted to Dante's Paradise (Paradiso, XVII, 76).\\r\\nDuring the period of his exile Dante corresponded with Dominican theologian Fr. Nicholas Brunacci OP [1240ÿ1322] who had been a student of Thomas Aquinas at the Santa Sabina studium in Rome, and later at Paris.[22][23] and of Albert the Great at the Cologne studium.[24] Brunacci became lector at the Santa Sabina studium, forerunner of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, and later served in the papal curia.[25]\\r\\nIn 1315, Florence was forced by Uguccione della Faggiuola (the military officer controlling the town) to grant an amnesty to those in exile, including Dante. But for this, Florence required public penance in addition to a heavy fine. Dante refused, preferring to remain in exile. When Uguccione defeated Florence, Dante's death sentence was commuted to house arrest on condition that he go to Florence to swear he would never enter the town again. He refused to go, and his death sentence was confirmed and extended to his sons. He still hoped late in life that he might be invited back to Florence on honorable terms. For Dante, exile was nearly a form of death, stripping him of much of his identity and his heritage. He addressed the pain of exile in Paradiso, XVII (55ÿ60), where Cacciaguida, his great-great-grandfather, warns him what to expect:\\r\\n... Tu lascerai ogne cosa diletta\\r\\npi caramente; e questo  quello strale\\r\\nche l'arco de lo essilio pria saetta.\\r\\nTu proverai s come sa di sale\\r\\nlo pane altrui, e come  duro calle\\r\\nlo scendere e 'l salir per l'altrui scale ...\\r\\n... You shall leave everything you love most:\\r\\nthis is the arrow that the bow of exile\\r\\nshoots first. You are to know the bitter taste\\r\\nof others' bread, how salty it is, and know\\r\\nhow hard a path it is for one who goes\\r\\nascending and descending others' stairs ...\\r\\nAs for the hope of returning to Florence, he describes it as if he had already accepted its impossibility (in Paradiso, XXV, 1ÿ9):\\r\\nSe mai continga che 'l poema sacro\\r\\nal quale ha posto mano e cielo e terra,\\r\\ns che m'ha fatto per molti anni macro,\\r\\nvinca la crudelt che fuor mi serra\\r\\ndel bello ovile ov'io dormi' agnello,\\r\\nnimico ai lupi che li danno guerra;\\r\\ncon altra voce omai, con altro vello\\r\\nritorner poeta, e in sul fonte\\r\\ndel mio battesmo prender 'l cappello ...\\r\\nIf it ever comes to pass that the sacred poem\\r\\nto which both heaven and earth have set their hand\\r\\nso as to have made me lean for many years\\r\\nshould overcome the cruelty that bars me\\r\\nfrom the fair sheepfold where I slept as a lamb,\\r\\nan enemy to the wolves that make war on it,\\r\\nwith another voice now and other fleece\\r\\nI shall return a poet and at the font\\r\\nof my baptism take the laurel crown ...\\r\\nAlighieri accepted Prince Guido Novello da Polenta's invitation to Ravenna in 1318. He finished Paradiso, and died in 1321 (aged 56) while returning to Ravenna from a diplomatic mission to Venice, possibly of malaria contracted there. He was buried in Ravenna at the Church of San Pier Maggiore (later called San Francesco). Bernardo Bembo, praetor of Venice, erected a tomb for him in 1483.\\r\\nOn the grave, some verses of Bernardo Canaccio, a friend of Dante, dedicated to Florence:\\r\\nparvi Florentia mater amoris\\r\\nFlorence, mother of little love\\r\\nThe first formal biography of Dante was the Vita di Dante (also known as Trattatello in laude di Dante), written after 1348 by Giovanni Boccaccio;[26] Although several statements and episodes of it have been deemed unreliable on the basis of modern research, an earlier account of Dante's life and works had been included in the Nuova Cronica of the Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani.[27]\\r\\nFlorence eventually came to regret Dante's exile, and the city made repeated requests for the return of his remains. The custodians of the body in Ravenna refused, at one point going so far as to conceal the bones in a false wall of the monastery. Nonetheless, a tomb was built for him in Florence in 1829, in the Basilica of Santa Croce. That tomb has been empty ever since, with Dante's body remaining in Ravenna, far from the land he had loved so dearly. The front of his tomb in Florence reads Onorate l'altissimo poetawhich roughly translates as \\"Honor the most exalted poet\\". The phrase is a quote from the fourth canto of the Inferno, depicting Virgil's welcome as he returns among the great ancient poets spending eternity in limbo. The ensuing line, L'ombra sua torna, ch'era dipartita (\\"his spirit, which had left us, returns\\"), is poignantly absent from the empty tomb.\\r\\nItaly's first dreadnought battleship was completed in 1913 and named Dante Alighieri in honor of him.\\r\\nOn April 30, 1921, in honor of the 600th anniversary of Dante's death, Pope Benedict XV promulgated an encyclical named In praeclara summorum, calling him one \\"of the many celebrated geniuses of whom the Catholic faith can boast\\" and the \\"pride and glory of humanity\\".[28]\\r\\nIn 2007, a reconstruction of Dante's face was undertaken in a collaborative project. Artists from Pisa University and engineers at the University of Bologna at Forl constructed the model, portraying Dante's features as somewhat different from what was once thought.[29][30]\\r\\nIn 2008, the Municipality of Florence officially apologized for expelling Dante 700 years earlier.[31]\\r\\nA celebration was held in 2015 for the 750th anniversary of his birth.[32][33]\\r\\nThe Divine Comedy describes Dante's journey through Hell (Inferno), Purgatory (Purgatorio), and Paradise (Paradiso); he is first guided by the Roman poet Virgil and then by Beatrice, the subject of his love (and of another of his works, La Vita Nuova). While the vision of Hell, the Inferno, is vivid for most modern readers, the theological niceties presented in the other books require a certain amount of patience and knowledge to appreciate. Purgatorio is arguably the most lyrical of the three, referencing more contemporary poets and artists than Inferno; Paradiso is the most heavily theological, and the one in which, many scholars have argued, the Divine Comedy's most beautiful and mystic passages appear (e.g., when Dante looks into the face of God: \\"all'alta fantasia qui manc possa\\"\\"at this high moment, ability failed my capacity to describe,\\" Paradiso, XXXIII, 142).\\r\\nWith its seriousness of purpose, its literary stature and the rangeboth stylistic and thematicof its content, the Comedy soon became a cornerstone in the evolution of Italian as an established literary language. Dante was more aware than most early Italian writers of the variety of Italian dialects and of the need to create a literature and a unified literary language beyond the limits of Latin writing at the time; in that sense, he is a forerunner of the Renaissance, with its effort to create vernacular literature in competition with earlier classical writers. Dante's in-depth knowledge (within the limits of his time) of Roman antiquity, and his evident admiration for some aspects of pagan Rome, also point forward to the 15th century. Ironically, while he was widely honored in the centuries after his death, the Comedy slipped out of fashion among men of letters: too medieval, too rough and tragic, and not stylistically refined in the respects that the high and late Renaissance came to demand of literature.\\r\\nHe wrote the Comedy in a language he called \\"Italian\\", in some sense an amalgamated literary language mostly based on the regional dialect of Tuscany, but with some elements of Latin and other regional dialects.[34] He deliberately aimed to reach a readership throughout Italy including laymen, clergymen and other poets. By creating a poem of epic structure and philosophic purpose, he established that the Italian language was suitable for the highest sort of expression. In French, Italian is sometimes nicknamed la langue de Dante. Publishing in the vernacular language marked Dante as one of the first in Roman Catholic Western Europe (among others such as Geoffrey Chaucer and Giovanni Boccaccio) to break free from standards of publishing in only Latin (the language of liturgy, history and scholarship in general, but often also of lyric poetry). This break set a precedent and allowed more literature to be published for a wider audience, setting the stage for greater levels of literacy in the future. However, unlike Boccaccio, Milton or Ariosto, Dante did not really become an author read all over Europe until the Romantic era. To the Romantics, Dante, like Homer and Shakespeare, was a prime example of the \\"original genius\\" who sets his own rules, creates persons of overpowering stature and depth, and goes far beyond any imitation of the patterns of earlier masters; and who, in turn, cannot truly be imitated. Throughout the 19th century, Dante's reputation grew and solidified; and by 1865, the 600th anniversary of his birth, he had become established as one of the greatest literary icons of the Western world.\\r\\nNew readers often wonder how such a serious work may be called a \\"comedy\\". In the classical sense the word comedy refers to works which reflect belief in an ordered universe, in which events tend toward not only a happy or amusing ending but one influenced by a Providential will that orders all things to an ultimate good. By this meaning of the word, as Dante himself wrote in a letter to Cangrande I della Scala, the progression of the pilgrimage from Hell to Paradise is the paradigmatic expression of comedy, since the work begins with the pilgrim's moral confusion and ends with the vision of God.\\r\\nDante's other works include Convivio (\\"The Banquet\\"),[35] a collection of his longest poems with an (unfinished) allegorical commentary; Monarchia,[36] a summary treatise of political philosophy in Latin which was condemned and burned after Dante's death[37][38] by the Papal Legate Bertrando del Poggetto, which argues for the necessity of a universal or global monarchy in order to establish universal peace in this life, and this monarchy's relationship to the Roman Catholic Church as guide to eternal peace; De vulgari eloquentia (\\"On the Eloquence of Vernacular\\"),[39] on vernacular literature, partly inspired by the Razos de trobar of Raimon Vidal de Bezaudun; and La Vita Nuova (\\"The New Life\\"),[40] the story of his love for Beatrice Portinari, who also served as the ultimate symbol of salvation in the Comedy. The Vita Nuova contains many of Dante's love poems in Tuscan, which was not unprecedented; the vernacular had been regularly used for lyric works before, during all the thirteenth century. However, Dante's commentary on his own work is also in the vernacularboth in the Vita Nuova and in the Convivioinstead of the Latin that was almost universally used. References to Divina Commedia are in the format (book, canto, verse), e.g., (Inferno, XV, 76).","input":"Who was dante what is he most famous for writing?"},{"output":"325 000 troops","context":"Central Powers victory\\r\\n\\r\\n?Russian Empire (1914ÿ17)?Russian Republic (1917)?Romania (1916ÿ17) Belgium (1915ÿ17)?British Empire (1916ÿ17)\\r\\n\\r\\n1915\\r\\n\\r\\n1916\\r\\n\\r\\n1917\\r\\n\\r\\n1918\\r\\n\\r\\nNaval warfare\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eastern Front or Eastern Theater of World War I (Russian: Ҿ۷ֳ Ѿ, Vostochn?y front, sometimes called the Second Fatherland War or Second Patriotic War (Russian: Ҿ ҿۿ־ ־񳭷, Vtoraya Otechestvennaya voyna) in Russian sources)[18] was a theatre of operations that encompassed at its greatest extent the entire frontier between the Russian Empire and Romania on one side and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and the German Empire on the other. It stretched from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south, included most of Eastern Europe and stretched deep into Central Europe as well. The term contrasts with \\"Western Front\\", which was being fought in Belgium and France.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 1910, Russian General Yuri Danilov developed \\"Plan 19\\" under which four armies would invade East Prussia. This plan was criticised as Austria-Hungary could be a greater threat than the German Empire. So instead of four armies invading East Prussia, the Russians planned to send two armies to East Prussia, and two Armies to defend against Austro-Hungarian forces invading from Galicia. In the opening months of the war, the Imperial Russian Army attempted an invasion of eastern Prussia in the northwestern theater, only to be beaten back by the Germans after some initial success. At the same time, in the south, they successfully invaded Galicia, defeating the Austro-Hungarian forces there.[19] In Russian Poland, the Germans failed to take Warsaw. But by 1915, the German and Austro-Hungarian armies were on the advance, dealing the Russians heavy casualties in Galicia and in Poland, forcing it to retreat. Grand Duke Nicholas was sacked from his position as the commander-in-chief and replaced by the Tsar himself.[20] Several offensives against the Germans in 1916 failed, including Lake Naroch Offensive and the Baranovichi Offensive. However, General Aleksei Brusilov oversaw a highly successful operation against Austria-Hungary that became known as the Brusilov Offensive, which saw the Russian Army make large gains.[21][22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Romania entered the war in August 1916. The Entente promised the region of Transylvania (which was part of Austria-Hungary) in return for Romanian support. The Romanian Army invaded Transylvania and had initial successes, but was forced to stop and was pushed back by the Germans and Austro-Hungarians when Bulgaria attacked them in the south. Meanwhile, a revolution occurred in Russia in February 1917 (one of the several causes being the hardships of the war). Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate and a Russian Provisional Government was founded, with Georgy Lvov as its first leader, who was eventually replaced by Alexander Kerensky.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newly formed Russian Republic continued to fight the war alongside Romania and the rest of the Entente until it was overthrown by the Bolsheviks in October 1917. Kerensky oversaw the July Offensive, which was largely a failure and caused a collapse in the Russian Army. The new government established by the Bolsheviks signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers, taking it out of the war and making large territorial concessions. Romania was also forced to surrender and signed a similar treaty, though both of the treaties were nullified with the surrender of the Central Powers in November 1918.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe front in the east was much longer than that in the west. The theater of war was roughly delimited by the Baltic Sea in the west and Minsk in the east, and Saint Petersburg in the north and the Black Sea in the south, a distance of more than 1,600 kilometres (990?mi). This had a drastic effect on the nature of the warfare.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile World War I on the Western Front developed into trench warfare, the battle lines on the Eastern Front were much more fluid and trenches never truly developed. This was because the greater length of the front ensured that the density of soldiers in the line was lower so the line was easier to break. Once broken, the sparse communication networks made it difficult for the defender to rush reinforcements to the rupture in the line, mounting rapid counteroffensives to seal off any breakthrough.\\r\\n\\r\\nPropaganda was a key component of the culture of World War I. It was most commonly deployed through the state-controlled media to glorify the homeland and demonize the enemy. Propaganda often took the form of images which portrayed stereotypes from folklore about the enemy or from glorified moments from the nation's history. On the Eastern Front, propaganda took many forms such as opera, film, spy fiction, theater, spectacle, war novels and graphic art. Across the Eastern Front the amount of propaganda used in each country varied from state to state. Propaganda took many forms within each country and was distributed by many different groups. Most commonly the state produced propaganda, but other groups, such as anti-war organizations, also generated propaganda.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the outbreak of war, German strategy was based almost entirely on the Schlieffen Plan. With the Franco-Russian Agreement in place, Germany knew that war with either of these combatants would result in war with the other, which meant that there would be war in both the west and the east. Therefore, the German General Staff, Alfred von Schlieffen, planned a quick, all-out ground war on the Western Front to take France and, upon victory, Germany would turn its attention to Russia in the east.\\r\\nVon Schlieffen believed Russia would not be ready or willing to move against and attack Germany due to the huge losses of military equipment that Russia suffered in the Russo-Japanese war, her low population density and lack of railroads.\\r\\n\\r\\nConversely, the German Navy believed it could be victorious over Britain with Russian neutrality, something which von Moltke knew would not be possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the immediate years preceding the First World War, the kingdom of Romania was involved in the Second Balkan War on the side of Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and the Ottoman Empire against Bulgaria. The Treaty of Bucharest, signed on August 10, 1913, ended the Balkan conflict and added 6,960 square kilometers to Romanias territory.[25] Although militarized, Romania decided upon a policy of neutrality at the start of the First World War, mainly due to having territorial interests in both Austria-Hungary (Transylvania and Bukovina) and in Russia (Bessarabia). Strong cultural influences also affected Romanian leanings, however. King Carol I, as a Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, favoured his Germanic roots, while the Romanian people, influenced by their Orthodox church and Latin-based language, were inclined to join France. Perhaps King Carols attempts at joining the war on the side of the Central powers would have been fruitful had he not died in 1914, but Romanian disenchantment with Austria-Hungary had already influenced public and political opinion. French endorsement of Romanian action against Bulgaria, and support of the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest was particularly effective at inclining Romania towards the Entente. Furthermore, Russian courting of Romanian sympathies, exemplified by the visit of the Tsar to Constanta on June 14, 1914, signaled in a new era of positive relations between the two countries.[26] Nevertheless, King Ferdinand I of Romania maintained a policy of neutrality, intending to gain the most for Romania by negotiating between competing powers. According to historian John Keegan, the enticements offered by the Allies were never concrete, for in secret, Russia and France agreed not to honor any conventions when the end of the war came.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immediate reason for Russia's involvement in the First World War was a direct result of the decisions made by the statesmen and generals during July 1914. The July crisis was the culmination of a series of diplomatic conflicts that took place in the decades prior to 1914, and this is fundamental to an understanding of Russia's position immediately prior to the War. According to D. C. Lieven, Russia was formidable and was able to back up her diplomatic policies with force. In 1870ÿ1914, the four leading powers in Europe were Russia, Prussia, Austria and France, each of whom exercised a similar proportion of power at the time. One of the most significant factors in bringing Russia to the brink of war was the downfall of her economy.[28] The 20 percent jump in defense expenditure during 1866ÿ77 and in 1871-5 forced them to change their position within Europe and shift the balance of power out of her favour.[29] At the time, Russian infrastructure was backward and the Russian government had to invest far more than its European rivals in structural changes. In addition there were overwhelming burdens of defense, which would ultimately result in an economic downfall for the Russians. This was a major strain on the Russian population, but also served as a direct threat to military expenditure.[30] Thus the only way the Russians could sustain the strains of European war would be to place more emphasis on foreign investment from the French who essentially came to Russia's aid for industrial change.[31] The Franco-Russian Alliance allowed for the Russian defense to grow and aid the European balance of power during the growth of the German Empire's might. In 1914, Germany was the most powerful state in all of Europe. Nevertheless, one of the key factors was that of the Russian foreign policy between 1890 and 1914.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order for the Russians to legitimise their war efforts the government constructed an image of the enemy through state instituted propaganda. Their main aim was to help overcome the legend of the invincible German war machine, in order to boost the morale of civilians and soldiers. Russian propaganda often took the form of showing the Germans as a civilised nation, with barbaric inhuman traits. Russian propaganda also exploited the image of the Russian POWs who were in the German camps, again in order to boost the morale of their troops, serving as encouragement to defeat the enemy and to get their fellow soldiers out of the inhuman German POW camps.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn element of the Russian propaganda was the Investigate Commission formed in April 1915. It was led by Aleksei Krivtsov and the study was tasked with the job of studying the legal violations committed by of the Central Powers and then getting this information to the Russian public. This commission published photographs of letters that were allegedly found on fallen German soldiers. These letters document the German correspondents saying to take no prisoners. A museum was also set up in Petrograd, which displayed pictures that showed how inhumanly the Germans were treating prisoners of war.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustria-Hungary's participation in the outbreak of World War I has been neglected by historians, as emphasis has traditionally been placed on Germany's role as the prime instigator.[33] However, the \\"spark\\" that ignited the First World War is attributed to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip, which took place on June 28, 1914. Approximately a month later, on July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. This act led to a series of events that would quickly expand into the First World War; thus, the Habsburg government in Vienna initiated the pivotal decision that would begin the conflict.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe causes of the Great War have generally been defined in diplomatic terms, but certain deep-seated issues in Austria-Hungary undoubtedly contributed to the beginnings of the First World War.[34] The Austro-Hungarian situation in the Balkans pre-1914 is a primary factor in its involvement in the war. The movement towards South Slav unity was a major problem for the Habsburg Empire, which was facing increasing nationalist pressure from its multinational populace. As Europe's third largest state, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was hardly homogeneous; comprising over fifty million people and eleven nationalities, the Empire was a conglomeration of a number of diverse cultures, languages, and peoples.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecifically, the South Slavic people of Austria-Hungary desired to amalgamate with Serbia in an effort to officially solidify their shared cultural heritage. Over seven million South Slavs lived inside the Empire, while three million lived outside it.[36] With the growing emergence of nationalism in the twentieth century, unity of all South Slavs looked promising. This tension is exemplified by Conrad von H?tzendorf's letter to Franz Ferdinand:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unification of the South Slav race is one of the powerful national movements which can neither be ignored nor kept down. The question can only be, whether unification will take place within the boundaries of the Monarchy ÿ that is at the expense of Serbia's independence ÿ or under Serbia's leadership at the expense of the Monarchy. The cost to the Monarchy would be the loss of its South Slav provinces and thus of almost its entire coastline. The loss of territory and prestige would relegate the Monarchy to the status of a small power.[37]\\r\\nThe annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908 by Austrian foreign minister Baron von Aehrenthal in an effort to assert domination over the Balkans inflamed Slavic nationalism and angered Serbia. Bosnia-Herzegovina became a \\"rallying cry\\" for South Slavs, with hostilities between Austria-Hungary and Serbia steadily increasing.[38] The situation was ripe for conflict, and when the Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated Austrian imperial heir, Franz Ferdinand, these longstanding hostilities culminated into an all-out war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Allied Powers wholeheartedly supported the Slavs' nationalistic fight. George Macaulay Trevelyan, a British historian, saw Serbia's war against Austria-Hungary as a \\"war of liberation\\" that would \\"free South Slavs from tyranny.\\"[39] In his own words: \\"If ever there was a battle for freedom, there is such a battle now going on in Southeastern Europe against Austrian and Magyar. If this war ends in the overthrow of the Magyar tyranny, an immense step forward will have been taken toward racial liberty and European peace.\\"[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 1914, the Russians lack of success in war and diplomacy in the six decades before 1914 sapped the countrys moral strength. The triumphs of Britain and Germany in the martial, diplomatic and economic spheres put these countries in the front rank of the world's leading nations.[41] This was a source of national pride, self-confidence and unity. It helped reconcile the worker to the state and the Bavarian or Scotsman to rule from Berlin or London.\\r\\nIn the years prior to 1914, Austro-Russian co-operation was both crucial for European peace and difficult to maintain. Old suspicions exacerbated by the Bosnian crisis stood in the way of agreement between the two empires, as did ethnic sensitivities. Russias historical role as liberator of the Balkans was difficult to square with Austrias determination to control adjacent territories. [42] In 1913ÿ1914 Saint Petersburg was too concerned with its own weakness and what it saw as threats to vital Russian interests, to spare much thought for Viennas feelings. The Russians were, with some justice, indignant that the concessions they had made after the First Balkan War in the interest of European peace had not been reciprocated by the Central Powers.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was doubly dangerous given the growing evidence flowing into Petersburg about Germanys aggressive intentions. Both Bazarov and the agents of the Russian secret political police in Germany reported the concern aroused in public opinion by the press war against Russia, which raged in the spring of 1914.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian military was the largest in the world consisting of 1.4 million men prior to the war. They could also mobilize up to 5 million men, but only had 4.6 million rifles to give them. It also had poor leadership.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe war in the east began with the Russian invasion of East Prussia on 17 August 1914 and the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia.[45] The first effort quickly turned to a defeat following the Battle of Tannenberg in August 1914.[46] A second Russian incursion into Galicia was completely successful, with the Russians controlling almost all of that region by the end of 1914, routing four Austrian armies in the process. Under the command of Nikolai Ivanov and Aleksei Brusilov, the Russians won the Battle of Galicia in September and began the Siege of Przemy?l, the next fortress on the road towards Krak܇w.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis early Russian success in 1914 on the Austro-Russian border was a reason for concern to the Central Powers and caused considerable German forces to be transferred to the East to take pressure off the Austrians, leading to the creation of the new German Ninth Army. At the end of 1914, the main focus of the fighting shifted to central part of Russian Poland, west of the river Vistula.[48] The October Battle of the Vistula River and the November Battle of ?܇d? brought little advancement for the Germans, but at least kept the Russians at a safe distance.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies continued to clash in and near the Carpathian Mountains throughout the winter of 1914ÿ1915. Przemysl fortress managed to hold out deep behind enemy lines throughout this period, with the Russians bypassing it in order to attack the Austro-Hungarian troops further to the west. They made some progress, crossing the Carpathians in February and March 1915, but then the German relief helped the Austrians stop further Russian advances. In the meantime, Przemysl was almost entirely destroyed and the Siege of Przemysl ended in a defeat for the Austrians.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1915 the German command decided to make its main effort on the Eastern Front, and accordingly transferred considerable forces there. To eliminate the Russian threat the Central Powers began the campaign season of 1915 with the successful Gorlice-Tarnow Offensive in Galicia in May 1915.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes, the German and Austro-Hungarian troops in the Eastern Front functioned under a unified command. The offensive soon turned into a general advance and a corresponding strategic retreat by the Russian Army. The cause of the reverses suffered by the Russian Army was not so much errors in the tactical sphere, as the deficiency in technical equipment, particularly in artillery and ammunition as well as the corruption and incompetence of the Russian officers. Only by 1916 did the buildup of Russian war industries increase production of war material and improve the supply situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy mid-1915, the Russians had been expelled from Russian Poland and hence pushed hundreds of kilometers away from the borders of the Central Powers, removing the threat of Russian invasion of Germany or Austria-Hungary. At the end of 1915 German-Austrian advance was stopped on the line RigaÿJakobstadtÿDnaburgÿBaranovichiÿPinskÿDubnoÿTernopil. The general outline of this front line did not change until the Russian collapse in 1917.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Battle of Sarikamish, the Russo-Turkish front quickly turned in favor of Russian forces. The Turks were concerned with reorganizing their army and committing the Armenian Genocide.[51] Meanwhile, Russia was preoccupied with other armies on the Eastern Front. However, the appointment of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich as Viceroy and Commander in the Caucasus in September 1915 revived the situation of the Russo-Turkish front.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Allies withdrew from Gallipoli in December, the Caucasus Army's Chief of Staff General Nikolai Yudenich believed Turkish forces would take action against his army. This concern was legitimate: Bulgaria's entry into the war as Germany's ally in October caused serious alarm, as a land route from Germany to Turkey was now open and would allow for an unrestricted flow of German weapons to the Turks.[51] A \\"window of opportunity\\" appeared that would allow the Russians to destroy the Turkish Third Army, as the British required assistance in Mesopotamia (now modern day Iraq). Britain's efforts to besiege Baghdad had been halted at Ctesiphon, and they were forced to retreat. This led to an increasing number of attacks by Turkish forces. The British requested the Russians to attack in an attempt to distract the Turks, and Yudenich agreed. The resulting offensive began on January 10, 1916.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis offensive was unanticipated by the Turks, as it was in the middle of winter. The Turkish situation was exacerbated by the Third Army's commander Kamil Pasha and Chief of Staff Major Guse absence. Coupled with an imbalance of forces ÿ the Russians had 325 000 troops, while the Turks only 78 000 ÿ the situation appeared grim for the Central Powers.[52] After three months of fighting, the Russians captured the city of Trabzon on April 18, 1916.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllied operations in 1916 were dictated by an urgent need to force Germany to transfer forces from its Western to Eastern fronts, to relieve the pressure on the French at the Battle of Verdun. This was to be accomplished by a series of Russian offensives which would force the Germans to deploy additional forces to counter them. The first such operation was the Lake Naroch Offensive in MarchÿApril 1916, which ended in failure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian operations during 1916 had one extraordinarily positive result: Austrian divisions were pulled away from the Russian southern front. This allowed the Russian forces to organize a counter-offensive. The Brusilov Offensive was a large tactical assault carried out by Russian forces against Austro-Hungarian forces in Galicia. General Aleksei Brusilov believed victory against the Central Powers was possible if close attention was paid to preparation. Brusilov suggested that the Russians should attack on a wide front, and to position their trenches a mere seventy-five yard away from Austrian trenches.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrusilov's plan worked impeccably. The Russians outnumbered the Austrians 200,000 to 150,000, and held a considerable advantage in guns, with 904 large guns to 600. Most importantly innovative new tactics similar to those independently invented by Erwin Rommel were used to perform quick and effective close-range surprise attacks that allowed a steady advance.[54] The Russian Eighth Army overwhelmed the Austrian Fourth and pushed on to Lutsk, advancing forty miles beyond the starting position. Over a million Austrians were lost, with over 500,000 men killed or taken prisoner by mid-June.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Brusilov Offensive was initially successful, it slowed down considerably. An inadequate number of troops and poorly maintained supply lines hindered Brusilov's ability to follow up on the initial victories in June. The Brusilov Offensive is considered to be the greatest Russian victory of the First World War.[22]:52 Although it cost the Russians half a million casualties, the offensive successfully diverted substantial forces of the Central Powers from the Western front, and persuaded Romania to join the war, diverting even more Central Powers forces to the East.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nRomania may be the turning point of the campaign. If the Germans fail there it will be the greatest disaster inflicted upon them. Afterwards it will only be a question of time. But should Germany succeed, I hesitate to think what the effect will be on the fortunes of our campaign.  and yet no one seems to have thought it his particular duty to prepare a plan.\\r\\nUp until 1916, the Romanians followed the tides of war with interest, while attempting to situate themselves in the most advantageous position. French and Russian diplomats had begun courting the Romanians early on, but persuasion tactics gradually intensified. For King Ferdinand to commit his force of half a million men, he expected the Allies to offer a substantial incentive.[57] Playing on Romanian anti-Hungarian sentiment the Allies promised the Austria-Hungarian territory of Ardeal (Transylvania) to Romania. Transylvanian demographics strongly favoured the Romanians. Romania succumbed to Allied enticement on August 18, 1916.[58] Nine days later, on August 27, Romanian troops marched into Transylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\nRomania's entry into the war provoked major strategic changes for the Germans. In September 1916, German troops were mobilized to the Eastern Front. Additionally, the German Chief of the General Staff, General Erich Von Falkenhayn was forced to resign from office in order to command the combined Central Powers forces against Romania, along with General August von Mackensen. Kaiser Wilhelm II immediately replaced Falkenhayn with Paul von Hindenburg.[59] Von Hindenburg's deputy, the more adept Erich Ludendorff, was given effective control of the army and ordered to advance on Romania. On September 3, the first troops of the Central Powers marched into Romanian territory. Simultaneously, the Bulgarian Air Force commenced an incessant bombing of Bucharest.[60] In an attempt to relieve some pressure, French and British forces launched a new offensive known as the Battle of the Somme, while the Brusilov Offensive continued in the East.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is certain that so relatively small a state as Rumania had never before been given a role so important, and, indeed, so decisive for the history of the world at so favorable a moment. Never before had two Great Powers like Germany and Austria found themselves so much at the mercy of the military resources of a country which had scarcely one twentieth of the population of the two great states. Judging by the military situation, it was to be expected that Rumania had only to advance where she wished to decide the world war in favor of those Powers which had been hurling themselves at us in vain for years. Thus everything seemed to depend on whether Rumania was ready to make any sort of use of her momentary advantage.\\r\\nThe entrance of Romania into the war was disconcerting for von Hindenburg. On September 15, Paul von Hindenburg issued the following order, stating that: \\"The main task of the Armies is now to hold fast all positions on the Western, Eastern, Italian and Macedonian Fronts, and to employ all other available forces against Rumania.\\"[62] Fortunately for the Central Powers, the quantity and quality of the Romanian Army was overestimated. Although numbering half a million men, the Romanian Army suffered from poor training and a lack of appropriate equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial success of the Romanian Army in Austria-Hungarian territory was quickly undermined by the Central Powers. German and Austro-Hungarian troops advanced from the north, while Bulgarian-Turkish-German forces marched into Romania from the south. Although thought to be a tactical blunder by contemporaries, the Romanians opted to mount operations in both directions.[63] By the middle of November the German force passed through the Carpathians, suffering significant casualties due to determined Romanian resistance. By December 5, Bulgarian troops had crossed the Danube and were approaching the capital, Bucharest. At the same time as the Austro-Hungarian troops moved east, and as the Bulgarians marched north, the Turks had sent in two army divisions by sea to the Dobruja from the east.[64] Eventually, the Romanian forces were pushed back behind the Siret in northern Moldavia.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy January 1917, the ranks of the Romanian army had been significantly thinned. Roughly 150,000 Romanian soldiers had been taken prisoner, 200,000 men were dead or wounded, and lost two thirds of their country, including the capital.[65] Importantly, the Ploie?ti oilfields, the only significant source of oil in Europe west of the Black Sea, had been destroyed before they were abandoned to the Central Powers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian February Revolution aimed to topple the Russian monarchy and resulted in the creation of the Provisional Government. The revolution was a turning point in Russian history, and its significance and influence can still be felt in many countries today.[66] Although many Russians wanted a revolution, no one had expected it to happen when it did ÿ let alone how it did.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn International Women's Day, Thursday, February 23, 1917/March 8, 1917, as many as 90,000 female workers in the city of Petrograd left their factory jobs and marched through the streets, shouting \\"Bread\\", \\"Down with the autocracy!\\" and \\"Stop the War!\\" These women were tired, hungry, and angry,[67] after working long hours in miserable conditions to feed their families because their menfolk were fighting at the front. They were not alone in demanding change; more than 150,000 men and women took to the streets to protest the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Saturday, February 25, the city of Petrograd was essentially shut down. No one was allowed to work or wanted to work.[68] Even though there were a few incidents of police and soldiers firing into the crowds, those groups soon mutinied and joined the protesters.[69] Tsar Nicholas II, who was not in Petrograd during the revolution, heard reports of the protests but chose not to take them seriously. By March 1, it was obvious to everyone except the czar himself, that his rule was over. On March 2 it was made official.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early July 1917, on the Romanian front, a relatively small area, there was one of the largest concentrations of combat forces and means known during the conflagration: nine armies, 80 infantry divisions with 974 battalions, 19 cavalry divisions with 550 squadrons and 923 artillery batteries, whose effectives numbered some 800,000 men, with about one million in their immediate reserve. The three great battles, decisive for the Romanian nation's destiny, delivered at M?r??ti, M?r??e?ti and Oituz represented a turning point in the world war on the Eastern front. These battles, named by the localities and zones where they took place, were fought approximately on the front alignment stabilized in early 1917, which the conflicting sides had thoroughly consolidated for half a year.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween late July and early September, the Romanian Army fought the battles of M?r??ti, M?r??e?ti and Oituz, managing to stop the German-Austro-Hungarian advance, inflicting heavy losses in the process and winning the most important Allied victories on the Eastern Front in 1917.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of these operations, the remaining Romanian territories remained unoccupied, tying down nearly 1,000,000 Central Powers troops and prompting The Times to describe the Romanian front as \\"The only point of light in the East\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 7, 1918, in light of the existing politico-military situation, Romania was forced to conclude the Treaty of Bucharest with the Central Powers, imposing harsh conditions on the country but recognizing its union with Bessarabia. Alexandru Marghiloman became the new German-sponsored Prime Minister. King Ferdinand, however, refused to sign the treaty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans were able to repair the oil fields around Ploie?ti and by the end of the war had pumped a million tons of oil. They also requisitioned two million tons of grain from Romanian farmers. These materials were vital in keeping Germany in the war to the end of 1918.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy September 1917, just months after the February Revolution, Lenin believed the Russian people were ready for another revolution, this time on Marxist principles.[73] On October 10, at a secret meeting of the Bolshevik party leaders, Lenin used all his power to convince the others that it was time for armed insurrection. Troops who were loyal to the Bolsheviks took control of the telegraph stations, power stations, strategic bridges, post offices, train stations, and state banks.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nPetrograd was officially in the hands of the Bolsheviks, who greatly increased their organization in factory groups and in many barracks throughout Petrograd. They concentrated on devising a plan for overturning the Provisional Government, with a coup dtat.[75] On October 24, Lenin emerged from hiding in a suburb, entered the city, set up his headquarters at the Smolny Institute and worked to complete his three-phase plan. With the main bridges and the main railways secured, only the Winter Palace, and with it the Provisional Government, remained to be taken. On the evening of November 7, the troops that were loyal to the Bolsheviks infiltrated the Winter Palace. After an almost bloodless coup, the Bolsheviks were the new leaders of Russia.[75] Lenin announced that the new regime would end the war, abolish all private land ownership, and create a system for workers' control over the factories.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 November 1917, the Communist Bolsheviks took power under their leader Vladimir Lenin. Lenins new Bolshevik government tried to end the war, with a ceasefire being declared on December 15, 1917 along lines agreed in November. At the same time Bolsheviks launched a full-scale military offensive against its opponents: Ukraine and separatist governments in the Don region. During the peace negotiations between Soviets and Central Powers, the Germans demanded enormous concessions, eventually resulting in the failure of the long-drawn-out peace negotiations on February 17, 1918. At the same time the Central Powers concluded a military treaty with Ukraine which was losing ground in the fight with invading Bolshevik forces. [76] The Russian Civil War, which started just after November 1917, would tear apart Russia for three years. As a result of the events during 1917, many groups opposed to Lenins Bolsheviks had formed. With the fall of Nicholas II, many parts of the Russian Empire took the opportunity to declare their independence, one of which was Finland, which did so in December 1917; however, Finland too collapsed into a civil war. Finland declared itself independent Dec. 6th 1917, and this was accepted by Lenin a month later.\\r\\nThe Finnish Parliament elected a German prince as King of Finland. However, the Socialists (The Reds) and the Whites in Finland fell into war with each other in January 1918. The Reds wanted Finland to be a Soviet republic, and was aided by Russian forces still in Finland.\\r\\nThe Whites of Finland were led by General Carl Gustaf Mannerheim, a Finnish baron who had been in the Tsars service since he was 15 years old.\\r\\nThe Whites were also offered help by a German Expeditionary Corps led by the German General Goltz. Mannerheim never approved this. The German corps landed in Finland in April 1918.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the disintegration of the Russian imperial army and navy in 1917, the Council of People's Commissars headed by Leon Trotsky set about creating a new army. By a decree on January 28, 1918 the council created the Workers' and Peoples' Red Army; it began recruitment on a voluntary basis, but on April 22, the Soviet government made serving in the army compulsory for anyone who did not employ hired labor. While the majority of the army was made up of workers and peasants, many of the Red Army's officers had served a similar function in the imperial army before its collapse.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the German Army just 85 miles (137?km) from the Russian capital Petrograd (St. Petersburg) on March 3, 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed and the Eastern Front ceased to be a war zone. While the treaty was practically obsolete before the end of the year, it did provide some relief to the Bolsheviks, who were embroiled in a civil war, and affirmed the independence of Ukraine. However, Estonia and Latvia were intended to become a United Baltic Duchy to be ruled by German princes and German nobility as fiefdoms under the German Kaiser. Finland's sovereignty had already been declared in December 1917, and accepted by most nations, including France and the Soviet Union, but not by the United Kingdom and the United States. The Germans were able to transfer substantial forces to the west in order to mount an offensive in France in the spring of 1918.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis offensive on the Western Front failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough, and the arrival of more and more American units in Europe was sufficient to offset the German advantage. Even after the Russian collapse, about a million German soldiers remained tied up in the east until the end of the war, attempting to run a short-lived addition to the German Empire in Europe. In the end, Germany and Austria lost all their captured lands, and more, under various treaties (such as the Treaty of Versailles) signed after the armistice in 1918.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn comparison to the attention directed to the role played by women on the Western Front during the First World War, the role of women in the east has garnered limited scholarly focus. It is estimated that 20 percent of the Russian industrial working class was conscripted into the army; therefore, women's share of industrial jobs increased dramatically. There were percentage increases in every industry, but the most noticeable increase happened in industrial labour, which increased from 31.4 percent in 1913 to 45 percent in 1918.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen also fought on the Eastern Front. In the later stages of Russia's participation in the war, Russia began forming all-woman combat units, the Women's Battalions, in part to fight plummeting morale among male soldiers by demonstrating Russian women's willingness to fight. In Romania, Ecaterina Teodoroiu actively fought in the Romanian Army and is remembered today as a national hero.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish nursing efforts were not limited to the Western Front. Nicknamed the \\"Gray partridges\\" in reference to their dark gray overcoats, Scottish volunteer nurses arrived in Romania in 1916 under the leadership of Elsie Inglis. In addition to nursing injured personnel, Scottish nurses manned transport vehicles and acted as regimental cooks.[79] The \\"Gray Partridges\\" were well respected by Romanian, Serbian and Russian troops and as a result, the Romanian press went as far as to characterize them as \\"healthy, masculine, and tanned women.\\" As a testament to her abilities, Elsie Inglis and her volunteers were entrusted to turn an abandoned building in the city of Galati into an operational hospital, which they did in a little more than a day.[80] Yvonne Fitzroy's published journal, \\"With the Scottish Nurses in Roumania,\\" provides an excellent first hand account Scottish nursing activities in the Eastern Front.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War I, approximately 200,000 German soldiers and 2.5 million soldiers from the Austro-Hungarian army entered Russian captivity. During the 1914 Russian campaign the Russians began taking thousands of Austrian prisoners. As a result, the Russian authorities made emergency facilities in Kiev, Penza, Kazan, and later Turkestan to hold the Austrian prisoners of war. As the war continued Russia began to detain soldiers from Germany as well as a growing number from the Austro-Hungarian army. The Tsarist state saw the large population of POWs as a workforce that could benefit the war economy in Russia. Many POWs were employed as farm laborers and miners in Donbas and Krivoi Rog. However, the majority of POWs were employed as laborers constructing canals and building railroads. The living and working environments for these POWs was bleak. There was a shortage of food, clean drinking water and proper medical care. During the summer months malaria was a major problem, and the malnutrition among the POWs led to many cases of scurvy. While working on the Murmansk rail building project over 25,000 POWs died. Information about the bleak conditions of the labor camps reached the German and Austro-Hungarian governments. They began to complain about the treatment of POWs. The Tsarist authorities initially refused to acknowledge the German and Habsburg governments. They rejected their claims because Russian POWs were working on railway construction in Serbia. However, they slowly agreed to stop using prison labor.[82] Life in the camps was extremely rough for the men who resided in them. The Tsarist government could not provide adequate supplies for the men living in their POW camps. The Russian government's inability to supply the POWs in their camps with supplies was due to inadequate resources and bureaucratic rivalries. However, the conditions in the POW camps varied; some were more bearable than others.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nDisease played a critical role in the loss of life on the Eastern Front. In the East, disease accounted for approximately four times the number of deaths caused by direct combat, in contrast to the three to one ratio in the West.[83] Malaria, cholera, and dysentery contributed to the epidemiological crisis on the Eastern Front; however, typhoid spotted fever, transmitted by pathogenic lice and previously unknown to German medical officers before the outbreak of the war, was the most deadly. There was a direct correlation between the environmental conditions of the East and the prevalence of disease. With cities excessively crowded by refugees fleeing their native countries, unsanitary medical conditions created a suitable environment for diseases to spread. Primitive hygienic conditions, along with general lack of knowledge about proper medical care was evident in the German occupied Ober Ost.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, a large scale sanitation program was put into effect. This program, named Santit?tswesen (Medical Affairs), was responsible for ensuring proper hygienic procedures were being carried out in Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Quarantine centers were built, and diseased neighbourhoods were isolated from the rest of the population. Delousing stations were prevalent in the countryside and in cities to prevent the spread of typhoid spotted fever, with mass numbers of natives being forced to take part in this process at military bathhouses. A \\"sanitary police\\" was also introduced to confirm the cleanliness of homes, and any home deemed unfit would be boarded up with a warning sign.[84] Dogs and cats were also killed for fear of possible infection.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo avoid the spread of disease, prostitution became regulated. Prostitutes were required to register for a permit, and authorities demanded mandatory medical examinations for all prostitutes, estimating that seventy percent of prostitutes carried a venereal disease.[84] Military brothels were introduced to combat disease; the city of Kowno emphasized proper educational use of contraceptives such as condoms, encouraged proper cleansing of the genital area after intercourse, and gave instructions on treatment in the case of infection.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian casualties in the First World War are difficult to estimate, due to the poor quality of available statistics.\\r\\n\\r\\nCornish gives a total of 2,006,000 military dead (700,000 killed in action, 970,000 died of wounds, 155,000 died of disease and 181,000 died while POWs). This measure of Russian losses is similar to that of the British Empire, 5% of the male population in the 15 to 49 age group. He says civilian casualties were five to six hundred thousand in the first two years, and were then not kept, so a total of over 1,500,000 is not unlikely. He has over five million men passing into captivity, the majority during 1915.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Russia withdrew from the war, 2,500,000 Russian POWs were in German and Austrian hands. This by far exceeded the total number of prisoners of war (1,880,000) lost by the armies of Britain, France and Germany combined. Only the Austro-Hungarian Army, with 2,200,000 POWs, came even close.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe empire of Austria lost approximately 60% of its territory as a result of the war, and evolved into a smaller state with a small homogeneous population of 6.5 million people. With the loss Vienna was now an imperial capital without an empire to support it. The states that were formed around Austria feared the return of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and put measures into place to prevent it from re-forming.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nCzechoslovakia was created through the merging of the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, previously under Austrian rule, united with Slovakia and Ruthenia, which were part of Hungary. Although these groups had many differences between them, they believed that together they would create a stronger state.\\r\\nThe new country was a multi-ethnic state. The population consisted of Czechs (51%), Slovaks (16%), Germans (22%), Hungarians (5%) and Rusyns (4%), with other ethnic groups making up 2%.[88] Many of the Germans, Hungarians, Ruthenians and Poles[89] and some Slovaks, felt oppressed because the political elite did not generally allow political autonomy for minority ethnic groups.\\r\\nThe state proclaimed the official ideology that there are no Czechs and Slovaks, but only one nation of Czechoslovaks (see Czechoslovakism), to the disagreement of Slovaks and other ethnic groups. Once a unified Czechoslovakia was restored after World War II the conflict between the Czechs and the Slovaks surfaced again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the war Hungary was severely disrupted by the loss of 72% of its territory, 64% of its population and most of its natural resources. The loss of territory was similar to that of Austria after the breaking up the Austria-Hungary territory. They lost the territories of Transylvania, Slovakia, Croatia, Slavonia, Syrmia, and Banat.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly incorporated the regions of Trieste and Tyrol from Austria.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creation of a free and Independent Poland was one of Wilsons fourteen points. At the end of the 18th century the state of Poland was broken apart by Prussia, Russia, and Austria. During the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, the Commission on Polish Affairs was created which recommended there be a passageway across West Prussia and Posen, in order to give Poland access to the Baltic through the port of Danzig at the mouth of the Vistula River. The creation of the state of Poland would cut off 1.5 million Germans in East Prussia from the rest of Germany. Poland also received Upper Silesia. British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon proposed Polands eastern border with Russia. Neither the Soviet Russians nor the Polish were happy with the demarcation of the border.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state of Romania was enlarged greatly after the war. As a result of the Paris peace conference Romania kept the Dobrudja and Transylvania. Between the states of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Romania an alliance named the Little Entente was formed. They worked together on matters of foreign policy in order to prevent a Habsburg restoration.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially Yugoslavia began as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. The State secured its territory at the Paris peace talks after the end of the war. The state suffered from many internal problems because of the many diverse cultures and languages within the state. Yugoslavia was divided on national, linguistic, economic, and religious lines.[87]","input":"How many troops did russia have in ww1?"},{"output":"more than 175 ethnolinguistic nations","context":"The Philippines are inhabited by more than 175 ethnolinguistic nations, the majority of whose languages are Austronesian in origin.

The Leeds University study, published in Molecular Biology and Evolution, showed that mitochondrial DNA lineages have been evolving within Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) since modern humans arrived approximately 50,000 years ago.[2]\\r\\nThere is no genetic evidence for large-scale population replacement, displacement, or absorption to suggest replacement of preexisting hunting and gathering populations by farming-voyaging immigrants from Taiwan.[3] Population dispersals occurred at the same time as sea levels rose, which resulted in migrations from the Philippines to as far north as Taiwan within the last 10,000 years.[2]\\r\\nExamination of mitochondrial DNA lineages showed that the neolithic culture (Austronesian) had been evolving within Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) for a longer period than previously believed. Per co-author Dr Oppenheimer, from the Oxford University School of Anthropology, population migrations were most likely to have been driven by climate changethe effects of the drowning of a huge ancient peninsula called Sundaland, that extended the Asian landmass as far as Borneo and Java.[2]\\r\\nThis happened during the period 15,000 to 7,000 years ago following the last Ice Age. Rising sea levels in three massive pulses caused flooding and the submergence of the Sunda Peninsula, creating the Java and South China Seas and the thousands of islands that make up Indonesia and the Philippines today.[2]\\r\\nAccording to a recent study by Mark Donohue of the Australian National University and Tim Denham of Monash University, there is no linguistic evidence for an orderly north-to-south dispersal of the Austronesian languages from Taiwan through the Philippines and into Island Southeast Asia (ISEA).[3]\\r\\nThe Philippine Statistics Department does not account for the racial background or ancestry of an individual. The official population of all types of mestizos (Asian, American, etc.) that reside inside and outside of the Philippines remains unknown. Although a study provided by Stanford University[4] found that European introgression into the Philippines was evident due to the period of colonization, it only genotyped 28 individuals from the Philippines. Results from such a small sample cannot be used with high confidence to characterize a population of 92 million persons.[a] Old Spanish censuses state that as much as 33.5% or one third of the population of the main island of Luzon had full or partial Hispanic or Latino descent.[6]\\r\\nPrehistoric Tabon Man, found in Palawan in 1962 was, until 2007, the oldest human remains discovered by anthropologists in the Philippines. Archaeological evidence indicates similarities with two early human fossils found in Indonesia and China, called the Java Man and Peking Man. In 2007, a single metatarsal from an earlier fossil was discovered in Callao Cave, Pe?ablanca, Cagayan. That earlier fossil was named as Callao Man.\\r\\nThe Negritos, several ethnolinguistic nations of the Australoid race,[7] arrived about 30,000 years ago and occupied several scattered areas throughout the islands. Recent archaeological evidence described by Peter Bellwood claimed that the ancestors of Filipinos, Malaysians, and Indonesians first crossed the Taiwan Strait during the Prehistoric period. These early mariners are thought to be the Austronesian people (Malayo-Polynesian). They used boats to cross the oceans, and settled into many regions of Southeast Asia, the Polynesian Islands, and Madagascar.\\r\\nBy the 14th century, the Malayo-Polynesian ethnolinguistic nations had dominated and displaced the Negrito population in most areas. Traders from southern China, Japan, India, Malaysia, and Indonesia, also contributed to the ethnic, and cultural development of the islands.[8]\\r\\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of Japanese people traders also migrated to the Philippines and assimilated into the local population.[9] pp.?52ÿ3\\r\\nBy the 16th century, Spanish colonization brought new groups of people to the Philippines. Many settled in the Philippines, and intermarried with the indigenous population. This gave rise to the Filipino mestizo or individuals of mixed Austronesian and Spanish descent.\\r\\nFar more numerous were Chinese immigrant workers, known as sangley, as many Chinese historically had been traders. They intermarried with Filipinos, and their children and descendants were called mestizo de sangley. By the 19th century, the more successful among them had risen to become wealthy major landowners. They could afford to have their children educated in elite institutions in the Philippines and Europe.\\r\\nBy the opening of the Suez Canal in the 1800s, the Spanish opened the Philippines for foreign trade. Europeans such as the British, Germans, and French settled in the islands to do business. By the end of the Spanish colonial period, the native ethnic groups of the Philippines began calling themselves Filipinos, a term that had begun as self-identification for persons of Spanish descent born in the Philippines.\\r\\nFollowing its victory in the SpanishÿAmerican War, the United States created a colonial authority in the Philippines in 1898. Military troops and businessmen made their way to the country, bringing in new ethnic groups, culture and language. In the late 19th century.\\r\\nThe Philippines has over 180 indigenous ethnic groups, over half of which represent unique linguistic groups.\\r\\nThere are more than 100 highland, lowland, and coastland tribal groups in the Philippines. These include:\\r\\nHowever, some Sama words (of the Jama Mapun variant) and Tausug words are found in the Molbog dialect after a long period of exposure with those ethnics. This plus a few characteristics of their socio-cultural life style distinguish them from the Orang Tidung. Molbog livelihood includes subsistence farming, fishing and occasional barter trading with the Moros and neighbouring ethnolinguistic nations in Sabah. In the past, both the Molbog and the Palawanon Muslims were ruled by Sulu datus, thus forming the outer political periphery of the Sulu Sultanate. Intermarriage between Tausug and the Molbog hastened the Islamization of the Molbog. The offsprings of these intermarriages are known as kolibugan or \\"half-breed\\".\\r\\nPalawan is home to many indigenous peoples whose origins date back thousands of centuries. Pre-historic discoveries reveal how abundant cultural life in Palawan survived before foreign occupiers and colonizers reached the Philippine archipelago. Today, Palawan is making its best to preserve and conserve the richness of its cultural groups. The provincial government strives to support the groups of indigenous peoples of Palawan.\\r\\nThe Tagbanwas speak the Tagbanwa language and has several sub-dialects. They are able to comprehend Tagalog, and, depending on their proximity to neighboring ethnolinguistic nations, Batak, Cuyonen and Calamian languages.

Bamboo and wood are used for the house's frame anahaw leaves are used to create walls and the roof and bamboo slats are used as flooring. Their basic social unit is the nuclear family which is composed of a married couple and their children usually one girl and one boy.\\r\\nAs of 1987, their population was about 198.

Formerly the group was known to Europeans and Americans as the \\"Sandwich Islands\\", a name chosen by James Cook in honor of the then First Lord of the Admiralty John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. The contemporary name is derived from the name of the largest island, Hawaii Island.\\r\\nThe Hawaiian monarchy was overthrown in 1893. The islands were subsequently put under the control of a republic, which the United States annexed in 1898.[1] The U.S. state of Hawaii now occupies the archipelago almost in its entirety (including the uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands), with the sole exception of Midway Island, which instead separately belongs to the United States as one of its unincorporated territories within the United States Minor Outlying Islands.\\r\\nThe Hawaiian Islands are the exposed peaks of a great undersea mountain range known as the HawaiianÿEmperor seamount chain, formed by volcanic activity over a hotspot in the Earth's mantle. The islands are about 1,860 miles (3,000?km) from the nearest continent.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain James Cook visited the islands on January 18, 1778 and named them the \\"Sandwich Islands\\" in honor of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, who was one of his sponsors as the First Lord of the Admiralty.[3] This name was in use until the 1840s, when the local name \\"Hawaii\\" gradually began to take precedence.[4]\\r\\nThe Hawaiian Islands have a total land area of 6,423.4 square miles (16,636.5?km2). Except for Midway, which is an unincorporated territory of the United States, these islands and islets are administered as Hawaiithe 50th state of the United States.[5]\\r\\nThe eight main islands of Hawaii (also called the Hawaiian Windward Islands) are listed here. All except Kahoolawe are inhabited.[6]\\r\\nSmaller islands, atolls, and reefs (all west of Ni?ihau are uninhabited) form the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, or Hawaiian Leeward Islands:\\r\\nThe state of Hawaii counts 137 \\"islands\\" in the Hawaiian chain.[17] This number includes all minor islands and islets, or very small island, offshore of the main islands (listed above) and individual islets in each atoll. These are just a few:\\r\\nThis chain of islands, or archipelago, developed as the Pacific Plate moved slowly northwestward over a hotspot in the Earth's mantle at a rate of approximately 32 miles (51?km) per million years. Thus, the southeast island is volcanically active, whereas the islands on the northwest end of the archipelago are older and typically smaller, due to longer exposure to erosion. The age of the archipelago has been estimated using potassium-argon dating methods.[18] From this study and others,[19][20] it is estimated that the northwestern most island, Kure Atoll, is the oldest at approximately 28 million years (Ma); while the southeastern most island, Hawai?i, is approximately 0.4 Ma (400,000 years). The only active volcanism in the last 200 years has been on the southeastern island, Hawai?i, and on the submerged but growing volcano to the extreme southeast, Lo?ihi. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory of the USGS documents recent volcanic activity and provides images and interpretations of the volcanism.\\r\\nAlmost all of the magma of the hotspot has the composition of basalt, and so the Hawaiian volcanoes are composed almost entirely of this igneous rock. There is very little coarser-grained gabbro and diabase. Nephelinite is exposed on the islands but is extremely rare. The majority of eruptions in Hawai?i are Hawaiian-type eruptions because basaltic magma is relatively fluid compared with magmas typically involved in more explosive eruptions, such as the andesitic magmas that produce some of the spectacular and dangerous eruptions around the margins of the Pacific basin.\\r\\nHawai?i island (the Big Island) is the biggest and youngest island in the chain, built from five volcanoes. Mauna Loa, taking up over half of the Big Island, is the largest shield volcano on the Earth. The measurement from sea level to summit is more than 2.5 miles (4?km), from sea level to sea floor about 3.1 miles (5?km).[21]\\r\\nThe Hawaiian Islands have many earthquakes, generally caused by volcanic activity. Most of the early earthquake monitoring took place in Hilo, by missionaries Titus Coan, Sarah J. Lyman and her family. From 1833 to 1896, approximately 4 or 5 earthquakes were reported per year.[22]\\r\\nHawaii accounted for 7.3% of the United States' reported earthquakes with a magnitude 3.5 or greater from 1974 to 2003, with a total 1533 earthquakes. Hawaii ranked as the state with the third most earthquakes over this time period, after Alaska and California.[23]\\r\\nOn October 15, 2006, there was an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.7 off the northwest coast of the island of Hawaii, near the Kona area of the big island. The initial earthquake was followed approximately five minutes later by a magnitude 5.7 aftershock. Minor-to-moderate damage was reported on most of the Big Island. Several major roadways became impassable from rock slides, and effects were felt as far away as Honolulu, Oahu, nearly 150 miles (240?km) from the epicenter. Power outages lasted for several hours to days. Several water mains ruptured. No deaths or life-threatening injuries were reported.\\r\\nEarthquakes are monitored by the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory run by the USGS.\\r\\nThe Hawaiian Islands are subject to tsunamis, great waves that strike the shore. Tsunamis are most often caused by earthquakes somewhere in the Pacific. The waves produced by the earthquakes travel at speeds of 400ÿ500 miles per hour (600ÿ800?km/h) and can affect coastal regions thousands of miles (kilometers) away.\\r\\nTsunamis may also originate from the Hawaiian Islands. Explosive volcanic activity can cause tsunamis. The island of Moloka?i had a catastrophic collapse or debris avalanche over a million years ago; this underwater landslide likely caused tsunamis. The Hilina Slump on the island of Hawai?i is another potential place for a large landslide and resulting tsunami.\\r\\nThe city of Hilo on the Big Island has been most affected by tsunamis, where the in-rushing water is accentuated by the shape of Hilo Bay. Coastal cities have tsunami warning sirens.\\r\\nA tsunami resulting from an earthquake in Chile hit the islands on February 27, 2010. It was relatively minor, but local emergency management officials utilized the latest technology and ordered evacuations in preparation for a possible major event. The Governor declared it a \\"good drill\\" for the next major event.\\r\\nA tsunami resulting from an earthquake in Japan hit the islands on March 11, 2011. It was relatively minor, but local officials ordered evacuations in preparation for a possible major event. The tsunami caused about $30.1 million in damages.[24]\\r\\nThe endemic plant and animal species of the Hawaiian Islands developed in nearly complete isolation over about 70 million years.[clarification needed] Prior to human arrival, the only native mammals were the Hawaiian hoary bat and the Hawaiian monk seal.[25][not in citation given]\\r\\nHuman contact, first by Polynesians, introduced new trees, other plants and animals. These included voracious species such as rats and pigs, who took a heavy toll on native birds and invertebrates that evolved in the absence of such predators. The growing population also brought deforestation, forest degradation, treeless grasslands, and environmental degradation. As a result, many species which depended on forest habitats and food became extinct. As humans cleared land for farming, monocultural crop production replaced multi-species systems.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe arrival of the Europeans had a more significant impact, with the promotion of large-scale single-species export agriculture and livestock grazing. This led to increased clearing of forests, and the development of towns, adding many more species to the list of extinct animals of the Hawaiian Islands. As of 2009[update], many of the remaining endemic species are considered endangered.[26]\\r\\nOn June 15, 2006, President George W. Bush issued a public proclamation creating Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument under the Antiquities Act of 1906. The Monument encompasses the northwestern Hawaiian Islands and surrounding waters, forming the largest[27] marine wildlife reserve in the world. In August 2010, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee added Papahnaumokukea to its list of World Heritage Sites.[28][29][30] On August 26, 2016, President Barack Obama greatly expanded Papahnaumokukea, quadrupling it from its original size.[31][32][33]\\r\\nThe climate of the Hawaiian Islands is tropical but it experiences many different climates, depending on altitude and weather.[34] The islands receive most rainfall from the trade winds on their north and east flanks (the windward side) as a result of orographic precipitation.[34] Coastal areas in general and especially the south and west flanks or leeward sides, tend to be drier.[34]\\r\\nIn general, the lowlands of Hawaiian Islands receive most of their precipitation during the winter months (October to April).[34] Drier conditions generally prevail from May to September.[34] The tropical storms, and occasional hurricanes, tend to occur from July through November.[34]\\r\\nCoordinates: 21N 157W? / ?21N 157W? / 21; -157","input":"What was the original name for the hawaiian islands?"},{"output":"0.08% or greater","context":"\\"Drunk driving\\" is the act of operating or driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs to the degree that mental and motor skills are \\"impaired\\". It is illegal in all jurisdictions within the United States, though enforcement varies widely between and within states/territories, to drive a motor vehicle while impaired or with a breath or blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% or greater if over the age of 21.\\r\\nThe specific criminal offense is usually called driving under the influence (DUI), and in some states 'driving while intoxicated' (DWI), 'operating while impaired' (OWI), or 'operating a vehicle under the influence' (OVI). Such laws may also apply to boating or piloting aircraft. Vehicles can include farm machinery and horse-drawn carriages.\\r\\nIn construing the terms DUI, DWI, OWI and OVI, one may notice that some states therefore make it illegal to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence or driving while intoxicated while others indicate that it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle. There is a split of authority across the country regarding this issue. Some states permit enforcement of DUI, DWI and OWI/OVI statutes based on \\"operation and control\\" of a vehicle, while others require actual \\"driving\\". \\"The distinction between these terms is material, for it is generally held that the word 'drive,' as used in statutes of this kind, usually denotes movement of the vehicle in some direction, whereas the word 'operate' has a broader meaning so as to include not only the motion of the vehicle, but also acts which engage the machinery of the vehicle that, alone or in sequence, will set in motion the motive power of the vehicle.\\" (State v. Graves (1977) 269 S.C. 356 [237 S.E.2d 584, 586-588, 586. fn. 8]\\r\\nIn California, for instance, in Mercer v. DMV (1991) 53 Cal.3d 753,[1] the California State Supreme Court contrasted the term drive, commonly understood to require volitional movement of the vehicle, with the term driver, defined in California Vehicle Code  305 as one who is either driving or in actual physical control. The court pointed out that the phrase actual physical control does not appear anywhere in the drunk driving offense statutes. Further, the court noted that since driver is defined as one who drives or is in actual physical control, the two terms (drive vs. actual physical control) must have different meanings. Construing these penal statutes strictly, rather than broadly, as is required by Keeler v. Superior Court of Amador County (1970) 2 Cal.3d 619, 631, the court held that mere actual physical control is not enough to constitute driving. Therefore, the term: drive, at least for purposes of the drunk driving statutes, requires volitional movement of the vehicle. In coming to this conclusion, the California Supreme Court held that in everyday usage the phrase, \\"to drive a vehicle,\\" is understood as requiring evidence of volitional movement of a vehicle. Numerous dictionary definitions-including Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1981), cited by the Court of Appeal in the case that led to the California Supreme Court's review of this case, support a definition of \\"drive\\" that includes movement. (See, e.g., Id., at p.?692.) fn. 5. The Mercer Court held that it believed that these definitions are consistent with the usual and ordinary understanding of that term, and suggest the sense in which the word was intended by the Legislature in the present context.\\r\\nIn the United States the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that 17,941 people died in 2006 in alcohol-related collisions, representing 40% of total traffic deaths in the US. NHTSA states 275,000 were injured in alcohol-related accidents in 2003.[2] The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that in 1996 local law enforcement agencies made 1,467,300 arrests nationwide for driving under the influence of alcohol, 1 out of every 10 arrests for all crimes in the U.S., compared to 1.9 million such arrests during the peak year in 1983, accounting for 1 out of every 80 licensed drivers in the U.S.[3][4] In 2012, 29.1 million people admitted to driving under the influence of alcohol.[5]\\r\\nNHTSA defines fatal collisions as \\"alcohol-related\\" if they believe the driver, a passenger, or non-motorist (such as a pedestrian or pedal cyclist) had a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.01% or greater. NHTSA defines nonfatal collisions as alcohol-related if the accident report indicates evidence of alcohol present. NHTSA specifically notes that alcohol-related does not necessarily mean a driver or non-occupant was tested for alcohol and that the term does not indicate a collision or fatality was caused by the presence of alcohol.[6] On average, about 60% of the BAC values are missing or unknown. To analyze what they believe is the complete data, statisticians simulate BAC information.[7] Drivers with a BAC of 0.10% are 6 to 12 times more likely to get into a fatal crash or injury than drivers with no alcohol.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the most part, DUI or DWI are synonymous terms that represent the criminal offense of operating (or in some jurisdictions merely being in physical control of) a motor vehicle while being under the influence of alcohol or drugs or a combination of both. The key inquiry focuses on whether the driver's faculties were impaired by the substance that was consumed. The detection and successful prosecution of drivers impaired by prescription medication or illegal drugs can therefore be difficult. Breathalyzers have been developed for the purpose of administering roadside or laboratory tests that can detect the actual level of a controlled substance in an individual's body.\\r\\nEvery state in the U.S. designates a \\"per se\\" blood or breath alcohol level as the threshold point for an independent criminal offense. This is often referred to as the \\"legal limit\\". It is a permissive presumption of guilt where the person's BAC is 0.08% or greater (units of milligrams per deciliter, representing 8 g of alcohol in 10 liters of blood).[9] Some states (e.g., Colorado) include a lesser charge, sometimes referred to as \\"driving while ability impaired\\" that may apply to individuals with a 0.05% or above, but less than the 0.08% per se limit for the more serious charge.[9]\\r\\nEvery state has a \\"catch-all\\" provision designed to cover those circumstances where the person is below 0.08%, but the person still appears impaired by definition of law. These types of \\"catch-all\\" statutes cover situations involving a person under the influence of drugs or under the combined influence of alcohol and drugs. With the advent of the legalization of marijuana, these catch-all provisions cover those prosecutions pursuing those charged with driving under the influence of drugs or even drugs and alcohol.\\r\\nIn California, this \\"catch-all\\" provision was previously found in California Vehicle Code Section 23152(a); however new statutes that were made effective on January 1, 2014, two new sections were created to make sections specifically addressing those charged with driving under the influence of drugs, (which includes prescription medications if it can be shown that those medications impaired the driver), and driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs.\\r\\nWisconsin regards first offense drunk driving as a municipal offense, and New Jersey treats all drunk driving cases without serious injury or death as traffic violations.[10] The amount of alcohol intake to reach a BAC of 0.08% may vary with the individual's body composition and state of health. Prior to increased emphasis on drinking and driving in the 1980s, standards of 0.10%-0.15% were in place.\\r\\nAfter the passage of federal legislation, the legal limit for commercial drivers is now set at 0.04%. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulation prohibits those who hold a commercial driver's license from driving with an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater. A commercial driver with an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, must be removed from duty for 24 hours.[11]\\r\\nArizona has a 0.08% BAC limit for standard DUI, but drivers can also face more severe DUI charges like an Extreme DUI ( 28-1382(A)(1)) for having a BAC over 0.15% or Super Extreme DUI ( 28-1382(A)(2)) for a BAC over 0.20%.[12]\\r\\nCalifornia, like every other state, has a \\"per se\\" BAC limit of 0.08% pursuant to California Vehicle Code Section 23152(b); and based on the aforementioned federal legislation, a lower limit of 0.04% for drivers holding commercial drivers licenses (CDL). California also has a limit of 0.01% for drivers who are under 21 or on probation for previous DUI offenses pursuant to California Vehicle Code Sections 23136 and 23140. California also makes it illegal for persons who are on probation for a DUI conviction to drive with a blood or breath alcohol concentration of 0.01% or greater pursuant to Vehicle Code Section 23154. While the existence of a BAC of 0.01% or greater may not always result in prosecution for driving under the influence, it will expose such drivers to a one or two-year suspension through an administrative action by the California Department of Motor Vehicles. If that same person has a BAC of 0.08% or greater, it will prompt what is referred to as a \\"dual action\\", meaning a suspension for driving with a BAC of 0.08% or greater and a suspension for driving with a BAC of 0.01% or greater while on DUI Probation.\\r\\nAll U.S. states have implied consent laws which state that a licensed driver has given their consent to a field sobriety test and/or a Breathalyzer or similar manner of determining blood alcohol concentration. In 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States in Birchfield v. North Dakota held that both breath tests and blood tests constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment, concluding that requiring breath tests is constitutional without a search warrant, however, requiring more intrusive blood tests involving piercing the skin is not, as the goal of traffic safety can be obtained by less invasive means.[13]\\r\\nNevada has an implied consent law, an agreement every motor vehicle license recipient must accept, that makes breath or blood testing mandatory if an officer has reasonable suspicion of impairment. Refusal is grounds for arrest and law enforcement may use reasonable force to obtain blood samples[14]\\r\\nNew Jersey has a general 0.08% BAC limit, but people can be convicted of drunk driving even when the BAC is under that limit.[15]\\r\\nNorth Carolina has a general 0.08% BAC limit,[16] a lower limit of 0.04% for drivers holding commercial drivers licenses (CDL) while operating a commercial vehicle.[17] Additionally, it is illegal for anyone under the age of twenty-one (21) to possess or consume alcohol.[18]\\r\\nEvery state has enhanced penalties for refusing to submit to an Implied Consent Test pursuant to the State's Implied Consent Laws. In California, refusing to submit to a test of one's breath or blood upon being arrested for driving under the influence carries an additional punishment of a one-year license suspension pursuant to California Vehicle Code Section 13558(c)(1).\\r\\nFederal Aviation Regulation 91.17 (14 C.F.R. 91.17) prohibits pilots from flying aircraft with an alcohol level of 0.04% or more, or within eight hours of consuming alcohol, or while under the impairing influence of any drug. The same prohibition applies to any other crew members on duty aboard the aircraft (flight attendants, etc.). Some airlines impose additional restrictions, and many pilots also impose stricter standards upon themselves. Commercial pilots found to be in violation of regulations are typically fired or resign voluntarily, and they may lose their pilot certificates and be subject to criminal prosecution under Federal or State laws, effectively ending their careers.\\r\\nSimilar laws apply to other activities involving transportation; Michigan prohibits intoxicated bicycling, horseback riding, buggy driving, use of motorized farm implements, or boating, the latter whether a pilot or passenger, with much the same threshold of intoxication. In the case of boating, the laws extend to include kayaks, canoes, sailboatsany flotation device that needs to be steered in water. Different states have different laws and classifications on the level of transgression attached to a citation for boating under the influence. For example, Virginia has very similar penalties for a BUI as it does for a DUI. Those convicted of boating while intoxicated face penalties including, fines of up to $2,500, jail time of up to one year, loss of your operators license for up to three years and mandatory enrollment and completion of a Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Program.[19]\\r\\nAlcohol use was the number one contributing factor in U.S. recreational boating deaths between 2003 and 2012, accounting for 15 percent of the fatalities in 2003, and 17 percent in 2012.[20] A Canadian study published in 2011 examined 18 years of data on recreational boating, and concluded that a \\"true figure\\" of alcohol-related deaths in that country \\"may lie between 46% and 56%\\".[21]:15\\r\\nSix states require physicians to report patients who drive while impaired.[22] Another 25 states permit physicians to violate doctor-patient confidentiality to report impaired drivers, if they so choose.[22] The American Medical Association endorsed physician reporting in 1999, but deferred to the states on whether such notification should be mandatory or permissive.[22] Medical bioethicist Jacob Appel of New York University says physician reporting may deter some patients from seeking care, writing \\"Reporting may remove some dangerous drivers from the roads, but if in doing so it actually creates other dangerous drivers, by scaring them away from treatment, then society has sacrificed confidentiality for no tangible return in lives saved.\\"[22]\\r\\nThese innovative courts use substance abuse intervention with repeat offenders who plead guilty to driving while intoxicated. Those accepted into the diversionary program are required to abstain from alcohol. Some are required to wear a device that monitors and records any levels of alcohol detected in their bloodstreams.\\r\\nThe penalties for driving under the influence (DUI), driving while intoxicated (DWI) and operating while intoxicated (OWI) vary from state-to-state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is not uncommon for the penalties to be different from county-to-county within any given state depending on the practices of the individual jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions require jail time and larger fines, even on a first offense. For instance, Ohio requires a mandatory 72-hour jail sentence for a first offense conviction; however, the jail time component is satisfied by attendance of the Ohio A.W.A.R.E. Program, which is a 72-hour alcohol-education program. Compared to many other countries, such as Sweden, penalties for drunk driving in the United States are considered less severe unless alcohol is involved in an incident causing injury or death of another, such DUI, DWI or OWI with Great Bodily Injury (GBI) or Vehicular Manslaughter.\\r\\nThe federal Assimilative Crimes Act, which makes state law applicable on lands reserved or acquired by the Federal government when the act or omission is not made punishable by an enactment of Congress, recognizes collateral actions related to DUI convictions as punishments. According to 18 U.S.C.??13:\\r\\n that which may or shall be imposed through judicial or administrative action under the law of a State, territory, possession, or district, for a conviction for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of a drug or alcohol, shall be considered to be a punishment provided by that law \\r\\nAn SR-22 is an addendum to an insurance policy. It is an administrative form that attests to an insurance company's coverage, or the posting of a personal public bond in the amount of the state's minimum liability coverage for the licensed driver or vehicle registration. The SR in SR-22 stands for Safety Responsibility, and it is needed to reinstate a suspended driver's license after a DUI conviction in 49 states and the District of Columbia. It is submitted to the State's DMV by an auto insurance company to serve as proof that a driver has the minimum liability insurance that the states requires. They are essentially an agreement between a driver's insurance company and the respective State's DMV that requires the driver's insurance company to notify the respective State's DMV that the driver's insurance has either been terminated or lapsed; thus instituting a suspension of the driver's driving privileges until proof of insurance is re-filed with the State's DMV.\\r\\nWhile SR-22s are typically filed with the respective State's DMV, some States require the driver to carry proof of the SR-22 or to carry it in the registered vehicle, (particularly if the driver has been cited for coverage lapses or other administrative infractions). SR-22s may attest coverage for a vehicle regardless of operator (owner liability coverage), or cover a specific person regardless of the specific vehicle operated (operator liability coverage).\\r\\nAs stated, the form is required in 49 states and the US District of Columbia in order to register a vehicle for usage on public roads. It is also required to redeem a license which has been suspended due to coverage lapse in these required states. These states also, generally, require that the issuing insurance company provide the relevant state's DMV with timely updates as to the status of such coverage. If the policy with the SR22 cancels, a form called an SR26 is issued and sent to the state DMV.[23] Upon notice that there has been a lapse in coverage, the state will suspend the driver's license again.[24] Another SR-22 filing will need to be submitted to regain driving privileges.\\r\\nThe State of Washington used to permit those charged with a first offense DUI/DWI/OWI to complete a diversion program that resulted in the charges being dismissed upon the completion of a Diversion Program. In 1975, under the revised code of Washington or RCW Section 10.05, the Washington State Legislature established a deferred prosecution option for offenders arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or impairing drugs (DUI). It was intended to encourage individuals to seek appropriate treatment and, under this option, defendants with a significant alcohol or drug dependence problem could petition a court to defer disposition of their charge until they have completed intensive substance dependence treatment and met other conditions required by the court. If the defendant successfully completed the terms of the program, the charge was dismissed; for those who failed, the deferred status was revoked and the defendant was prosecuted for the original DUI charge. (RCW 10.05.010 and 10.05.020) In 1992, the University of Washington Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute evaluated DUI deferred prosecution and concluded the program reduced DUI recidivism.[25] In 1998, the legislature modified the DUI statutes. Among other things, the length of deferred prosecution supervision was increased from two to five years and defendants were restricted to one deferred prosecution per lifetime.\\r\\nAlcohol Programs\\r\\nEvery jurisdiction imposes the completion of alcohol education programs, commonly known as DUI programs, subsequent to a DUI/DWI/OWI conviction. Additionally, some states impose an additional requirement that a person attend a Victim Impact Panel (VIP) administered by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), which was established in 1982. Both DUI classes and Victim Impact Panels are available in some states for first offense DUIs dependent on the judge's decision.[26]\\r\\nIn 1967, Ohio began to issue special license plates to DUI offenders who are granted limited driving privileges such as work-related driving until a court can rule that they can have full privileges back. However, judges rarely enforced the plates, so in 2004, the plates became mandated by state law to all DUI offenders.[27] Unlike Ohio's standard-issue plates (which as of 2008 have a picture of the Ohio country side), the DUI plates are yellow with red writing with no registration stickers or graphics. They are commonly referred to as \\"party plates\\".[27]\\r\\nMinnesota has a similar program, where the plates are white with either blue or black text. The plate number is a \\"W\\", followed by a letter and four numbers. These plates may be issued to drivers with at least 2 offenses in a five-year period; three offenses in a ten-year period; having a BAC twice the legal limit; or having a child in the car at the time of arrest.[28] In Minnesota, DUI plates are referred to as \\"whiskey plates\\",[29] whiskey being the name of the letter W in the NATO phonetic alphabet.\\r\\nSome states, such as California, may impose the installation of ignition interlock devices in cases where the driver's BAC is over 0.20%, or 0.15% in some places. These additional sanctions are meant to deter and punish the operation of a vehicle at extremely high BAC levels and the concomitant danger posed to the safety of persons and property by heavily impaired drivers.\\r\\nAs of July 1, 2010, California implemented a pilot project for DUI sentencing. In four counties, Los Angeles, Sacramento, Tulare and Alameda, first offenders convicted of drunk driving are required to install an ignition interlock device in their car for a period of five months and second offenders for a period of one year.[30] Previously, this requirement was only required for third offenders and permitted for second offenders, and then for a three-year period. The California DMV has written guidelines to clear up some ambiguities in the law. Costs associated with ignition interlock devices include $70 ÿ $150 for installation and fees in the range of $60 - $80 per month thereafter.[31]\\r\\nSome states, such as California, allow for the impoundment and forfeiture of vehicles under certain conditions.[32][33]\\r\\nIn the United States, paying the DUI ticket, court costs, and attorney fees is just the start of a person's financial obligations after a DUI conviction. Additional costs of a DUI conviction will often involve the installation and maintenance fees of a vehicle Ignition Interlock Device, which serves the same function as a Breathalyzer to enable the vehicle to start. A person convicted of a driving under the influence charge, can also expect to pay higher insurance rates and premiums.[34][35] In addition, DUI records prevent entry into Canada without proper documentation.[36]\\r\\nNew Jersey enacted the first law that specifically criminalized driving an automobile while intoxicated, in 1906. The New Jersey statute provided that \\"[n]o intoxicated person shall drive a motor vehicle.\\" Violation of this provision was punishable by a fine of up to $500, or a term of up to 60 days in county jail.[37]\\r\\nEarly laws, such as that enacted in New Jersey, required proof of a state of intoxication with no specific definition of what level of inebriation qualified.[38] The first generally accepted legal BAC limit was 0.15%. New York, for example, which had enacted a prohibition on driving while intoxicated in 1910,[39] amended this law in 1941 to provide that it would constitute prima facie evidence of intoxication when an arrested person was found to have a BAC of .15 percent or higher, as ascertained through a test administered within two hours of arrest.[40]\\r\\nIn 1938, the American Medical Association created a \\"Committee to Study Problems of Motor Vehicle Accidents\\". At the same time, the National Safety Council set up a \\"Committee on Tests for Intoxication\\".\\r\\nIn the US, most of the laws and penalties were greatly enhanced starting in the late 1970s, and through the 1990s, largely due to pressure from groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD) and leaders like Candy Lightner. Significantly, zero tolerance laws were enacted which criminalized driving a vehicle with 0.01% or 0.02% BAC for drivers under 21. This is true even in Puerto Rico, despite maintaining a legal drinking age of 18.[41]\\r\\nOn May 14, 2013, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended that all 50 states lower the benchmark for determining when a driver is legally drunk from 0.08 blood-alcohol content to 0.05. The idea is part of an initiative to eliminate drunk driving, which accounts for about a third of all road deaths.[42] In light of this push by the NTSB, and in addition to numerous media reports, many bloggers/authors have posted content addressing the Debate Surrounding Lowering the Legal Limit from 0.08% to 0.05%.\\r\\nThe NHTSA estimates that 17,941 people died in 2006 in alcohol-related collisions, representing 40% of total traffic deaths in the US. Over the decade 2001-2010, this rate showed only a 3% variation, and no trend.[43] NHTSA states 275,000 were injured in alcohol-related accidents in 2003.[2] The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that in 1996 local law enforcement agencies made 1,467,300 arrests nationwide for driving under the influence of alcohol, 1 out of every 10 arrests for all crimes in the U.S., compared to 1.9 million such arrests during the peak year in 1983, accounting for 1 out of every 80 licensed drivers in the U.S.[3][4] This represented a 220% increase in DUI arrests from 1970 to 1986, while the number of licensed drivers increased by just 42% in the same period.[44] The arrest rate for alcohol-related offenses among American Indians was more than double that for the total population during 1996, and almost 4 in 10 American Indians held in local jails had been charged with a public order offense, most commonly driving while intoxicated.[45] In 1997 an estimated 513,200 DUI offenders were under correctional supervision, down from 593,000 in 1990 and up from 270,100 in 1986.[46]\\r\\nRecent analysis have shown cities in which ride sharing services operate show mixed results as to whether the availability of those services affects rates of impaired driving.[47] NHTSA defines fatal collisions as \\"alcohol-related\\" if they believe the driver, a passenger, or non-motorist (such as a pedestrian or pedal cyclist) had a BAC of 0.01% or greater. NHTSA defines nonfatal collisions as alcohol-related if the accident report indicates evidence of alcohol present. NHTSA specifically notes that alcohol-related does not necessarily mean a driver or non occupant was tested for alcohol and that the term does not indicate a collision or fatality was caused by the presence of alcohol.[6] On average, about 60% of the BAC values are missing or unknown. To analyze what they believe is the complete data, statisticians simulate BAC information.[7] Drivers with a BAC of 0.10% are 6 to 12 times more likely to get into a fatal crash or injury than drivers with no alcohol.[8][48]\\r\\nFollowing are common procedures when a law enforcement officer has reason to suspect a driver is intoxicated.\\r\\nThere are several situations in which the officer will come into contact with a driver, some examples are:\\r\\nThe following list of DUI symptoms, from a publication issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (DOT HS-805-711),[49] is widely used in training officers to detect drunk drivers. After each symptom is a percentage figure which, according to NHTSA, indicates the statistical chances through research, that a driver is over the legal limit.\\r\\nIf the officer observes enough evidence to have a \\"Reasonable Suspicion\\" to legally justify a further detention and investigation, they will ask the driver to step out of the vehicle.\\r\\nReasonable suspicion requires less evidence than \\"Probable Cause\\", but more than a mere hunch. A rule of thumb is that reasonable suspicion requires 25% proof, and probable cause requires more than 50% statistical chance. Therefore, if there is probable cause for arrest for DUI/DWIOWI, as suggested by the research and examples used above, then there is reasonable suspicion to stop a driver.\\r\\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, police officers should conduct DUI Investigations according to a specific protocol called phases. According to the NHTSA training, DUI Investigations are categorized by these phases:\\r\\nThe Vehicle in Motion Phase deals with the law enforcement officers observations of the suspect's driving maneuvers. The Personal Contact Phase is where the officer actually comes into contact with the DUI suspect. The Pre-Arrest Screening Phase is portion of the DUI Investigation that encompasses the Pre-Field Sobriety Test Questioning and the Field Sobriety Testing, including a Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test where applicable. This Phase also includes the post-arrest evidentiary chemical test despite that it occurs subsequent to a DUI arrest, not prior to a DUI arrest.\\r\\nThe officer will typically approach the driver's window and ask some preliminary questions. During this phase of the stop the officer will note if they detect any of the following indicators of intoxication\\r\\nIf the officer observes enough to have a reasonable suspicion to legally justify a further detention and investigation, they will ask the driver to step out of the vehicle.\\r\\nOne of the most controversial aspects of a DUI stop is the field sobriety test (FSTs). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has developed a model system for managing Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) training. They have published numerous training manuals associated with FSTs. As a result of the NHTSA studies, the walk-and-turn test was determined to be 68% accurate, and the one-leg stand test is only 65% accurate when administered to people within the study parameters. The tests were not validated for people with medical conditions, injuries, 65 years or older, and 50 pounds or greater overweight. The officer will administer one or more field sobriety tests. FSTs are considered \\"divided attention tests\\" that test the suspect's ability to perform the type of mental and physical multitasking that is required to operate an automobile. However, these tests can be problematic for people with non-obvious disabilities affecting proprioception, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\\r\\nThe three validated tests by NHTSA are:\\r\\nAlternative tests, which have not been scientifically validated, include:\\r\\nAlthough most law enforcement agencies continue to use a variety of these FSTs, most use the 3-test battery of validated field sobriety tests, referred to as the Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFSTs). The NHTSA-approved battery of tests consists of the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test, or HGN Test; the Walk-and-Turn Test, or the WAT Test, and the One-Leg-Stand Test, or the OLS Test.\\r\\nIn some states, such as Ohio, only the standardized tests will be admitted into evidence, provided they were administered and objectively scored \\"in substantial compliance\\" with NHTSA standards (ORC 4511.19(D)(4)(b)).[citation needed]\\r\\nAccording to NHTSA, these tests were not designed to measure impairment, but rather to give a probability that a driver is at or above a 0.08% BAC. However, studies have shown that there are reasons to doubt the tests' usefulness in helping an officer to make such a determination. In 1991, Dr. Spurgeon Cole of Clemson University conducted a study of the accuracy of FSTs. His staff videotaped people performing six common field sobriety tests, then showed the tapes to 14 police officers and asked them to decide whether the suspects had \\"had too much to drink and drive\\" (sic). The blood-alcohol concentration of each of the 21 DUI subjects was 0.00, unknown to the officers. The result: the officers gave their opinion that 46% of these innocent people were too drunk to be able to drive. This study showed the possible inaccuracy of FSTs.[51]\\r\\nAn increasingly used field sobriety test involves having the suspect breathe into a small, handheld breath testing device. These are often referred to as PAS Tests, or \\"Preliminary Alcohol Screening\\" Tests\\", or a PBT, \\"Preliminary Breath Test\\" and precede the actual arrest and subsequent requirement to submit to an evidentiary chemical test of the suspect's breath or blood. These breath testing devices used are smaller, inexpensive versions of the larger, more sophisticated instruments at the police stations, commonly known as an Evidentiary Breath Test using an EBT device, or Evidentiary Breath Test device. However, an increasing number jurisdictions began using Portable Evidentiary Breath Test devices, or PEBT devices, that are more sophisticated versions of the smaller, inexpensive versions of the larger, larger instruments at the police stations. However, where the larger EBTs usually employ infrared spectroscopy, the PEBT and PAS devices use a relatively simple electrochemical (fuel cell) technology. When used for purposes of a Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test, or PAS Test, their purpose, along with the other FSTs, is to assist the officer in determining whether he/she has probable cause for arrest.\\r\\nThere were three tests chosen to constitute the \\"Standardized Field Sobriety Tests\\", which are: (1) the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test; (2) the Walk & Turn Test; and (3) the One Leg Stand Test.\\r\\nThe Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test, or HGN Test, is administered by the police officer checking the test subject's eyes.\\r\\nHorizontal Gaze Nystagmus Instructions (HGN)\\r\\nHorizontal Gaze Nystagmus Evaluation\\r\\nThere are six cues or clues that a police officer is looking for on the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test, they are as follows:\\r\\nTotal Cues: 6 Cues - Decision Point: 4/6 Cues\\r\\nWhile the original research indicated that 6 out of 6 cues meant that a person was more likely above 0.08% at the time of the test, subsequent research conducted by the NHTSA has indicated that a Hit occurred when the number of reported signs for a given BAC fell within the range: > a 0.06% at 4ÿ6 cues or clues; a .05ÿ.059% at 2ÿ4 cues or clues; a 0.03ÿ0.049% at 0ÿ4 cues or clues and a < 0.03% at 0ÿ2 cues or clues. \\"The Robustness of the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Study\\" (September, 2007)\\r\\nThe walk-and-turn test is composed of two phases: the Instruction Phase and Walking Phase. During the test, the individual is directed to take nine steps along a straight line. The individual is supposed to walk heel to toe, and while looking down at a real or imaginary line, count the steps out loud. The test subject's arms must remain at their side. Reaching the ending point, the individual must turn around using a series of small steps, and return to the starting point. The proper instruction, according to the NHTSA Guidelines, is as follows:\\r\\nThere are eight cues or clues that a police officer is looking for on the Walk & Turn Test, they are as follows:\\r\\nTotal Cues: 8 Cues ÿ Decision Point: 2/8 Cues\\r\\nThe One Leg Stand Test is composed of two stages: the Instruction Phase and Balancing Phase. The proper instruction, according to the NHTSA Guidelines, is as follows:\\r\\nThere are four cues or clues that a police officer is looking for on the One Leg Stand Test, they are as follows\\r\\nTotal Cues: 4 Cues ÿ Decision Point: 2/4 Cues\\r\\nCritics of standardized field sobriety tests often question the statistical evidence behind them, and the ability of the officers to administer the tests and actually judge for impairments related to alcohol. According to Barone, one study involved completely sober individuals who were asked to perform the standardized field sobriety tests, and their performances were videotaped. \\"After viewing the 21 videos of sober individuals taking the standardized field tests, the police officers believed that forty-six percent of the individuals had 'too much to drink'\\". It should not be out of the question for the standardized field sobriety tests to be re-examined for reliability and validity. A standardized test that claims to have scientific support should be able to be repeated. Along with that, the standardized field sobriety tests do not have a specific standard for grading, and it is left up to the discretion of the officer to determine whether what he/she see observes is actually a cue sufficient to count against the test subject. To err is human. The NHTSA's 1977 study had an error rate of 47 percent, and the 1981 study had an error rate of 32 percent, which is considered unusually high for a scientific study.[52]\\r\\nOne of the main criticisms of field sobriety tests is that the judgment is left up to the discretion of the police officer. An officer may have some bias towards a suspect and judge the test more critically than necessary. Additionally, it is almost impossible to tell whether or not a police officer used proper procedures for administering the field sobriety test when a case is brought to court. The original research conducted by the NHTSA is often disputed because of the manner in which they were conducted and the conclusions that were reported. One author comments that \\"The reports for all three studies issued by NHTSA are lacking much of the material and analysis expected in a scientific paper, and none have been published in peer-reviewed journals\\" (Rubenzer 2011).\\r\\nOne of the main problems with the walk-and-turn test is that some of the signs of alcohol impairment may stem from other physical problems. Along with that, there are other signs of physical impairment that can stem from various causes, including fatigue, an injury or illness, and nervousness. Those who are physically inactive, elderly, or obese may have trouble completing the walk-and-turn test without flaw. The NTSA used to say that those who are 50 pounds or more overweight may have difficulty performing the test, and that the suspect must walk along a real line. \\"Later NHTSA manuals removed the weight comment, and also inserted the phrase 'imaginary line' at the instruction phase, even though original research always used a visible line\\".[52] The fact that officers are no longer required to provide a line for the suspect to walk along may affect the outcome of the test, and often adds to the scrutiny received from critics.\\r\\nIf the officer has sufficient probable cause that the suspect has been driving under the influence of alcohol, they will make the arrest, handcuff the suspect and transport them to the police station. En route, the officer may advise them of their legal implied consent obligation to submit to an evidentiary chemical test of blood, breath or possibly urine depending on the jurisdiction.\\r\\nLaws relating to what exactly constitutes probable cause vary from state to state. In California it is a refutable presumption that a person with a BAC of 0.08% or higher is driving under the influence. However, section 23610(a)(2) of the California Vehicle Code states that driving with a BAC between 0.05% and 0.08% \\"shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of an alcoholic beverage\\".\\r\\nAn arrestee will be offered a chemical test of breath, blood or, much less frequently, urine. Breath test results are usually available immediately; urine and blood samples are sent to a lab for later analysis to determine the BAC or possible presence of drugs. Some states sought to impose criminal punishment for a refusal to submit to a chemical test of his/her breath or blood; however, in Birchfield v. North Dakota, the United States Supreme Court visited the issue of whether states can criminalize a refusal to submit to a chemical test. The United States Supreme Court decided that states may criminalize a refusal to submit to a breath test; but not a refusal to submit to a blood test absent a McNeely warrant, named after Missouri v. McNeely (2013), which was a case decided by United States Supreme Court, on appeal from the Supreme Court of Missouri, regarding exceptions to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution under exigent circumstances.[1] The United States Supreme Court ruled that police must generally obtain a warrant before subjecting a drunken-driving suspect to a blood test, and that the natural metabolism of blood alcohol does not establish a per se exigency that would justify a blood draw without consent.\\r\\nRegarding blood tests, some commentators, such as Brown University's Jacob Appel, have criticized the role of medical personnel in this process. According to Appel, \\"If physicians acquiesce today in the removal of a resistant patient's blood, soon they may be called upon to pump the contents of an unwilling patient's stomach or even to perform involuntary surgery to retrieve an evidential bullet\\".[53]\\r\\nWhile chemical tests are used to determine the driver's BAC, they do not determine the driver's level of impairment. However, state laws usually provide for a rebuttable legal presumption of intoxication at a BAC of 0.08% or higher (see blood alcohol test assumptions).\\r\\nIf it is determined after arrest that the person's BAC is not at or above the legal limit of 0.08%, they will probably be released without any charges. One may, however, still be charged with driving under the influence of alcohol on the basis of driving symptoms, observed impairment, admissions or performance on the field sobriety tests. And if there is suspicion of drug usage, a blood or urine test is likely, or at least the testimony of a specially trained officer called a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE). Assuming sufficient evidence of impaired driving from drugs, the arrested may face charges of driving under the influence of drugs or the combined influence of alcohol and drugs.\\r\\nMost of the time, the driver will either be kept in a holding cell (sometimes referred to as the \\"drunk tank\\") until they are deemed sober enough to be released on bail or on his \\"own recognizance\\" (\\"O.R.\\"). A date to appear in court for an arraignment will be given to them. If they cannot make bail or is not granted O.R., they will be kept in jail to wait for the arraignment on remand.\\r\\nDrunk driving is a public health concern in the United States, and reducing its frequency may require an integrated community-based approach utilizing sanctions and treatments.[54] Several intervention programs have been developed, such as the Paradigm Developmental Model of Treatment (PDMT), a program encouraging a paradigm shift in the offender's view of oneself and the world.[55]\\r\\nThe National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism suggests environmental interventions to help eliminate drinking and driving all together. To date, the most successful law[citation needed] in combating drinking and driving has been raising the minimum drinking age to 21 (NIAAA, 2011). NHTSA estimates that a legal drinking age of 21 saves 700 to 1,000 lives annually.[citation needed] Since 1976, these laws have prevented more than 21,000 traffic deaths.[citation needed] Other suggestions include raising taxes, enacting zero-tolerance laws, stepping up enforcement, school-based prevention programs, and family based prevention programs (NIAAA).\\r\\nIn countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia drunk driving and deaths caused by drunk driving are considerably lower than in the USA. Drunk driving deaths in the UK (population 61 million, 31 million cars) were 380 in 2010 (21% of all fatal accidents).[56][57][58] In California (population 36 million, 32 million cars) there were 950 deaths from traffic accidents involving drivers with a Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) of 0.08 or greater) in 2009 (31% of all fatal accidents).[59][60] Alcohol consumption per capita in the UK and Australia is higher than in the USA and the legal age for drinking lower.[61]\\r\\nResearch in the United Kingdom has shown that the danger group for drunk driving is young men in their early 20s rather than teenagers.[62] It is not uncommon for police forces in Australia to randomly stop motorists and submit them to a Random breath test. This test involves speaking or blowing into a hand held device to give a reading. Refusing a roadside test is an offense, and is subject to the same penalty as high range drunk driving. This detection method is not employed in the UK, and it is not an offence in England or Wales for a fully licensed driver to drive with a BAC of less than 0.08% (Australia and Scotland have limits of 0.05%). Also in Australia it is an offence for any person driving on Learner or probationary ('P1 or P2') plates (aged under 20 years) to drive with any alcohol at all in their system. The BAC must be 0.00% and still remains under 0.05% for an \\"instructing a learner\\".\\r\\nUnlike the USA, these countries do not see restricting access to alcohol as having any useful role to play in reducing drunk driving. Their experience is that random breath tests, severe penalties, including imprisonment for a first offense (in UK), combined with blanket public service broadcasting are a more effective strategy.[63]\\r\\nAlso, Australian and British Law do not recognize the crime of DUI Manslaughter and sentences for causing death by drunk driving are much lower than the USA. In the UK, a judge makes a sentencing decision based on the amount of alcohol present. This can lead to imprisonment for a first offence.[64][65]\\r\\nIn Germany, a legal limit of 0.05% lowers to 0.03% if a driver is found to be at fault in a traffic accident. 0.00% is the standard for those who are under 21 years of age.[66]","input":"What is the blood alcohol limit in usa?"},{"output":"seven","context":"Violin Renditions of:\\r\\n\\"My Love\\" by Paul McCartney and Wings\\"[1]\\r\\n\\"A Groovy Kind of Love\\" by Phil Collins\\r\\n\\"The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding\\" is a double length episode of the television sitcom Friends. It first aired on May 17, 2001 as the finale of season seven. It is usually broadcast in a one-hour slot and presented on DVD as one complete episode, but when the episodes are split the two parts are differentiated by the suffixes Part 1 and Part 2. For his guest appearance, Gary Oldman was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMonica is making a list of things which are most likely to go wrong which seems to be all Rachel's chores when suddenly Joey appears telling them that he got a part in the movie which he wanted, which is related to World War I.\\r\\nAt the studios, Joey has started shooting with Richard Crosby (Gary Oldman) who keeps spitting while saying his lines which annoys Joey. When he can't stand it anymore, he talks to Richard about it, when Richard tells him that all good actors spit while saying their lines. Therefore, when they shoot the next scene, Joey and Richard both constantly spit at each other while saying their lines. When their scenes are over for the day, Joey is given lines for scenes for the next day. However, Joey can't come the next day since he is performing Monica and Chandler's wedding. Because he's still in the mood of saying the lines, he accidentally spits on the man who gave him the lines, while telling him that he has important plans due to which he can't come.\\r\\nBack at Monica's apartment, Chandler and Monica are going to their wedding rehearsal. Chandler listens to the answering machine after Monica leaves, when he realizes they're becoming \\"The Bings\\". At the rehearsal things are going smoothly until Chandler's parents come and things go crazy. When Chandler's mom, Nora Tyler-Bing (played by Morgan Fairchild), is introduced to Monica's parents Jack and Judy Geller, Jack embarrasses himself by asking her \\"so...are you Chandler's mom or dad?\\" Chandler's mom and Chandler's dad, Charles Bing (played by Kathleen Turner), keep having arguments. As a consequence, Rachel is told by Monica to keep them away from each other. Since Rachel doesn't know what Chandler's dad looks like, Monica describes him, saying \\"a man in the black dress\\". When Rachel looks around, she spots a woman in a black dress having a drink nearby, and assumes that she is Chandler's dad. When both of them introduce themselves, the woman says her name is Amanda and Rachel replies \\"Oh, I get it - a-man-duh!\\", embarrassing herself.\\r\\nWhen they return to their apartments, Rachel, Phoebe and Monica are sitting down at the table in Monica's apartment. Monica gets up, walks to her wedding dress and asks Rachel and Phoebe if anyone wanted to be in charge of looking after the dress. Rachel volunteers, but Monica ignores her since she obviously thinks Rachel is irresponsible from results in the past. Rachel is hurt when she volunteers twice and Monica doesn't give her the responsibility. She states that she can be responsible, leading Monica to feel as if she's misjudging her. She apologizes to Rachel and hands over the responsibility to her.\\r\\nAfter the dinner, when Ross goes to Joey's apartment looking for Chandler (who's staying there that night because of the whole \\"the groom isn't supposed to see the bride before the wedding\\" thing), he finds an empty apartment and a note. When he unfolds it, he finds a note from Chandler saying \\"tell Monica I'm sorry\\". Ross immediately goes across the hall to Monica's apartment - Rachel opens the door when Monica is in her bedroom, and Ross explains the situation to her. A little while later, Phoebe arrives at the door to find out what's going on and when Rachel just hands over the note without explaining the situation, Phoebe assumes Ross wrote it and tells him to tell Monica himself that he's sorry. Ross goes out to search for Chandler but unfortunately fails.\\r\\nThe next morning, Ross arrives at Monica's apartment and informs Rachel and Phoebe that he still hasn't found Chandler. When he leaves, Monica comes out of her room in excitement and starts getting ready. Seeing that Chandler still isn't found and Monica's so excited and thrilled about her wedding day, Rachel starts to panic and eventually cries. Therefore, Phoebe takes her to the bathroom because Monica can't see her in this state or she will know something's wrong. When they're in there, Phoebe finds a positive pregnancy test in the garbage and deduces that Monica is pregnant.\\r\\nRoss tells Rachel to stall Monica so he can have more time to search for Chandler and Phoebe helps him search. When Monica comes back out of her room to begin getting ready for the wedding, Rachel distracts her by saying \\"I'm never gonna get married\\" and started to cry.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Ross and Phoebe find a confused Chandler in his office. He tells them he loves Monica so much, and he doesn't want to hurt her, but he's afraid that becoming 'the Bings' will spell marital misery, maybe as bad as his parents. Ross convinces Chandler to go back to the apartment and begin getting ready, doing one thing at a time, not thinking about the goal. In Monica's apartment, Rachel tries other less believable tactics to distract Monica and she realizes that something is going on. Rachel decides to tell Monica, and starts saying \\"We can't find Chandler...\\". At this point, Phoebe opens the door and gives a thumbs-up sign to Rachel, who suddenly changes the subject \\"Chandler...'s vest\\", controlling the situation.\\r\\nAt the studios, Joey is stuck shooting an easy scene over and over since Richard is drunk and can barely stay focused. The director makes it very clear to Joey that he can't leave until the scene is finished or as long as Richard is on set and conscious, so Joey convinces a confused Richard that they've completed all of their scenes and sends him home.\\r\\nAt the hotel, everything is ready for the wedding when Joey calls Rachel to warn her that he'll be late. Meanwhile, Ross is keeping an eye on Chandler since he still has cold feet. Chandler steps out to sneak a cigarette when he suddenly hears Phoebe and Rachel coming, so he ducks into a storeroom to hide. He overhears that Monica's pregnant and takes off again. Rachel finds another wedding finishing up in the same hotel and convinces the minister to officiate the wedding in case Joey doesn't arrive in time. Meanwhile, Ross and Phoebe find Chandler again, who admits that he was indeed running away until he found a small baby outfit in the hotel's gift store and realized that someone that small can't be scary. He then goes with Phoebe and Ross to the wedding.\\r\\nAs the ceremony begins, Joey finally arrives and takes his place between Monica and Chandler, accidentally letting slip that Chandler had second thoughts about the wedding. Monica delivers her self-written vow, while Chandler delivers one from the heart - both speeches are very moving. When the ceremony is over Chandler tells Monica that he knows about her being pregnant and how Phoebe told him she found a pregnancy test in the trash, but she reveals she didn't take a pregnancy test. Phoebe exclaims to Rachel how Chandler & Monica are now married and how great it is that they're going to have a baby, and the camera zooms in on Rachel as she manages out a weak \\"uh-huh\\" with a slightly panicked look on her face, thus revealing to the audience that she's the one who's pregnant.\\r\\nThe show was filmed over two weeks, with all of the scenes featuring Gary Oldman being filmed in the first week. The wedding was filmed in the second week, with the final shot of Rachel filmed after the studio audience had left.[2]\\r\\nThe first part has a 9.1 rating at TV.com[3] with the second having a slightly higher 9.3.[4] Gary Oldman received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his portrayal of Richard Crosby.

American policy during the Cold War tried to prevent Soviet Union influence by supporting anti-communist regimes and backing Israel against Soviet-sponsored Arab countries. The U.S. also came to replace the United Kingdom as the main security patron of the Persian Gulf states in the 1960s and 1970s, working to ensure a stable flow of Gulf oil.[1] Since the 9/11 attacks of 2001, U.S. policy has included an emphasis on counter-terrorism. The U.S. has diplomatic relations with all countries in the Middle East except for Iran, whose 1979 revolution brought to power a staunchly anti-American regime.\\r\\nRecent priorities of the U.S. government in the Middle East have included resolving the ArabÿIsraeli conflict and limiting the spread of weapons of mass destruction[2] among regional states.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States' relationship with the Middle East prior to World War?I was limited, although commercial ties existed even in the early 19th century. President Andrew Jackson established formal ties with the Sultan of Muscat and Oman in 1833. (The Sultan saw the U.S. as a potential balance to Britain's overwhelming regional influence.) Commercial relations opened between the U.S. and Persia in 1857, after Britain persuaded the Persian government not to ratify a similar agreement in 1851.[3]\\r\\nIn comparison to European powers such as Britain and France which had managed to colonize almost all of the Middle East region after defeating the Ottoman Empire in 1918, the United States was \\"popular and respected throughout the Middle East\\".[4] Indeed, \\"Americans were seen as good people, untainted by the selfishness and duplicity associated with the Europeans.\\"[5] American missionaries had brought modern medicine and set up educational institutions all over the Middle East. Moreover, the United States had provided the Middle East with highly skilled petroleum engineers.[6] Thus, there were some connections made between the United States and the Middle East before the Second World War. Other examples of cooperations between the U.S. and the Middle East are the Red Line Agreement signed in 1928 and the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement signed in 1944. Both of these agreements were legally binding and reflected an American interest in control of Middle Eastern energy resources, namely oil, and moreover reflected an American \\"security imperative to prevent the (re)emergence of a powerful regional rival\\".[7] The Red Line Agreement had been \\"part of a network of agreements made in the 1920s to restrict supply of petroleum and ensure that the major [mostly American] companies  could control oil prices on world markets\\".[8] The Red Line agreement governed the development of Middle East oil for the next two decades. The Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement of 1944 was based on negotiations between the United States and Britain over the control of Middle Eastern oil. Below is shown what the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had in mind for to a British Ambassador in 1944:\\r\\nPersian oil  is yours. We share the oil of Iraq and Kuwait. As for Saudi Arabian oil, it's ours.[9]\\r\\nOn August 8, 1944, the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement was signed, dividing Middle Eastern oil between the United States and Britain. Consequently, political scholar Fred H. Lawson remarks, that by the mid-1944, U.S. officials had buttressed their country's position on the peninsula by concluding an Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement that protected \\"all valid concession contracts and lawfully acquired rights\\" belonging to the signatories and established a principle of \\"equal opportunity\\" in those areas where no concession had yet been assigned.[10] Furthermore, political scholar Irvine Anderson summarises American interests in the Middle East in the late 19th century and the early 20th century noting that, \\"the most significant event of the period was the transition of the United States from the position of net exporter to one of net importer of petroleum.\\"[11]\\r\\nBy the end of the Second World War, the United States had come to consider the Middle East region as \\"the most strategically important area of the world.\\"[12] and \\"one of the greatest material prizes in world history,\\" argues Noam Chomsky.[12] For that reason, it was not until around the period of World War?II that America became directly involved in the Middle East region. At this time the region was going through great social, economic and political changes and as a result, internally the Middle East was in turmoil. Politically, the Middle East was experiencing an upsurge in the popularity of nationalistic politics and an increase in the number of nationalistic political groups across the region, which was causing great trouble for the English and French colonial powers.\\r\\nHistory scholar Jack Watson explains that \\"Europeans could not hold these lands indefinitely in the face of Arab nationalism\\".[13] Watson then continues, stating that \\"by the end of 1946 Palestine was the last remaining mandate, but it posed a major problem\\".[14] In truth, this nationalistic political trend clashed with American interests in the Middle East, which were, as Middle East scholar Louise Fawcett argues, \\"about the Soviet Union, access to oil and the project for a Jewish state in Palestine\\".[15] Hence, Arabist Ambassador Raymond Hare described the Second World War, as \\"the great divide\\" in United States' relation with the Middle East, because these three interests would later serve as a backdrop and reasoning for a great deal of American interventions in the Middle East and thus also come to be the cause of several future conflicts between the United States and the Middle East.[5]\\r\\nIn 1947, the U.S. and the Truman administration, under domestic political pressure, pushed for a solution and resolution on the ArabÿIsraeli conflict, and in May 1948 the new state of Israel came into existence. This process was not without its fights and loss of lives. Nevertheless, \\"the first state to extend diplomatic recognition to Israel was the United States; the Soviet Union and several Western nations quickly followed suit. No Arab state, however, recognized Israel.\\"[16]\\r\\nSyria became an independent republic in 1946, but the March 1949 Syrian coup d'tat, led by Army Chief of Staff Husni al-Za'im, ended the initial period of civilian rule. Za'im met at least six times with CIA operatives in the months prior to the coup to discuss his plan to seize power. Za'im requested American funding or personnel, but it is not known whether this assistance was provided. Once in power, Za'im made several key decisions that benefitted the United States. He approved the Trans-Arabian Pipeline (TAPLINE), an American project designed to transport Saudi Arabian oil to Mediterranean ports. Construction of TAPLINE had been delayed due to Syrian intransigence. Za'im also improved relations with two American allies in the region: Israel and Turkey. He signed an armistice with Israel, formally ending the 1948 ArabÿIsraeli War and he renounced Syrian claims to Hatay Province, a major source of dispute between Syria and Turkey. Za'im also cracked down on local communists. However, Za'im's regime was short-lived. He was overthrown in August, just four and a half months after seizing power.[17][18][19][20]\\r\\nOpposed to foreign intervention in Iran and a keen nationalist, Mohammed Mosaddeq became the prime minister of Iran in 1951. Thus, when Mosaddeq was elected he chose to nationalize the Iranian oil industry, where previously British holdings had generated great profits for Britain through the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Furthermore, prior to the nationalisation of Iranian oil Mosaddeq had also cut all diplomatic ties with Britain.[21] The Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was opposed to the nationalisation of Iranian oil as he feared this would result in an oil embargo, which would destroy Iran's economy and thus, the Shah was very concerned with the effect of Mosaddeq's policies on Iran. Equally worried were workers in the Iranian oil industry, when they experienced the economic effect of the sanctions on Iranian oil exports which Mosaddeq's policies had resulted in, and riots were happening across Iran.[22]\\r\\nThus, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi asked Mosaddeq to resign, as was the Shah's constitutional right, but Mosaddeq refused, which resulted in national uprisings. The Shah, fearing for his personal security, fled the country but nominated General Fazlollah Zahedi as new Prime Minister. Although General Fazlollah Zahedi was a nationalist, he did not agree with the Mosaddeq's lenient attitude towards the communist Tudeh party, which the United States had also become increasingly concerned with, fearing Soviet influence spreading in the Middle East. Therefore, in late 1952, the British government asked the U.S. administration for help with the removal of Mohammed Mosaddeq. President Harry S. Truman thought Mossadeq was a valuable bulwark against Soviet influence.[23] However, Truman left office in January 1953, and the new administration of Dwight Eisenhower shared British concern over Mossadeq. Allen Dulles, the director of the CIA, approved one million dollars on April 4, 1953 to be used \\"in any way that would bring about the fall of Mossadegh\\"[24] Consequently, after a failed attempt on August 15, \\"on August 19, 1953, General Fazlollah Zahedi succeeded [with the help of the United States and Britain] and Mossadegh was overthrown. The CIA covertly funneled five million dollars to General Zahedi's regime on August 21, 1953.\\"[24]\\r\\nThis CIA operation, often referred to as Operation Ajax and led by CIA officer Kermit Roosevelt, Jr., ensured the return of the Shah on August 22, 1953.[22]\\r\\nToday more than a quarter of the world's oil is shipped through the Suez Canal.[25]\\r\\nAlthough accepting large sums of military aid from the United States in 1954, by 1956 Egyptian leader Nasser had grown tired of the American influence in the country. The involvement that the U.S. would take in Egyptian business and politics in return for aid, Nasser thought \\"smacked of colonialism.\\"[26] Indeed, as political scholar B.M. Bleckman argued in 1978, \\"Nasser had ambivalent feelings toward the United States. From 1952 to 1954 he was on close terms with U.S. officials and was viewed in Washington as a promising moderate Arab leader. The conclusion of an arms deal with the USSR in 1955, however, had cooled the relationship between Cairo and Washington considerably, and the Dulles-Eisenhower decision to withdraw the offer to finance the Aswan High Dam in mid-1956 was a further blow to the chances of maintaining friendly ties. Eisenhower's stand against the British, French, and Israeli attack on Egypt in October 1956 created a momentary sense of gratitude on the part of Nasser, but the subsequent development of the Eisenhower Doctrine, so clearly aimed at 'containing' Nasserism, undermined what little goodwill existed toward the United States in Cairo.\\"[27] \\"The Suez Crisis of 1956 marked the demise of British power and its gradual replacement by USA as the dominant power in the Middle East.\\"[28] The Eisenhower Doctrine became a manifestation of this process. \\"The general objective of the Eisenhower Doctrine, like that of the Truman Doctrine formulated ten years earlier, was the containment of Soviet expansion.\\"[29] Furthermore, when the Doctrine was finalised on March 9, 1957, it \\"essentially gave the president the latitude to intervene militarily in the Middle East  without having to resort to Congress.\\"[30] indeed as, Middle East scholar Irene L. Gerdzier explains \\"that with the Eisenhower Doctrine the United States emerged \\"as the uncontested Western power  in the Middle East.\\"[31]\\r\\nMeanwhile, in Jordan nationalistic anti-government rioting broke out and the United States decided to send a battalion of marines to Lebanon in case of possibly having to intervene in Jordan later that year. Moreover, attempting to keep the pro-American King Hussein of Jordan in power, the CIA started to make secret payments of millions of dollars a year to King Hussein. In the same year, the U.S. supported allies in Lebanon, Iraq, Turkey and Saudi Arabia and sent fleets to be near Syria as Syria's government had executed nationalistic and pro-Soviet policies the same year.[32] However, 1958 was to become a difficult year in U.S. foreign policy; in 1958 Syria and Egypt were merged into the \\"United Arab Republic\\", anti-American and anti-government revolts started occurring in Lebanon, causing the Lebanese president Chamoun to ask America for help, and the very pro-American King Feisal the 2nd of Iraq was overthrown by a group of nationalistic military officers.[33] It was quite \\"commonly believed that [Nasser]  stirred up the unrest in Lebanon and, perhaps, had helped to plan the Iraqi revolution.\\"[34]\\r\\nIn June 1967 Israel fought with Egypt, Jordan, and Syria in the Six-Day War. As a result of the war, Israel captured the West Bank, Golan Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula. The U.S. supported Israel with weapons and continued to support Israel financially throughout the 1970s. On September 17, 1970, with U.S. and Israeli help, Jordanian troops attacked PLO guerrilla camps, while Jordan's U.S.-supplied air force dropped napalm from above. The U.S. deployed the aircraft carrier Independence and six destroyers off the coast of Lebanon and readied troops in Turkey to support the assault.\\r\\nThe American interventions in the years before the Iranian revolution have all proven to be based in part on economic considerations, but more so have been influenced and led by the international Cold War context.[35]\\r\\nSaudi Arabia and the United States are strategic allies,[36][37][38] but relations with the U.S. became strained following September 11 attacks.[39]\\r\\nIn March 2015, President Barack Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a \\"Joint Planning Cell\\" with Saudi Arabia.[40] The report by Human Rights Watch stated that US-made bombs were being used in attacks indiscriminately targeting civilians and violating the laws of war.[41]\\r\\nAfghanistan and Pakistan, though situated in South Asia, are considered part of the Greater Middle East. U.S. intervention in both Afghanistan and Pakistan started with the Carter Administration after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The relations of the U.S. with Afghanistan and Pakistan have been closely tied to the War on terrorism that has happened there. American policy has been instrumental in coordinating the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan. In recent times, political situations of both countries have been bracketed under a single theater of operations, denoted by the newly coined American term \\"AfPak.\\"[42]\\r\\nOn 15 July 2016, a coup d'tat was attempted in Turkey by a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces against state institutions, including, but not limited to the government and President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an.\\r\\nThe Turkish government accused the coup leaders of being linked to the Glen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Glen, a Turkish businessman and cleric who lives in Pennsylvania, United States. Erdo?an accuses Glen of being behind the coupa claim that Glen deniesand accused the United States of harboring him. President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an accused the head of United States Central Command, chief General Joseph Votel[43] of \\"siding with coup plotters,\\" (after Votel accused the Turkish government of arresting the Pentagon's contacts in Turkey).[44]","input":"When did america first enter the middle east?"},{"output":"Allegheny","context":"The following is a history of the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessional baseball has been played in the Pittsburgh area since 1876. The teams of the era were \\"independents\\", barnstorming throughout the region and not affiliated with any organized league, though they did have salaries and were run as business organizations.[1] In 1882, the strongest team in the area joined the American Association as a founding member. Their various home fields in the 19th century were in a then-separate city called Allegheny City, across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. The team was listed as \\"Allegheny\\" in the standings, and was sometimes called the \\"Alleghenys\\" (not the \\"Alleghenies\\") in the same generic way that teams from Boston, New York, and Chicago were sometimes called the \\"Bostons\\", the \\"New Yorks\\", and the \\"Chicagos\\", in the sports writing style of that era. After five mediocre seasons in the A.A., Pittsburgh became the first A.A. team to switch to the older National League in 1887. At this time, the team renamed itself the Pittsburgh Alleghenys,[2] although Allegheny remained a separate city until it was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1907. At that time, owner-manager Horace Phillips sold the team to Dennis McKnight; Phillips stayed on as manager.[3]\\r\\nIn those early days, the club benefited three times from mergers with defunct clubs. The A.A. club picked up a number of players from a defunct Columbus, Ohio, team in 1885.\\r\\nThe Alleghenys were severely crippled during the 1890 season, when nearly all of their stars jumped to the Pittsburgh Burghers of the Players' League. With a decimated roster, the team experienced what is still the worst season in franchise history, going 23ÿ113.[4] The battle nearly ruined McKnight, and he was forced to return his franchise to the league. However, almost immediately after this, McKnight joined the backers of the Burghers as a minority owner, which then repurchased the Pittsburgh National League franchise and rechartered it under a different corporate name. They were thus able to legally recover the services of most of the players who had jumped to the upstart league a year earlier.[3]\\r\\nThe new owners also signed highly regarded second baseman Lou Bierbauer, who had previously played with the AA's Philadelphia Athletics. The Athletics failed to include him on their reserve list, and the Alleghenys picked him up. Nonetheless, this led to loud protests by the Athletics, and in an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' actions were \\"piratical\\".[5] This incident (which is discussed at some length in The Beer and Whisky League, by David Nemec, 1994) quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A.A. Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, they made sport of being denounced for being \\"piratical\\" by renaming themselves \\"the Pirates\\" for the 1891 season.[2] The nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912.\\r\\nAfter the 1899 season, the Pirates made what is arguably the best player transaction in franchise history when they picked up nearly all of the star players from the Louisville Colonels. Louisville owner Barney Dreyfuss had been told that the Colonels were slated for elimination when the N.L. contracted from 12 to 8 teams. He secretly purchased a half-interest in the Pirates, then after the season sent nearly all of the Colonels' stars up the Ohio River to Pittsburgh. Since the transaction occurred before the Colonels officially folded, it was structured as a trade; the Pirates sent four relatively unknown players to Louisville.[3] Despite their nickname, the Pirates at least waited until after the season to pull off this blockbuster trade. This is unlike what happened in 1899 to the Cleveland Spiders and, to a lesser extent, the Baltimore Orioles, who were also part of two-team ownerships. Dreyfuss later bought full control of the team and kept it until his death in 1932.\\r\\nBolstered by former Colonels shortstop Honus Wagner (who was born and raised in the Pittsburgh area) and player/manager Fred Clarke, the Pirates completely dominated the National League, in part because they lost few star players to the rival American League. However, owing to injuries to their starting pitchers, they lost the first modern World Series ever played, in 1903, to Boston. Deacon Phillippe pitched five complete games, winning three of them, but it was not enough. With largely the same star players, the Pirates would continue to be a strong team over the next few years, and won their first World Series title in 1909, defeating the Detroit Tigers in seven games. The same year, the club opened Forbes Field, which would be its home stadium for the next 61 years.\\r\\nThe Pirates originally played in Recreation, Union, and Exposition Parks, all in what was then Allegheny City. Allegheny City was annexed by Pittsburgh in December 1907. Accordingly, the Pirates did not play their first major league game in Pittsburgh until 1908 ÿ over 25 years after their founding.[6]\\r\\nThe decline of Honus Wagner, considered by many to be the greatest shortstop ever, led to a number of losing seasons, culminating in a disastrous 51ÿ103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder Max Carey and young players Pie Traynor and Kiki Cuyler, along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back into the spotlight. The Pirates recovered from a 3ÿ1 deficit to win the 1925 World Series over the Washington Senators, and reached the 1927 World Series before being swept by the New York Yankees, who at that time had built the most dominant team in baseball. The 1927 season was the first for the sharp-hitting combination of brothers Lloyd Waner and Paul Waner, who along with shortstop Arky Vaughan ensured that the Pirates had plenty of Hall of Fame-caliber position players through 1941. However, the Pirates' crushing defeats in 1927 and 1938 (when they lost the pennant to the Chicago Cubs in the final days of the season) were tremendous setbacks.\\r\\nThe post-World War II years were not kind to the Pirates, despite the presence of a genuine star in Ralph Kiner, who led or co-led the National League in home runs for seven consecutive seasons (1946 through 1952). Kiner would be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1975.\\r\\nIn 1946, the long era of ownership by the Barney Dreyfuss family came to an end when it sold the team to a syndicate that was led by Indianapolis businessman Frank McKinney; the group also included entertainer Bing Crosby, Pittsburgh attorney Thomas Johnson, and Columbus, Ohio-based real estate tycoon John W. Galbreath. The new owners seemingly scored a coup when they purchased veteran slugger Hank Greenberg from the Detroit Tigers for the 1947 season. The Hall-of-Fame-bound Greenberg, then 36, had led the American League in home runs (44) and runs batted in (127) in 1946, his first full season after almost five years in military service. But a contentious relationship with the Detroit front office ended his 12-year career with the Tigers after a .319 batting average, 306 homers and 1,528 hits.\\r\\nWith Greenberg a fearsome, right-handed power hitter, the Pirates' new ownership decided to make Forbes Field a more inviting home run destination. They reduced the previously-cavernous dimensions of the left field and left-center-field section of the park by 30 feet (9.1?m) by moving the bullpens to the base of the old left field wall, behind a new fence that was 335 feet (102?m) from home plate down the left-field line.\\r\\nThe shorter porch was immediately dubbed \\"Greenberg Gardens\\" in honor of the former Tiger. As events turned out, however, Greenberg's playing career was winding down rapidly. He played only 125 games for the 1947 Pirates, hit 25 home runs (18 at Forbes Field),[7] batted only .249, and then retired from the game. Kinerwho, as rookie, had led the National League in homers with 23 playing in the old Forbes Fieldbecame the beneficiary of the new left-field configuration, which was quickly renamed \\"Kiner's Korner.\\" He slugged 51 home runs in 1947, then followed with seasons of 40, 54, 47, 42 and 37 blasts to lead the NL, sharing the home run title with Johnny Mize (1947ÿ1948) and Hank Sauer (1952).\\r\\nWhile attendance figures at Forbes Field rose to among the top in the NL, the team built around Kiner placed in the first division only once ÿ in 1948 ÿ and in 1952 compiled one of the worst records in major league history, winning 42 and losing 112 games (.273) and finishing 54? games out of first place. The new ownership group reorganized during 1950, when Galbreath, Crosby and Johnson bought out McKinney's investment, and Galbreath became majority owner. His family would control the destiny of the Pirates for the next 35 years.\\r\\nGalbreath's first major move, the hiring of Branch Rickey as general manager after the 1950 campaign, was initially a great disappointment to Pittsburgh fans. Rickey had invented the farm system with the Cardinals and broken the baseball color line with the Dodgers, building dynasties with each club. In Pittsburgh, though, he purged the roster of its higher-salaried veterans (including Kiner in 1953) and flooded the team with young players. Many of those youngsters faltered, but those who fulfilled Rickey's faith in them ÿ pitchers Vern Law, Bob Friend and Elroy Face, shortstop Dick Groat, second baseman Bill Mazeroski, and especially outfielder Roberto Clemente, drafted from Brooklyn after his only minor league season (1954) ÿ would form the nucleus of the Pirates' 1960 championship club. Moreover, as in St. Louis and Brooklyn, Rickey put into place one of baseball's most successful farm and scouting systems, keeping the Pirates competitive into the late 1970s. However, all this was not evident when Rickey (then 73) retired due to ill health in 1955, with the Pirates still struggling to escape the NL basement.\\r\\n\\"Kiner's Korner\\", meanwhile, was demolished in 1954, restoring Forbes Field to its previous, pitching-friendly contour.\\r\\nThe 1948 team was the only postwar Pirates squad with a winning record until 1958, Danny Murtaugh's first full season as manager. Murtaugh is widely credited with inventing the concept of the closer by frequently playing Face late in close games. The 1960 team featured eight All-Stars, but was widely predicted to lose the World Series to a powerful New York Yankees team. In one of the most memorable World Series in history, the Pirates were defeated by ten or more runs in three games, won three close games, then recovered from a 7ÿ4 deficit late in Game 7 eventually to win on a walk-off home run by Mazeroski, a second baseman better known for defensive wizardry. The 1960 Pirates were the only team between 1945 and 2001 to have not succumbed to the so-called \\"Ex-Cubs Factor\\" in the postseason. They also became the first team to win a World Series on a home run, a feat later achieved by the Toronto Blue Jays in 1993, although Joe Carter's home run came in Game 6 of the 1993 Series. Mazeroski's homer remains the only walk-off home run in Game 7 of a World Series.\\r\\nThe 1960s would continue with extremely solid defensive play by Bill Mazeroski and the great offensive and defensive abilities of Clemente, baseball's first Puerto Rican superstar. Clemente was regarded as one of the game's best all-time hitters, and possessed a tremendous arm in right field. Although not the first black-Hispanic baseball player (an honor belonging to Minnie Mi?oso), Clemente's charisma and leadership in humanitarian causes made him an icon across the continent. During his playing career, Clemente was often overlooked, but today many consider him to have been one of the greatest right fielders in baseball history.\\r\\nEven with Roberto Clemente, however, the Pirates struggled to post winning marks from 1961 to 1964, and Murtaugh was replaced by Harry Walker in 1965. With Walker, a renowned batting coach, at the helm, and the hitting of Clemente, Matty Alou, Manny Mota and others, the Bucs fielded contending, 90+ win teams in both 1965 and 1966, with Clemente claiming the National League MVP Award in the latter year. However, Pittsburgh had no answer for the pitching of the Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants, and finished third both seasons. In 1967, they fell back to .500, and did not contend through the rest of the 1960s.\\r\\nSlugger Willie Stargell became a fixture in the Pittsburgh lineup in the late 1960s, and the Pirates returned to prominence in 1970. Murtaugh returned as manager and the Pirates' home field, Forbes Field, was demolished in favor of the multi-purpose Three Rivers Stadium. In 1970, the Pirates won their first of five National League East division titles over the next seven years, and won their fourth World Series in 1971 behind a .414 Series batting average by Clemente. They also thought they had a genuine superstar pitcher (historically rare for the Pirates) in Steve Blass, who pitched two masterful games in the World Series against Baltimore and had excellent seasons in 1968 and 1972.[8]\\r\\nOn September 1, 1971, the Pirates made Major League Baseball history by fielding the first all-black/minority starting lineup: second baseman Rennie Stennett, center fielder Gene Clines, right fielder Roberto Clemente, left fielder Willie Stargell, catcher Manny Sanguilln, third baseman Dave Cash, first baseman Al Oliver, shortstop Jackie Hernndez, and pitcher Dock Ellis.[9] Manager Danny Murtaugh had never hesitated using minority players in the lineup, but even the players took notice when he posted the lineup that day. Blass later recalled, \\"The thing I remember about it, when he was interviewed afterwards, Murtaugh said, I put the nine best athletes out there. The best nine I put out there tonight happened to be black. No big deal. Next question.\\"[10]\\r\\nThe sports world was stunned and saddened when Clemente died in a plane crash on December 31, 1972, while accompanying a shipment of relief supplies to the victims of an earthquake in Nicaragua. Tom Walker, then-Montreal Expos pitcher and future father of Pirates second baseman Neil Walker, offered to join Clemente that day but Clemente insisted that he stay home. Thus, Roberto Clemente had an influence on the 2013 playoff run. He had reached a milestone by rapping his 3,000th career hit, a stand-up double off Jon Matlack of the New York Mets on September 30, 1972, in what would prove to be his last regular-season at-bat. The Baseball Hall of Fame waived its usual waiting requirement and inducted Clemente immediately. Pittsburgh would erect a statue and name a bridge and park near the stadium after him, as well as a street in the Oakland neighborhood near the former site of Forbes Field.\\r\\nIn 1973, Blass suffered a mysterious decline in his pitching abilities, posting a 9.85 ERA. To this day, pitchers who suddenly lose the ability to throw strikes are said to have \\"Steve Blass disease.\\"[11] Blass retired soon after; he has since, for almost two decades, been one of the Pirates' radio and TV announcers.\\r\\nThe Pirates made the playoffs in 1974 and 1975, but lost the National League Championship Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds, respectively. The speedy Omar Moreno and the power-hitting Dave Parker joined Stargell in the lineup during this period. After the 1976 season, in which the Bucs finished in second place behind the cross-state Philadelphia Phillies, Danny Murtaugh died. The Pirates struck a trade with the Oakland Athletics in which catcher Manny Sanguilln was sent to Oakland for manager Chuck Tanner. The Pirates would finish second to the Phillies once again in 1977, with Parker winning a batting title. It was also in 1977 that the Pirates began wearing yellow and black uniforms with pillbox caps. Stargell would award teammates with \\"Stargell Stars\\" on their caps for excellent plays on the field. The following year, the Pirates turned the end of the 1978 season into an impromptu race for the NL East, as they tried to chase down the collapsing Phillies, who ultimately won the division, only to fall short during the final home stand of the season (ironically against the Phillies). Despite this, Parker won another batting title and was named National League MVP to go with it.\\r\\nAdopting the popular song \\"We Are Family\\" by the Philadelphia disco group Sister Sledge as their theme song, the 1979 Pirates held off the Montreal Expos to claim the pennant. \\"We Are Family\\" was elevated from theme song to anthem status (and is still nearly synonymous with the '79 Pirates), with fans chanting \\"Fam-a-lee!\\" from the stands. The Pirates faced the Baltimore Orioles again in the World Series, which (like 1971) they won in seven games, on October 17, 1979. During the 1979 championship season, a Pirate player was designated as Most Valuable Player in every available category: All-Star Game MVP (Dave Parker), NL Championship Series MVP (Willie Stargell), World Series MVP (Willie Stargell), and National League MVP (Willie Stargell, shared with Keith Hernandez of the Cardinals).\\r\\nAfter three world titles and six division titles since 1948 the Galbreaths began listening to offers to sell the franchise. Edward J. Lewis of Oxford Development and Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr. made a serious offer to purchase the team in early 1981.[12] Both the city of New Orleans, Louisiana and Tampa, Florida put packages together to attempt to lure the team out of Pittsburgh.\\r\\nAfter the 1979 World Series, the Pirates entered a period of decline, steadily declining until they were regarded as the worst team in baseball during the mid-1980s. After the Pittsburgh Drug Trials and a league worst finish in 1985, the Galbreath family sold the franchise to the Pittsburgh Associates, a consortium of area businesses determined to keep the team from relocating.[13] Jim Leyland took over as manager in 1986, and under his guidance the Pirates gradually climbed out of the cellar. They featured young and exciting players such as the \\"outfield of dreams\\" Bobby Bonilla, Barry Bonds, and Andy Van Slyke; infielders Jay Bell, Steve Buechele, Sid Bream, and Jos Lind; catcher Mike LaValliere, and pitchers Doug Drabek, John Smiley, and Stan Belinda.\\r\\nAs a rookie in 1982, Johnny Ray played in every game and was named the Rookie of the Year by the Sporting News.\\r\\nIn 1988, the young team finished 85ÿ75 and seemed ready to compete for a pennant. However, the 1989 season was a major setback, with injuries depleting the squad and leading to a fifth-place finish. Among the low points of the season was a game against rival Philadelphia Phillies in Philadelphia on June 8, 1989, where the Pirates became the first team in major-league history to score 10 runs in the first inning and nevertheless lose the game.[14] Pirates broadcaster (and former pitcher) Jim Rooker famously vowed that if the team blew the lead, he would walk home from Philadelphiaa vow he fulfilled after the season while raising money for charity.[15]\\r\\nThe Pirates would win the first three NL East titles of the 1990s, but failed to advance to the World Series each time. In both 1991 and 1992, they lost closely contested League Championship Series to the Atlanta Braves.\\r\\nAfter the 1992 season, the front office set out to rebuild the team, giving up several high-payroll players in favor of a younger crew. The Pirates were unable to produce a winning season until 2013, accumulating a 20-year losing streak ÿ the longest in any of the four major professional North American sports leagues.[16] The closest the Pirates had come to fielding a winning team during that period was the 1997 team, which finished second in the NL Central despite having a losing record and a payroll of $9 million. The 1997 team was eliminated from playoff contention during the season's final week. In 2012, they finished in 4th place with a 79ÿ83 record and were not eliminated until late September. The 2013 team became the first Pirates team since 1992 to secure a winning season.\\r\\nIn 2001, the Pirates opened a new stadium, PNC Park, featuring a simple concept and strategic usage of the Pittsburgh skyline.[17]\\r\\nGeneral manager Dave Littlefield was installed July 13, 2001, midway through the 2001 season, and began overhauling the team to comply with owner Kevin McClatchy's dictum to drastically reduce the payroll. Enigmatic but talented third baseman Aramis Ramrez was traded to the Chicago Cubs in 2003 for a fairly minimal return under pressure to dump his $6 million salary for 2004, and he proceeded to become a star for the Cubs. Brian Giles was one of the National League's best hitters for several years, but he and his $9 million salary were also traded in 2003 to the San Diego Padres for youngsters ܇liver Prez, Jason Bay, and Cory Stewart. Pirate fans found this trade much more palatable in the short run, as Prez led the majors in strikeouts per inning and Bay won the Rookie of the Year Award in 2004, while Giles put up a subpar season by his standards. After the 2004 season, Jason Kendall went to the Oakland Athletics in a cross-exchange of high-salary players.\\r\\nIllustrating the Pirates' rebuilding efforts, at the close of the 2005 season, the team fielded the youngest roster in baseball, with an average age of 26.6 years. During the course of the season, 14 players were called up from its Triple-A affiliate. On September 6, manager Lloyd McClendon was fired after 5 losing seasons. On October 11, Jim Tracy was hired as the new manager. The 2006 season got off to a slow start with the Pirates losing their first six games. The Bucs stood at an abysmal 30ÿ60 mark by the time they hosted the All Star Game at PNC Park. During the second half of the season, however, the Pirates made a successful turnaround and finished the second half with a 37ÿ35 record. This is the first time the Pirates have finished the second half of the season with a winning record since 1992. Third baseman Freddy Sanchez won the National League batting title for the 2006 season with an average of .344.\\r\\nThe 2007 season was a year of transition for the Pirates. Robert Nutting replaced McClatchy as majority owner, becoming the sixth majority owner in Pirates history. On July 6, 2007, Kevin McClatchy announced he was stepping down as the Pirates CEO at the end of the 2007 season.[18] On September 7, 2007, Nutting fired general manager Dave Littlefield.[19]\\r\\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates began to shape their organizational management team late in the 2007 season. On September 13, Frank Coonelly, chief labor counsel for Major League Baseball, was introduced as the team's new president.[20] On September 25, 2007, the Pirates announced the hiring of Neal Huntington, formerly a scout in the Cleveland Indians organization, as the team's new general manager.[21] On October 5, 2007, Jim Tracy was fired by the Pirates, leaving them with another search for a manager. Torey Lovullo had originally been named as a leading candidate for the position,[22] but his name was gradually replaced by others in the minor league ranks, one being Ottawa Lynx manager John Russell, who eventually was named the new manager November 5, 2007. He had originally been the third base coach under previous manager Lloyd McClendon from 2003 to 2005 until he was fired by the previous General Manager Dave Littlefield.[23]\\r\\nAs the Pirates once again failed to produce a winning record, the team began another round of rebuilding. Prior to the trade deadline, the Pirates made several deals that sent several accomplished veterans to other franchises. On July 26, the Pirates traded left fielder Xavier Nady and pitcher Dmaso Marte to the New York Yankees in return for Jos Tbata, Ross Ohlendorf, Dan McCutchen, and Jeff Karstens. Karstens began his career with the Pirates at 2ÿ0 and came within 4 outs of pitching the first perfect game in franchise history on August 6, 2008.[24] On July 31, Jason Bay was traded to the Boston Red Sox in a three-team deal that sent Manny Ramrez to the Los Angeles Dodgers and Andy LaRoche and Bryan Morris to the Pirates from the Dodgers and Brandon Moss and Craig Hansen to the Pirates from the Red Sox. On November 24, the Pirates signed Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel as undrafted free agents, making them the first Indian citizens to sign a contract with any American professional sports team.[25] Both men are pitchers, who were first spotted in the \\"Million Dollar Arm\\" contest organized in India by J.B. Bernstein earlier in 2008. Trading away players for prospects continued in 2009, as the team's only 2008 All-Star Nate McLouth was traded to the Atlanta Braves for prospects Jeff Locke, Charlie Morton and Gorkys Hernndez.[26] On June 30, the team dealt Nyjer Morgan and Sean Burnett to the Washington Nationals, as well as sending utility player Eric Hinske to the New York Yankees. This upset some Pirates players, including Adam LaRoche and Jack Wilson, who questioned the direction of the team.[27] LaRoche was later traded to the Red Sox in exchange for minor leaguers Hunter Strickland and Argenis Daz.[28] On July 29, Wilson was traded to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for shortstop Ronny Cede?o and Minor League players Jeff Clement, Aaron Pribanic, Brett Lorin, and Nathan Adcock. The same day, the Pirates traded Sanchez to the San Francisco Giants in exchange for Tim Alderson.[29] On September 7, the Pittsburgh Pirates were defeated by the Chicago Cubs 4ÿ2. The loss was the Pirates' 82nd of the year, and it clinched for them the longest streak of consecutive losing seasons in any North American professional sport.[16]\\r\\nOn November 14, 2010, after a disastrous 2010 season, which saw 105 losses, the Pirates hired a new manager in Clint Hurdle. Hurdle was a part of the Colorado Rockies 2007 NL Pennant and was the hitting coach for the American League Champion Texas Rangers during the 2010 season. Although the losing streak would continue for two more seasons, the Pirates began to show signs of success. By 2012 it seemed the Pirates were on pace to break the streak, but unfortunately a second late season collapse resulted in the 20th consecutive losing season. The team had added free agent pitcher Francisco Liriano but his arrival to the team was delayed by a broken non-throwing arm. The Pirates entered the 2013 MLB All Star Game with a record of 56-37 and had sent four all stars (Andrew McCutchen, Jason Grilli, Pedro lvarez, and Jeff Locke). The Pirates finished the season 94-68 and clinched a wild card berth. They eventually were eliminated by the NL champion St. Louis Cardinals. McCutchen received the NL MVP and Pedro Alvarez was tied for the NL Leader in home runs.\\r\\nThe 2011 season had a promising start, as the Pirates were above .500 at the All-Star Break for the first time since 1992. The Pirates also sent three players to the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game with the selections of starting pitcher Kevin Correia, closer Joel Hanrahan and center fielder Andrew McCutchen.[30] On July 15, and again on July 18, the Pirates moved into first place of the NL Central. This marked the first two times that the Pirates were in first place this late in the season since 1997.[31] The last day they were in first was July 25. The Bucs split four games with the Braves on July 25 to July 28. After this they lost 10 games in a row and never recovered. Starting in late July rumblings of \\"America's Team\\" began to surface, with ESPN television picking up two of their games for their nightly baseball telecast. The Pirates acquired two former all-stars through the trade market during the Trade Deadline on July 31: First baseman Derrek Lee from the Orioles and outfielder Ryan Ludwick from the Padres.[32] On July 26, a questionable call at home plate led to a 19-inning loss against the Atlanta Braves. The Pirates then won only one game from that point to August 8, including a season-high 10-game losing streak in that span. Despite a promising season, with a loss to the St. Louis Cardinals on September 14, 2011, the team lost its 82nd game of the season, ensuring a 19-year losing season streak.\\r\\nIn 2012, the Pirates aggressively pursued and acquired Yankees pitcher A. J. Burnett to bolster their starting pitching staff. During the first few months of the season, team pitching held up very well, but the offense was sluggish. However, the bats began to pick up in June as many of the players began to dramatically improve offensively. By the time July hit, the Pirates had soared to first place in the NL Central at the All Star break ÿ the first time the Bucs entered the break at first place since the \\"Freak Show\\" team of 1997. Andrew McCutchen would lead the majors in batting average and the \\"Power of Zoltan\\" (reference to a character scene in the movie Dude, Where's My Car?) began to sweep PNC Park and the city of Pittsburgh.\\r\\nThe Pirates were 63ÿ47 on August 8, but a stunning disintegration left the team scuffling down the stretch, effectively eliminating them from the NL Central race and the Wild card race. On September 28, the Pirates were no-hit by Cincinnati Reds pitcher Homer Bailey; the loss was their 81st of the season, ensuring their 20th consecutive non-winning season. They lost their 82nd game on September 30, clinching their 20th consecutive losing season, extending the longest such streak in North American sports history. They are also the only Major League Baseball team to be 16 games over .500 after ? of the season complete and finish with a losing record. The 82nd loss came 4ÿ3 to the Cincinnati Reds at PNC Park on September 30, with the Reds scoring twice in the ninth inning off of All-Star closer Joel Hanrahan.\\r\\nAfter two consecutive seasons of late season collapses, Huntington and Hurdle were determined to be aggressive in free agency, adding players and veteran leadership that would stave off another Pittsburgh Pirates collapse in 2013. In the offseason, the team agreed with veteran catcher Russell Martin on a two-year, $17 million deal. Martin, while providing decent offensive numbers, was considered to be a major defensive upgrade over the previous year's platoon of Rod Barajas and Michael McKenry. In 2012, Barajas and McKenry had combined to throw out 19 of 173 baserunners, for a caught stealing percentage of 11%, while Russell Martin held a career caught stealing percentage of 30.25% entering the 2013 season. On December 26, 2012, the Pirates traded established closer Joel Hanrahan and infielder Brock Holt to the Boston Red Sox for reliever Mark Melancon, and prospects Jerry Sands, Ivn DeJes~s Jr., and Stolmy Pimentel. With this move, the Pirates re-signed setup man Jason Grilli to a two-year deal worth $4.5 million, to become the new Pirates closer. Melancon, who was under-valued after a miserable, injury-riddled 2012 season, replaced Grilli as the Pirates setup man. The trade wound up leaning strongly in favor of the Pirates, as Grilli and Melancon would anchor the so-called \\"Shark Tank\\" bullpen as one of the best bullpens in MLB as well as both being selected to the All-Star Game, while Hanrahan wound up only playing in nine games for the Red Sox before suffering an injury to his pitching arm and requiring Tommy John surgery just as his contract was getting ready to expire at the end of the season. Ultimately, Hanrahan would never pitch in the Majors again.[33]\\r\\nOn February 8, 2013, the Pirates finalized a two-year, $12.75 million deal with starting pitcher Francisco Liriano.[34] The deal had been delayed two months because Liriano had broken his non-throwing arm in December 2012, and had refused to take a physical.\\r\\nThough the Pirates made no trades before the July 31 deadline, they would make some moves to shore up their lineup for a potential playoff run, acquiring Marlon Byrd and John Buck from the New York Mets on August 27, 2013[35] and trading with the Minnesota Twins for Justin Morneau on August 31, 2013.[36]\\r\\nOn September 3, 2013, the Pirates defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 4-3 in Milwaukee to win their 81st game of the season, clinching their first non-losing season since 1992.[37] Then, following a four-game losing streak, the Pirates defeated the Texas Rangers 1-0 on September 9 for their 82nd win, clinching their first winning season in 21 years.[38] 14 days later, due to a combination of a Pirates win and a Nationals' loss to the St. Louis Cardinals, the Pirates headed to postseason play for the first time in twenty-one seasons. By finishing the season with a three-game sweep of the Cincinnati Reds, their chief competition for the NL Wild Card, the Pirates hosted and won their first home playoff game since 1992 in the National League Wild Card Game on October 1, 2013 with a score of 6-2.[39]\\r\\nThat victory put the Pirates into the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. On October 3, 2013, the Cardinals rode a 7-run inning to a 9-1 win over the Pirates.[40] The Pirates evened the series with a 7-1 victory on in Game 2 on October 4,[41] tying the series heading into Game 3. The Pirates then took a 2-1 Series lead by defeating the Cardinals in dramatic fashion at PNC Park 5-3 before dropping the remaining two games to the Cardinals by scores of 2-1 and 6-1, thereby being eliminated from further post-season play.\\r\\nIn 2014, the Pirates made the National League Wild Card game but lost at home to the eventual World Series champions, the San Francisco Giants by a score of 8-0.[42] Brandon Crawford hit a grand slam while the Pirates could not recover and were once again denied a playoff series win.\\r\\nIn 2015, the Pirates finished with the second best record in baseball at 98-64, however, despite many injuries to key players, the division rival St. Louis Cardinals had the best record in baseball at 100-62, winning the NL Central division. The 98-win season was good enough to ensure another home Wild Card game, this time hosting the 97-win Chicago Cubs. The eventual 2015 NL Cy Young winner, Jake Arrieta, pitched dominantly for the Cubs, hurling a complete game shutout, handing the Pirates a 4-0 loss.[43]","input":"What was the original name of the pittsburgh pirates?"},{"output":"Giorgio Vasari","context":"","input":"Who developed the first example of gothic architecture?"},{"output":"two net molecules","context":"Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products.[1] The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy in the process, as weak so-called \\"high-energy\\" bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products. Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. Cellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction which releases heat. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, most of which are redox reactions themselves. Although technically, cellular respiration is a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell because of the slow release of energy from the series of reactions.\\r\\nNutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar, amino acids and fatty acids, and the most common oxidizing agent (electron acceptor) is molecular oxygen (O2). The chemical energy stored in ATP (its third phosphate group is weakly bonded to the rest of the molecule and is cheaply broken allowing stronger bonds to form, thereby transferring energy for use by the cell) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy, including biosynthesis, locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAerobic respiration requires oxygen (O2) in order to create ATP. Although carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are consumed as reactants, it is the preferred method of pyruvate breakdown in glycolysis and requires that pyruvate enter the mitochondria in order to be fully oxidized by the Krebs cycle. The products of this process are carbon dioxide and water, but the energy transferred is used to break bonds in ADP as the third phosphate group is added to form ATP (adenosine triphosphate), by substrate-level phosphorylation, NADH and FADH2\\r\\nThe negative G indicates that the reaction can occur spontaneously.\\r\\nThe potential of NADH and FADH2 is converted to more ATP through an electron transport chain with oxygen as the \\"terminal electron acceptor\\". Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation. This works by the energy released in the consumption of pyruvate being used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane. This potential is then used to drive ATP synthase and produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate group. Biology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration (2 from glycolysis, 2 from the Krebs cycle, and about 34 from the electron transport system).[2] However, this maximum yield is never quite reached because of losses due to leaky membranes as well as the cost of moving pyruvate and ADP into the mitochondrial matrix, and current estimates range around 29 to 30 ATP per glucose.[2]\\r\\nAerobic metabolism is up to 15 times more efficient than anaerobic metabolism (which yields 2?molecules ATP per 1?molecule glucose). However some anaerobic organisms, such as methanogens are able to continue with anaerobic respiration, yielding more ATP by using other inorganic molecules (not oxygen) as final electron acceptors in the electron transport chain. They share the initial pathway of glycolysis but aerobic metabolism continues with the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. The post-glycolytic reactions take place in the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells, and in the cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells.\\r\\nGlycolysis is a metabolic pathway that takes place in the cytosol of cells in all living organisms. This pathway can function with or without the presence of oxygen. In humans, aerobic conditions produce pyruvate and anaerobic conditions produce lactate. In aerobic conditions, the process converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate (pyruvic acid), generating energy in the form of two net molecules of ATP. Four molecules of ATP per glucose are actually produced, however, two are consumed as part of the preparatory phase. The initial phosphorylation of glucose is required to increase the reactivity (decrease its stability) in order for the molecule to be cleaved into two pyruvate molecules by the enzyme aldolase. During the pay-off phase of glycolysis, four phosphate groups are transferred to ADP by substrate-level phosphorylation to make four ATP, and two NADH are produced when the pyruvate are oxidized. The overall reaction can be expressed this way:\\r\\nStarting with glucose, 1 ATP is used to donate a phosphate to glucose to produce glucose 6-phosphate. Glycogen can be converted into glucose 6-phosphate as well with the help of glycogen phosphorylase. During energy metabolism, glucose 6-phosphate becomes fructose 6-phosphate. An additional ATP is used to phosphorylate fructose 6-phosphate into fructose 1,6-disphosphate by the help of phosphofructokinase. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate then splits into two phosphorylated molecules with three carbon chains which later degrades into pyruvate.\\r\\nGlycolysis can be literally translated as \\"sugar splitting\\". [3]\\r\\nPyruvate is oxidized to acetyl-CoA and CO2 by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). The PDC contains multiple copies of three enzymes and is located in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and in the cytosol of prokaryotes. In the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, one molecule of NADH and one molecule of CO2 is formed.\\r\\nThis is also called the Krebs cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle. When oxygen is present, acetyl-CoA is produced from the pyruvate molecules created from glycolysis. Once acetyl-CoA is formed, aerobic or anaerobic respiration can occur. [4] When oxygen is present, the mitochondria will undergo aerobic respiration which leads to the Krebs cycle. However, if oxygen is not present, fermentation of the pyruvate molecule will occur. In the presence of oxygen, when acetyl-CoA is produced, the molecule then enters the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) inside the mitochondrial matrix, and is oxidized to CO2 while at the same time reducing NAD to NADH. NADH can be used by the electron transport chain to create further ATP as part of oxidative phosphorylation. To fully oxidize the equivalent of one glucose molecule, two acetyl-CoA must be metabolized by the Krebs cycle. Two waste products, H2O and CO2, are created during this cycle.\\r\\nThe citric acid cycle is an 8-step process involving 18 different enzymes and co-enzymes. [4] During the cycle, acetyl-CoA (2 carbons) + oxaloacetate (4 carbons) yields citrate (6 carbons), which is rearranged to a more reactive form called isocitrate (6 carbons). Isocitrate is modified to become ϫ-ketoglutarate (5 carbons), succinyl-CoA, succinate, fumarate, malate, and, finally, oxaloacetate.\\r\\nThe net gain of high-energy compounds from one cycle is 3 NADH, 1 FADH2, and 1 GTP; the GTP may subsequently be used to produce ATP. Thus, the total yield from 1 glucose molecule (2 pyruvate molecules) is 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, and 2 ATP.\\r\\nIn eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the mitochondrial cristae. It comprises the electron transport chain that establishes a proton gradient (chemiosmotic potential) across the boundary of inner membrane by oxidizing the NADH produced from the Krebs cycle. ATP is synthesized by the ATP synthase enzyme when the chemiosmotic gradient is used to drive the phosphorylation of ADP. The electrons are finally transferred to exogenous oxygen and, with the addition of two protons, water is formed.\\r\\nThe table below describes the reactions involved when one glucose molecule is fully oxidized into carbon dioxide. It is assumed that all the reduced coenzymes are oxidized by the electron transport chain and used for oxidative phosphorylation.\\r\\nAlthough there is a theoretical yield of 38 ATP molecules per glucose during cellular respiration, such conditions are generally not realized because of losses such as the cost of moving pyruvate (from glycolysis), phosphate, and ADP (substrates for ATP synthesis) into the mitochondria. All are actively transported using carriers that utilize the stored energy in the proton electrochemical gradient.\\r\\nThe outcome of these transport processes using the proton electrochemical gradient is that more than 3 H+ are needed to make 1 ATP. Obviously this reduces the theoretical efficiency of the whole process and the likely maximum is closer to 28ÿ30 ATP molecules.[2] In practice the efficiency may be even lower because the inner membrane of the mitochondria is slightly leaky to protons.[5] Other factors may also dissipate the proton gradient creating an apparently leaky mitochondria. An uncoupling protein known as thermogenin is expressed in some cell types and is a channel that can transport protons. When this protein is active in the inner membrane it short circuits the coupling between the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis. The potential energy from the proton gradient is not used to make ATP but generates heat. This is particularly important in brown fat thermogenesis of newborn and hibernating mammals.\\r\\nAccording to some of newer sources the ATP yield during aerobic respiration is not 36ÿ38, but only about 30ÿ32 ATP molecules / 1 molecule of glucose [6], because:\\r\\nSo finally we have, per molecule of glucose\\r\\nAltogether this gives 4 + 3 (or 5) + 20 + 3 = 30 (or 32) ATP per molecule of glucose\\r\\nThe total ATP yield in ethanol or lactic acid fermentation is only 2 molecules coming from glycolysis, because pyruvate is not transferred to the mitochondrion and finally oxidized to the carbon dioxide (CO2), but reduced to ethanol or lactic acid in the cytoplasm.[6]\\r\\nWithout oxygen, pyruvate (pyruvic acid) is not metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation. The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion, but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is converted to waste products that may be removed from the cell. This serves the purpose of oxidizing the electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and removing the excess pyruvate. Fermentation oxidizes NADH to NAD+ so it can be re-used in glycolysis. In the absence of oxygen, fermentation prevents the buildup of NADH in the cytoplasm and provides NAD+ for glycolysis. This waste product varies depending on the organism. In skeletal muscles, the waste product is lactic acid. This type of fermentation is called lactic acid fermentation. In strenuous exercise, when energy demands exceed energy supply, the respiratory chain cannot process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD+ regenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate. Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. Lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen. During recovery, when oxygen becomes available, NAD+ attaches to hydrogen from lactate to form ATP. In yeast, the waste products are ethanol and carbon dioxide. This type of fermentation is known as alcoholic or ethanol fermentation. The ATP generated in this process is made by substrate-level phosphorylation, which does not require oxygen.\\r\\nFermentation is less efficient at using the energy from glucose: only 2 ATP are produced per glucose, compared to the 38 ATP per glucose nominally produced by aerobic respiration. This is because the waste products of fermentation still contain chemical potential energy that can be released by oxidation. Ethanol, for example, can be burned in an internal combustion engine like gasoline. Glycolytic ATP, however, is created more quickly. For prokaryotes to continue a rapid growth rate when they are shifted from an aerobic environment to an anaerobic environment, they must increase the rate of the glycolytic reactions. For multicellular organisms, during short bursts of strenuous activity, muscle cells use fermentation to supplement the ATP production from the slower aerobic respiration, so fermentation may be used by a cell even before the oxygen levels are depleted, as is the case in sports that do not require athletes to pace themselves, such as sprinting.\\r\\nCellular respiration is the process by which biological fuels are oxidised in the presence of an inorganic electron acceptor (such as oxygen) to produce large amounts of energy, to drive the bulk production of ATP.\\r\\nAnaerobic respiration is used by some microorganisms in which neither oxygen (aerobic respiration) nor pyruvate derivatives (fermentation) is the final electron acceptor. Rather, an inorganic acceptor such as sulfate or nitrate is used. Such organisms are typically found in unusual places such as underwater caves or near hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean.","input":"How many atp are produced from one molecule of glucose during aerobic cellular respiration?"},{"output":"Mariana Trench","context":"Coordinates: 1121N 14212E? / ?11.350N 142.200E? / 11.350; 142.200\\r\\nThe Mariana Trench or Marianas Trench[1] is the deepest part of the world's oceans. It is located in the western Pacific Ocean, an average of 200 kilometres (124?mi) to the east of the Mariana Islands, in the Western Pacific East of Philippines. It is a crescent-shaped scar in the Earth's crust, and measures about 2,550?km (1,580?mi) long and 69?km (43?mi) wide on average. It reaches a maximum-known depth of 10,994 metres (36,070?ft) (I 40 metres [130?ft]) at a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep, at its southern end,[2] although some unrepeated measurements place the deepest portion at 11,034 metres (36,201?ft).[3] For comparison - if Mount Everest were dropped into the trench at this point, its peak would still be over 1.6 kilometres (1?mi) underwater. In 2009, Marianas Trench was established as a United States National Monument[4].\\r\\nAt the bottom of the trench the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bars (15,750?psi), more than 1,000 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%, so that 95 litres of water under the pressure of the Challenger Deep would contain the same mass as 100 litres at the surface. The temperature at the top is 1 to 4?C (34 to 39?F).[5]\\r\\nThe trench is not the part of the seafloor closest to the center of the Earth. This is because the Earth is not a perfect sphere; its radius is about 25 kilometres (16?mi) less at the poles than at the equator.[6] As a result, parts of the Arctic Ocean seabed are at least 13 kilometres (8.1?mi) closer to the Earth's center than the Challenger Deep seafloor.\\r\\nXenophyophores have been found in the trench by Scripps Institution of Oceanography researchers at a record depth of 10.6 kilometres (6.6?mi) below the sea surface.[7] On 17 March 2013, researchers reported data that suggested microbial life forms thrive within the trench.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mariana Trench is named for the nearby Mariana Islands (in turn named Las Marianas in honor of Spanish Queen Mariana of Austria, widow of Philip IV of Spain). The islands are part of the island arc that is formed on an over-riding plate, called the Mariana Plate (also named for the islands), on the western side of the trench.\\r\\nThe Mariana Trench is part of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction system that forms the boundary between two tectonic plates. In this system, the western edge of one plate, the Pacific Plate, is subducted (i.e., thrust) beneath the smaller Mariana Plate that lies to the west. Crustal material at the western edge of the Pacific Plate is some of the oldest oceanic crust on earth (up to 170 million years old), and is therefore cooler and more dense; hence its great height difference relative to the higher-riding (and younger) Mariana Plate. The deepest area at the plate boundary is the Mariana Trench proper.\\r\\nThe movement of the Pacific and Mariana plates is also indirectly responsible for the formation of the Mariana Islands. These volcanic islands are caused by flux melting of the upper mantle due to release of water that is trapped in minerals of the subducted portion of the Pacific Plate.\\r\\nThe trench was first sounded during the Challenger expedition in 1875, using a weighted rope, which recorded a depth of 4,475 fathoms (8,184 metres; 26,850 feet).[10] In 1877, a map was published called Tiefenkarte des Grossen Ozeans (\\"Deep map of the Great Ocean\\") by Petermann, which showed a Challenger Tief (\\"Challenger deep\\") at the location of that sounding. In 1899, USS Nero, a converted collier, recorded a depth of 5,269 fathoms (9,636 metres; 31,614 feet).[11]\\r\\nIn 1951, Challenger II surveyed the trench using echo sounding, a much more precise and vastly easier way to measure depth than the sounding equipment and drag lines used in the original expedition. During this survey, the deepest part of the trench was recorded when the Challenger II measured a depth of 5,960 fathoms (10,900 metres; 35,760 feet) at 1119N 14215E? / ?11.317N 142.250E? / 11.317; 142.250, known as the Challenger Deep.[12]\\r\\nIn 1957, the Soviet vessel Vityaz reported a depth of 11,034 metres (36,201?ft) at a location dubbed the Mariana Hollow.[3]\\r\\nIn 1962, the surface ship M.V. Spencer F. Baird recorded a maximum depth of 10,915 metres (35,810?ft) using precision depth gauges.\\r\\nIn 1984, the Japanese survey vessel Takuy (r) collected data from the Mariana Trench using a narrow, multi-beam echo sounder; it reported a maximum depth of 10,924 metres (35,840?ft), also reported as 10,920 metres (35,830?ft) I10?m (33?ft).[13] Remotely Operated Vehicle KAIKO reached the deepest area of the Mariana trench and made the deepest diving record of 10,911 metres (35,797?ft) on March 24, 1995.[14]\\r\\nDuring surveys carried out between 1997 and 2001, a spot was found along the Mariana Trench that had depth similar to that of the Challenger Deep, possibly even deeper. It was discovered while scientists from the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology were completing a survey around Guam; they used a sonar mapping system towed behind the research ship to conduct the survey. This new spot was named the HMRG (Hawaii Mapping Research Group) Deep, after the group of scientists who discovered it.[15]\\r\\nOn 1 June 2009, sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the Simrad EM120 sonar multibeam bathymetry system for deep water, mapping aboard the RV Kilo Moana (mothership of the Nereus vehicle), indicated a spot with a depth of 10,971 metres (35,994?ft). The sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection, with an accuracy of better than 0.2% of water depth across the entire swath (implying that the depth figure is accurate to I 22 metres (72?ft)).[16][17]\\r\\nIn 2011, it was announced at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting that a US Navy hydrographic ship equipped with a multibeam echosounder conducted a survey which mapped the entire trench to 100 metres (330?ft) resolution.[2] The mapping revealed the existence of four rocky outcrops thought to be former seamounts.[18]\\r\\nThe Mariana Trench is a site chosen by researchers at Washington University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 2012 for a seismic survey to investigate the subsurface water cycle. Using both ocean-bottom seismometers and hydrophones the scientists are able to map structures as deep as 97 kilometres (60?mi) beneath the surface.[19]\\r\\nFour descents have been achieved. The first was the manned descent by Swiss-designed, Italian-built, United States Navy-owned bathyscaphe Trieste which reached the bottom at 1:06?pm on 23 January 1960, with Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard on board.[12][21] Iron shot was used for ballast, with gasoline for buoyancy.[12] The onboard systems indicated a depth of 11,521 m (37,799?ft), but this was later revised to 10,916 m (35,814?ft).[22] The depth was estimated from a conversion of pressure measured and calculations based on the water density from sea surface to seabed.[21]\\r\\nThis was followed by the unmanned ROVs Kaik in 1996 and Nereus in 2009. The first three expeditions directly measured very similar depths of 10,902 to 10,916?m (35,768 to 35,814?ft). The fourth was made by Canadian film director James Cameron in 2012. On 26 March, he reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the submersible vessel Deepsea Challenger.[23][24][25]\\r\\nIn July 2015, members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oregon State University, and the Coast Guard submerged a hydrophone into the deepest part of the Mariana Trench, the Challenger Deep, never having deployed one past a mile. The titanium-shelled hydrophone was designed to withstand the immense pressure 7 miles under.[26] Although researchers were unable to retrieve the hydrophone until November, the data capacity was full within the first 23 days. After months of analyzing the sounds, the experts were surprised to pick up natural and man-made sounds such as boats, earthquakes, a typhoon, and baleen whales.[27] Due to the mission's success, the researchers announced plans to deploy a second hydrophone in 2017 for an extended period of time.\\r\\nAs of February 2012, at least two other teams are planning piloted submarines to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Triton Submarines, a Florida-based company that designs and manufactures private submarines, plans for a crew of three to take 120 minutes to reach the seabed.[28] DOER Marine, a marine technology company based near San Francisco and set up in 1992, plans for a crew of two or three to take 90 minutes to reach the seabed.[29]\\r\\nThe expedition conducted in 1960 claimed to have observed, with great surprise because of the high pressure, large creatures living at the bottom, such as a flatfish about 30?cm (12?in) long,[22] and shrimp.[30] According to Piccard, \\"The bottom appeared light and clear, a waste of firm diatomaceous ooze\\".[22] Many marine biologists are now skeptical of the supposed sighting of the flatfish, and it is suggested that the creature may instead have been a sea cucumber.[31][32] During the second expedition, the unmanned vehicle Kaik collected mud samples from the seabed.[33] Tiny organisms were found to be living in those samples.\\r\\nIn July 2011, a research expedition deployed untethered landers, called dropcams, equipped with digital video and lights to explore this region of the deep sea. Amongst many other living organisms, some gigantic single-celled amoebas with a size of more than 10?cm (4?in), belonging to the class of xenophyophores were observed.[34] Xenophyophores are noteworthy for their size, their extreme abundance on the seafloor and their role as hosts for a variety of organisms.\\r\\nIn December 2014, a new species of snailfish was discovered at a depth of 8,145?m (26,722?ft), breaking the previous record for the deepest living fish seen on video.[35]\\r\\nDuring the 2014 expedition, several new species were filmed including huge crustaceans known as supergiants. Deep-sea gigantism is the process where species grow larger than their shallow water relatives.[35]\\r\\nIn May 2017 an unidentified type of snailfish was filmed at a depth of 8,178 metres (26,800?ft).[36]\\r\\nIn 2016, a research expedition looked at the chemical makeup of crustacean scavengers collected from a range of 7,841ÿ10,250 metres within the trench. Within these organisms, the researchers found extremely elevated concentrations of PCBs, a chemical toxin banned for its environmental harm in the 1970s, concentrated at all depths within the sediment of the trench.[37]\\r\\nLike other oceanic trenches, the Mariana Trench has been proposed as a site for nuclear waste disposal,[38][39] in the hope that tectonic plate subduction occurring at the site might eventually push the nuclear waste deep into the Earth's mantle, the second layer of the Earth. However, ocean dumping of nuclear waste is prohibited by international law.[38][39][40] Furthermore, plate subduction zones are associated with very large megathrust earthquakes, the effects of which are unpredictable for the safety of long-term disposal of nuclear wastes within the hadopelagic ecosystem.[39]","input":"Which part of the ocean is the deepest?"},{"output":"North Korea","context":"Coordinates: 36N 128E? / ?36N 128E? / 36; 128\\r\\nSouth Korea is located in East Asia, on the southern half of the Korean Peninsula jutting out from the far east of the Asian land mass. The only country with a land border to South Korea is North Korea, lying to the north with 238 kilometres (148?mi) of border running along the Korean Demilitarized Zone. South Korea is mostly surrounded by water and has 2,413 kilometres (1,499?mi) of coast line along three seas; to the west is the Yellow Sea (known in Korea as West Sea), to the south is the East China Sea, and to the east is the Sea of Japan (known in Korea as East Sea). Geographically, South Korea's land mass is approximately 100,032 square kilometres (38,623?sq?mi).[1] 290 square kilometres (110?sq?mi) of South Korea are occupied by water. The approximate coordinates are 37 North, 127 30 East. Notable islands include Jeju Island (Jejudo), Ulleung Island (Ulleungdo), and Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo, known in Japan as Takeshima).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Korean Peninsula extends southward from the northeast part of the Asian continental landmass. The Japanese islands of Honsh and Kysh are located some 200?km (124?mi) to the southeast across the Korea Strait; the Shandong Peninsula of China lies 190 kilometers to the west. The west coast of the peninsula is bordered by the Korea Bay to the north and the Yellow Sea and Korea Strait to the south; the east coast is bordered by the Sea of Japan. The 8,640-kilometer coastline is highly indented. Some 3,579 islands lie adjacent to the peninsula. Most of them are found along the south and west coasts.\\r\\nThe line between the two Korean states was the thirty-eighth parallel of latitude. After the Korean War, the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) formed the boundary between the two. The DMZ is a heavily guarded, 4,000-meter-wide strip of land that runs along the Demarcation line established by the Korean Armistice Agreement, from the east to the west coasts for a distance of 241 kilometers (238 kilometers of that line form the land boundary with North Korea).\\r\\nThe total land area of the peninsula, including the islands, is 223,170 square kilometers. Some 44.8 percent (100 210 square kilometers) of this total, excluding the area within the DMZ, constitutes the territory of the Republic of Korea. The combined territories of North Korea and South Korea are about the same size as the U.S. state of Minnesota. South Korea alone is about the size of Portugal or Hungary.\\r\\nThe largest island, Jeju-do, lies off the southwest corner of the peninsula and has a land area of 1,825 square kilometers. Other important islands include Ulleung and Liancourt Rocks in the Sea of Japan and Ganghwa Island at the mouth of the Han River. Although the eastern coastline of South Korea is generally unindented, the southern and western coasts are jagged and irregular. The difference is caused by the fact that the eastern coast is gradually rising, while the southern and western coasts are subsiding.\\r\\nEarly European visitors to Korea remarked that the land resembled \\"a sea in a heavy gale\\" because of the large number of successive mountain ranges that crisscross the peninsula. The highest mountains are in North Korea. The highest mountain peak in South Korea is Hallasan (1,950 m), which is the cone of a volcanic formation constituting Jeju Island. There are three major mountain ranges within South Korea: the Taebaek Mountains, and Sobaek ranges, and the Jiri Massif.\\r\\nUnlike Japan or the northern provinces of China, the Korean Peninsula is geologically stable. There are no active volcanoes (aside from Baekdu Mountain on the border between North Korea and China, most recently active in 1903), and there have been no strong earthquakes. Historical records, however, describe volcanic activity on Mount Halla during the Goryeo Dynasty (918ÿ1392).\\r\\nSouth Korea has no extensive plains; its lowlands are the product of mountain erosion. Approximately 30 percent of the area of South Korea consists of lowlands, with the rest consisting of uplands and mountains. The great majority of the lowland area lies along the coasts, particularly the west coast, and along the major rivers. The most important lowlands are the Han River plain around Seoul, the Pyeongtaek coastal plain southwest of Seoul, the Geum River basin, the Nakdong River basin, and the Yeongsan River and the Honam plains in the southwest. A narrow littoral plain extends along the east coast.\\r\\nThe Nakdong is South Korea's longest river (521 kilometers). The Han River, which flows through Seoul, is 514 kilometers long, and the Geum River is 401 kilometers long. Other major rivers include the Imjin, which flows through both North Korea and South Korea and forms an estuary with the Han River; the Bukhan, a tributary of the Han that also flows out of North Korea; and the Somjin. The major rivers flow north to south or east to west and empty into the Yellow Sea or the Korea Strait. They tend to be broad and shallow and to have wide seasonal variations in water flow.\\r\\nIn the early part of 20th century and especially the period during and after World War II and the Korean War, much of the existing Korean forests were cut down, which led to problems with flooding and soil erosion. Combination of reforestation efforts (e.g. Arbor day was celebrated as a national holiday starting in 1949) and policies designed to reduce use of firewood as a source of energy (e.g. restriction of inflow of firewood into Seoul and other major cities starting in 1958) helped to spark a recovery in the 1950s.[2] Comprehensive reforestation programs starting in the 1970s and continuing into the late 1990s aided in an acceleration of forest volume increase,[3] and the forest cover reached a peak of 65% of national land area in 1980 as opposed to a low of 35% in 1955.[2]\\r\\nNews that North Korea was constructing a huge multipurpose dam at the base of Geumgangsan (1,638 m) north of the DMZ caused considerable consternation in South Korea during the mid-1980s. South Korean authorities feared that once completed, a sudden release of the dam's waters into the Pukhan River during north-south hostilities could flood Seoul and paralyze the capital region. During 1987 the Geumgangsan Dam was a major issue that Seoul sought to raise in talks with Pyongyang. Though Seoul completed a \\"Peace Dam\\" on the Pukhan River to counteract the potential threat of Pyongyang's dam project before the 1988 Olympics, the North Korean project apparently still was in its initial stages of construction in 1990.\\r\\nMaritime claims:\\r\\nterritorial sea: 12?nmi (22.2?km; 13.8?mi); between 3?nmi (5.6?km; 3.5?mi) and 12?nmi (22.2?km; 13.8?mi) in the Korea Strait\\r\\ncontiguous zone: 24?nmi (44.4?km; 27.6?mi)\\r\\nexclusive economic zone: 200?nmi (370.4?km; 230.2?mi)\\r\\ncontinental shelf: not specified\\r\\nElevation extremes:\\r\\nlowest point: Sea level 0?m\\r\\nhighest point: Hallasan 1,950?m\\r\\nPart of the East Asian Monsoon region, South Korea has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons. The movement of air masses from the Asian continent exerts greater influence on South Korea's weather than does air movement from the Pacific Ocean. Winters are usually long, cold, and dry, whereas summers are short, hot, and humid. Spring and autumn are pleasant but short in duration. Seoul's mean temperature in January is ?5 to ?2.5?C (23.0 to 27.5?F); in July the mean temperature is about 22.5 to 25?C (72.5 to 77.0?F). Because of its southern and seagirt location, Jeju Island has warmer and milder weather than other parts of South Korea. Mean temperatures on Jeju range from 2.5?C (36.5?F) in January to 25?C (77?F) in July.\\r\\nThe country generally has sufficient rainfall to sustain its agriculture. Rarely does less than 750 millimeters (29.5?in) of rain fall in any given year; for the most part, rainfall is over 1,000 millimeters (39.4?in). Amounts of precipitation, however, can vary from year to year. Serious droughts occur about once every eight years, especially in the rice-producing southwestern part of the country. About two-thirds of the annual precipitation occurs between June and September.\\r\\nSouth Korea is less vulnerable to typhoons than Japan, Taiwan, the east coast of China, or the Philippines. From one to three typhoons can be expected per year. Typhoons usually pass over South Korea in late summer, especially in August, and bring torrential rains. Flooding occasionally causes considerable damage, as do landslides, given the country's generally mountainous terrain.\\r\\nIn September 1984, record floods caused the deaths of 190 people and left 200,000 homeless. This disaster prompted the North Korean government to make an unprecedented offer of humanitarian aid in the form of rice, medicine, clothes, and building materials. South Korea accepted these items and distributed them to flood victims.[4]\\r\\nGraphically the seasons can be represented this way:\\r\\nNatural resources: South Korea produces coal, tungsten, graphite, molybdenum, lead, and has potential for hydropower.\\r\\nLand use:\\r\\narable land: 15.3%\\r\\npermanent crops: 2.2%\\r\\npermanent pasture: 0.6%\\r\\nforest: 63.9%\\r\\nother: 18.0% (2011)\\r\\nIrrigated land: 8,804?km2 (2003)\\r\\nTotal renewable water resources: 69.7?km3\\r\\nFreshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)\\r\\ntotal: 25.47?km3/yr (26%/12%/62%)\\r\\nper capita: 548.7 m3/yr (2003)\\r\\nNatural hazards: There are occasional typhoons that bring high winds and floods. There is also low-level seismic activity, which is common in the southwest.\\r\\nVolcanism: Hallasan (elev. 1,950 m) is considered historically active although it has not erupted in many centuries. Earthquake activity is minimal, however, since 2016 there have been two earthquakes over 5.4 magnitude.\\r\\nEnvironment - current issues: Habitat loss and degradation, especially of wetlands, through coastal reclamation (e.g. Saemangeum, Shiwa, Song Do, Namyang Bay, Asan Bay, in the south-west, Gwangyang Bay and the Nakdong Estuary) have caused huge declines in fisheries and of biodiversity.

After playing college football for Boston College, Ryan was drafted by the Falcons with the third overall pick in the first round of the 2008 NFL Draft.\\r\\nRyan was Boston College's starting quarterback from 2005 to 2007, leading them to three bowl victories and a 25ÿ7 record in 32 starts. He threw for 200 or more yards 15 times and is third all time in school history in passing yards and in pass completions. He earned MVP of the game honors at the 2005 MPC Computers Bowl.[1]\\r\\nIn 2007, Ryan led his team to an ACC Atlantic Division championship and was named ACC Player of the Year.[2] During his rookie year, Ryan started all 16 games for the Falcons and led them to the playoffs with an 11ÿ5 season record. He earned honors as the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. In 2016, Ryan was the NFL's Most Valuable Player and led the Falcons to Super Bowl LI, where they were defeated by the New England Patriots.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRyan attended the William Penn Charter School,[3] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he was a three-year starter and earned All-East honors from Larunt Lemming Prep Football Report. He captured All-Southeastern Pennsylvania accolades as a senior quarterback in addition to receiving All-City first-team honors in 2002 and second-team recognition in 2001. A three-time All-League selection, he threw for more than 1,300 yards with 9 touchdowns as a senior, finishing his career by completing more than 52 percent of his pass attempts during all three seasons at the helm. Ryan played football, basketball and baseball while in high school and was named captain of all three teams his senior year. He was quarterback of the football team in 2002, played small forward on the basketball team, and was a pitcher and a shortstop on the baseball team.[4]\\r\\nRyan says he was \\"mildly\\" recruited and began receiving scholarship offers as a sophomore. Some of the schools that offered him an athletic scholarship were Purdue, Georgia Tech, Temple, and Connecticut. After attending his recruiting visit with Boston College during his junior year, it was announced he gave them his verbal commitment on August 14, 2002. His choices had come down to Iowa or Boston College. Ryan was looking for a university close to home and had a strong and competitive football program with a major emphasis on academics.[5]\\r\\nRyan began attending Boston College in 2003 and redshirted his first year with the team. Before the 2004 season, he was named the starting quarterback for Boston College due to an injury to Quinton Porter. He made his collegiate debut on October 2, 2004 against the UMass Minutemen and completed two of three passes for 16 yards.[6] He would not complete his first touchdown until November 20, 2004 against Temple, after throwing a 32-yard touchdown pass to Larry Lester. Replacing the injured Paul Peterson, he completed 9-of-15 passes for 121 yards.[7] He made his first collegiate start on November 27, 2004 in the final game of that season, completing 24 of 51 passes for 200 yards against Syracuse.[8] He also played against North Carolina in the Continental Tire Bowl. He completed one of his two passes for 13 yards.[9] Ryan was also quite proficient in the classroom, and was awarded the 2004 Freshman Male Scholar-Athlete award that same year.[10] Ryan launched a website during his senior year at Boston College called Mattyice.com, where fans and media have 24-hour access to video highlights, updated biographical information, statistics and other information about him.[11] In 2016, Boston College retired his jersey.[12]\\r\\nAt the beginning of the 2005 season, Ryan was named the second-string quarterback behind Quinton Porter. Porter had some success at the beginning of the year, including winning Atlantic Coast Conference player of the week for his performance in Boston College's 28ÿ17 win over Virginia. After a 30ÿ10 loss to third-ranked Virginia Tech, coach Tom O'Brien finally went to Ryan for good in the fourth quarter of the next game against North Carolina. In ten games (five starts), he completed 121 of 195 passes for 1,514 yards. He had eight touchdowns and five interceptions. He also rushed for five touchdowns and 94 yards.[13] He started his first bowl game in the MPC Computers Bowl versus Boise State. He completed 19 of 36 passes for 256 yards and a career-best three touchdowns.[4]\\r\\nRyan started 11 of the 12 games. He completed 254-of-398 passes for 2,700 yards, 17 touchdowns, and eight interceptions. In addition, he rushed for four touchdowns.[14] He was All-ACC first-team and led the ACC in total offense (242.2 yards per game) and in passing yards (245.5 yards per game). He was named ACC Offensive Back of the week three times. He set career highs in completions (32 vs. Central Michigan) and passing yards (356 vs. Brigham Young).[15][16] He led the team to a 9ÿ3 record including double overtime wins versus Clemson and Brigham Young.[17] He led the Eagles to a close 25ÿ24 victory on December 26, 2006 in the Meineke Car Care Bowl against Navy in Charlotte, North Carolina.[18] In the season opener against Central Michigan, Ryan sprained his ankle. Against Virginia Tech, Ryan broke his foot on the same leg. Despite these injuries, Ryan only missed one game (against Buffalo).[19] His 57 pass attempts in the 2006 Wake Forest game tied Shawn Halloran's performance against Syracuse Orange in 1985 and Frank Harris's performance against Army in 1968 for the BC record his 40 pass completions in the 2006 Wake Forest game broke the old school record of 37 by Frank Harris in the 1968 Army clash.\\r\\nBefore the season started, Ryan was named to the preseason All-ACC team. Against Wake Forest, he completed 32 of 52 passes for 408 yards and 5 touchdowns.[20] Boston College also hired a new coach: Jeff Jagodzinski, a longtime NFL assistant.[21] He continued his hot streak versus Georgia Tech, going 30ÿ44 with one touchdown and passing for a career-high 435 yards against the staunch Tech defense en route to a convincing 24ÿ10 road victory.[22] After this game, Ryan was suggested as a potential Heisman Trophy contender. Battling Virginia Tech through bad weather in Blacksburg, Virginia, Ryan led an amazing comeback for the Boston College Eagles, passing for two touchdowns with less than 3 minutes to play on October 25, 2007, including the game-winner with 11 seconds left to Andre Callender.[23][24][25] However, Ryan's chances to win the Heisman fell sharply after he threw three interceptions in a 27ÿ17 loss to Florida State, an unranked team that had six wins and three losses.[26] However, with a strong performance against Clemson[27] his chances were raised substantially. Despite 2 consecutive ACC losses, Ryan and the Eagles found themselves with a trip to the conference championship on the line. Down 10ÿ3 in the third quarter, he led the offense on a game-tying drive, hitting on key passes to Rich Gunnell, Andre Callender and Ryan Purvis, landing the Eagles at the Clemson 2 early in the fourth. James McCluskey finished the job from there, running it in to even the score at 10-apiece. Shortly thereafter, a Clemson turnover resulted in a Boston College field goal and a 13ÿ10 lead for the maroon and gold.[28] On November 24, against ACC rival Miami,[29] Ryan surpassed Doug Flutie for the most passing touchdowns in a single season by an Eagle QB with 28 TDs, ultimately ending the season with 31. Despite these records, he struggled with throwing interceptions throughout the year, and finished with 19 (2nd most among college quarterbacks). His five touchdown passes in the 2007 Wake Forest game are one shy of the school record of six, held by Doug Flutie in 1984 vs North Carolina. For the maroon and gold, it was their first 10-win regular season since 1940 and the first time they had achieved back-to-back 10-overall-win seasons in program history. He led the Eagles to extend the nation's longest bowl winning streak to eight with a 24ÿ21 victory over Michigan State Spartans in the Champs Sports Bowl on December 28, Ryan threw three touchdown passes, two to Rich Gunnell and one to Jon Loyte .[30][31]\\r\\nRyan was awarded the 2007 Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, given annually in the United States to the nation's most outstanding college football senior quarterback, the other finalists for the 2007 award were Hawaii's Colt Brennan, Louisville's Brian Brohm, Oregon's Dennis Dixon, and Kentucky's Andre Woodson (all of whom were drafted at the 2008 NFL Draft) He was selected to play in the 2008 Senior Bowl. He also won the 2007 Manning Award[32] awarded to the nation's top quarterback, beating out eventual Heisman winner Tim Tebow and eight other finalists for this year's award: Erik Ainge (Tennessee), Sam Bradford (Oklahoma), Colt Brennan (Hawai'i), Chase Daniel (Missouri), Dennis Dixon (Oregon), Graham Harrell (Texas Tech), Pat White (West Virginia), and Andre' Woodson (Kentucky). He was named \\"Eagle of the Year\\" alongside BC's first ever individual champion Kasey Hill.\\r\\nIn November, he was asked to speak at the Boston College Multi-Cultural Thanksgiving celebration, where he spoke of family, integrity and devotion.\\r\\nHe was featured as the cover athlete for the PS3 version of NCAA Football 09.[33]\\r\\nSource:[34]\\r\\nRyan[36] scored a 32 on the Wonderlic exam, tying Louisville's Brian Brohm for the highest score by a quarterback in the 2008 Draft class.[37][38]\\r\\nHe was drafted third overall by the Atlanta Falcons in the 2008 NFL Draft[39][40][41] He was the second first-round pick of the draft to sign when he agreed to a six-year, $72 million contract on May 20, 2008; the contract contained $34.75 million in guaranteed money.[42] The contract made Ryan the fourth highest paid quarterback in the NFL behind Peyton Manning, Ben Roethlisberger, and Carson Palmer, despite never having played a professional game.[43] This helped fuel the discussion regarding whether salaries for first-round draftees in the NFL were too high.[44] In addition, Ryan had signed endorsement deals with Nike[45] and AirTran.[46]\\r\\nOn August 24, 2008, Ryan was named the starting quarterback for the September 7 regular season opener against the Detroit Lions.[47][48] Ryan became the first rookie quarterback to start a season for the Falcons since Michael Vick in 2001. In the game, Ryan completed his first NFL pass for a 62-yard touchdown to Michael Jenkins,[49] becoming the first quarterback to throw a touchdown on his first career NFL pass since Michael Bishop of the New England Patriots in 2000. Ryan was sacked for the first time by Lions defensive player Dewayne White in his first win. The second game of the season against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers marked Ryan's first interception by rookie cornerback Aqib Talib and also by Sabby Piscitelli.[50]\\r\\nIn Week 3 against the Kansas City Chiefs, he completed the then-longest touchdown pass in his career for 70 yards to Roddy White. The 70-yard touchdown pass to White was the longest pass completion for the Falcons since December 23, 2007, when Chris Redman threw a 74-yard touchdown pass. In the same game, Ryan completed passes to 6 different players.[51] The following week, he threw for 194 yards and two touchdowns against the Green Bay Packers. His touchdown passes went to Roddy White and tight end Justin Peelle.[52] The following week against the Chicago Bears Ryan led the Falcons to a comeback win. With 6 seconds left he completed a 26-yard strike to Michael Jenkins that set Jason Elam up for the game-winning field goal as time expired. Ryan finished the game 22-of-30 for a then career-high 301 passing yards.[53] He also had a key fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Roddy White. On Atlanta's first offensive drive, Ryan completed all five of his pass attempts for 57 yards en route to a Falcons field goal and a 3ÿ0 lead. Ryan was named Diet Pepsi Rookie of the Week for his performance.[54]\\r\\nRyan created an activity named \\"Folleyball\\" for NFL Play 60 at NFL Rush.com, published in October of that year.[55]\\r\\nOn October 30, Ryan was honored as the NFC Rookie of the Month for October following an impressive string of games in which he led the Falcons to a 2ÿ1 record. Ryan became the first player in Falcons franchise history to be awarded this honor[56][57] In Week 8 against the Oakland Raiders, Ryan finished with the highest completion percentage of his career (77.3). He threw for 220 yards and posted a quarterback rating of 138.4. He also completed passes to eight different receivers and the game was his third multiple touchdown game (Green Bay, Philadelphia).[58][59] His first half passing yardage, completion percentage (81.3) and passer rating (154.2) are all career highs for a half and his two touchdowns tie a first half high, Ryans final completion percentage of 77.3 is a career-high along with his passer rating of 138.4. He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week following his performance against the Raiders.[60][61][62] He scored his first rushing career touchdown against the New Orleans Saints on December 7 with a 12-yard touchdown scramble, Ryan also achieved 3,000+ passing yards in the 2008 season being only the 2nd rookie to do so. Peyton Manning was the first.[63][64]\\r\\nRyan became the first Falcons rookie quarterback in franchise history to throw for over 3,000 yards in a season after finishing with 206 yards against Tampa Bay. Ryans passing total also makes him only the 10th quarterback in club annals to hit the 3,000-yard mark and the first since 1998 when Chris Chandler threw 3,154.[65] It was also his first overtime win as a starter. He was named the Diet Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week for games played after his performance by the second time in his career.[66][67] Ryan finished second amongst rookies in fan Pro Bowl voting (416,468 votes), behind only Titans running back Chris Johnson.[68] Ryan threw for a season-low 134 yards in Week 16 against the Minnesota Vikings, ending a streak of nine straight games with at least 200 yards passing, he finished 13-of-24 passing, throwing an 8-yard touchdown passes to Jerious Norwood in the second quarter; however, with this win Ryan led the Falcons to their first playoff berth since 2004.[69]\\r\\nHe finished the season with 3,440 passing yards, 17 touchdowns (one rushing), and 11 interceptions.[70] He and fellow rookie Joe Flacco were the first rookie quarterbacks to lead their teams to the playoffs after starting all 16 games of the season. He is one of twelve rookie quarterbacks to throw for over 3,000 yards in their rookie season. On December 31, Ryan was named the AP NFL Rookie of the Year.[71][72]\\r\\nRyan made his first playoff start against the Arizona Cardinals on January 3, 2009. He was 15 years younger than opposing quarterback Kurt Warner, the third largest age discrepancy between playoff quarterbacks. His first attempted playoff pass was an interception. Ryan completed 26 of 40 passing attempts for 199 yards and 2 touchdowns but was intercepted twice. He threw his first TD in a playoff contest to Justin Peelle.[73] Atlanta lost, 30ÿ24.[74][73] Falcons Head Coach Mike Smith and Ryan became the first rookie head coach and rookie quarterback to coach and compete in a playoff game since the Cleveland Rams accomplished the feat in 1945 (the feat was repeated the next day when Ravens Joe Flacco and John Harbaugh did so.)[73] During the game, Ryan set an NFL playoff rookie record with 26 completions in a single postseason game.[73]\\r\\nRyan was voted by his teammates as Offensive Captain alongside Todd McClure at the end of the 2008 Season. He was first on the depth chart and was the Falcons starting quarterback for the second consecutive season.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2009, Ryan started off the season fast as he threw for 229 yards and 2 touchdowns with no interceptions as he led the Falcons to a 19ÿ7 win against the Miami Dolphins in the 2009 NFL season opener.[75] In Week 2, Ryan led the Falcons past the Carolina Panthers. Ryan had a career-high in touchdown passes (3), completion percentage (78%) and touchdown passes in a half (3). He finished the game 21ÿ28 with 220 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick.[76] In Week 3, Ryan and the Falcons lost to the New England Patriots. Ryan completed 17-28 for 199 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions.[77]\\r\\nIn the Week 5 game against the San Francisco 49ers, he completed 15 of 21 passes for 258 yards in the first half, setting a new career-high for the first half of play.[78][79] Ryan finished the game having completed 22 of 32 passes for 329 yards and two touchdowns for a 110.0 passer rating. Ryan tossed a 31-yard strike to Roddy White and he connected to White again in the second quarter with a 90-yard touchdown.[80] The pass and reception for Ryan and White set new career highs. The pass and reception also mark the third longest in franchise history and the longest pass play since 2001.[79] The game was his third-career 300-yard passing outing as the second-year quarterback set a new career-high in total passing yards in a single game.[79]\\r\\nIn Weeks 6 through 9, Ryan generally struggled, throwing more interceptions (8) than touchdowns (6), was sacked 10 times, and had an average passing rating of 65.5. Still, he led the Falcons to two victories in the four games, in part thanks to Michael Turner returning to the form of 2008.[81][82][83][84]\\r\\nIn Week 12, Ryan suffered a turf toe injury during the game against Tampa Bay. Chris Redman stepped in and managed to win the game by connecting to Roddy White for a touchdown in the 4th quarter.[85] Following this victory, however, the effect of Ryan's absence was compounded by injury to starting running back Michael Turner, and the Falcons suffered losses to both Philadelphia and New Orleans in Weeks 13 and 14. In Week 15, Ryan returned, despite not yet having fully recovered from his injury, and led Atlanta to a 10ÿ7 upset win against the New York Jets.[86]\\r\\nIn Week 16, the Falcons defeated the Buffalo Bills in a 31ÿ3 win. Ryan threw for 250 yards with three touchdowns, two of them to Roddy White.[87] In the last game of the season, the Falcons defeated the Buccaneers by a score of 20ÿ10. In the win, Ryan had 223 passing yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions.[88]\\r\\nWith a record of 9ÿ7, the Falcons attained back to back winning seasons for the first time in franchise history.[89]\\r\\nRyan finished the season throwing for 2,916 yards with 22 touchdowns, 14 interceptions, and a quarterback rating of 80.9. Ryan also rushed for 49 yards and one touchdown.[90]\\r\\nIn the 2010 season, Ryan led the Falcons to an NFC best 13ÿ3 record, second in the NFL behind the 14ÿ2 New England Patriots.[91]\\r\\nRyan's 2010 season started off slow in a 15ÿ9 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was 27-of-44 for 252 yards and an interception.[92] He bounced back in the next game against the Arizona Cardinals. In the 41ÿ7 victory, he was 21-of-32 for 225 yards and three touchdowns.[93] In Week 7, he had his most efficient game of the season in the 39ÿ32 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. He was 24-of-33 for 299 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception for a season-high 118.1 passer rating.[94] The victory over the Bengals was the start of an eight-game winning streak for Ryan and the Falcons. In Week 10, against the Baltimore Ravens, he passed for 316 yards and three touchdowns in the 26ÿ21 win.[95] After falling to the New Orleans Saints in Week 16, Ryan closed out the regular season with a 31ÿ10 victory over the Carolina Panthers.[96][97]\\r\\nOn the season, Ryan set career highs in touchdowns (28), completion percentage (62.5), and yards (3,705) while tossing 9 interceptions. Ryan set the single season franchise records, as well as career highs, in attempts (571), completions (357), and wins in a season (13).[98] Ryan led the NFL in fourth quarter comebacks for a quarterback in the 2010 season, with six.\\r\\nIn the Divisional round of the 2010ÿ11 NFL playoffs, the Falcons were defeated by the eventual Super Bowl XLV champions, Green Bay Packers, with the score 48ÿ21.[99]\\r\\nRyan was invited to the 2011 Pro Bowl, for the first time of his career. He threw two touchdowns in the Pro Bowl, one to Tony Gonzalez and the other to Larry Fitzgerald.[100]\\r\\nIn the 2011 season, Ryan led the Falcons to a 10ÿ6 record, passing for 4,177 yards, 29 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions.[101]\\r\\nIn the season opener against the Chicago Bears, the Falcons started off slow with a 30ÿ12 loss. Ryan was 31-of-47 for 319 yards and an interception.[102] However, in the next game, the Falcons bounced back with a 35ÿ31 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. Ryan was 17-of-28 for 195 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions.[103] In Weeks 10 and 11, he recorded consecutive games with at least 300 passing yards in games against the New Orleans Saints and the Tennessee Titans.[104][105] In Week 14, against the Carolina Panthers, he was 22-of-38 for 320 yards and four touchdowns in the 31ÿ23 victory.[106]\\r\\nThe Falcons' regular season qualified them for the playoffs. However, they were defeated by the eventual Super Bowl XLVI champion New York Giants in the Wild Card Round by a score of 24ÿ2.[107]\\r\\nIn 2012, Ryan led the Falcons to their franchise best start of the season, starting 8ÿ0. Ryan set personal records in completions (422), completion percentage (68.6), yards (4,719), and touchdowns (32).[108]\\r\\nIn the 8ÿ0 start, Ryan posted four games with three touchdown passes and three games going over the 300-yard passing mark. The first blemish of the season for the Falcons came in Week 10 against the New Orleans Saints. Ryan was 34-of-52 for a then career-high 411 yards and three touchdowns and one interception as the Falcons fell by a score of 31ÿ27.[109] In the next game against the Arizona Cardinals, Ryan threw for 301 yards but had five interceptions. Despite the turnovers, the Falcons were able to win by a score of 23ÿ19.[110] In the penultimate game of the regular season, he was 25-of-32 for 279 yards and four touchdowns in a 31ÿ18 victory over the Detroit Lions.[111]\\r\\nThe Falcons finished the regular season 13ÿ3, with the first seed in the NFC. Ryan, who was 0ÿ3 in the postseason coming into the playoffs, won his first postseason game in the NFC Divisional Round against the Seattle Seahawks, with Ryan orchestrating the final scoring drive that led to Matt Bryant's game-winning field goal. Ryan finished with 250 passing yards, 68.6% completion percentage, 3 touchdowns, and two interceptions.[112] In the NFC Championship against the San Francisco 49ers, Ryan threw for 396 yards and three touchdowns, but also committed two turnovers in crucial portions of the game, and later sprained the AC joint to his non-throwing shoulder as the Falcons lost 28ÿ24.[113] He did not require surgical procedure to repair his shoulder and would have been able to play in the Super Bowl if the Falcons had advanced.\\r\\nOn July 25, 2013, Ryan agreed to a five-year contract extension worth $103.75 million with the Falcons.[114] On December 30, Ryan surpassed Steve Bartkowski for the all-time franchise leader in passing yards.[115]\\r\\nThe Falcons had a down year, where they limped to a 4ÿ12 record, due to multiple injuries and losing key players on both sides of the ball.[116] Some of Ryan's highlights in the down season were games against the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Against the Patriots in Week 4, he was 34-of-54 for a then career-high 421 yards with two touchdowns and one interception in the 30ÿ23 loss.[117] Against the Buccaneers in Week 7, he was 20-of-26 for 273 yards and three touchdowns for a 148.4 passer rating in the 31ÿ23 victory.[118] After the victory, the Falcons were 2ÿ4 with all the losses being by a combined 19 points. However, the rest of the season collapsed starting with five consecutive losses, which the team never recovered from.[119]\\r\\nOverall, on the season, Ryan passed for 4,515 yards with 26 touchdowns and 17 interceptions.[120]\\r\\nRyan led the Falcons to a 6ÿ10 record in 2014. He threw for 4,694 yards, 28 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions, and had a quarterback rating of 93.9; the second highest of his career.[121]\\r\\nThe season did start off promising. In a 37ÿ34 overtime victory over the New Orleans Saints, Ryan was 31-of-43 for a then career-high 448 yards and three touchdowns.[122] After a 24ÿ10 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, the Falcons defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers by a score of 56ÿ14 on Thursday Night Football.[123] In the victory, Ryan was 21-of-24 (a career-high single-game completion percentage of 87.50%) for 286 yards and three touchdowns for a career-high 155.9 passer rating.[124] The Falcons went on to lose six of their next eight games. After a much-needed 29ÿ18 win over the Arizona Cardinals, the Falcons had to play the Green Bay Packers.[125] The Falcons lost 43ÿ37 as Ryan had 375 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception.[126] After a loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers and a victory over the New Orleans Saints, the Falcons had a 6ÿ9 record. Despite the struggles of the 2014 season, the Falcons still had a chance to make the playoffs with a Week 17 victory due to the weakness of the entire NFC South division. However, the Falcons missed the playoffs a second year in a row after losing 34ÿ3 to their divisional rivals, Carolina Panthers, in Week 17.[127]\\r\\nRyan led the Falcons to a 8ÿ8 record in 2015, good for second in the NFC South, but not enough for the playoffs.[128]\\r\\nThe 2015 season was a roller-coaster one for Ryan and the Falcons. In the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday Night Football, he was 23-of-34 for 298 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions in the 26ÿ24 victory.[129] In the next game against the New York Giants, he was 30-of-46 for 363 yards and a touchdown in the 24ÿ20 victory.[130] The Falcons won the next three games for a 5ÿ0 start. Their first loss came in the sixth game against the New Orleans Saints, where Ryan was 30-of-44 for 295 yards and two touchdowns.[131] After a victory over the Tennessee Titans, the Falcons dropped their next six games to send their season plummeting. In the losing streak, Ryan had a season-high 397 passing yards for two touchdowns and an interception against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 1.[132]\\r\\nRyan finished the 2015 season with 21 touchdown passes, the second lowest of his career, as well as 16 interceptions, the second highest of his career. Additionally Ryan fumbled a career-high 12 times, losing five of them, which was also a career-high.[133]\\r\\nIn Week 4 of the 2016 season, Ryan threw for a team-record 503 yards and four touchdowns while teammate Julio Jones caught 12 passes for a team-record 300 yards and a touchdown in a win over the Carolina Panthers.[134] Ryan and Jones were the first quarterback-receiver duo in NFL history to combine for at least 500 passing yards and 300 receiving yards in the same game.[135] In October 2016, he set an NFL record for most consecutive games with at least 200 passing yards with 46 straight games.[136] Ryan improved greatly from the previous season. He threw for a career-high 4,944 yards on just 373 completions and 534 attempts, second in the league, and a career-high 38 touchdowns and a career-low seven interceptions, also second in the league. Ryan's 9.3 yards per attempt and 5.0 air yards per attempt ranked No. 1 among NFL quarterbacks in 2016.[137] He threw touchdown passes to 13 different receivers, an NFL record. He threw a touchdown pass in all 16 games for the first time in his career and was the only quarterback to do so for the 2016 season. Ryan was selected to his fourth Pro Bowl and was named First-team All Pro.[138] Following the regular season, he was recognized as the NFL Most Valuable Player by the Pro Football Writers Association.[139] Ryan was named the NFL Offensive Player of the Year and the NFL Most Valuable Player for the 2016 season.[140][141] He was also ranked tenth by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[142]\\r\\nAs the number 2 seed in the NFC Playoffs, Ryan led the 11ÿ5 Falcons to a 36ÿ20 victory over the number 3 seeded Seattle Seahawks in the Divisional Round.[143] Ryan passed for over 300 yards and had three touchdowns.[144] In the NFC Championship game, Ryan led the Falcons to a 44ÿ21 victory over the Green Bay Packers. Ryan threw for 392 yards for 4 touchdowns and no interceptions. He also ran for a fifth touchdown, just the fourth player to do so in a post-season game,[145] as the Falcons earned a trip to Super Bowl LI.[146] During the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots, Ryan finished with 284 passing yards, two touchdowns, and a lost fumble in a 28ÿ34 overtime loss.[147][148]\\r\\nOn September 10, 2017, in the season opening 23ÿ17 victory over the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field, Ryan connected with tight end Austin Hooper for an 88-yard touchdown, which was the second-longest touchdown pass of Ryan's career. In the game, Ryan was 21-of-30 for 321 yards and the one touchdown.[149][150]\\r\\nIn Week 2, Ryan and the Falcons had their first home game at the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Against the Green Bay Packers on NBC Sunday Night Football, Ryan was 19-of-28 for 252 yards and a touchdown, which was to running back Tevin Coleman and the first touchdown ever thrown in the new stadium.[151]\\r\\nIn Week 10, during a 27-7 win over the Dallas Cowboys, Ryan became the fastest quarterback to throw for over 40,000 passing yards. This was done in 151 games breaking Brees' record which was done in 152 games.[152]\\r\\nIn Week 17, after clinching a spot in the playoffs after beating the Carolina Panthers 22-10, Ryan set the record for most passing yards through 10 seasons with 41,796, breaking the record held by Peyton Manning, who had 41,626.[153] Ryan led the Falcons to a victory against the Los Angeles Rams in the Wild Card 26-13,[154] A week later the Falcons were beaten by the Philadelphia Eagles 15-10 in the NFC Divisional Round.[155]\\r\\nRyan, the third of four siblings, was born to Bernice and Michael Ryan, both Roman Catholics of Irish descent.[178] One of Ryan's uncles, John Loughery, played quarterback at Boston College from 1979-82.[179] Ryan is an avid golfer and has participated in such tournaments as the American Century Celebrity Golf Classic.[180] His cousin, Mike McGlinchey, played college football at Notre Dame.[181]\\r\\nHe is part of the Falcons' online reading program, \\"Read with a Falcon\\" and grew up a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles.[182][183]\\r\\nOn November 21, 2017, Ryan announced on social media that he and his wife Sarah are expecting twins.[184]","input":"When did matt ryan play at boston college?"},{"output":"Hiram Bingham","context":"Machu Picchu (Spanish pronunciation:?[?mat?u ?pit?u]) (Quechua: Machu Picchu;[1] [?mt?u ?pikt?u]) is a 15th-century Inca citadel situated on a mountain ridge 2,430 metres (7,970?ft) above sea level.[2][3] It is located in the Cusco Region, Urubamba Province, Machupicchu District in Peru,[4] above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometres (50?mi) northwest of Cuzco and through which the Urubamba River flows.\\r\\nMost archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438ÿ1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the \\"Lost City of the Incas\\" (a title more accurately applied to Vilcabamba), it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish during the colonial period and remained unknown to the outside world until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to international attention in 1911.\\r\\nMachu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.[5] By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored[5] and restoration continues.[6]\\r\\nMachu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.[3] In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide Internet poll.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Quechua language, machu means \\"old\\" or \\"old person\\", while picchu means \\"peak; mountain or prominence with a broad base that ends in sharp peaks\\",[8] hence the name of the site means \\"old peak\\".\\r\\nMachu Picchu was built around 1450ÿ1460.[10] Its construction appears to date to the period of the two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438ÿ71) and T~pac Inca Yupanqui (1472ÿ93).[11] There is a consensus among archaeologists that Pachacutec ordered the construction of the royal estate for himself, most likely after his successful military campaign. Though Machu Picchu is considered to be a \\"royal\\" estate, surprisingly, the estate would not have been passed down in the line of succession. It was only used for approximately 80 years before being abandoned seemingly due to destruction of the Spanish Conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire.[10] It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travellers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area.[12]\\r\\nDuring its use as a royal estate, it is estimated that no more than 750 people lived there at a time, most people being support staff (yanaconas, yana)[10][13] who lived there permanently. Though the estate belonged to Pachacutec, religious specialists and temporary specialized workers (mayocs) lived there as well, most likely for the ruler's well-being and enjoyment. During the harsher season, staff dropped down to around a hundred servants and a few religious specialists focused only on maintenance.[10]\\r\\nStudies show that according to their skeletal remains, most people who lived there were immigrants from diverse backgrounds. They lacked the chemical markers and osteological markers they would have if they had been living there their whole lives. Instead, there was bone damage from various species of water parasites indigenous to different areas of Peru. There were also varying osteological stressors and varying chemical densities suggesting varying long term diets characteristic of specific regions that were spaced apart.[14] These diets are composed of varying levels of maize, potatoes, grains, legumes, and fish, but the overall most recent short-term diet for these people composed of less fish and more corn. This suggests that several of the immigrants were from more coastal areas and moved to Machu Picchu where corn was a larger portion of food intake.[13] The skeletal remains found at Machu Picchu are also unique in their level of natural bone damage from laborious activities. Most people found at the site had lower levels of arthritis and bone fractures found in most sites of the Inca Empire. Inca individuals that have arthritis and bone fractures are typically those who performed heavy physical labor (such as the Mit'a) and/or served in the Inca military.[10]\\r\\nNot only people were suspected to have immigrated to Machu Picchu, there were several animal bones found that were not native to the site. Most animal bones found were from llamas and alpacas. These animals naturally live in altitudes of 14000?ft above sea level rather than the mere 8000?ft Machu Picchu rests on. Most likely, these animals were brought in from the Puna region[15] for meat consumption and for their pelts. Guinea pigs were also found at the site in special burial caves, suggesting that they were at least used for funerary rituals[10] as it was common throughout the Inca Empire to use them for sacrifices and meat.[16] Six dogs were also recovered from the site. Due to their placements among the human remains, it is believed that they served as companions of the dead.[10]\\r\\nStudies have shown that much of the farming done at Machu Picchu was done on the hundreds of man-made terraces there. These terraces were a work of considerable engineering, built to ensure good drainage and soil fertility while also protecting the mountain itself from erosion and landslides. However, the terraces were not perfect, as studies of the land show that there were landslides that happened during the construction of Machu Picchu. It can still be seen where the terraces were shifted by landslides and then stabilized by the Inca as they continued to build around the area.[17]\\r\\nIt is estimated that the area around the site has received more than 72 inches of rain per year since A.D. 1450, which was more than needed to support crop growth there. Because of the large amount of rainfall at Machu Picchu, it was found that irrigation was not needed for the terraces. The terraces received so much rain that they were built specifically to allow for ample drainage of the extra water. Excavation and soil analyses done by Kenneth Wright in the 90's showed that the terraces were built in layers, with a bottom layer of larger stones covered by loose gravel.[17] On top of the gravel was a layer of mixed sand and gravel packed together, with rich topsoil covering all of that. It was proven that the topsoil was probably moved from the valley floor to the terraces because it was much more rich than the soil higher up the mountain.[10]\\r\\nHowever, it has been found that the terrace farming area makes up only about 12 acres of land, and a study of the soil around the terraces showed that what was grown there was mostly corn and potatoes, which was not enough to support the 750+ people living at Machu Picchu. Therefore, when studies were done on the food that the Incas ate at Machu Picchu, it was found that much of what they ate was imported to the area from the surrounding valleys and farther.[14]\\r\\nAlthough it was located only about 80 kilometers (50?mi) from the Inca capital in Cusco, the Spanish never found Machu Picchu and so did not plunder or destroy it, as they did many other sites.[18] The conquistadors had notes of a place called Piccho, although no record of a Spanish visit exists. The types of sacred rocks defaced by the conquistadors in other locations are untouched at Machu Picchu.[19]\\r\\nOver the centuries, the surrounding jungle overgrew the site, and few outside the immediate area knew of its existence. The site may have been discovered and plundered in 1867 by a German businessman, Augusto Berns.[20] Some evidence indicates that German engineer J. M. von Hassel arrived earlier. Maps show references to Machu Picchu as early as 1874.[21]\\r\\nIn 1911 American historian and explorer Hiram Bingham travelled the region looking for the old Inca capital and was led to Machu Picchu by a local farmer. Bingham brought Machu Picchu to international attention and organized another expedition in 1912 to undertake major clearing and excavation. He returned in 1914 and 1915 to continue with excavation.\\r\\nIn 1981, Peru declared an area of 325.92 square kilometres (125.84?sq?mi) surrounding Machu Picchu a \\"Historic Sanctuary\\". In addition to the ruins, the sanctuary includes a large portion of the adjoining region, rich with the flora and fauna of the Peruvian Yungas and Central Andean wet puna ecoregions.[22]\\r\\nIn 1983, UNESCO designated Machu Picchu a World Heritage Site, describing it as \\"an absolute masterpiece of architecture and a unique testimony to the Inca civilization\\".[2]\\r\\nBingham was a lecturer at Yale University, although not a trained archaeologist. In 1909, returning from the Pan-American Scientific Congress in Santiago, he traveled through Peru and was invited to explore the Inca ruins at Choqquequirau in the Apurmac Valley. He organized the 1911 Yale Peruvian Expedition in part to search for the Inca capital, which was thought to be the city of Vitcos. He received funding for his travels from the National Geographic Society. He consulted Carlos Romero, a historian in Lima who showed him helpful references and Father Calanchas Chronicle.\\r\\nArmed with this information the expedition went down the Urubamba River. En route Bingham asked local people to show them Inca ruins. By the time they camped at Mandor Pampa, with Huayna Picchu 2000 feet above them on the opposite bank, they had already examined several ruins, but none fit the descriptions of Vitcos.\\r\\nAt Mandor Pampa, Bingham asked farmer and innkeeper Melchor Arteaga if he knew of any nearby ruins. Arteaga said he knew of excellent ruins on the top of Huayna Picchu.[23] The next day, 24 July, Arteaga led Bingham and Sergeant Carrasco across the river on a log bridge and up the Huayna Picchu mountain. At the top of the mountain they came across a small hut occupied by a couple of Quechua, Richarte and Alvarez, who were farming some of the original Machu Picchu agricultural terraces that they had cleared four years earlier. Alvarez's 11-year-old son, Pablito, led Bingham along the ridge to the main ruins.[19]\\r\\nThe ruins were mostly covered with vegetation except for the cleared agricultural terraces and clearings used by the farmers as vegetable gardens. Because of the vegetation Bingham was not able to observe the full extent of the site. He took preliminary notes, measurements and photographs, noting the fine quality of Inca stonework of several principal buildings. Bingham was unclear about the original purpose of the ruins, but decided that there was no indication that it matched the description of Vitcos.\\r\\nThe expedition continued down the Urubamba and up the Vilcabamba Rivers examining all the ruins they could find. Guided by locals Bingham rediscovered and correctly identified the site of the old Inca capital, Vitcos (then called Rosaspata), and the nearby temple of Chuquipalta. He then crossed a pass and into the Pampaconas Valley where he found more ruins heavily buried in the jungle undergrowth at Espritu Pampa, which he named \\"Eromboni Pampa\\".[24] As was the case with Machu Picchu, the site was so heavily overgrown that Bingham could only note a few of the buildings. In 1964, Gene Savoy further explored the ruins at Espiritu Pampa and revealed the full extent of the site, identifying it as Vilcabamba Viejo where the Incas fled after the Spanish drove them from Vitcos.[25]\\r\\nOn the return of the expedition up the Urubamba River, Bingham sent two men to clear and map the site he referred to as Machu Picchu. As Bingham failed to identify the ruins at Espiritu Pampa as Vilcabamba Viejo, he erroneously theorized that Machu Picchu was Vilcabamba Viejo. Machu Picchu features spectacular workmanship and a dramatic site, while Vilcabamba was built while the short-lived remnant Neo-Inca State was being vanquished by the Spanish; it was built quickly and features crude workmanship.\\r\\nBingham returned to Machu Picchu in 1912 under the sponsorship of Yale University and National Geographic again and with full support of Peruvian President Leguia. The expedition undertook a four-month clearing of the site with local labor, which was expedited with the support of the Prefect of Cuzco. Excavation started in 1912 with further excavation undertaken in 1914 and 1915. Bingham focused on Machu Picchu because of its fine Inca stonework and well-preserved nature, which had lain undisturbed since the site was abandoned. None of Bingham's several hypotheses explaining the site held up. During his studies, he carried various artifacts back to Yale. One prominent artifact was a set of 15th-century, ceremonial Incan knives made from bismuth bronze; they are the earliest known artifact containing this alloy.[26][27]\\r\\nAlthough local institutions initially welcomed the exploration, they soon accused Bingham of legal and cultural malpractice.[28] Rumors arose that the team was stealing artifacts and smuggling them out of Peru through Bolivia. (In fact, Bingham removed many artifacts, but openly and legally; they were deposited in the Yale University Museum. Bingham was abiding by the 1852 Civil Code of Peru; the code stated that \\"archaeological finds generally belonged to the discoverer, except when they had been discovered on private land.\\" (Batievsky 100)[29] ) Local press perpetuated the accusations, claiming that the excavation harmed the site and deprived local archaeologists of knowledge about their own history.[28] Landowners began to demand rent from the excavators.[28] By the time Bingham and his team left Machu Picchu, locals had formed coalitions to defend their ownership of Machu Picchu and its cultural remains, while Bingham claimed the artifacts ought to be studied by experts in American institutions.[28]\\r\\nLittle information describes human sacrifices at Machu Picchu, though many sacrifices were never given a proper burial, and their skeletal remains succumbed to the elements.[30]:115 However, there is evidence that retainers were sacrificed to accompany a deceased noble in the afterlife.[30]:107,119 Animal, liquid and dirt sacrifices to the gods were much more common, made at the Altar of the Condor. The tradition is upheld by members of the New Age Andean religion.[31]:263\\r\\nMachu Picchu lies in the southern hemisphere, 13.164 degrees south of the equator.[32] It is 80 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Cusco, on the crest of the mountain Machu Picchu, located about 2,430 metres (7,970 feet) above mean sea level, over 1,000 metres (3,300?ft) lower than Cusco, which has an elevation of 3,600 metres (11,800?ft).[32] As such, it had a milder climate than the Inca capital. It is one of the most important archaeological sites in South America, one of the most visited tourist attractions in Latin America[33] and the most visited in Peru.\\r\\nMachu Picchu has wet and dry seasons, with the majority of annual rain falling from October through to April.[32]\\r\\nMachu Picchu is situated above a bow of the Urubamba River, which surrounds the site on three sides, where cliffs drop vertically for 450 metres (1,480?ft) to the river at their base. The area is subject to morning mists rising from the river.[18] The location of the city was a military secret, and its deep precipices and steep mountains provided natural defenses. The Inca Bridge, an Inca grass rope bridge, across the Urubamba River in the Pongo de Mainique, provided a secret entrance for the Inca army. Another Inca bridge was built to the west of Machu Picchu, the tree-trunk bridge, at a location where a gap occurs in the cliff that measures 6 metres (20?ft).\\r\\nThe city sits in a saddle between the two mountains Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu,[18] with a commanding view down two valleys and a nearly impassable mountain at its back. It has a water supply from springs that cannot be blocked easily. The hillsides leading to it were terraced, to provide more farmland to grow crops, and to steepen the slopes that invaders would have to ascend. The terraces reduced soil erosion and protected against landslides.[34] Two high-altitude routes from Machu Picchu cross the mountains back to Cusco, one through the Sun Gate, and the other across the Inca bridge. Both could be blocked easily, should invaders approach along them.\\r\\nThe site is roughly divided into an urban sector and an agricultural sector, and into an upper town and a lower town. The temples are in the upper town, the warehouses in the lower.[35]\\r\\nThe architecture is adapted to the mountains. Approximately 200 buildings are arranged on wide parallel terraces around an east-west central square. The various compounds, called kanchas, are long and narrow in order to exploit the terrain. Sophisticated channeling systems provided irrigation for the fields. Stone stairways set in the walls allowed access to the different levels across the site. The eastern section of the city was probably residential. The western, separated by the square, was for religious and ceremonial purposes. This section contains the Torre܇n, the massive tower which may have been used as an observatory.[36]\\r\\nLocated in the first zone are the primary archaeological treasures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows. These were dedicated to Inti, their sun god and greatest deity.\\r\\nThe Popular District, or Residential District, is the place where the lower-class people lived. It includes storage buildings and simple houses.\\r\\nThe royalty area, a sector for the nobility, is a group of houses located in rows over a slope; the residence of the amautas (wise persons) was characterized by its reddish walls, and the zone of the ?ustas (princesses) had trapezoid-shaped rooms. The Monumental Mausoleum is a carved statue with a vaulted interior and carved drawings. It was used for rites or sacrifices.\\r\\nThe Guardhouse is a three-sided building, with one of its long sides opening onto the Terrace of the Ceremonial Rock. The three-sided style of Inca architecture is known as the wayrona style.[37]\\r\\nIn 2005 and 2009, the University of Arkansas made detailed laser scans of the entire site and of the ruins at the top of the adjacent Huayna Picchu mountain. The scan data is available online for research purposes.[38]\\r\\nThe Intihuatana stone is one of many ritual stones in South America. These stones are arranged to point directly at the sun during the winter solstice. The name of the stone (perhaps coined by Bingham) derives from Quechua language: inti means \\"sun\\", and wata-, \\"to tie, hitch (up)\\". The suffix -na derives nouns for tools or places. Hence Intihuatana is literally an instrument or place to \\"tie up the sun\\", often expressed in English as \\"The Hitching Post of the Sun\\". The Inca believed the stone held the sun in its place along its annual path in the sky. The stone is situated at 139'48\\" S. At midday on 11 November and 30 January, the sun stands almost exactly above the pillar, casting no shadow. On 21 June, the stone casts the longest shadow on its southern side, and on 21 December a much shorter shadow on its northern side.\\r\\nInti Mach'ay is a special cave used to observe the Royal Feast of the Sun. This festival was celebrated during the Incan month of Qhapaq Raymi. It began earlier in the month and concluded on the December solstice. On this day, noble boys were initiated into manhood by an ear-piercing ritual as they stood inside the cave and watched the sun rise.[40]\\r\\nArchitecturally, Inti Mach'ay is the most significant structure at Machu Picchu. Its entrances, walls, steps and windows are some of the finest masonry in the Incan Empire. The cave also includes a tunnel-like window unique among Incan structures, which was constructed to only allow sunlight into the cave during several days around the December solstice. For this reason, the cave was inaccessible for much of the year.[41] Inti Mach'ay is located on the eastern side of Machu Picchu, just north of the \\"Condor Stone.\\" Many of the caves surrounding this area were prehistorically used as tombs, yet there is no evidence that Mach'ay was a burial ground.[42]\\r\\nThe central buildings use the classical Inca architectural style of polished dry-stone walls of regular shape. The Incas were masters of this technique, called ashlar, in which blocks of stone are cut to fit together tightly without mortar.\\r\\nThe section of the mountain where Machu Picchu was built provided various challenges that the Incas solved with local materials. One issue was the seismic activity due to two fault lines. It made mortar and similar building methods nearly useless. Instead, the Inca mined stones from the quarry at the site, lined them up and shaped them to fit together perfectly, stabilizing the structures. Inca walls have many stabilizing features: doors and windows are trapezoidal, narrowing from bottom to top; corners usually are rounded; inside corners often incline slightly into the rooms; and outside corners were often tied together by \\"L\\"-shaped blocks; walls are offset slightly from row to row rather than rising straight from bottom to top.\\r\\nHeavy rainfall required terraces and stone chips to drain rain water and prevent mud slides, landslides, erosion and flooding. Terraces were layered with stone chips, sand, dirt and top soil, to absorb water and prevent it from running down the mountain. Similar layering protected the large city center from flooding.[43] Multiple canals and reserves provide water throughout the city that could be supplied to the terraces for irrigation and to prevent erosion and flooding.\\r\\nThe Incas never used wheels in a practical way, although their use in toys shows that they knew the principle. The use of wheels in engineering may have been limited due to the lack of strong draft animals, steep terrain and dense vegetation. The approach to moving and placing the enormous stones remains uncertain, probably involving hundreds of men to push the stones up inclines. A few stones have knobs that could have been used to lever them into position; the knobs were generally sanded away, with a few overlooked.\\r\\nThe Inca road system included a route to the Machu Picchu region. The people of Machu Picchu were connected to long-distance trade, as shown by non-local artifacts found at the site. For example, Bingham found unmodified obsidian nodules at the entrance gateway. In the 1970s, Burger and Asaro determined that these obsidian samples were from the Titicaca or Chivay obsidian source, and that the samples from Machu Picchu showed long-distance transport of this obsidian type in pre-Hispanic Peru.[44][page?needed]\\r\\nThousands of tourists walk the Inca Trail to visit Machu Picchu each year.[45] They congregate at Cusco before starting on the one-, two-, four- or five-day journey on foot from kilometer 82 (or 77 or 85, four/five-day trip) or kilometer 104 (one/two-day trip) near the town of Ollantaytambo in the Urubamba valley, walking up through the Andes to the isolated city.\\r\\nMachu Picchu is both a cultural and natural UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since its discovery in 1911, growing numbers of tourists have visited the site each year, including 1,411,279 in 2017.[46] As Peru's most visited tourist attraction and major revenue generator, it is continually exposed to economic and commercial forces. In the late 1990s, the Peruvian government granted concessions to allow the construction of a cable car and a luxury hotel, including a tourist complex with boutiques and restaurants and a bridge to the site.[47] Many people protested the plans, including Peruvians and foreign scientists, saying that more visitors would pose a physical burden on the ruins.[48] A no-fly zone exists above the area.[49] UNESCO is considering putting Machu Picchu on its List of World Heritage in Danger.[47]\\r\\nDuring the 1980s a large rock from Machu Picchu's central plaza was moved to a different location to create a helicopter landing zone. In the 1990s, the government prohibited helicopter landings. In 2006, a Cusco-based company, Helicusco, sought approval for tourist flights over Machu Picchu. The resulting license was soon rescinded.[50]\\r\\nAuthorities have struggled to maintain tourist safety. Tourist deaths have been linked to altitude sickness, floods and hiking accidents.[51][52][53][54] UNESCO received criticism for allowing tourists at the location given high risks of landslides, earthquakes and injury due to decaying structures.[55]\\r\\nNude tourism is a recent trend, to the dismay of Peruvian officials. In several incidents, tourists were detained for posing for nude pictures or streaking across the site. Peru's Ministry of Culture denounced these acts for threatening Peru's cultural heritage. Cusco's Regional Director of Culture increased surveillance to end the practice.[56]\\r\\nIn January 2010, heavy rain caused flooding that buried or washed away roads and railways to Machu Picchu, trapping more than 2,000 locals and more than 2,000 tourists, later airlifted out. Machu Picchu was temporarily closed,[57] reopening on 1 April 2010.[58]\\r\\nIn July 2011, the Direcci܇n Regional de Cultura Cusco (DRC) introduced new entrance rules to the citadel of Machu Picchu.[59] The tougher entrance rules attempted to reduce the effect of tourism. The entrance was limited to 2,500 visitors per day, and the entrance to Huayna Picchu (within the citadel) was further restricted to 400 visitors per day.\\r\\nIn May 2012, a team of UNESCO conservation experts called upon Peruvian authorities to take \\"emergency measures\\" to further stabilize the sites buffer zone and protect it from damage, particularly in the nearby town of Aguas Calientes, which had grown rapidly.[60]\\r\\nIn 1912, 1914 and 1915, Bingham removed thousands of artifacts from Machu Picchuceramic vessels, silver statues, jewelry and human bonesand took them to Yale University for further study, supposedly for 18 months. Yale instead kept the artifacts until 2012, arguing that Peru lacked the infrastructure and systems to care for them. Eliane Karp, an anthropologist and wife of former Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo, accused Yale of profiting from Peru's cultural heritage. Many of the articles were exhibited at Yale's Peabody Museum.\\r\\nIn 2006, Yale returned some pieces but kept the rest, claiming this was supported by federal case law of Peruvian antiquities.[61] In 2007, Peru and Yale had agreed on a joint traveling exhibition and construction of a new museum and research center in Cusco advised by Yale. Yale acknowledged Peru's title to all the objects, but would share rights with Peru in the research collection, part of which would remain at Yale for continuing study.[62] On 21 November 2010, Yale agreed to return the disputed artifacts.[63] The third and final batch of artifacts was delivered November 2012.[64] The artifacts are permanently exhibited at La Casa Concha (\\"The Shell House\\") close to Cusco's colonial center. Owned by the National University of San Antonio Abad del Cusco, La Casa Concha also features a study area for local and foreign students.\\r\\nThe Paramount Pictures film Secret of the Incas (1955), with Charlton Heston and Ima Sumac, was filmed on location at Cusco and Machu Picchu, the first time that a major Hollywood studio filmed on site. Five hundred indigenous people were hired as extras in the film.[65]\\r\\nThe opening sequence of the film Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972) was shot in the Machu Picchu area and on the stone stairway of Huayna Picchu.[66]\\r\\nMachu Picchu was featured prominently in the film, The Motorcycle Diaries (2004), a biopic based on the 1952 youthful travel memoir of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara.[67]\\r\\nThe NOVA television documentary \\"Ghosts of Machu Picchu\\" presents an elaborate documentary on the mysteries of Machu Picchu.[68]\\r\\nContemporary multimedia artist Kimsooja used Macchu Picchu as the primary setting for the first episode of her film series Thread Routes, shot in 2010.[69]\\r\\nThe song \\"Kilimanjaro\\", from the South Indian Tamil film Enthiran (2010), was filmed in Machu Picchu.[70] The sanction for filming was granted only after direct intervention from the Indian government.[71][72]\\r\\nImages","input":"Who discovered the ancient city of machu pichu?"},{"output":"Zuleyka Rivera","context":"\\"Despacito\\" (American Spanish:?[despa'sito]; English: \\"Slowly\\") is a single by Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi featuring Puerto Rican rapper Daddy Yankee from Fonsi's upcoming studio album.[1] On January 12, 2017, Universal Music Latin released \\"Despacito\\" and its music video, which shows both artists performing the song in La Perla neighborhood of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico and the local bar La Factora. The song was written by Fonsi, Erika Ender and Daddy Yankee, and was produced by Andrs Torres and Mauricio Rengifo.[2]\\r\\nIt is a reggaeton-pop song composed in common time with lyrics about having a sexual relationship, performed in a smooth and romantic way. Commercially, the song topped the charts of 47 countries and reached the top 10 of ten others, making it both Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's most successful single to date. It became the first song primarily in Spanish to top the Billboard Hot 100 since \\"Macarena\\" (Bayside Boys Mix) in 1996. On August 4, 2017, the official music video for \\"Despacito\\" became the most viewed YouTube video of all time after receiving its 3 billionth view, making it the first video on the site to reach the milestone. It later became the first YouTube video to hit 4 billion views on October 11, 2017. With its 3.3 million certified sales plus track-equivalent streams, \\"Despacito\\" is one of the best-selling Latin singles in the United States. Additionally, it became the world's most streamed song of all time with 4.6 billion streams.[3] In September 2017, Billboard ranked it the fifth best Latin song of all time.\\r\\nSeveral remix versions were released following the single's success. On March 17, 2017, both a solo pop version and a salsa version featuring Puerto Rican musician Victor Manuelle were released. On April 17, 2017, a remix version featuring Canadian singer Justin Bieber was released; this version helped to improve the song's chart performance in numerous countries, particularly in the English-speaking world.

regional\\" and they started writing a story.[8]\\r\\nFonsi originally composed \\"Despacito\\" as a cumbia and pop song with lyrics written as a ballad, but began to consider giving it an \\"urban injection\\" and contacted reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee, who agreed to collaborate on the song after Fonsi played him the demo.[5] Prior to collaborating on \\"Despacito\\", Fonsi and Daddy Yankee had worked together on \\"Una Oportunidad\\", released digitally in 2010.[9] Daddy Yankee wrote his verse and the post-chorus or hook.[10][11] They recorded the song in Miami in 2016.[12] The song was produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andrs Torres;[13] the former is known as a member of Colombian pop duo Cali & El Dandee[14] and the latter is known for previously working with David Bisbal and Ricky Martin.[15]\\r\\nOriginally, Luis Fonsi focused on other songs of his album after making the demo of \\"Despacito\\".[16] After showing the track to his producers, they and Fonsi decided to focus on \\"Despacito\\" and leave the other works aside.[16] He stated that both Daddy Yankee and he were surprised after hearing the final song because it sounded \\"powerful, fresh and different.\\"[16] Luis Fonsi said that he does not consider it a reggaeton song but feels that \\"it does have a reggaeton energy and an subtle urban beat.\\"[5] He also affirmed that Daddy Yankee's work was a plus to the song because \\"it needed that explosion that only he can bring to the table.\\"[5] Ender stated that the track \\"went through several arrangements\\" until Fonsi got \\"exactly the arrangement he wanted.\\"[8]\\r\\nFonsi stated that he made \\"Despacito\\" a danceable song because \\"Latinos are known for being happy people\\" and that he feels the need of happy music.[17] He added that the \\"urban feel\\" in the song's rhythm is the type that \\"[us Latinos] breathe in and out\\" and that it is \\"a synonym of party.\\"[17] According to him, \\"Despacito\\" is a very melodic song that can adapt well to many other music genres.[17] In an interview with Billboard magazine in April 2017, Erika Ender stated that the track \\"made a special connection\\" and that the collaboration with Daddy Yankee was \\"a great idea.\\"[6] She also said that because of the sensual nature of the song, they \\"needed to be responsible with a good lyric\\" and that her approach to writing for Fonsi was \\"to take care of how to say things with a good taste.\\"[6] During the 2017 Billboard Latin Music Conference, American-Puerto Rican singer and songwriter Nicky Jam revealed that the original version of \\"Despacito\\" featured him instead of Daddy Yankee.[18][19][20]\\r\\n\\"Despacito\\" is a reggaeton-pop song composed in common time (4\\r\\n4 time) and written in the key of B minor with a tempo of 89 beats per minute and a common chord progression of BmGDA.[21][22] Its implicit lyrics are about having a sexual relationship in a smooth and romantic way, making heavy use of allegories.[23][24] However, Luis Fonsi expressed that some lines are free for interpretation.[25][26]\\r\\nAndrs Torres and Mauricio Rengifo produced \\"Despacito\\" using Pro Tools and its final mix consisted of 47 tracks.[27] The song begins with a Puerto Rican cuatro played by Christian Nieves, which is accompanied by an acoustic guitar when Luis Fonsi starts performing.[27] Nieves plays salsa-influenced melodies during the chorus and the hook, which contains vocal samples and \\"old school pop\\" effects based on American producer Dr. Luke.[27] Percussion instruments guache and gira were synchronized with a hi hat in order to highlight the track's cumbia influences.[27] The song uses the side-chaining production technique in order to make the chorus \\"more prominent\\", silencing the music as the kick drum hits.[28] It also makes heavy use of text painting when the music is slowed down as the word \\"Despacito\\" (slowly) is performed at the beginning of every chorus.[28] Its percussion consists of guache, cowbell, timbales, gira, and sequenced drum patterns.[27]\\r\\n\\"Despacito\\" was made available for digital download on January 13, 2017 by Universal Music Latin.[29] It was released physically on April 30, 2017 in Europe as a 2-track single including the original and pop version.[30] Some music publications believed the single's success was influenced by a trend of combining Latin pop and urban music after the release of hit singles by Nicky Jam, Thalia, Enrique Iglesias, Carlos Vives, Ricky Martin and Shakira.[31] Fonsi considered the trend to be \\"the new pop\\", and Ender said of it, \\"everyone is making this type of fusions.\\"[4][6]\\r\\nThe song was well received from music critics. Doris Irizarry of AXS praised the fusion between \\"Latin sensual rhythms\\" and urban music, describing it as \\"masterful.\\"[32] Sebastian Wernke-Schmiesing of Dance-Charts electronic journal stated that \\"a simple 4/4 time, Spanish guitar sounds, a crisp bass, and the excellent vocals by Luis Fonsi and [Daddy Yankee] were enough to get a hit single from the start.\\"[33] He added that \\"'Despacito' has the magic it takes to reach the world\\" and that \\"works both on the dancefloors and on the radio.\\"[33] Buddy Iahn of The Music Universe described it as an \\"infectious tune\\" and expressed that its music video became very popular because it is \\"great music performed by two of the biggest stars in the Latin music business.\\"[34] Diana Marti of E! News said that \\"it is almost impossible not to dance to [it].\\"[35] Caroline Soriano of Enstars magazine described the song's beat as \\"quite sexy and catchy\\" and defined the lyrics as \\"captivating.\\"[36] Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone magazine described it as alluring, sexy and catchy.[12] Leila Cobo of Billboard expressed that \\"Despacito\\" is \\"a great pop song\\", highlighting the \\"undeniable immediate catchiness\\" of the pre-chorus and the chorus.[37]\\r\\nRobert Joffred of Medium's culture blog That Good You Need stated in his review that the song has \\"something [very] interesting happening\\" and that it can be classified as a Latin-American song because of its composition and characteristics.[28] He highlighted the use of a steel-string guitar to play flamenco-style melodies instead of a nylon-string guitar, on which flamenco is usually played, representing \\"a modern take on a historical musical style.\\"[28] Joffred also stated that what makes \\"Despacito\\" a \\"great song\\" is that it \\"throws decades of tradition to the wind in a very subtle way\\" because of the presence of \\"swung rhythms\\" when the word \\"Despacito\\" is sung at the beginning of the chorus.[28] He referred to the text painting as \\"pretty genius.\\"[28] Petra Rivera-Rideau, author of Remixing Reggaet܇n: The Cultural Politics of Race in Puerto Rico (2015), said that she \\"really likes\\" the song and that it is \\"super catchy.\\"[38] She also stated that \\"what's great about 'Despacito' is that it shows reggaeton never really went away\\" and that the song's success \\"makes [her] really excited to see whats going to happen next.\\"[38]\\r\\nSpanish record producer Nah~m Garca stated that \\"the way the rhythm breaks before the chorus is genius\\", referring to the first time Luis Fonsi performs the word \\"Despacito\\".[39] He explained that \\"the brain realizes that there has been a rare breakdown and it catches its eye\\",[39] and claimed that this \\"trick\\" in particular is not very common \\"and much less in pop music.\\"[39] Garca concluded stating that the song \\"is very well made.\\"[39] James Kellaris, composer and professor at the University of Cincinnati's business school,[40] expressed that \\"'Despacito' contains earworm elements\\" for being \\"cheerful, simple, repetitive and having a sticky rhythm.\\"[39]\\r\\n\\"Despacito\\" has received various awards and nominations following its commercial success. The song has four pending nominations for the 18th Latin Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Urban Fusion/Performance, and Best Short Form Music Video.[41] The original version received two Premios Juventud[42] and a MTV Millennial Award,[43][44] and was nominated for a Premio Tu Mundo.[45] On the other hand, the remix version featuring Justin Bieber received two Teen Choice Awards[46] and was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award.[47] It also has three pending nominations for the 3rd Latin American Music Awards and the 45th American Music Awards.[48][49] The Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame will recognize \\"Despacito\\" as the iHeartLatino Song of the Year at the 5th La Musa Awards.[50] Erika Ender became the youngest person to be inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame.[50]\\r\\nIn September 2017, \\"Despacito\\" was ranked the fifth best Latin song of all time according to Billboard, whose critics stated that it is \\"without a doubt, one of the biggest hits in Latin music history, period.\\"[53] In November 2017, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee were selected as the \\"Stars of the Year\\" by People en Espa?ol magazine.[54]\\r\\nIn July 2017, it was reported that tourist interest in Puerto Rico increased by 45% since the worldwide success of the song.[55][56] Tour operators cite the song's music video for increasing interest in locations such as Club La Factora and La Perla district in Old San Juan, which were featured in the video.[57]\\r\\nIn July 2017, officials from the Government of Malaysia reported that \\"Despacito\\" was being banned from airing on government-owned broadcast stations as a result of public complaints.[58] Government ministers said that the song was considered un-Islamic and that its lyrics were \\"not suitable to be heard.\\"[58]\\r\\nIn August 2017, the Basque Institute of Women (Emakunde) did not include \\"Despacito\\" on \\"a 'feminist' playlist of about 200 songs that should be played in festivals [in Basque Country].\\" A spokesperson said, \\"It's not about listening to just these songs and no others.

The song, an ode to Hindustanthe land comprising present-day Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, was later published in 1924 in the Urdu book Bang-i-Dara.[2]\\r\\nThe song has remained popular, especially in India. An abridged version is sung and played frequently as a patriotic song and as a marching song of the Indian Armed Forces. A satirical version of the same from a 1958 Hindi movie also remains popular.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIqbal was a lecturer at the Government College, Lahore at that time, and was invited by a student Lala Har Dayal to preside over a function. Instead of delivering a speech, Iqbal sang \\"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\\". The song, in addition to embodying yearning and attachment to the land of Hindustan, expressed \\"cultural memory\\" and had an elegiac quality. In 1905, the 27-year-old Iqbal viewed the future society of the subcontinent as both a pluralistic and composite Hindu-Muslim culture. Later that year he left for Europe for a three-year sojourn that was to transform him into an Islamic philosopher and a visionary of a future Islamic society.[2]\\r\\nIn 1910, Iqbal wrote another song for children, \\"Tarana-e-Milli\\" (Anthem of the Religious Community), which was composed in the same metre and rhyme scheme as \\"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\\", but which renounced much of the sentiment of the earlier song.[4] The sixth stanza of \\"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\\" (1904), which is often quoted as proof of Iqbal's secular outlook:\\r\\nMaz?hab nahؐn? sikht pas men? bair rakhn\\r\\nHindؐ hain? ham, wat?an hai Hindstn? hamr\\r\\nReligion does not teach us to bear ill-will among ourselves\\r\\nWe are of Hind, our homeland is Hindustan.\\r\\ncontrasted significantly with the first stanza of Tarana-e-Milli (1910) reads:[4]\\r\\nCؐn o-?Arab hamr, Hindstn? hamr\\r\\nMuslim hain? ham, wat?an hai sr jahn? hamr\\r\\nCentral Asia[5] and Arabia are ours, Hindustan is ours\\r\\nWe are Muslims, the whole world is our homeland.[4]\\r\\nIqbal's world view had now changed; it had become both global and Islamic. Instead of singing of Hindustan, \\"our homeland,\\" the new song proclaimed that \\"our homeland is the whole world.\\"[6] Two decades later, in his presidential address to the Muslim League annual conference in Allahabad in 1930, he supported a separate nation-state in the Muslim majority areas of the sub-continent, an idea that inspired the creation of Pakistan.[7]\\r\\n???? ???? ?? ???? ???????? ?????\\r\\n?? ?????? ??? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ?????\\r\\n???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???? ?? ?? ??? ???\\r\\n????? ???? ???? ??? ?? ?? ???? ?????\\r\\n???? ?? ?? ?? ?????? ?????? ????? ??\\r\\n?? ????? ?????? ?? ?????? ?????\\r\\n???? ??? ?????? ??? ?? ?? ?????? ?????\\r\\n???? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ???? ???? ?????\\r\\n?? ??? ???? ????! ?? ?? ??? ??? ??? ???\\r\\n???? ??? ????? ?? ?????? ?????\\r\\n???? ???? ?????? ??? ??? ??? ?????\\r\\n???? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???????? ?????\\r\\n????? ? ??? ? ???? ?? ?? ??? ???? ??\\r\\n?? ?? ??? ?? ???? ??? ? ???? ?????\\r\\n??? ??? ?? ?? ???? ???? ???? ?????\\r\\n????? ??? ?? ???? ???? ???? ?????\\r\\n?????! ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???\\r\\n????? ??? ??? ?? ???? ???? ?????!?\\r\\n???? ???? ?? ????? ??????????? ?????\\r\\n?? ???????? ??? ???? ?? ???????? ?????\\r\\n??????? ??? ??? ??? ??, ???? ?? ??? ??? ???\\r\\n???? ???? ???? ?? ??? ?? ???? ?????\\r\\n???? ?? ???? ????, ??????? ????? ??\\r\\n?? ????? ?????, ?? ?????? ?????\\r\\n???? ??? ????? ??? ???? ??????? ??????\\r\\n?????? ?? ????? ?? ?? ????-?-???? ?????\\r\\n? ??-?-???-?-????! ?? ??? ??? ??? ??????\\r\\n???? ???? ?????? ?? ?????? ?????\\r\\n?????? ???? ?????? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n????? ??? ??, ??? ?? ??????????? ?????\\r\\n?????-?-?????-?-???? ?? ??? ?? ???? ??\\r\\n?? ?? ??? ?? ????? ???-?-????? ?????\\r\\n??? ??? ?? ?? ????? ????? ???? ?????\\r\\n?????? ??? ?? ?????? ???-?-????? ?????\\r\\n???????! ??? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???\\r\\n????? ???? ???? ?? ????-?-????? ??????!\\r\\nSre jahn? se acch, Hindositn?[8] hamr\\r\\nHam bulbulen? hain? is kؐ, yih gulsitn?[8] hamr\\r\\nG?h?urbat men? hon? agar ham, raht hai dil wat?an men?\\r\\nSamjho wuhؐn? hamen? bhؐ dil ho jahn? hamr\\r\\nParbat wuh sab se n?ch, hamsyah smn? k\\r\\nWuh santarؐ hamr, wuh psbn? hamr\\r\\nGodؐ men? kheltؐ hain? is kؐ hazron? nadiyn?\\r\\nGuls?h?an hai jin ke dam se ras?h?k-i jann? hamr\\r\\nAi b-i rd-i Gang! wuh din hain? yd tujh ko?\\r\\nUtr tire[9] kinre jab krwn? hamr\\r\\nMaz?hab nahؐn? sikht pas men? bair rakhn\\r\\nHindؐ hain? ham, wat?an hai Hindositn? hamr\\r\\nYnn o-Mi?r o-Rm, sab mi? ga'e jahn? se\\r\\nAb tak magar hai bqؐ, nm o-nis?h?an? hamr\\r\\nKuch bt hai kih hastؐ, mi?tؐ nahؐn? hamrؐ\\r\\n?adiyon? rah hai dus?h?man daur-i zamn? hamr\\r\\nIqbl! ko'ؐ ma?ram apn nahؐn? jahn? men?\\r\\nMa?lm ky kisؐ ko dard-i nihn? hamr!\\r\\nBetter than the entire world, is our Hindustan,\\r\\nWe are its nightingales, and it (is) our garden abode\\r\\nIf we are in an alien place, the heart remains in the homeland,\\r\\nKnow us to be only there where our heart is.\\r\\nThat tallest mountain, that shade-sharer of the sky,\\r\\nIt (is) our sentry, it (is) our watchman\\r\\nIn its lap where frolic thousands of rivers,\\r\\nWhose vitality makes our garden the envy of Paradise.\\r\\nO the flowing waters of the Ganges, do you remember that day\\r\\nWhen our caravan first disembarked on your waterfront?\\r\\nReligion does not teach us to bear animosity among ourselves\\r\\nWe are of Hind, our homeland is Hindustan.\\r\\nIn a world in which ancient Greece, Egypt, and Rome have all vanished\\r\\nOur own attributes (name and sign) live on today.\\r\\nThere is something about our existence for it doesn't get wiped\\r\\nEven though, for centuries, the time-cycle of the world has been our enemy.\\r\\nIqbal!

GRPS serves nearly 17,000 students with 2,700 employees, including 1,400 teachers. The student population represents 55 countries with 54 different languages spoken, creating a diverse educational experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Rapids Public Schools was created in 1871, when the state legislature passed an act creating the Board of Education of the City of Grand Rapids. According to the act, the boundaries of the district were the same as the boundaries of the City of Grand Rapids. Prior to that time, the City of Grand Rapids had not established one single school district. Rather, the west side was known as the Union School District and the east side of the Grand River was served by two other districts.[3]\\r\\nIn the days following 1871, the matters of the public schools and the matters of the city were much more intertwined than they are today since the school board's budget had to be submitted to the city for approval. In that time, when city boundaries were expanded, school boundaries expanded as well. The Constitution of 1908 [4] prohibited special and local acts, so the city was expanded through annexation until the 1920s when the codified school law became more distinct. In 1962, the law stating that the boundaries for the city and the school district must be the same was repealed. Since then, enlargement of the city has not resulted in the expansion of the boundaries within the Grand Rapids Public Schools school district.\\r\\nThe relationship between GRPS and the city is very different than it was one hundred years ago. The city no longer has any control over the school budget, the district's bonding powers, or its borrowing powers. Currently,[when?] the city's basic responsibility is to conduct school elections and to collect school tax after the school board has determined how much tax should be levied. The legislature has continued to require that cities and schools operate separately.\\r\\nPrior to May 1906, the board of education had twenty-five members. Two of these members were elected from each of the twelve wards of the city, and the Mayor of Grand Rapids served as an ex-officio member. The election process was responsible for the poor location of many schools in Grand Rapids.[citation needed] Many schools were located according to a specific ward, rather than according to the needs of the city. In May 1906, the membership of the board was decreased to nine. Each member is now elected by the residents of the city as a whole and serves on the board for a three-year term.\\r\\nOriginally, the board occupied space on the first floor of City Hall, but by 1915 had complete use of the fourth floor of the building. Additional offices were located in the old North Division School at 234 North Division Avenue and the old Junior College Building on Ransom Avenue. The maintenance department was located at 425 West Pleasant Street in the former Pleasant Street School. In June 1920, the Board moved all its offices to the fifth floor of a new addition to the George A. Davis Vocational and Technical High School. This building later transitioned into the West Junior College Building. The new addition was specifically designed to hold these offices. One important factor in construction of the administrative offices was a 1927 City Commission imposed rental fee of $5,000 per year for the use of the space in City Hall. Prior to this time, the space had been rent free. However, the main factor for construction was increased efficiency and a desire to have all administrative personnel at one location.[citation needed]\\r\\nAdministratively, the board initially used a dual system of control, where the superintendent of schools and the business manager were each directly responsible to the board. In 1937, the chief engineer also became responsible directly to the board of education; the chief engineer previously reported to the business manager.\\r\\nOn March 2, 1959, the administrative structure was changed so the superintendent of schools was the only employee directly responsible to the board. The business manager was placed under the superintendent of schools, and the Chief Engineer was assigned to report to the business manager.\\r\\nGRPS offers a large selection of school choices, including neighborhood, theme, Center of Innovation, special education, and charter. Neighborhood schools provide students with a traditional education. Located throughout the city, these schools are open to all students living within a specific attendance area. Pilot programs in select neighborhood schools are working to improve the connection between neighborhood residents and their local school.[citation needed]\\r\\nTheme schools take the traditional curriculum and apply a theme to create a unique curriculum. Examples of themes available at GRPS include environmental science, arts and music, global studies, leadership, Montessori, International Baccalaureate, and more. In many GRPS theme schools, students also experience place based learning and thematic extracurricular activities. Of the theme schools, four require students to test-in. City High Middle School, one of the test-in schools, consistently ranks as the top performing school in West Michigan. Additionally, it is also ranked among the top schools in the state by U.S. News & World Report,[6] and The Washington Post.[7]\\r\\nCenters of Innovation are public-private partnerships that offer students rigorous academics along with opportunities to connect with professional mentors. Furthermore, the Centers of Innovation offer job shadowing and internships,as well as the potential to earn college or trade school credits or career certification to prepare for in-demand careers.[citation needed]\\r\\nGRPS also provides center-based special education services for students from throughout the Kent Intermediate School District (KISD). Students qualify for these services through the IEP team process. Additionally, GRPS has one charter elementary school, Grand Rapids Child Discovery Center.[8] Schools may also offer services for English language learners; \\"community schools\\"[9] with social, health, and mental health services; all-day preschool; and all-day kindergarten.","input":"How many high schools are in grand rapids michigan?"},{"output":"is awarded annually to a child","context":"The International Childrens Peace Prize is awarded annually to a child who has made a significant contribution to advocating children's rights and improving the situation of vulnerable children such as orphans, child labourers and children with HIV/AIDS.\\r\\nThe prize is an initiative of the KidsRights Foundation, an international children's aid and advocacy organisation based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

The term was originally rifled gun, with the word \\"rifle\\" referring to the machining process of creating grooving with cutting tools, and is now used for any long handheld device designed for aimed discharge activated by a trigger, such as air rifles and the personnel halting and stimulation response rifle. Rifles are used in warfare, hunting and shooting sports.\\r\\nLike all typical firearms, a rifle's projectile (bullet) is propelled by the contained deflagration of a combustible propellant compound (originally black powder, later cordite, and now nitrocellulose), although other means such as compressed air are used in air rifles, which are popular for vermin control, hunting small game, formal target shooting and casual shooting (\\"plinking\\"). The raised areas of the rifling are called \\"lands,\\" which make contact with the projectile, imparting a spin around the longitudinal axis of the barrel. When the projectile leaves the barrel, this spin lends gyroscopic stability to the projectile and prevents tumbling, in the same way that a properly spirally thrown American football or rugby ball behaves. This allows the use of aerodynamically-efficient bullets (as opposed to the spherical balls used in muskets) and thus improves range and accuracy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFormerly, rifles only fired a single projectile with each squeeze of the trigger. Modern rifles are capable of firing more than one round per trigger squeeze; some fire in a fully automatic mode and others are limited to fixed bursts of two, three, or more rounds per squeeze. Thus, modern automatic rifles overlap to some extent in design and function with machine guns. In fact, many light machine guns (such as the Russian RPK) are adaptations of existing automatic rifle designs. A military's light machine guns are typically chambered for the same caliber ammunition as its service rifles. Generally, the difference between an automatic rifle and a machine gun comes down to weight, cooling system, and ammunition feed system. Rifles, with their relatively lighter components (which overheat quickly) and smaller capacity magazines, are incapable of sustained automatic fire in the way that machine guns are; they trade this capability in favor of increased mobility. Modern military rifles are fed by magazines, while machine guns are generally belt-fed. Many machine guns allow the operator to quickly exchange barrels in order to prevent overheating, whereas rifles generally do not. Most machine guns fire from an open bolt in order to reduce the danger of \\"cook-off\\", while almost all rifles fire from a closed bolt for accuracy. Machine guns are often crewed by more than one soldier; the rifle is an individual weapon.\\r\\nThe term \\"rifle\\" is sometimes used to describe larger rifled crew-served weapons firing explosive shells, for example, recoilless rifles and naval rifles.\\r\\nIn many works of fiction a rifle refers to any weapon that has a stock and is shouldered before firing, even if the weapon is not rifled or does not fire solid projectiles (e.g. a \\"laser rifle\\").\\r\\nThe origins of rifling are difficult to trace, but some of the earliest practical experiments seem to have occurred in Europe during the 15th century. Archers had long realized that a twist added to the tail feathers of their arrows gave them greater accuracy. Early muskets produced large quantities of smoke and soot, which had to be cleaned from the action and bore of the musket frequently, either through the action of repeated bore scrubbing, or a deliberate attempt to create \\"soot grooves\\" that would allow for more shots to be fired from the firearm. This might also have led to a perceived increase in accuracy, although no one knows for sure. True rifling dates from the mid-15th century,[citation needed] although military commanders preferred smooth bore weapons for infantry use because rifles were much more prone to problems due to powder fouling the barrel and because they took longer to reload and fire than muskets.[citation needed]\\r\\nRifles were created as an improvement in the accuracy of smooth bore muskets. In the early 18th century, Benjamin Robins, an English mathematician, realized that an elongated bullet would retain the momentum and kinetic energy of a musket ball, but would slice through the air with greater ease.[1] The black powder used in early muzzle-loading rifles quickly fouled the barrel, making loading slower and more difficult. Their greater range was also considered to be of little practical use, since the smoke from black powder quickly obscured the battlefield and made it almost impossible to target the enemy from a distance. Since musketeers could not afford to take the time to stop and clean their barrels in the middle of a battle, rifles were limited to use by sharpshooters and non-military uses like hunting.[citation needed]\\r\\nMuskets were smoothbore, large caliber weapons using ball-shaped ammunition fired at relatively low velocity. Due to the high cost and great difficulty of precision manufacturing, and the need to load readily from the muzzle, the musket ball was a loose fit in the barrel. Consequently, on firing the ball bounced off the sides of the barrel when fired and the final direction on leaving the muzzle was unpredictable.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe performance of early muskets defined the style of warfare at the time. Due to the lack of accuracy, soldiers were employed in long lines (thus Line infantry) and fire at the opposing forces. Precise aim was thus not necessary to hit an opponent. Muskets were used for comparatively rapid, imprecisely aimed volley fire, and the average soldier could be easily trained to use them.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the territory of Kentucky, one of the most early successful rifles, the long rifle, was developed over the course of the 18th century. Compared to the more common Brown Bess, they had a tighter bore, no room between bullet and barrel, still used balls instead of conical bullets, but the balls were smaller, allowing the production of more rounds for a given amount of lead. They also had longer barrels, allowing more accuracy, and were rifled with a helical groove. These first started appearing sometime before 1740, one early examples being made by Jacob Dickert, a German immigrant. By 1850 there were a number of such manufacturers in the area. The longer barrel was a departure by local gunsmiths from their German roots, allowing frontiersmen to carry more rounds and for bullets to achieve a higher speed (as the burning gunpowder was contained longer) before emerging from the barrel.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe rifle was used for precise shooting, to aim and fire at individual targets instead of the musket's use for imprecise fire.[2]\\r\\nBy the time of the American Revolutionary War, these rifles were commonly used by frontiersmen, and Congress authorized the establishment of ten companies of riflemen. One of the most important units was Morgan's Riflemen, led by Daniel Morgan, a sharpshooting unit that eventually proved integral to turning the war against the British at the Battle of Saratoga, and in the southern states where General Morgan commanded, and therefore overall. Morgan's sharpshooters would pick off enemy cannoneers and officers, reducing the impact of superior British artillery.[3] This kind of advantage was considered pivotal in many battles, like The Battle of Cowpens, Saratoga, and King's Mountain. After King's Mountain, a British officer wrote \\"The Americans had riflemen who could hit a man anywhere they liked at 200 paces...At King's Mountain, they destroyed us.\\"[4]\\r\\nLater during the Napoleonic Wars, the British 95th Regiment (Green Jackets) and 60th Regiment, (Royal American), as well as American sharpshooters and riflemen during the War of 1812, used the rifle to great effect during skirmishing. Because of a slower loading time than a musket, they were not adopted by the whole army. Since rifles were used by sharpshooters who did not routinely fire over other men's shoulders, long length was not required to avoid the forward line. A shorter length made a handier weapon in which tight-fitting balls did not have to be rammed so far down the barrel.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe invention of the minie balls in the 1840s solved the slow loading problem, and in the 1850s and 1860s rifles quickly replaced muskets on the battlefield. Many rifles, often referred to as rifled muskets, were very similar to the muskets they replaced, but the military also experimented with other designs. Breech-loading weapons proved to have a much faster rate of fire than muzzleloaders, causing military forces to abandon muzzle loaders in favor of breech-loading designs in the late 1860s. In the later part of the 19th century, rifles were generally single-shot and breech-loading, designed for aimed, discretionary fire by individual soldiers. Then, as now, rifles had a stock, either fixed or folding, to be braced against the shoulder when firing.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe adoption of cartridges and breech-loading in the 19th century was concurrent with the general adoption of rifles. In the early part of the 20th century, soldiers were trained to shoot accurately over long ranges with high-powered cartridges. World War I LeeÿEnfield rifles (among others) were equipped with long-range 'volley sights' for massed firing at ranges of up to 1.6?km (1?mi). Individual shots were unlikely to hit, but a platoon firing repeatedly could produce a 'beaten ground' effect similar to light artillery or machine guns.[citation needed]\\r\\nCurrently, rifles are the most common firearm in general use for hunting purposes (with the exception of bird hunting where shotguns are favored). Rifles derived from military designs have long been popular with civilian shooters.[5]\\r\\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars the British army created several experimental units known as \\"Rifles\\", armed with the Baker rifle. These Rifle Regiments were deployed as skirmishers during the Peninsular war in Spain and Portugal, and were more effective than skirmishers armed with muskets due to their accuracy and long range.[citation needed]\\r\\nGradually, rifles appeared with cylindrical barrels cut with helical grooves, the surfaces between the grooves being \\"lands\\". The innovation shortly preceded the mass adoption of breech-loading weapons, as it was not practical to push an overbore bullet down through a rifled barrel, only to then (try to) fire it back out. The dirt and grime from prior shots was pushed down ahead of a tight bullet or ball (which may have been a loose fit in the clean barrel before the first shot), and loading was far more difficult, as the lead had to be deformed to go down in the first place, reducing the accuracy due to deformation. Several systems were tried to deal with the problem, usually by resorting to an under-bore bullet that expanded upon firing.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe original muzzle-loading rifle, with a closely fitting ball to take the rifling grooves, was loaded with difficulty, particularly when foul, and for this reason was not generally used for military purposes. Even with the advent of rifling the bullet itself didn't change, but was wrapped in a greased, cloth patch to grip the rifling grooves.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first half of the 19th century saw a distinct change in the shape and function of the bullet. In 1826 Delvigne, a French infantry officer, invented a breech with abrupt shoulders on which a spherical bullet was rammed down until it caught the rifling grooves. Delvigne's method, however, deformed the bullet and was inaccurate.[citation needed]\\r\\nSoon after, the Carabine  tige was invented by Louis-Etienne de Thouvenin, which provided for a stem at the bottom at the barrel that would deform and expand the base of the bullet when rammed, therefore enabling accurate contact with the rifling. However, the area around the stem would clog and get dirty easily.[citation needed]\\r\\nOne of the most famous was the Mini system, invented by French Army Captain Claude-tienne Mini, which relied on a conical bullet (known as a Mini ball) with a hollow skirt at the base of the bullet. When fired, the skirt would expand from the pressure of the exploding charge and grip the rifling as the round was fired. The better seal gave more power, as less gas escaped past the bullet, which combined with the fact that for the same bore (caliber) diameter a long bullet was heavier than a round ball. The extra grip also spun the bullet more consistently, which increased the range from about 50 yards for a smooth bore musket to about 300 yards for a rifle using the Mini system. The expanding skirt of the Mini ball also solved the problem that earlier tight fitting bullets were difficult to load as black powder residue fouled the inside of the barrel. The Mini system allowed conical bullets to be loaded into rifles just as quickly as round balls in smooth bores, which allowed rifle muskets to replace muskets on the battlefield. Mini system rifles, notably the U.S. Springfield and the British Enfield of the early 1860s, featured prominently in the U.S. Civil War, due to their enhanced power and accuracy.[citation needed]\\r\\nOver the 19th century, bullet design also evolved, the bullets becoming gradually smaller and lighter. By 1910 the standard blunt-nosed bullet had been replaced with the pointed, 'spitzer' bullet, an innovation that increased range and penetration. Cartridge design evolved from simple paper tubes containing black powder and shot, to sealed brass cases with integral primers for ignition, while black powder itself was replaced with cordite, and then other nitro-cellulose-based smokeless powder mixtures, propelling bullets to higher velocities than before.[6]\\r\\nThe increased velocity meant that new problems arrived, and so bullets went from being soft lead to harder lead, then to copper-jacketed, in order to better engage the spiraled grooves without \\"stripping\\" them in the same way that a screw or bolt thread would be stripped if subjected to extreme forces.[citation needed]\\r\\nFrom 1836, breech-loading rifles were introduced with the German Dreyse Needle gun, and followed by the French Tabatire in 1857 the British Calisher and Terry carbine made in Birmingham and later in 1864 and the more well known British SniderÿEnfield. Primitive chamber-locking mechanisms were soon replaced by bolt-action mechanisms, exemplified by the Chassepot in 1866. Breech loading was to have a major impact on warfare, as breech-loading rifles can be fired at a rate many times higher than muzzle loaded rifles and significantly can be loaded from a prone rather than standing position. Firing prone (i.e., lying down) is more accurate than firing from a standing position, while a prone rifleman presents a much smaller target than a standing soldier. The higher accuracy and range, combined with reduced vulnerability generally benefited the defense while making the traditional battle between lines of standing and volleying infantry men obsolete.[citation needed]\\r\\nRevolving rifles were an attempt to increase the rate of fire of rifles by combining them with the revolving firing mechanism that had been developed earlier for revolving pistols. Colt began experimenting with revolving rifles in the early 19th century, and other manufacturers like Remington later experimented with them as well. The Colt Revolving Rifle Model 1855 was an early repeating rifle and the first one to be used by the U.S. Government, and saw some limited action during the American Civil War. Revolvers, both rifles and pistols, tend to spray fragments of metal from the front of the cylinder.\\r\\nThe Winchester repeating rifle was invented in the mid-1800s. An operator pulled on a lever to reload the rifle with a stored cartridge.[2]\\r\\nAn important area of development was the way that cartridges were stored and used in the weapon. The Spencer repeating rifle was a breech-loading manually operated lever action rifle that was adopted by the United States. Over 20,000 were used during the American Civil War. It marked the first adoption of a removable magazine-fed infantry rifle by any country. The design was completed by Christopher Spencer in 1860.[7] It used copper rimfire cartridges stored in a removable seven round tube magazine, enabling the rounds to be fired one after another. When the magazine was empty, it could be exchanged for another.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the Russo-Japanese War of 1904ÿ1905, military observers from Europe and the United States witnessed a major conflict fought with high velocity bolt-action rifles firing smokeless powder.[8]:179,229,230[9]:104,105 The Battle of Mukden fought in 1905 consisted of nearly 343,000 Russian troops against over 281,000 Japanese troops. The Russian MosinÿNagant Model 1891 in 7.62mm was pitted against the Japanese Arisaka Type 30 bolt-action rifle in 6.5mm,[9]:104,105,155 each had velocities well over the 19th century black powder velocities of under 2,000 feet per second (610?m/s).[9]:187[10]:28,29\\r\\nUntil the late 19th century rifles tended to be very long, some rifles reaching approximately 2?m (6?ft) in length (see long rifle) to maximize accuracy, making early rifles impractical for use by cavalry. However, following the advent of more powerful smokeless powder, a shorter barrel did not impair accuracy as much. As a result, cavalry saw limited, but noteworthy, usage in 20th century conflicts.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe advent of massed, rapid firepower of the machine gun, submachine gun and the rifled artillery piece was so quick as to outstrip the development of any way to attack a trench defended by riflemen and machine gunners. The carnage of World War I was perhaps the greatest vindication and vilification of the rifle as a military weapon.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe M1 Garand was a semi-automatic rapid-fire rifle developed for modern warfare use in World War II.[2]\\r\\nDuring and after World War II it became accepted that most infantry engagements occur at ranges of less than 300?m; the range and power of the large full-powered rifle cartridges were \\"overkill\\"; and thus the weapons were heavier than ideal. This led to Germany's development of the 7.92G33mm Kurz (short) round, the MKb-42, and ultimately, the assault rifle. Today, an infantryman's rifle is optimized for ranges of 300?m or less, and soldiers are trained to deliver individual rounds or bursts of fire within these distances. Typically, the application of accurate, long-range fire is the domain of the marksman and the sniper in warfare, and of enthusiastic target shooters in peacetime. The modern marksman rifle and sniper rifle are usually capable of accuracy better than 0.3 mrad at 100 yards (1 arcminute).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Grizzly is a 3D printed .22-caliber rifle created around August 2013.[11] It was created using a Stratasys Dimension 1200es printer.[12] It was created by a Canadian only known by the pseudonym \\"Matthew\\" who told The Verge that he is in his late 20s, and his main job is making tools for the construction industry.[12][13]\\r\\nThe original Grizzly fired a single shot before breaking.[12] Grizzly 2.0 fired fourteen bullets before getting damaged due to the strain.[13] According to the Daily Mail, the Grizzly 2.0 performed so well that the inventor \\"Matthew\\" was able to put the rifle to his shoulder, pressed against his cheek, and shoot off three rounds without hurting himself.[11]\\r\\nA youth rifle is a rifle designed or modified for fitting children, or small-framed shooters. A youth rifle is often a single shot .22 caliber rifle, or a bolt action rifle, although some youth rifles are semi-automatic. They are usually very light, with a greatly shortened length of pull, which is necessary to accommodate children. Youth stocks are available for many popular rifles, such as the Ruger 10/22, a semi-automatic .22 LR rifle, allowing a youth rifle to be made from a standard rifle by simply changing the stock. The typical ages of shooters for such rifles vary from about age 5 to 11 years old.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe usual form of rifling was helical grooves in a round bore.\\r\\nSome early rifled guns had barrels with a twisted polygonal bore. The Whitworth rifle was the first such type designed to spin the round for accuracy. Bullets for these guns were made to match the shape of the bore so the bullet would grip the rifle bore and take a spin that way. These were generally large caliber weapons and the ammunition still did not fit tightly in the barrel. Many different shapes and degrees of spiraling were used in experimental designs. One widely produced example was the Metford rifling in the Pattern 1888 LeeÿMetford service rifle. Although uncommon, polygonal rifling is still used in some weapons today, with one example being the Glock line of pistols (which fire standard bullets). Unfortunately, many of these early designs were prone to dangerous backfiring, which could lead to destruction of the weapon and serious injury to the person firing it.\\r\\nAs the bullet enters the barrel, it inserts itself into the rifling, a process that gradually wears down the barrel, and also causes the barrel to heat up more rapidly. Therefore, some machine guns are equipped with quick-change barrels that can be swapped every few thousand rounds, or in earlier designs, were water-cooled. Unlike older carbon steel barrels, which were limited to around 1,000 shots before the extreme heat caused accuracy to fade, modern stainless steel barrels for target rifles are much more resistant to wear, allowing many thousands of rounds to be fired before accuracy drops. (Many shotguns and small arms have chrome-lined barrels to reduce wear and enhance corrosion resistance. This is rare on rifles designed for extreme accuracy, as the plating process is difficult and liable to reduce the effect of the rifling.) Modern ammunition has a hardened lead core with a softer outer cladding or jacket, typically of an alloy of copper and nickel ÿ cupro-nickel. Some ammunition is even coated with molybdenum disulfide to further reduce internal friction ÿ the so-called 'moly-coated' bullet.[14]\\r\\nRifles were initially single-shot, muzzle-loading weapons. During the 18th century, breech-loading weapons were designed, which allowed the rifleman to reload while under cover, but defects in manufacturing and the difficulty in forming a reliable gas-tight seal prevented widespread adoption. During the 19th century, multi-shot repeating rifles using lever, pump or linear bolt actions became standard, further increasing the rate of fire and minimizing the fuss involved in loading a firearm. The problem of proper seal creation had been solved with the use of brass cartridge cases, which expanded in an elastic fashion at the point of firing and effectively sealed the breech while the pressure remained high, then relaxed back enough to allow for easy removal. By the end of the 19th century, the leading bolt-action design was that of Paul Mauser, whose actionwedded to a reliable design possessing a five-shot magazinebecame a world standard through two world wars and beyond. The Mauser rifle was paralleled by Britain's ten-shot LeeÿEnfield and America's 1903 Springfield Rifle models. The American M1903 closely copied Mauser's original design.\\r\\nBarrel rifling dramatically increased the range and accuracy of the musket. Indeed, throughout its development, the rifle's history has been marked by increases in range and accuracy. From the Mini rifle and beyond, the rifle has become ever more potent at long range strikes.\\r\\nIn recent decades, large-caliber anti-materiel rifles, typically firing between 12.7?mm and 20?mm caliber cartridges, have been developed. The US Barrett M82A1 is probably the best-known such rifle. These weapons are typically used to strike critical, vulnerable targets such as computerized command and control vehicles, radio trucks, radar antennae, vehicle engine blocks and the jet engines of enemy aircraft. Anti-materiel rifles can be used against human targets, but the much higher weight of rifle and ammunition, and the massive recoil and muzzle blast, usually make them less than practical for such use. The Barrett M82 is designed with a maximum effective range of 1,800?m (1.1?mi), although it has a confirmed kill distance of 2,430?m (1.51?mi) in Afghanistan during Operation Anaconda in 2002.[15] The record for the longest confirmed kill shot stands at 3,540?m (11,610?ft), set by an unnamed soldier with Canada's elite special operations unit Joint Task Force 2 using a McMillan TAC-50 sniper rifle.[16]\\r\\nBullets leaving a rifled barrel can spin at a rotational speed of over 100,000 revolutions per minute (rpm, or 1.67 kilohertz) depending on the muzzle velocity of the bullet and the pitch of the rifling. The rotational speed of the bullet can be calculated by using the formula below. The formula divides the number of inches in a foot (12) by the rate of twist that the barrel has. This number is multiplied by the muzzle velocity (MV) and the number of seconds in a minute (60). For example, a bullet with a muzzle velocity of 3,000 feet per second (910?m/s) leaving a barrel that twists once per foot (1/12\\") would rotate at 180,000rpm.[17]\\r\\nExample using a barrel that has a twist rate of 1 turn in 8\\" with a muzzle velocity of 3000?ft/s:\\r\\nExcessive rotational speed can exceed the bullet's designed limits and the inadequate centripetal force will fail to keep the bullet from disintegrating in a radial fashion.[18]\\r\\nRifles may be chambered in a variety of calibers, from as low as .17 (4.4mm) varmint calibers to as high as .80 caliber in the case of the largest anti tank rifles. The term caliber essentially refers to the width of the bullet fired through a rifle's barrel. Armies have consistently attempted to find and procure the most lethal and accurate caliber for their firearms.\\r\\nThe standard calibers used by the world's militaries tend to follow worldwide trends. These trends have significantly changed during the centuries of firearm design and re-design. Muskets were normally chambered for large calibers, such as .50 or .59, with the theory that these large bullets caused the most damage.\\r\\nDuring World War I and II, most rifles were chambered in .30 caliber, a combination of power and speed. Examples would be the .303 British LeeÿEnfield, the American M1903 .30-06, and the German 8mm Mauser K98.\\r\\nAn exception was the Italian Modello 91 rifle, which used the 6.5G52mm MannlicherÿCarcano cartridge.\\r\\nDetailed study of infantry combat during and after WWII revealed that most small-arms engagements occurred within 100 meters, meaning that the power and range of the traditional .30-caliber weapons (designed for engagements at 500 meters and beyond) was essentially wasted. The single greatest predictor of an individual soldier's combat effectiveness was the number of rounds he fired. Weapons designers and strategists realized that service rifles firing smaller-caliber projectiles would allow troops to carry far more ammunition for the same weight. The lower recoil and more generous magazine capacities of small-caliber weapons also allows troops a much greater volume of fire, compared to historical battle rifles. Smaller, faster traveling, less stable projectiles have also demonstrated greater terminal ballistics and therein, a greater lethality than traditional .30-caliber rounds. Most modern service rifles fire a projectile of approximately 5.56mm. Examples of firearms in this range are the American 5.56?mm M16 and the Russian 5.45G39mm AK-74.","input":"How many rounds can a hunting rifle shoot?"},{"output":"a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary","context":"In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary, is a region of active deformation where two or more tectonic plates or fragments of the lithosphere are near the end of their life cycle. This is in contrast to a constructive plate boundary (also known as a mid-ocean ridge or spreading center). As a result of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle, earthquakes and volcanoes are common near destructive boundaries, where subduction zones or an area of continental collision (depending on the nature of the plates involved) occurs. The subducting plate in a subduction zone is normally oceanic crust, and moves beneath the other plate, which can be made of either oceanic or continental crust. During collisions between two continental plates, large mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas are formed. In other regions, a divergent boundary or transform faults may be present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason for the existence of convergent boundaries are the mid-ocean ridges that were only beginning to be understood with the acceptance of the theory of plate tectonics in the mid-1960s. The radioactive decay of elements within the rocks in the interior of the earth generates large amounts of heat that moves magma to the surface of the crust in a process called mantle convection. This results in a new oceanic crust or sea floor being formed that slowly moves away from the ridges (sometimes called spreading centers) towards the subduction zones. In other words, new seafloor originates from the upwelling rock as it emerges from the depths of the mantle and it slowly cools as it is transported over the millennia to the collision or subduction zones where it is consumed or recycled.[1]\\r\\nLarge, shallow earthquakes on subduction zone interfaces are the largest types of earthquakes. They accounted for 90% of the total seismic moment released for the period 1900ÿ1989, but these events usually occur offshore and far from population centers. Non-subduction interface earthquakes also occur in the region of the trench including shallow upper plate shocks, deeper events within the downgoing slab, and events that are related to outer trench swell.[2]\\r\\nA volcanic arc is formed on the continental plate, above the location of the downgoing oceanic slab. The volcanic arc is the surface expression of the magma that is generated by hydrous melting of the mantle above the downgoing slab. Hydrated minerals (e.g., phlogopite, lawsonite, amphibole) within the oceanic lithosphere become unstable at certain depths due to increased temperature and pressure, causing the crystal structure of the hydrated minerals break down and release water. The buoyant fluids then rise into the asthenosphere, where they lower the melting temperature of the mantle and cause partial melting. These melts rise to the surface and are the source of some of the most explosive volcanism on Earth because of their high volumes of extremely pressurized gases.\\r\\nWhen two plates with oceanic crust converge, they typically create an island arc as one plate is subducted below the other. The arc is formed from volcanoes which erupt through the overriding plate as the descending plate melts below it. The arc shape occurs because of the spherical surface of the earth (nick the peel of an orange with a knife and note the arc formed by the straight-edge of the knife). A deep oceanic trench is located in front of such arcs where the descending slab dips downward, such as the Mariana Trench near the Mariana Islands.\\r\\nSome convergent margins have zones of active seafloor spreading behind the island arc, known as back-arc basins. When one plate is composed of oceanic lithosphere and the other is composed of continental lithosphere, the denser oceanic plate is subducted, often forming an orogenic belt and associated mountain range. This type of convergent boundary is similar to the Andes or the Cascade Range in North America.\\r\\nAn oceanic trench is found where the denser plate is subducted underneath the other plate. There is water in the rocks of the oceanic plate (because they are underwater), and as this plate moves further down into the subduction zone, much of the water contained in the plate is squeezed out when the plate begins to subduct. However, the recrystallization of ocean floor rocks, such as serpentinite, which are unstable in the upper mantle, recrystallize into olivine, causing dehydration through loss of hydroxyl groups. This addition of water to the mantle causes partial melting of the mantle, generating magma, which then rises, and which normally results in volcanoes. This normally happens at a certain depth, about 70 to 80 miles below the Earth's surface, and so volcanoes are formed fairly close to, but not right next to, the trench.","input":"What type of boundary is the himalayan mountains?"},{"output":"9th dan","context":"This list of taekwondo grandmasters includes notable persons who have been recognized as grandmasters of the Korean martial art of taekwondo.

Eliot","context":"\\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\", commonly known as \\"Prufrock\\", is the first professionally published poem by American-born, British poet T. S. Eliot (1888ÿ1965). Eliot began writing \\"Prufrock\\" in February 1910, and it was first published in the June 1915 issue of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse[2] at the instigation of Ezra Pound (1885ÿ1972). It was later printed as part of a twelve-poem pamphlet (or chapbook) titled Prufrock and Other Observations in 1917.[1] At the time of its publication, Prufrock was considered outlandish,[3] but is now seen as heralding a paradigmatic cultural shift from late 19th-century Romantic verse and Georgian lyrics to Modernism.\\r\\nThe poem's structure was heavily influenced by Eliot's extensive reading of Dante Alighieri[4] and makes several references to the Bible and other literary worksincluding William Shakespeare's plays Henry IV Part II, Twelfth Night, and Hamlet, the poetry of seventeenth-century metaphysical poet Andrew Marvell, and the nineteenth-century French Symbolists. Eliot narrates the experience of Prufrock using the stream of consciousness technique developed by his fellow Modernist writers. The poem, described as a \\"drama of literary anguish\\", is a dramatic interior monologue of an urban man, stricken with feelings of isolation and an incapability for decisive action that is said \\"to epitomize frustration and impotence of the modern individual\\" and \\"represent thwarted desires and modern disillusionment\\".[5]\\r\\nPrufrock laments his physical and intellectual inertia, the lost opportunities in his life and lack of spiritual progress, and he is haunted by reminders of unattained carnal love. With visceral feelings of weariness, regret, embarrassment, longing, emasculation, sexual frustration, a sense of decay, and an awareness of mortality, \\"Prufrock\\" has become one of the most recognised voices in modern literature.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEliot wrote \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" between February 1910 and July or August 1911. Shortly after arriving in England to attend Merton College, Oxford, Eliot was introduced to American expatriate poet Ezra Pound, who instantly deemed Eliot \\"worth watching\\" and aided the start of Eliot's career. Pound served as the overseas editor of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse and recommended to the magazine's founder, Harriet Monroe, that Poetry publish \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\", extolling that Eliot and his work embodied a new and unique phenomenon among contemporary writers. Pound claimed that Eliot \\"has actually trained himself AND modernized himself ON HIS OWN. The rest of the promising young have done one or the other, but never both.\\"[7] The poem was first published by the magazine in its June 1915 issue.[2][8]\\r\\nIn November 1915 \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\"along with Eliot's poems \\"Portrait of a Lady,\\" \\"The Boston Evening Transcript,\\" \\"Hysteria,\\" and \\"Miss Helen Slingsby\\"was included in Catholic Anthology 1914ÿ1915 edited by Ezra Pound and printed by Elkin Mathews in London.[9]:297 In June 1917 The Egoist, a small publishing firm run by Dora Marsden, published a pamphlet entitled Prufrock and Other Observations (London), containing twelve poems by Eliot. \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" was the first in the volume.[1] Also Eliot was appointed assistant editor of the Egoist in June 1917.[9]:290\\r\\nAccording to Eliot biographer Lyndall Gordon, when Eliot was writing the first drafts of Prufrock in his notebook in 1910ÿ1911, he intentionally kept four pages blank in the middle section of the poem.[10] According to the notebooks, now in the collection of the New York Public Library, Eliot finished the poem that was originally published sometime in July and August 1911when he was 22 years old.[11] In 1912, Eliot revised the poem and included a 38-line section now called \\"Prufrock's Pervigilium\\" which was inserted on those blank pages, and intended as a middle section for the poem.[10] However, Eliot removed this section soon after seeking the advice of his fellow Harvard acquaintance and poet Conrad Aiken.[12] This section would not be included in the original publication of Eliot's poem but was included when published posthumously in the 1996 collection of Eliot's early, unpublished drafts in Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909ÿ1917.[11] This Pervigilium section describes the \\"vigil\\" of Prufrock through an evening and night[11]:41, 43ÿ44, 176ÿ90 described by one reviewer as an \\"erotic foray into the narrow streets of a social and emotional underworld\\" that portray \\"in clammy detail Prufrock's tramping 'through certain half-deserted streets' and the context of his 'muttering retreats / Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels.'\\"[13]\\r\\nIts reception in London can be gauged from an unsigned review in The Times Literary Supplement on 21 June 1917. \\"The fact that these things occurred to the mind of Mr. Eliot is surely of the very smallest importance to anyone, even to himself. They certainly have no relation to poetry.\\"[14]\\r\\nThe Harvard Vocarium at Harvard College recorded Eliot's reading of Prufrock and other poems in 1947, as part of their ongoing series of poetry readings by their authors.[15]\\r\\nIn his early drafts, Eliot gave the poem the subtitle \\"Prufrock among the Women.\\"[11]:41 This subtitle was apparently discarded before publication. Eliot called the poem a \\"love song\\" in reference to Rudyard Kipling's poem \\"The Love Song of Har Dyal,\\" first published in Kipling's collection Plain Tales from the Hills (1888).[16] In 1959, Eliot addressed a meeting of the Kipling Society and discussed the influence of Kipling upon his own poetry:\\r\\nTraces of Kipling appear in my own mature verse where no diligent scholarly sleuth has yet observed them, but which I am myself prepared to disclose. I once wrote a poem called \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\": I am convinced that it would never have been called \\"Love Song\\" but for a title of Kipling's that stuck obstinately in my head: \\"The Love Song of Har Dyal\\".[16]\\r\\nHowever, the origin of the name Prufrock is not certain, and Eliot never remarked on its origin other than to claim he was unsure of how he came upon the name. Many scholars and indeed Eliot himself have pointed towards the autobiographical elements in the character of Prufrock, and Eliot at the time of writing the poem was in the habit of rendering his name as \\"T.?Stearns Eliot,\\" very similar in form to that of J. Alfred Prufrock.[17] It is suggested that the name \\"Prufrock\\" came from Eliot's youth in St. Louis, Missouri, where the Prufrock-Litton Company, a large furniture store, occupied one city block downtown at 420ÿ422 North Fourth Street.[18][19][20] In a 1950 letter, Eliot said, \\"I did not have, at the time of writing the poem, and have not yet recovered, any recollection of having acquired this name in any way, but I think that it must be assumed that I did, and that the memory has been obliterated.\\"[21]\\r\\nThe draft version of the poem's epigraph comes from Dante's Purgatorio (XXVI, 147ÿ148):[11]:39, 41\\r\\n'sovegna vos a temps de ma dolor'.\\r\\nPoi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina.\\r\\n'be mindful in due time of my pain'.\\r\\nThen dived he back into that fire which refines them.[22]\\r\\nHe finally decided not to use this, but eventually used the quotation in the closing lines of his 1922 poem The Waste Land. The quotation that Eliot did choose comes from Dante also. Inferno (XXVII, 61ÿ66) reads:\\r\\nS\`io credesse che mia risposta fosse\\r\\nA persona che mai tornasse al mondo,\\r\\nQuesta fiamma staria senza piu scosse.\\r\\nMa perciocch giammai di questo fondo\\r\\nNon torn vivo alcun, s'i'odo il vero,\\r\\nSenza tema d'infamia ti rispondo.\\r\\nIf I but thought that my response were made\\r\\nto one perhaps returning to the world,\\r\\nthis tongue of flame would cease to flicker.\\r\\nBut since, up from these depths, no one has yet\\r\\nreturned alive, if what I hear is true,\\r\\nI answer without fear of being shamed.[23]\\r\\nIn context, the epigraph refers to a meeting between Dante and Guido da Montefeltro, who was condemned to the eighth circle of Hell for providing counsel to Pope Boniface VIII, who wished to use Guido's advice for a nefarious undertaking. This encounter follows Dante's meeting with Ulysses, who himself is also condemned to the circle of the Fraudulent. According to Ron Banerjee, the epigraph serves to cast ironic light on Prufrock's intent. Like Guido, Prufrock had never intended his story to be told, and so by quoting Guido, Eliot reveals his view of Prufrock's love song.[24]\\r\\nFrederick Locke contends that Prufrock himself is suffering from multiple personalities of sorts, and that he embodies both Guido and Dante in the Inferno analogy. One is the storyteller; the other the listener who later reveals the story to the world. He posits, alternatively, that the role of Guido in the analogy is indeed filled by Prufrock, but that the role of Dante is filled by you, the reader, as in \\"Let us go then, you and I,\\" (1). In that, the reader is granted the power to do as he pleases with Prufrock's love song.[25]\\r\\nBecause the poem is concerned primarily with the irregular musings of the narrator, it can be difficult to interpret. Laurence Perrine wrote, \\"[the poem] presents the apparently random thoughts going through a person's head within a certain time interval, in which the transitional links are psychological rather than logical\\".[26] This stylistic choice makes it difficult to determine exactly what is literal and what is symbolic. On the surface, \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" relays the thoughts of a sexually frustrated middle-aged man who wants to say something but is afraid to do so, and ultimately does not.[26][27] The dispute, however, lies in to whom Prufrock is speaking, whether he is actually going anywhere, what he wants to say, and to what the various images refer.\\r\\nThe intended audience is not evident. Some believe that Prufrock is talking to another person[28] or directly to the reader,[29] while others believe Prufrock's monologue is internal. Perrine writes \\"The 'you and I' of the first line are divided parts of Prufrock's own nature\\",[26] while Mutlu Konuk Blasing suggests that the \\"you and I\\" refers to the relationship between the dilemmas of the character and the author.[30] Similarly, critics dispute whether Prufrock is going somewhere during the course of the poem. In the first half of the poem, Prufrock uses various outdoor images (the sky, streets, cheap restaurants and hotels, fog), and talks about how there will be time for various things before \\"the taking of a toast and tea\\", and \\"time to turn back and descend the stair.\\" This has led many to believe that Prufrock is on his way to an afternoon tea, where he is preparing to ask this \\"overwhelming question\\".[26] Others, however, believe that Prufrock is not physically going anywhere, but rather, is playing through it in his mind.[29][30]\\r\\nPerhaps the most significant dispute lies over the \\"overwhelming question\\" that Prufrock is trying to ask. Many believe that Prufrock is trying to tell a woman of his romantic interest in her,[26] pointing to the various images of women's arms and clothing and the final few lines in which Prufrock laments that the mermaids will not sing to him. Others, however, believe that Prufrock is trying to express some deeper philosophical insight or disillusionment with society, but fears rejection, pointing to statements that express a disillusionment with society, such as \\"I have measured out my life with coffee spoons\\" (line 51). Many believe that the poem is a criticism of Edwardian society and Prufrock's dilemma represents the inability to live a meaningful existence in the modern world.[31] McCoy and Harlan wrote \\"For many readers in the 1920s, Prufrock seemed to epitomize the frustration and impotence of the modern individual. He seemed to represent thwarted desires and modern disillusionment.\\"[29]\\r\\nIn general, Eliot uses imagery which is indicative of Prufrock's character,[26] representing ageing and decay. For example, \\"When the evening is spread out against the sky / Like a patient etherized upon a table\\" (lines 2ÿ3), the \\"sawdust restaurants\\" and \\"cheap hotels,\\" the yellow fog, and the afternoon \\"Asleep...tired... or it malingers\\" (line 77), are reminiscent of languor and decay, while Prufrock's various concerns about his hair and teeth, as well as the mermaids \\"Combing the white hair of the waves blown back / When the wind blows the water white and black,\\" show his concern over aging.\\r\\nLike many of Eliot's poems, \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" makes numerous allusions to other works, which are often symbolic themselves.","input":"Who wrote the lovesong of j alfred prufrock?"},{"output":"two or four fingers","context":"Kit Kat is a chocolate-covered wafer bar confection created by Rowntree's of York, United Kingdom, and is now produced globally by Nestl, which acquired Rowntree in 1988,[1] with the exception of the United States where it is made under license by H.B. Reese Candy Company, a division of The Hershey Company. The standard bars consist of two or four fingers composed of three layers of wafer, separated and covered by an outer layer of chocolate. Each finger can be snapped from the bar separately. There are many different flavours of Kit Kat, including milk, white, and dark chocolate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUse of the name Kit Kat or Kit Cat for a type of food goes back to the 18th century, when mutton pies known as a Kit-Kat were served at meetings of the political Kit-Cat Club in London owned by pastry chef Christopher Catling.[2][3][clarification needed]\\r\\nThe origins of what is now known as the Kit Kat brand go back to 1911, when Rowntree's, a confectionery company based in York in the United Kingdom, trademarked the terms Kit Cat and Kit Kat. The names were not used immediately and Kit Kat first appeared in the 1920s, when Rowntree's launched a brand of boxed chocolates entitled Kit Cat. This continued into the 1930s, when Rowntree's shifted focus and production onto its Black Magic and Dairy Box brands. With the promotion of alternative products the Kit Cat brand decreased and was eventually discontinued.[4] The original four-finger bar was developed after a worker at Rowntree's York Factory put a suggestion in a recommendation box for a snack that \\"a man could take to work in his pack\\".[5] The bar launched on 29 August 1935, under the title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp (priced at 2d), and was sold in London and throughout Southern England.[6]\\r\\nThe product's official title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was renamed Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp in 1937, the same year that Kit Kat began to incorporate \\"Break\\" into its recognisable advertising strategy.[4] The colour scheme and first flavour variation to the brand came in 1942, owing to World War II, when food shortages prompted an alteration in the recipe. The flavour of Kit Kat was changed to dark chocolate; the packaging abandoned its Chocolate Crisp title, and was adorned in blue.[7] After the war the title was altered to Kit Kat and resumed its original milk recipe and red packaging.\\r\\nFollowing on from its success in the United Kingdom, in the 1940s Kit Kat was exported to Canada, South Africa, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. In 1958, Donald Gilles, the executive at JWT Orland, created the iconic advertising line \\"Have a Break, Have a Kit Kat\\". The brand further expanded in the 1970s when Rowntree created a new distribution factory in Germany to meet European demand, and established agreements to distribute the brand in the USA and Japan through the Hershey and Fujiya companies, respectively.[4]\\r\\nIn June 1988, Swiss company Nestl acquired Kit Kat through the purchase of Rowntree's. This gave Nestl global control over the brand, except in the US,[8] and production and distribution increased with new facilities in Japan and additional manufacturing operations set up in Malaysia, India and China.[4]\\r\\nThe Hershey Company has a licence to produce Kit Kat bars in the United States which dates from 1970, when Hershey executed a licensing agreement with Rowntree. Nestl, which has a substantial presence in the US, had to honour the licensing agreement when it bought Rowntree in 1988 which allowed Hershey to retain the Kit Kat licence so long as Hershey was not sold. As Kit Kat is one of Hershey's top five brands in the US market, the Kit Kat licence was a key factor in Hershey's failed attempt to attract a serious buyer in 2002.[9][10]\\r\\nVariants in the traditional chocolate bar first appeared in 1996 when Kit Kat Orange, the first flavour variant, was introduced in the United Kingdom. Its success was followed by several varieties including mint and caramel, and in 1999 Kit Kat Chunky was launched and received favourably by international consumers. Variations on the traditional Kit Kat have continued to develop throughout the 2000s. In 2000, Nestl acquired Fujiya's share of the brand in Japan, and also expanded its marketplace in Japan, Russia, Turkey, and Venezuela, in addition to markets in Eastern and Central Europe.[4] Throughout the decade Kit Kat has introduced dozens of flavours and line extensions within specific consumer markets, and celebrated its 75th anniversary on 10 October 2009.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe traditional bar has four fingers which each measure approximately 1 centimetre (0.4?in) by 9 centimetres (3.5?in). A two-finger bar was launched in the 1930s, and has remained the company's best-selling biscuit brand ever since.[6] The 1999 Kit Kat Chunky (known as Big Kat and Kit Kat Extra Crispy in the US) has one large finger approximately 2.5 centimetres (1?in) wide. Kit Kat bars contain varying numbers of fingers depending on the market, ranging from the half-finger sized Kit Kat Petit in Japan, to the three-fingered variants in Arabia, to the twelve-finger family-size bars in Australia and France. Kit Kat bars are sold individually and in bags, boxes and multi-packs. In Ireland, France, the UK and America Nestl also produces a Kit Kat ice cream, and in Australia and Malaysia, Kit Kat Drumsticks.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2010, a new S5?million manufacturing line was opened by Nestl in York. This will produce more than a billion Kit Kat bars each year.[11]\\r\\nKit Kat bars are produced in 16 countries by Nestl: Brazil, Mexico, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Germany, Russia, Japan, China, Malaysia, Thailand, India, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Bulgaria and Algeria. Kit Kat bars in the United States are produced under licence by The Hershey Company, a Nestl competitor, due to a prior licensing agreement with Rowntree. The year 2003 was a turning point for the Kit Kat bar as well as the confectionery industry in general. The popularity of low carb diets and the push to healthier eating stifled sales growth in many parts of the world. In addition, fierce competition from Cadbury's newly formed Dairy Milk superbrand also contributed to sales of the Kit Kat decreasing considerably in its home market of the UK, and threatened to depose it from its No.1 position.[12][13] The solution adopted by Nestl and others was to increase dramatically the number of new and unique variations of their confections and market them as limited or special editions, whereby they would usually only be available for a few months at a time so as not to impact the sales of their permanent edition counterparts.[14] The strategy initially reversed the decline of the Kit Kat[15] and has been adopted worldwide by Nestl, Hershey, Mars and others with similar success.[16][17]\\r\\nThis has resulted in many new flavours and varieties of the Kit Kat and other confections appearing globally since then. While some flavours have been hits, many have flopped, alienating some consumers in the process, causing Nestl to scale back on new releases.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn September 2006, Nestl announced that they would be cutting 645 jobs in their York factory and moving Smarties production to their Hamburg factory in which two thirds of production was already taking place. They stated that this move would allow for a S20 million investment to modernise the antiquated York factory and improve Kit Kat production.[18]\\r\\nAs dark chocolate has seen increased demand and favour worldwide because of its purported health benefits, September 2006 saw the launch of the four-finger Kit Kat Fine Dark in the United_Kingdom as a permanent edition, as well as new packaging for the entire brand.[citation needed] Hershey had sold the four-finger Kit Kat Dark in the US several years previously as a limited edition, and has begun doing so again.[19]\\r\\nNestl now manufactures two finger Kit Kats with natural flavourings, and for the first time, Kit Kats in this format are suitable for vegans.[citation needed] It is not known at this date whether or not other varieties will follow suit. In 2014, Kit Kat was ranked the third best selling chocolate bar in the United_Kingdom, after Dairy Milk and Galaxy.[20]\\r\\nWhen first introduced, the original Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp bar had a red wrapper, which briefly became blue between 1945ÿ1947. As a result of milk shortages after the end of World War II, the milk chocolate coating was suspended and a dark chocolate was used instead during that period.[citation needed]\\r\\nSince its introduction in the 1970s, the Hershey's Kit Kat packaging and advertising in the United States differed from the branding used in every other country where it was sold. In 2002, Hershey Kit Kats adopted the slanted ellipse logo used worldwide by Nestl, though the ellipse was red and the text white. The US version of \\"Kit Kat Chunky\\" is known as \\"Big Kat\\".\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the product has traditionally been wrapped in silver foil and an outer paper band. In 2001, flow wrap plastic was substituted as the confectionery's packaging.[21]\\r\\nIn Norway, a similar product is manufactured by Mondelz International and sold as Kvikk Lunsj; Kvikk Lunsj XXL is similar to a Kit Kat Chunky.\\r\\nAfter launching in the 1930s, Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was originally advertised as \\"the biggest little meal\\" and \\"the best companion to a cup of tea\\". During World War II, Kit Kat was depicted as a valuable wartime foodstuff, with the slogan \\"what active people need\\". 'Kitty the Kat' arrived in the late 1940s to emphasise the \\"rich full cream milk\\" qualities of the bar and, thanks to contemporary improvements in production methods, also highlighted the new and improved 'snap' by responding to a biscuit being broken off screen. The first Kit Kat poster appeared in 1951, and the first colour TV advertisement appeared in 1969.\\r\\nSince 1958, the slogan for the Kit Kat in the UK and elsewhere has been \\"Have a break... have a Kit Kat\\". However, in 1995, Nestl sought to trademark the \\"Have a break\\" portion. After a ten-year legal battle, which was contested by rival Mars, the European Court of Justice ruled on 7 July 2005 to send the case back to the British courts.[22] In 2004, Nestl UK used the slogan \\"Make the most of your break\\",[23] but later returned to the original slogan.\\r\\nThe United States also used the short-lived slogan, \\"Tastes So Good, You'll Roar\\", in the early 1980s. The TV commercial most known from this slogan involves a young man biting into one of the Kit Kat bars in a grocery store, and roaring like a lion so loudly the whole store shakes violently, knocking items from the shelves. Another short-lived US slogan was \\"That's What You Want\\", whose television adverts showed people pulling unlikely foodstuffs from their pockets or purses, before rejecting them in favour of a Kit Kat.\\r\\nThe \\"classic\\" American version of the \\"Gimme a Break\\" Kit Kat jingle (in use in the US since 1986) was written by Ken Shuldman (copy) and Michael A. Levine (music) for the DDB Advertising Agency. Versions of the original have been covered by Carrie Underwood, Shawn Colvin, and many studio singers, as well as people who have appeared on-camera in the commercials. The jingle was cited in a study by University of Cincinnati researcher James J. Kellaris as one of the top ten \\"earworms\\" ÿ bits of melody that become stuck in your head. Another version of the advertising jingle 'Gimme a break' created for Kit Kat \\"Factory\\" commercial in the US was an original recording by Andrew W.K. W.K. was hired to write a new musical version for their \\"Gimme a break\\" slogan. Variations on the Andrew W.K. advertisement included executive dance routines in corporate offices and a network newsroom. However, the \\"classic\\" song has also been used again since the newer version first aired in 2004.\\r\\nA 1989 United Kingdom advertisement for Kit Kat, in which a zoo photographer \\"takes a break\\" from waiting for pandas to appear in an enclosure and misses them performing a dance routine, came in 30th in Channel 4's \\"100 Greatest Adverts\\" poll in 2000.\\r\\nThe Maltese tour boat MV Lady Davinia had a distinctive red and white Kit Kat paint scheme before she sank in 2008.\\r\\nIn late 2004 through to the end of 2006, Nestl Rowntree sponsored the English football club York City F.C.. As a result, the club's home-ground, Bootham Crescent, was renamed to KitKat Crescent.[24]\\r\\nIn a 2012 advertising campaign in the UK and Ireland, several new flavours of Chunky Kit Kat were marketed, with consumers being asked to vote for their favourite. Selecting from white chocolate, double chocolate, peanut butter, and orange, Peanut butter was the winner by having 47% of votes. A similar campaign occurred in 2013 with mint, coconut, hazelnut and chocolate fudge.\\r\\nIn September 2013, it was announced that version 4.4 of Google's Android mobile operating system would be named \\"KitKat\\".[25] Google licensed the name from Nestl, with no money changing hands.[26] A promotion ran in numerous countries with specially branded Android Kit Kat bars to win Nexus 7 devices and Google Play Store credit.[27]\\r\\nIn December 2009, it was announced that the four finger variety of Kit Kat would use Fairtrade chocolate (at least in Britain and Ireland) from January 2010.[28] It has also been announced that the Fairtrade Kit Kat promotion will be extended to the finger edition as of January 2010.[29]\\r\\nDuring the first three weeks of Big Brother Series 7, Channel 4 conducted a promotion in conjunction with Nestl to distribute 100 \\"golden tickets\\" randomly throughout Kit Kats, in a style reminiscent of the story Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Members of the public finding these tickets were permitted to use them to give themselves a chance to become a Big Brother housemate and bypass the standard auditions process.\\r\\nGolden ticket holders were invited to a television show where one of them, Susie Verrico, was chosen to enter the House by Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace, picking a ball out of a machine at random.\\r\\nThis contest caused some controversy, with the Advertising Standards Authority saying that the terms and conditions of the draw should have been made clearer in related advertisements, and that an independent adjudicator should have been present before and during the draw.[30]\\r\\nMany varieties of Kit Kat have existed, either permanently or as limited editions, such as those sold to commemorate festivals such as St. Valentine's Day.[citation needed] In Japan, Nestl has introduced over 200 different flavours since 2000,[31] including ginger ale, soy sauce, creme brulee, green tea, sake, and banana.[32] The flavours are designed to appeal to younger buyers,[33] and are often bought as good-luck gifts as the brand name echoes the Japanese phrase \\"Kitto Katsu\\", roughly translating as \\"surely win.\\"[31]\\r\\nThe Kit Kat Orange was the first flavour variant to be introduced in the United Kingdom, in 1996 and 1998 in Ireland. It was followed in 1997 by the Kit Kat Dark and Kit Kat Mint.[citation needed] All three were available as permanent editions of the two-finger multipack in the United Kingdom, along with the Kit Kat Original, the Kit Kat White, and from 2012 the Kit Kat Cookies & Cream.\\r\\nA wide variety of promotional items exist, ranging from traditional merchandise (such as mugs, pens, oven gloves and tea-towels) to less common items such as coats for small dogs. Recently in Japan,[when?] Kit Kats have come packaged with CD singles, and a special limited edition double pack of Kit Kat Crispy Monogatari came bundled with a mini book featuring six short stories, one of which was written by Koji Suzuki, author of the Ring cycle series. In Japan, Kit Kats are also available in jars that are dispensed from vending machines.\\r\\nThe 'standard' Kit Kat finger bars can come in a variety of presentations and nutritional values. The bars can come in a miniature form of two finger mini bars, or a larger standard four, or in some cases, three, fingered bars.\\r\\nThe standard size has been upgraded in several cases up to a 'monster Size' bar, which can include up to five or eight fingers. Large single-fingered \\"Chunky Kit Kats\\" were launched in the United Kingdom in 1998 and have been sold in a variety of flavours. The market for Chunky Kit Kats has also expanded to Canada.\\r\\nOther forms and shapes include \\"Choc'n'Go\\" individually wrapped fingers from France, a twelve-finger \\"Family Block which is available in New Zealand, \\" in Australia, round bite-sized \\"Pop Choc\\" pieces, square \\"Kubes\\", praline-filled \\"Senses\\", a yoghurt with Kit Kat pieces, and a Kit Kat ice cream cone.\\r\\nIn the 1980s, a Kit Kat with five shorter fingers was sold in vending machines in the UK.[34]\\r\\nThe Japanese Bake 'N Tasty Mini Kit Kats Custard Pudding Flavour was launched in 2014. The bar must be baked in an oven before consumption, and the surface sugar caramelises in the process.[35]\\r\\nIn 2015, a new luxury and giftable variant of Kit Kat called Kit Kat Rubies was launched in Malaysia. Comes with the box of 20 small bars, the Kit Kat Rubies bar made with the premium chocolate truffle cream and imported roasted hazelnut pieces.[36]\\r\\nAs of 2017, U.S. variants include the standard and king-size four-finger bars, standard bars covered with white or dark chocolate, snack-size orange-covered bars for Halloween, bagged wrapped one-finger miniatures (original and assorted), unwrapped minis, a redesigned Big Kat, and a king-size Big Kat (two of the new Big Kat bars).[37]\\r\\nKit Kat has opened a Chocolatory in the Melbourne Central Shopping Centre in Melbourne, Australia. The dedicated shop allows customers to use touch screens to craft their own Kit Kat from a selection of chocolates and ingredients which are then created for them on site while they wait.[38]\\r\\nIn March 2010, Kit Kat was targeted for a boycott by Greenpeace for using palm oil, which the environmental organisation claimed resulted in destruction of forest habitats for orangutans in Indonesia.[39] A YouTube video by Greenpeace went viral[40] and Nestl announced a partnership with The Forest Trust to establish \\"responsible sourcing guidelines\\" and ensure that its products did not have a deforestation footprint. They aimed to achieve a fully sustainable method of palm oil harvesting by 2015.[41]\\r\\nKit Kat Milk Chocolate is made for the North American market with the ingredient PGPR (polyglycerol polyricinoleate, E476, AKA Palsgaard PGPR 4150),[42] which is used to reduce the amount of cocoa butter needed and as an emulsifier.[43] The FDA has determined it to be safe for humans in amounts up to 7.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. \\"Liver and kidney enlargement was noticed at much higher doses.\\"[44]\\r\\nOriginal Kit Kat ingredients unless otherwise stated, listed by decreasing weight: milk chocolate (sugar, milk ingredients, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, whey powder, lactose, soya lecithin, polyglycerol polyricinoleate, natural flavour), wheat flour, sugar, modified palm oil, cocoa, sodium bicarbonate, soya lecithin, yeast, and natural flavour.\\r\\nMilk chocolate (66%) (sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, dried whole milk, cocoa mass, lactose and proteins from whey, whey powder, emulsifier (sunflower lecithin), butterfat, flavouring), wheat flour, sugar, vegetable fat, cocoa mass, yeast, raising agent (sodium bicarbonate), salt, emulsifier (soya lecithin), flavourings.\\r\\nIn 2006, the UK four-finger Kit Kat contained 233 dietary calories (kcal) (975 kilojoules). In 2009, the two-finger Kit Kat contained 107 calories.\\r\\nIn 2013, the UK Kit Kat Chunky contained 247 calories which reduced to 207 calories in 2015. This correlated to a reduction in weight by 19% from 48?g to 40?g.[45][46]\\r\\nHershey's Kit Kat Crisp Wafers in Chocolate [1 oz] Sugar, wheat flour, cocoa butter, nonfat milk, chocolate, refined palm kernel oil, lactose (milk), milk fat, contains 2% or less of: soy lecithin, PGPR (emulsifier), yeast, artificial flavor, salt, and sodium bicarbonate.\\r\\nMilk chocolate (sugar, modified milk ingredients, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, whey powder, lactose, soya lecithin, polyglycerol polyricinoleate, natural flavour), wheat flour, sugar, modified palm oil, cocoa, sodium bicarbonate, soya lecithin, yeast, Natural Flavour.

During the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, where melamine was found to have tainted some milk suppliers in China, importers in Hong Kong chose to import bars manufactured in the United Kingdom.","input":"How many segments are in a kit kat bar?"},{"output":"crossover","context":"The Acura MDX, or Honda MDX as known in Japan and Australia (only the first generation was imported), is a mid-size three-row luxury crossover,[3][4][5] produced by the Japanese automaker Honda under its Acura luxury nameplate since 2000. The alphanumeric moniker stands for \\"Multi-Dimensional luxury\\". According to Honda, the MDX is the best-selling three-row luxury crossover of all time, with cumulative U.S. sales expected to surpass 700,000 units before the end of 2014.[6] It has ranked as the second-best selling luxury crossover after the Lexus RX,[7] which offers only two rows of seats.\\r\\nThe MDX was the first crossover SUV to have third-row seating, and shares a platform with the Honda Pilot.[8] The Pilot seats eight, while the MDX seats seven, with two seating positions in the third row. The MDX was introduced as a 2001 model, replacing the slow-selling U.S.-only body-on-frame SLX, based on the Isuzu Trooper. In Japan, it filled a gap when the Honda Horizon (also based on the Trooper) was discontinued in 1999. In 2003, the Honda MDX went on sale in Japan and Australia. The MDX has been the most expensive crossover in Acura's lineup, except for the 2009-13 model years when Acura added a crossover to slot above the MDX, called the ZDX.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDerived from Honda's Global mid-size platform which underpins cars like the Honda Accord, Acura TL, TSX and Odyssey, it is powered by a J35A3 3.5?L SOHC 24 valve V6 with VTEC. 2001-2002 3.5 V6 models produce 240?hp (180?kW) and 245?lb?ft (332?N?m) of torque from 3000 to 5000 rpm. 2003-2006 3471?cc (3.5?in x 3.6?in) model engine produces 265?hp (198?kW) and 253?lb?ft (343?N?m) . Curb weight is 4,451?lb (2,019?kg), with a 106.3?in (2,700?mm) wheelbase and 8?in (200?mm) of ground clearance. The cargo floor can flip up to provide two additional seats. The vehicle is designed to hold 7 passengers, but the third row seats are small and only seat two, in contrast to the Odyssey and Pilot whose third row holds three passengers.\\r\\nThe vehicle features an automatic four wheel drive system (named VTM-4) that engages during off the line acceleration as well as when wheel slippage is detected. Additionally, the system offers a lock mode which can be activated and operated at low speeds and provides permanent 4wd and the equivalent of a locked rear differential; designed for climbing steep hills and getting out of stuck situations. To reduce drivetrain noise and increase fuel efficiency, the system runs as front wheel drive during normal cruising. The VTM-4 AWD system in the MDX has the same design as the VTM-4 systems found in the Honda Pilot and Honda Ridgeline. It is different than the real time AWD system in the Honda CR-V in that it can lock and it attempts to predict when traction will be lost and apply power to all four wheels before slippage occurs (by monitoring throttle inputs). The Honda CR-V system waits for slippage to occur and then sends power back.\\r\\nThe navigation system and DVD entertainment system options were mutually exclusive in the 2002 model. Both could be ordered at the same time since the 2003 model. The navigation option comes with a rear view video camera since the 2003 model. Since 2005, the navigation system featured information from Zagat about restaurants and other points of interest. The 2003 model was rated as Ultra Low Emission Vehicle. The United States Environmental Protection Agency estimates 23?mpg?US (10?L/100?km; 28?mpg?imp) highway and 17?mpg?US (14?L/100?km; 20?mpg?imp) city.\\r\\nIn the 2003 model, the engine was improved to produce 20?hp (15?kW) more power than the 2002 model and wheel designs were updated. The 2004 model received an additional 5?hp (4?kW). The 2004 model is credited for a top speed of 137?mph, and a 0-60 time of 7.1 seconds. The 2004 model features dual tail pipes instead of the single pipe in earlier models, side curtain airbags, new head lights and tail lights, and new wheels. Some chrome trimmings on the 2004 model use matte finish to distinguish from the polished shiny finish on earlier models. Little changed for the MDX during the 2006 model year with a few minor revisions to the vehicle's chrome and faux wood interior trim which could now be had with a dark grey wood (as opposed to reddish wood on earlier models), and also a black dash and steering wheel in tan interiors.\\r\\nOn April 11, 2006, Acura unveiled the 2007 Acura MD-X Concept during the New York International Auto Show, showing to the public an indication about the exterior styling of the upcoming completely redesigned MDX. The second-generation MDX was released on October 17, 2006 in the U.S.\\r\\nThe second generation model's body has a wider track and longer wheelbase than the previous MDX, but visibility to the rear has worsened from the prior generation. The redesigned Acura MDX's unit-body was engineered with Honda's Advanced Compatibility Engineering (ACE) body structure designed to absorb energy from a collision. The suspension was tuned at Germany's Nrburgring race track. The engine was upgraded to a 3.7 liter V6 tuned for 300?hp (224?kW) at 6,000?rpm and 270?lb?ft (366?N?m) of torque at 5,000?rpm. It accelerates from 0-60?mph in 6.5 seconds and is estimated by the EPA to consume 16 miles per US gallon (15?L/100?km; 19?mpg?imp) in the city and 21 miles per US gallon (11?L/100?km; 25?mpg?imp) on the highway. It is one of the most powerful engines Honda has produced to date. The \\"VTM-4\\" all-wheel drive system on the previous generation was replaced by the new SH-AWD \\"Super Handling All-Wheel Drive\\" previously debuted on the 2005 Acura RL. This AWD system is one of the most advanced in its class, featuring an active rear differential often found on high performance cars. The MDX is able to tow 5,000?lb (2,300?kg).[9]\\r\\nLike all Acuras, the MDX comes with a high level of standard equipment, including a power moonroof, leather interior, and high intensity discharge (Xenon) low beam headlights. For the 2007 through 2009 model years, three option packages were available: Sport, Technology and Entertainment.\\r\\nAll Canadian Acura MDX models, aside from the heated front seats, also get the second-row heated outboard seats as standard equipment as well. A feature unique to Canadian MDX models are headlight washers. In terms of packages, Canadian MDX models get only two: Technology and Elite. The Technology package corresponds essentially to the US model's Technology package while the Elite package is an amalgamation of the US model's Sport and Entertainment packages. However, AcuraLink real-time traffic reporting through XM NavTraffic is unavailable for Canadian MDX models.\\r\\nLike the first generation model, the new generation is manufactured exclusively by Honda of Canada Manufacturing Ltd. in Alliston, Ontario, Canada. But along with the 2007 RDX, the new MDX was the first Acura model to pass the Acura Quality Line, a special quality control and verification process separate from the other Honda vehicles.\\r\\nFor 2008 the MDX received a new auto-dimming rearview mirror. The 2009 MDX had added more upgrades to the navigation system and there are two new colors added. The power tailgate, previously available only with the Entertainment package, is now included with Technology and Sport packages.\\r\\nIn 2010, the MDX received a facelift adopting to Acura's new \\"Power Plenum\\" grille that debuted on its 2009 model year sedans. The most important upgrades to the 2010 model where a new paddle shift 6-speed SportShift automatic transmission with downshift Rev-matching, and an increased in compression ratio to 11.2:1 with forged aluminum pistons to replace the previous 2007-2009 3.7L's 11.0:1 pistons. An Advance package became available that included Adaptive Cruise Control, blind spot monitor, Active Damper Suspension, Collision mitigation braking system, wider 7-spoked 19?inch wheels and tires, Premium Milano leather ventilated seats and auto leveling headlights. Non-navigation equipped MDX models now have a rear view camera monitor located in the rear view mirror.\\r\\nThe redesigned MDX overtook the TL as Acura's top seller in the United States.[10]\\r\\nThe 2014 MDX Prototype was unveiled at the 2013 North American International Auto Show,[11][12] the production version was revealed at the New York Auto Show. Production began on May 2, 2013; vehicle assembly shifted from Ontario, Canada to Lincoln, Alabama. US sales began on June 20.\\r\\nThe MDX is now powered by a 3.5-liter direct injected Earth Dreams V6 with Variable Cylinder Management. A front-wheel drive (FWD) model is available for the first time in the United States,[13] but not in Canada, where all-wheel drive is the only configuration offered. EPA-estimated fuel economy is improved with all-wheel drive (SH-AWD) models rated at 18/27/21 mpg (city/highway/combined) and FWD models rated at 20/28/23 mpg.\\r\\nThe interior reduced button clutter by adding a 7-inch touchscreen with haptic feedback, an additional 8-inch screen is also standard. To reduce interior noise an acoustic (PVB layered) windshield, acoustic front door glass and thicker rear glass are used as well as triple sealed door openings. Advance package models include further noise reduction using a thicker carpet base layer and front fender liners.[14] The seating H-point has been reduced and the steering gear ratio is 9% quicker for a more sporty feel. The MDX rides lower reducing its center of gravity.\\r\\nAccording to Acura the exterior is more aerodynamic reducing drag by 16% with the new model lapping Nrburgring 8 seconds faster than its predecessor. The headlights are Acura's Jewel Eye LED Headlights (first introduced on the RLX).[15] Each headlamp uses five separate LED sources with three used for low-beam lighting and two for high-beam lighting. LED bumper mounted fog lamps are offered as a dealer installed option.\\r\\nStructure rigidity is improved and weight reduced through increased use of high-strength steel. Overall, 64% of the total vehicle body mass is high strength steel (HSS), aluminum and magnesium. HSS makes up 59% of vehicle body mass; 1,500?MPa yield strength steel makes up 7%. A single ring-like hot stamped HSS component reinforces the A-pillar, roof rail, B-pillar, and lower floor rail encircling the front doors for improved crash protection. Acura states that after conducting a simulated IIHS 25% small offset frontal crash test the front doors will open with normal force.[16][17]\\r\\nIn terms of safety the MDX adds a standard driver's knee airbag, optional Lane Keeping Assist System and Collision Mitigation Braking System. The Adaptive Cruise Control now comes with stop and go functionality.\\r\\nA refreshed for 2017 model year MDX went on sale on June 22, 2016[21], and features a diamond pentagon front grille which debuted on the Acura Precision Concept, redesigned LED headlamps with automatic on/off high beams, LED DRL light pipe and LED amber light pipe turn signals. All MDX models will come standard with AcuraWatch which includes forward collision warning (with automatic emergency braking), lane departure warning (with lane keep assist), and Adaptive Cruise Control.\\r\\nA 3.0-liter V6, 7-speed dual-clutch hybrid was added to the lineup, the rear wheels are powered by twin electric motors and lithium-ion battery, and the hybrid is only available in all-wheel drive, while the regular variant of the 2017 Acura MDX began sales in Summer 2016, the hybrid will debut and begin sales in Spring 2017 (April 2017).\\r\\nAs part of 2014 Acura MDX launch in the United States, a campaign called 'The Extremely New MDX - Made for Mankind' was produced. The campaign highlights the complete technical transformation of the MDX and centers around the idea of \\"Made for Mankind,\\" a concept designed to highlight the unique engineering and design philosophy at the heart of all Acura vehicles - the synergy between man and machine. The campaign was developed by Mullen (Boston and LA) and with MediaVest.[22] Also, a series of 8 comedic commercials were created with comedian Jerry Seinfeld and director Barry Sonnenfeld. In addition, Acura became an exclusive sponsor of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.[23]","input":"Is the acura mdx a suv or crossover?"},{"output":"October 28, 2009","context":"Naruto: Shippuden is an anime series adapted from Part II of Masashi Kishimoto's manga series, with exactly 500 episodes.

It was set in the 1870s and 1880s in the fictional town of North Fork, New Mexico Territory. The show was filmed in black and white, in half-hour episodes. The Rifleman aired on ABC from September 30, 1958, to April 8, 1963, as a production of Four Star Television. It was one of the first prime time series on American television to show a widowed parent raising a child.\\r\\nThe program was titled to reflect McCain's use of a Winchester rifle, customized to allow repeated firing by cycling its lever action. He demonstrated this technique in the opening credits of every episode, as well as a second modification that allowed him to cycle the action with one hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series centers on Lucas McCain, a Union Civil War veteran and widower. McCain had been a lieutenant in the 11th Indiana Infantry Regiment, and he had received a battlefield commission at the Battle of Five Forks just before the end of the war.[2] Having previously been a homesteader, McCain buys a ranch outside the fictitious town of North Fork, New Mexico Territory, in the pilot episode. He and his son Mark had come from Enid, Oklahoma, following the death of his wife when his son was six years old.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe series was set during the 1880s; a wooden plaque next to the McCain home states that the home was rebuilt by Lucas McCain and his son Mark in August 1881.[3]\\r\\nA common thread in the series is that people deserve a second chance; Marshal Micah Torrance is a recovering alcoholic, and McCain gives a convict a job on his ranch in \\"The Marshal\\". Royal Dano appeared in \\"The Sheridan Story\\" as a former Confederate soldier who is given a job on the McCain ranch and encounters General Philip Sheridan, the man who cost him his arm in battle. Learning why the man wants him dead, Sheridan arranges for medical care for his wounded former foe, quoting Abraham Lincoln's last orders to \\"... bind up the nation's wounds\\".[4]\\r\\nMcCain has human foibles. In \\"Death Trap\\", an episode with Philip Carey as former gunman (and old adversary) Simon Battles, he is unwilling to believe the man has changed and become a doctor. It takes a gunfight (with Battles fighting alongside him) to make him admit he is wrong. In \\"Two Ounces Of Tin\\", with Sammy Davis Jr. as Tip Corey (a former circus trick-shot artist turned gunman), McCain angrily orders him off the ranch when he finds him demonstrating his skills to Mark. Corey suggests he is a hypocrite, because McCain has an equally deadly reputation in the Indian Territory of Oklahoma, where he first acquired the nickname \\"the Rifleman\\", and where his wife had died in a smallpox epidemic.[citation needed]\\r\\nSeven actors played the town doctor during the series (usually known as \\"Doc Burrage\\"): Edgar Buchanan, Fay Roope, Rhys Williams, Jack Kruschen, Robert Burton, Ralph Moody and Bert Stevens. Several actors also played blacksmith Nels Swenson.\\r\\nMore than 500 actors made guest appearances in more than 970 credited roles during the five-year run of the series.[5] Guest stars included veteran actors: John Anderson, Richard Anderson, Whit Bissell, John Carradine, Lon Chaney, Jr., Ellen Corby, Sammy Davis, Jr., John Dehner, Jack Elam, Med Flory, Dabbs Greer, Rodolfo Hoyos, Jr., L.Q. Jones, John Milford, Rex Holman, Agnes Moorehead, Denver Pyle, Lee Van Cleef, and Adam West, most appearing multiple times in different roles. Several then-newcomers also appeared in the series, including Claude Akins, James Coburn (credited as \\"Jim\\") Mark Goddard, Dan Blocker, Dennis Hopper, Michael Landon, Warren Oates, Harry Dean Stanton, Robert Vaughn, Robert Culp, Martin Landau, and Richard Kiel. Notable people in other fields also made cameo appearances such as future baseball Hall of Famers Duke Snider and Don Drysdale, comedian Buddy Hackett and writer, director and producer Paul Mazursky.[5]\\r\\nThe series was created by Arnold Laven and developed by Sam Peckinpah, who would become a director of Western movies. Peckinpah, who wrote and directed many early episodes, based many characters and plots on his own childhood on a ranch. His insistence on violent realism and complex characterizations, as well as his refusal to sugarcoat the lessons he felt the Rifleman's son needed to learn about life, put him at odds with the show's producers at Four Star. Peckinpah left the show and created a short-lived series, The Westerner, with Brian Keith.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe opening theme at the beginning of each episode depicted McCain walking down the street of a town while rapid-firing his Winchester 44-40 1892 model rifle that had been modified at the trigger and lever. The rifle's modification allowed McCain to fire the rifle only by hand pumping the lever, which had a pin imbedded in it to trip the weapon's trigger.[6] At various points during the series, episodes would show McCain deftly handling and shooting the rifle ambidextrously.[7]\\r\\nWesterns were popular when The Rifleman premiered, and producers tried to find gimmicks to distinguish one show from another. The Rifleman's gimmick was a modified Winchester Model 1892 rifle, with a large ring lever drilled and tapped for a set screw. The lever design allowed him to cock the rifle by spinning it around his hand. In addition, the screw could be positioned to depress the trigger every time he worked the lever, allowing for rapid fire, emptying the magazine in under five seconds during the opening credits on North Fork's main street.\\r\\nThe #8-32 UNC trigger-trip screw pin was used in two configurations: with the screw head turned inside (close to the trigger) or, more often, outside the trigger guard with a locknut on the outside (to secure its position). In some episodes, the screw was removed, when rapid-fire action was not required. When properly adjusted, the screw squeezed the trigger when the lever was fully closed. The rapid-fire mechanism was originally designed to keep Connors from puncturing his finger with the trigger as he quickly cycled the action of the rifle. With this modification, it was not necessary for Connors to pull the trigger for each shot and therefore he did not have to place his finger in harm's way.\\r\\nThe rifle may have appeared in every episode, but it was not always fired; some plots did not require violent solutions (for example, one involving Mark's rigid new teacher). McCain attempts to solve as many problems as possible without resorting to shooting, yet still manages to kill 120 villains over the show's five-year run. It is notable that McCain almost never carried a pistol.\\r\\nThe rifle was an anachronism, as the show was set 12 years before John Browning designed any such rifle.\\r\\nThe rifle used on the set of The Rifleman, an 1892 Winchester caliber .44-40 carbine with a standard 20-inch barrel, appeared with two different types of lever. The backwards, round-D-style loop was used in the early episodes. Sometimes the rifle McCain uses has a saddle ring (the purpose of this ring is to allow the rider to tie the gun with a lanyard, to secure it in the scabbard). The lever style later changed to a flatter lever (instead of the large loop) with no saddle ring.\\r\\nMcCain fires 12 shots from his rifle during the opening credits: seven shots in the first close-up and five more as the camera switches to another view. The blank cartridges are shorter than standard cartridges, so the magazine will hold more of the blanks. The soundtrack contained a dubbed 13th shot, to allow the firing to end with a section of the theme music. The rifle was chambered for the .44/40 W.C.F. (Winchester Center Fire) cartridge, which was used in both revolvers and rifles.[8] He could supposedly fire off his first round in three-tenths of a second, which certainly helped in a showdown.\\r\\nGunsmith James S. Stembridge modified two Model 1892s for use in regular and close-up filming.[9] In addition, a Spanish-made Grate y Anit~a \\"El Tigre\\" lever action, a near-copy of the Model 1892, was modified for use as a knockabout gun. The El Tigre is seen in scenes where the rifle is in a saddle scabbard and is not drawn; and in stunts where the rifle was thrown to the ground, used as a club, or in any stunt where there was the possibility of damage to the original Winchester 1892s.[10] These three rifles were the only ones used by Connors during the run of the series.\\r\\nThe now-defunct Stembridge Gunsmiths provided the rifles and ammunition. Ammunition was quarter-load 5-in-1 blank cartridges containing smokeless powder, which did not produce the thick clouds of smoke the genuine black powder cartridges of the 1880s did. Most (if not all) of the sound effects for the rifle shots were dubbed, which is why the rifle sounded so different from the other gunshots on the show.\\r\\nThe 1892 Winchester is a top-eject rifle (opening the action by pushing the finger-lever forward moves the bolt rearward and thereby opens the top of the receiver). Loaded rounds or empty cases from the chamber eject straight up when the lever is pushed fully open (forward). When Connors cycled the action by spinning the rifle to his side, the cartridge in the action could fall out. Therefore, the rifle was modified with a plunger, which would hold the round in place.\\r\\nThe Winchester Model 1892 rifle was designed by John Moses Browning and, other than general appearance, it has nothing in common with earlier lever-action rifles using the same class of cartridges. The significant improvement was the addition of vertical lugs that securely lock the bolt and receiver when the gun fires. Winchester originally produced this gun from 1892 to 1941; total production was slightly over 1,000,000. 27 variations in five chamberings were made over the course of production, but the basic design was largely unaltered. As with the earlier Model 1873, the light and handy Model 1892 was chambered for handgun cartridges, favored by many Westerners to simplify ammunition supply problems by using the same cartridge in both a handgun and a rifle. The Model 1892 was replaced by the Browning-designed Model 1894, which also had an impressive manufacturing history, with over 7,000,000 produced; it is still being produced to this day by a successor to Winchester. The Model 94's popularity and long production history may be related to its being the first Winchester to be designed for the then-new \\"smokeless\\" powder.\\r\\nThe pilot episode, \\"The Sharpshooter\\", was originally telecast on CBS as part of Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre on March 7, 1958; it was repeated (in edited form) as the first episode of the series on ABC. The episode was written by Sam Peckinpah, and guest starred Dennis Hopper.\\r\\nRegulars on the program included Marshal Micah Torrance (R. G. Armstrong was the original marshal for two episodes, the first and the fourth), Sweeney the bartender (Bill Quinn), and a half-dozen other residents of North Fork (played by Hope Summers, Joan Taylor, Patricia Blair, John Harmon, and Harlan Warde).\\r\\nFifty-one episodes of the series were directed by Joseph H. Lewis (director of 1950s Gun Crazy and known for his film noir style). Ida Lupino directed one episode, \\"The Assault\\".\\r\\nConnors wrote several episodes. Robert Culp (of CBS's Trackdown, another Four Star-produced series), wrote one two-part episode, and Frank Gilroy wrote \\"End of a Young Gun\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nMPI Home Video has released The Rifleman on DVD in Region 1 in a number of versions. It has released single-disc DVDs with five episodes; from 2002ÿ2006 it released six sets, each with 20 episodes. The releases are random collections of episodes, rather than the original broadcast order. These releases are out of print, since MPI Home Video no longer owns the rights to the series. Levy-Gardner-Laven Productions, the original producer, is again the sole copyright owner of The Rifleman series.[12]\\r\\nIn late 2013, Levy-Gardner-Laven Productions, Inc. announced it would be the only authorized outlet to offer for the very first time all 168 episodes of The Rifleman, the original series, newly restored and assembled in DVD box sets. The episodes will be released in sequential order, by season, in high quality boxed sets with exclusive special features. The first boxed set of all Season 1 episodes were made available on December 4, 2013 for $69.95.[13] The second season was released on November 28, 2014.[14] Season 3 was released on December 2, 2015.[15] Season 4 was released on December 4, 2016.[16][17] Season 5 was released on November 27, 2017.[18]\\r\\nThe February 17, 1959 episode of The Rifleman was a pilot for an NBC series, Law of the Plainsman, starring Michael Ansara as Marshal Sam Buckhart. In the episode \\"The Indian\\", Buckhart comes to North Fork to look for Indians suspected of murdering a Texas Ranger and his family.[19] He subsequently reappeared in \\"The Raid\\".\\r\\nChuck Connors briefly played the same character again in 1991's The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw, which featured a number of 1950s and 1960s television Western series leads reprising their roles in quick cameo appearances (Gene Barry as Bat Masterson, Hugh O'Brian as Wyatt Earp, Jack Kelly as Bart Maverick, Clint Walker as Cheyenne Bodie, David Carradine as Kung Fu's Caine).\\r\\nIn late 2011, CBS announced plans to remake the original Rifleman series.[20] Chris Columbus was slated to be the executive producer and direct, with Robert Levy, Steven Gardner, and Arthur Gardner (related to original producers Levy-Gardner-Laven) as executive producers.[21] The remake project was canceled a few months later, without a pilot episode being made.[22]\\r\\nThe TV show was also adapted into a comic book by Dan Spiegle, distributed by Dell Comics.[23]","input":"What kind of rifle did the rifleman carry?"},{"output":"Wisconsin","context":"","input":"What state is the green bay packers from?"},{"output":"Earth's interior","context":"Earth's magnetic field, also known as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65?microteslas (0.25 to 0.65?gauss).[3] Roughly speaking it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle at the center of the Earth. The North geomagnetic pole, located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole. Unlike a bar magnet, Earth's magnetic field changes over time because it is generated by a geodynamo (in Earth's case, the motion of molten iron alloys in its outer core).\\r\\nWhile the North and South magnetic poles are usually located near the geographic poles, they can wander widely over geological time scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary compasses to remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, the Earth's field reverses and the North and South Magnetic Poles relatively abruptly switch places. These reversals of the geomagnetic poles leave a record in rocks that are of value to paleomagnetists in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors in the process of plate tectonics.\\r\\nThe magnetosphere is the region above the ionosphere that is defined by the extent of the Earth's magnetic field in space. It extends several tens of thousands of kilometers into space, protecting the Earth from the charged particles of the solar wind and cosmic rays that would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere, including the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Earth's magnetic field serves to deflect most of the solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.[4] One stripping mechanism is for gas to be caught in bubbles of magnetic field, which are ripped off by solar winds.[5] Calculations of the loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars, resulting from scavenging of ions by the solar wind, indicate that the dissipation of the magnetic field of Mars caused a near total loss of its atmosphere.[6][7]\\r\\nThe study of past magnetic field of the Earth is known as paleomagnetism.[8] The polarity of the Earth's magnetic field is recorded in igneous rocks, and reversals of the field are thus detectable as \\"stripes\\" centered on mid-ocean ridges where the sea floor is spreading, while the stability of the geomagnetic poles between reversals has allowed paleomagnetists to track the past motion of continents. Reversals also provide the basis for magnetostratigraphy, a way of dating rocks and sediments.[9] The field also magnetizes the crust, and magnetic anomalies can be used to search for deposits of metal ores.[10]\\r\\nHumans have used compasses for direction finding since the 11th century A.D. and for navigation since the 12th century.[11] Although the magnetic declination does shift with time, this wandering is slow enough that a simple compass remains useful for navigation. Using magnetoception various other organisms, ranging from some types of bacteria to pigeons, use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and navigation.\\r\\nAt any location, the Earth's magnetic field can be represented by a three-dimensional vector. A typical procedure for measuring its direction is to use a compass to determine the direction of magnetic North. Its angle relative to true North is the declination (D) or variation. Facing magnetic North, the angle the field makes with the horizontal is the inclination (I) or magnetic dip. The intensity (F) of the field is proportional to the force it exerts on a magnet. Another common representation is in X (North), Y (East) and Z (Down) coordinates.[12]\\r\\nThe intensity of the field is often measured in gauss (G), but is generally reported in nanoteslas (nT), with 1?G = 100,000?nT. A nanotesla is also referred to as a gamma ().[13] The tesla is the SI unit of the Magnetic field, B. The Earth's field ranges between approximately 25,000 and 65,000?nT (0.25ÿ0.65?G). By comparison, a strong refrigerator magnet has a field of about 10,000,000 nanoteslas (100?G).[14]\\r\\nA map of intensity contours is called an isodynamic chart. As the World Magnetic Model shows, the intensity tends to decrease from the poles to the equator. A minimum intensity occurs in the South Atlantic Anomaly over South America while there are maxima over northern Canada, Siberia, and the coast of Antarctica south of Australia.[15]\\r\\nThe inclination is given by an angle that can assume values between -90 (up) to 90 (down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points downwards. It is straight down at the North Magnetic Pole and rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal (0) at the magnetic equator. It continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole. Inclination can be measured with a dip circle.\\r\\nAn isoclinic chart (map of inclination contours) for the Earth's magnetic field is shown below.\\r\\nDeclination is positive for an eastward deviation of the field relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/south heading on a compass with the direction of a celestial pole. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).\\r\\nComponents of the Earth's magnetic field at the surface from the World Magnetic Model for 2015.[15]\\r\\nIntensity\\r\\nInclination\\r\\nDeclination\\r\\nNear the surface of the Earth, its magnetic field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned at the center of the Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11 with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth.[13] The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole.[16] This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80ÿ90% of the field in most locations.[12]\\r\\nThe positions of the magnetic poles can be defined in at least two ways: locally or globally.[17]\\r\\nOne way to define a pole is as a point where the magnetic field is vertical.[18] This can be determined by measuring the inclination. The inclination of the Earth's field is 90 (downwards) at the North Magnetic Pole and -90 (upwards) at the South Magnetic Pole. The two poles wander independently of each other and are not directly opposite each other on the globe. They can migrate rapidly: movements of up to 40 kilometres (25?mi) per year have been observed for the North Magnetic Pole. Over the last 180 years, the North Magnetic Pole has been migrating northwestward, from Cape Adelaide in the Boothia Peninsula in 1831 to 600 kilometres (370?mi) from Resolute Bay in 2001.[19] The magnetic equator is the line where the inclination is zero (the magnetic field is horizontal).\\r\\nThe global definition of the Earth's field is based on a mathematical model. If a line is drawn through the center of the Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant non-dipolar contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.\\r\\nEarth's magnetic field, predominantly dipolar at its surface, is distorted further out by the solar wind. This is a stream of charged particles leaving the Sun's corona and accelerating to a speed of 200 to 1000?kilometres per second. They carry with them a magnetic field, the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).[20]\\r\\nThe solar wind exerts a pressure, and if it could reach Earth's atmosphere it would erode it. However, it is kept away by the pressure of the Earth's magnetic field. The magnetopause, the area where the pressures balance, is the boundary of the magnetosphere. Despite its name, the magnetosphere is asymmetric, with the sunward side being about 10?Earth radii out but the other side stretching out in a magnetotail that extends beyond 200?Earth radii.[21] Sunward of the magnetopause is the bow shock, the area where the solar wind slows abruptly.[20]\\r\\nInside the magnetosphere is the plasmasphere, a donut-shaped region containing low-energy charged particles, or plasma. This region begins at a height of 60?km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth.[21] There are also two concentric tire-shaped regions, called the Van Allen radiation belts, with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10?million electron volts (MeV)). The inner belt is 1ÿ2?Earth radii out while the outer belt is at 4ÿ7?Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.[22]\\r\\nAs well as deflecting the solar wind, the Earth's magnetic field deflects cosmic rays, high-energy charged particles that are mostly from outside the Solar system. (Many cosmic rays are kept out of the Solar system by the Sun's magnetosphere, or heliosphere.[23]) By contrast, astronauts on the Moon risk exposure to radiation. Anyone who had been on the Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.[20]\\r\\nSome of the charged particles do get into the magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing back and forth between the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a ring current. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface.[20] Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the aurorae and also emit X-rays.[21]\\r\\nThe varying conditions in the magnetosphere, known as space weather, are largely driven by solar activity. If the solar wind is weak, the magnetosphere expands; while if it is strong, it compresses the magnetosphere and more of it gets in. Periods of particularly intense activity, called geomagnetic storms, can occur when a coronal mass ejection erupts above the Sun and sends a shock wave through the Solar System. Such a wave can take just two days to reach the Earth. Geomagnetic storms can cause a lot of disruption; the \\"Halloween\\" storm of 2003 damaged more than a third of NASA's satellites. The largest documented storm occurred in 1859. It induced currents strong enough to short out telegraph lines, and aurorae were reported as far south as Hawaii.[20][24]\\r\\nThe geomagnetic field changes on time scales from milliseconds to millions of years. Shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the ionosphere (ionospheric dynamo region) and magnetosphere, and some changes can be traced to geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents. Changes over time scales of a year or more mostly reflect changes in the Earth's interior, particularly the iron-rich core.[12]\\r\\nFrequently, the Earth's magnetosphere is hit by solar flares causing geomagnetic storms, provoking displays of aurorae. The short-term instability of the magnetic field is measured with the K-index.[25]\\r\\nData from THEMIS show that the magnetic field, which interacts with the solar wind, is reduced when the magnetic orientation is aligned between Sun and Earth ÿ opposite to the previous hypothesis. During forthcoming solar storms, this could result in blackouts and disruptions in artificial satellites.[26]\\r\\nChanges in Earth's magnetic field on a time scale of a year or more are referred to as secular variation. Over hundreds of years, magnetic declination is observed to vary over tens of degrees.[12] A movie on the right shows how global declinations have changed over the last few centuries.[27]\\r\\nThe direction and intensity of the dipole change over time. Over the last two centuries the dipole strength has been decreasing at a rate of about 6.3% per century.[12] At this rate of decrease, the field would be negligible in about 1600 years.[28] However, this strength is about average for the last 7 thousand years, and the current rate of change is not unusual.[29]\\r\\nA prominent feature in the non-dipolar part of the secular variation is a westward drift at a rate of about 0.2 degrees per year.[28] This drift is not the same everywhere and has varied over time. The globally averaged drift has been westward since about 1400 AD but eastward between about 1000 AD and 1400 AD.[30]\\r\\nChanges that predate magnetic observatories are recorded in archaeological and geological materials. Such changes are referred to as paleomagnetic secular variation or paleosecular variation (PSV). The records typically include long periods of small change with occasional large changes reflecting geomagnetic excursions and reversals.[31]\\r\\nAlthough generally Earth's field is approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly aligned with the rotational axis, occasionally the North and South geomagnetic poles trade places. Evidence for these geomagnetic reversals can be found in basalts, sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and seafloor magnetic anomalies.[32] Reversals occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals between reversals ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent geomagnetic reversal, called the BrunhesÿMatuyama reversal, occurred about 780,000 years ago.[19][33] A related phenomenon, a geomagnetic excursion, amounts to an incomplete reversal, with no change in polarity.[34][35] The Laschamp event is an example of an excursion, it having occurred during the last ice age (41,000 years ago).\\r\\nThe past magnetic field is recorded mostly by strongly magnetic minerals, particularly iron oxides such as magnetite, that can carry a permanent magnetic moment. This remanent magnetization, or remanence, can be acquired in more than one way. In lava flows, the direction of the field is \\"frozen\\" in small minerals as they cool, giving rise to a thermoremanent magnetization. In sediments, the orientation of magnetic particles acquires a slight bias towards the magnetic field as they are deposited on an ocean floor or lake bottom. This is called detrital remanent magnetization.[8]\\r\\nThermoremanent magnetization is the main source of the magnetic anomalies around ocean ridges. As the seafloor spreads, magma wells up from the mantle, cools to form new basaltic crust on both sides of the ridge, and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean floor below. This provides information on the rate at which seafloor has spread in the past.[8]\\r\\nRadiometric dating of lava flows has been used to establish a geomagnetic polarity time scale, part of which is shown in the image. This forms the basis of magnetostratigraphy, a geophysical correlation technique that can be used to date both sedimentary and volcanic sequences as well as the seafloor magnetic anomalies.[8]\\r\\nStudies of lava flows on Steens Mountain, Oregon, indicate that the magnetic field could have shifted at a rate of up to 6 degrees per day at some time in Earth's history, which significantly challenges the popular understanding of how the Earth's magnetic field works.[36] This finding was later attributed to unusual rock magnetic properties of the lava flow under study, not rapid field change, by one of the original authors of the 1995 study.[37]\\r\\nTemporary dipole tilt variations that take the dipole axis across the equator and then back to the original polarity are known as excursions.[35]\\r\\nPaleomagnetic studies of Paleoarchean lava in Australia and conglomerate in South Africa have concluded that the magnetic field has been present since at least about 3,450?million years ago.[38][39][40]\\r\\nAt present, the overall geomagnetic field is becoming weaker; the present strong deterioration corresponds to a 10ÿ15% decline over the last 150 years and has accelerated in the past several years; geomagnetic intensity has declined almost continuously from a maximum 35% above the modern value achieved approximately 2,000 years ago. The rate of decrease and the current strength are within the normal range of variation, as shown by the record of past magnetic fields recorded in rocks.\\r\\nThe nature of Earth's magnetic field is one of heteroscedastic fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone up and down in the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.\\r\\nThe Earth's magnetic north pole is drifting from northern Canada towards Siberia with a presently accelerating rate10 kilometres (6.2?mi) per year at the beginning of the 20th century, up to 40 kilometres (25?mi) per year in 2003,[19] and since then has only accelerated.[41]\\r\\nThe Earth's magnetic field is believed to be generated by electric currents in the conductive material of its core, created by convection currents due to heat escaping from the core. However the process is complex, and computer models that reproduce some of its features have only been developed in the last few decades.\\r\\nThe Earth and most of the planets in the Solar System, as well as the Sun and other stars, all generate magnetic fields through the motion of electrically conducting fluids.[43] The Earth's field originates in its core. This is a region of iron alloys extending to about 3400?km (the radius of the Earth is 6370?km). It is divided into a solid inner core, with a radius of 1220?km, and a liquid outer core.[44] The motion of the liquid in the outer core is driven by heat flow from the inner core, which is about 6,000?K (5,730?C; 10,340?F), to the core-mantle boundary, which is about 3,800?K (3,530?C; 6,380?F).[45] The pattern of flow is organized by the rotation of the Earth and the presence of the solid inner core.[46]\\r\\nThe mechanism by which the Earth generates a magnetic field is known as a dynamo.[43] The magnetic field is generated by a feedback loop: current loops generate magnetic fields (Ampre's circuital law); a changing magnetic field generates an electric field (Faraday's law); and the electric and magnetic fields exert a force on the charges that are flowing in currents (the Lorentz force).[47] These effects can be combined in a partial differential equation for the magnetic field called the magnetic induction equation:\\r\\n...where u is the velocity of the fluid; B is the magnetic B-field; and =1/ is the magnetic diffusivity, which is inversely proportional to the product of the electrical conductivity  and the permeability  .[48] The term ?B/?t is the time derivative of the field; ?2 is the Laplace operator and ?G is the curl operator.\\r\\nThe first term on the right hand side of the induction equation is a diffusion term. In a stationary fluid, the magnetic field declines and any concentrations of field spread out. If the Earth's dynamo shut off, the dipole part would disappear in a few tens of thousands of years.[48]\\r\\nIn a perfect conductor (\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\sigma =\\\\infty \\\\;}\\r\\n\\r\\n), there would be no diffusion. By Lenz's law, any change in the magnetic field would be immediately opposed by currents, so the flux through a given volume of fluid could not change. As the fluid moved, the magnetic field would go with it. The theorem describing this effect is called the frozen-in-field theorem. Even in a fluid with a finite conductivity, new field is generated by stretching field lines as the fluid moves in ways that deform it. This process could go on generating new field indefinitely, were it not that as the magnetic field increases in strength, it resists fluid motion.[48]\\r\\nThe motion of the fluid is sustained by convection, motion driven by buoyancy. The temperature increases towards the center of the Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called compositional convection. A Coriolis effect, caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north-south polar axis.[46][48]\\r\\nA dynamo can amplify a magnetic field, but it needs a \\"seed\\" field to get it started.[48] For the Earth, this could have been an external magnetic field. Early in its history the Sun went through a T-Tauri phase in which the solar wind would have had a magnetic field orders of magnitude larger than the present solar wind.[49] However, much of the field may have been screened out by the Earth's mantle. An alternative source is currents in the core-mantle boundary driven by chemical reactions or variations in thermal or electric conductivity. Such effects may still provide a small bias that are part of the boundary conditions for the geodynamo.[50]\\r\\nThe average magnetic field in the Earth's outer core was calculated to be 25 gauss, 50 times stronger than the field at the surface.[51]\\r\\nSimulating the geodynamo requires numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of the Earth's interior. Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a 3D grid of points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the realism of the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were confined to creating kinematic dynamo computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and the effect on the magnetic field calculated. Kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and testing whether such geometries could sustain a dynamo.[52]\\r\\nThe first self-consistent dynamo models, ones that determine both the fluid motions and the magnetic field, were developed by two groups in 1995, one in Japan[53] and one in the United States.[1][54] The latter received attention because it successfully reproduced some of the characteristics of the Earth's field, including geomagnetic reversals.[52]\\r\\nElectric currents induced in the ionosphere generate magnetic fields (ionospheric dynamo region). Such a field is always generated near where the atmosphere is closest to the Sun, causing daily alterations that can deflect surface magnetic fields by as much as one degree. Typical daily variations of field strength are about 25 nanoteslas (nT) (one part in 2000), with variations over a few seconds of typically around 1 nT (one part in 50,000).[55]\\r\\nThe Earth's magnetic field strength was measured by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1832[56] and has been repeatedly measured since then, showing a relative decay of about 10% over the last 150 years.[57] The Magsat satellite and later satellites have used 3-axis vector magnetometers to probe the 3-D structure of the Earth's magnetic field. The later ?rsted satellite allowed a comparison indicating a dynamic geodynamo in action that appears to be giving rise to an alternate pole under the Atlantic Ocean west of S. Africa.[58]\\r\\nGovernments sometimes operate units that specialize in measurement of the Earth's magnetic field. These are geomagnetic observatories, typically part of a national Geological survey, for example the British Geological Survey's Eskdalemuir Observatory. Such observatories can measure and forecast magnetic conditions such as magnetic storms that sometimes affect communications, electric power, and other human activities.\\r\\nThe International Real-time Magnetic Observatory Network, with over 100 interlinked geomagnetic observatories around the world has been recording the earths magnetic field since 1991.\\r\\nThe military determines local geomagnetic field characteristics, in order to detect anomalies in the natural background that might be caused by a significant metallic object such as a submerged submarine. Typically, these magnetic anomaly detectors are flown in aircraft like the UK's Nimrod or towed as an instrument or an array of instruments from surface ships.\\r\\nCommercially, geophysical prospecting companies also use magnetic detectors to identify naturally occurring anomalies from ore bodies, such as the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly.\\r\\nMagnetometers detect minute deviations in the Earth's magnetic field caused by iron artifacts, kilns, some types of stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines,[60] the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt  the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor[61]  contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners as early as the late 18th century.[62] More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.[62]\\r\\nEach measurement of the magnetic field is at a particular place and time. If an accurate estimate of the field at some other place and time is needed, the measurements must be converted to a model and the model used to make predictions.\\r\\nThe most common way of analyzing the global variations in the Earth's magnetic field is to fit the measurements to a set of spherical harmonics. This was first done by Carl Friedrich Gauss.[63] Spherical harmonics are functions that oscillate over the surface of a sphere. They are the product of two functions, one that depends on latitude and one on longitude. The function of longitude is zero along zero or more great circles passing through the North and South Poles; the number of such nodal lines is the absolute value of the order m. The function of latitude is zero along zero or more latitude circles; this plus the order is equal to the degree ?. Each harmonic is equivalent to a particular arrangement of magnetic charges at the center of the Earth. A monopole is an isolated magnetic charge, which has never been observed. A dipole is equivalent to two opposing charges brought close together and a quadrupole to two dipoles brought together. A quadrupole field is shown in the lower figure on the right.[12]\\r\\nSpherical harmonics can represent any scalar field (function of position) that satisfies certain properties. A magnetic field is a vector field, but if it is expressed in Cartesian components X, Y, Z, each component is the derivative of the same scalar function called the magnetic potential. Analyses of the Earth's magnetic field use a modified version of the usual spherical harmonics that differ by a multiplicative factor. A least-squares fit to the magnetic field measurements gives the Earth's field as the sum of spherical harmonics, each multiplied by the best-fitting Gauss coefficient gm? or hm?.[12]\\r\\nThe lowest-degree Gauss coefficient, g00, gives the contribution of an isolated magnetic charge, so it is zero. The next three coefficients ÿ g10, g11, and h11 ÿ determine the direction and magnitude of the dipole contribution. The best fitting dipole is tilted at an angle of about 10 with respect to the rotational axis, as described earlier.[12]\\r\\nSpherical harmonic analysis can be used to distinguish internal from external sources if measurements are available at more than one height (for example, ground observatories and satellites). In that case, each term with coefficient gm? or hm? can be split into two terms: one that decreases with radius as 1/r?+1 and one that increases with radius as r?. The increasing terms fit the external sources (currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere). However, averaged over a few years the external contributions average to zero.[12]\\r\\nThe remaining terms predict that the potential of a dipole source (?=1) drops off as 1/r2. The magnetic field, being a derivative of the potential, drops off as 1/r3. Quadrupole terms drop off as 1/r4, and higher order terms drop off increasingly rapidly with the radius. The radius of the outer core is about half of the radius of the Earth. If the field at the core-mantle boundary is fit to spherical harmonics, the dipole part is smaller by a factor of about 8 at the surface, the quadrupole part by a factor of 16, and so on. Thus, only the components with large wavelengths can be noticeable at the surface. From a variety of arguments, it is usually assumed that only terms up to degree 14 or less have their origin in the core. These have wavelengths of about 2,000 kilometres (1,200?mi) or less. Smaller features are attributed to crustal anomalies.[12]\\r\\nThe International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy maintains a standard global field model called the International Geomagnetic Reference Field. It is updated every 5 years. The 11th-generation model, IGRF11, was developed using data from satellites (?rsted, CHAMP and SAC-C) and a world network of geomagnetic observatories.[64] The spherical harmonic expansion was truncated at degree 10, with 120 coefficients, until 2000. Subsequent models are truncated at degree 13 (195 coefficients).[65]\\r\\nAnother global field model, called World Magnetic Model, is produced jointly by the United States National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly the National Geophysical Data Center) and the British Geological Survey. This model truncates at degree 12 (168 coefficients) with an approximate spatial resolution of 3,000 kilometers. It is the model used by the United States Department of Defense, the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom), the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the International Hydrographic Office as well as in many civilian navigation systems.[66]\\r\\nA third model, produced by the Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA and GSFC) and the Danish Space Research Institute, uses a \\"comprehensive modeling\\" approach that attempts to reconcile data with greatly varying temporal and spatial resolution from ground and satellite sources.[67]\\r\\nFor users with higher accuracy needs, the United States National Centers for Environmental Information developed the Enhanced Magnetic Model (EMM), which extends to degree and order 720 and resolves magnetic anomalies down to a wavelength of 56 kilometers. It was compiled from satellite, marine, aeromagnetic and ground magnetic surveys. The latest version, EMM2015, includes data from The European Space Agency's Swarm satellite mission.[68]\\r\\nAnimals including birds and turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field, and use the field to navigate during migration.[69] Some researchers have found that cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north-south while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible.[70][71] Other researchers reported in 2011 that they could not replicate those findings using different Google Earth images.[72]\\r\\nResearchers found out that very weak electromagnetic fields disrupt the magnetic compass used by European robins and other songbirds to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field. Neither power lines nor cellphone signals are to blame for the electromagnetic field effect on the birds, according to the new study published in the 8 May 2014 edition of the journal Nature. Instead, the culprits consist of frequencies between 2?kHz and 5?MHz, such as AM radio signals and ordinary electronic equipment that might be found in businesses or private homes.[73]","input":"Where does the earth's magnetic field originate?"},{"output":"Spain","context":"The potato was first domesticated in the region of modern-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia[1] between 8000 and 5000 BC.[2] It has since spread around the world and become a staple crop in many countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCultivation of potatoes in South America may go back 10,000 years,[3] yet the tubers do not preserve well in archaeological record, and there are problems with exact identification of those that are found.\\r\\nThe earliest archaeologically verified potato tuber remains have been found at the coastal site of Anc܇n (central Peru), dating to 2500 BC.[4] Potatoes dating to about 2000 BC have been found at Huaynuma, in the Casma Valley of Peru,[5] and early potatoes dating to 800-500 BC were also uncovered at the Altiplano site of Chiripa on the east side of Lake Titicaca.[6][7]\\r\\nIn the Altiplano, potatoes provided the principal energy source for the Inca Empire, its predecessors, and its Spanish successor. In Bolivia and Peru above 10,000?feet altitude, tubers exposed to the cold night air turned into chu?o;[8] when kept in permanently frozen underground storehouses, chu?o can be stored for years with no loss of nutritional value. The Spanish fed chu?o to the silver miners who produced vast wealth in the 16th century for the Spanish government.[2]\\r\\nPotato was the staple food of most Pre?Columbian Mapuches, \\"specially in the southern and coastal [Mapuche] territories where maize did not reach maturity\\".[9]\\r\\nSailors returning from the Andes to Spain with silver presumably brought maize and potatoes for their own food on the trip.[10] Historians speculate that leftover tubers (and maize) were carried ashore and planted: \\"We think that the potato arrived some years before the end of the 16th century, by two different ports of entry: the first, logically, in Spain around 1570, and the second via the British Isles between 1588 and 1593 ... we find traces of the transport of potatoes travelling from the Canaries to Antwerp in 1567 ... we can say that the potato was introduced there [the Canary islands] from South America around 1562 ... the first written mention of the potato [is] ... a receipt for delivery dated 28 November 1567 between Las Palmas in the Grand Canaries and Antwerp.\\"[11] In 1553, in the book Cr܇nica del Peru, Pedro Cieza de Le܇n mentions he saw it in Quito, Popayn and Pasto in 1538. Basque fishermen from Spain used potatoes as ships' stores for their voyages across the Atlantic in the 16th century, and introduced the tuber to western Ireland, where they landed to dry their cod. The English privateer Sir Francis Drake, returning from his circumnavigation, or Sir Walter Raleigh's employee Thomas Harriot[12] are commonly credited with introducing potatoes into England. In 1588, botanist Carolus Clusius made a painting of what he called \\"Papas Peruanorum\\" from a specimen in the Low Countries; in 1601 he reported that potatoes were in common use in northern Italy for animal fodder and for human consumption.[13]\\r\\nThe Spanish had an empire across Europe, and brought potatoes for their armies. Peasants along the way adopted the crop, which was less often pillaged by marauding armies than above-ground stores of grain. Across most of Northern Europe, where open fields prevailed, potatoes were strictly confined to small garden plots because field agriculture was strictly governed by custom that prescribed seasonal rhythms for plowing, sowing, harvesting and grazing animals on fallow and stubble. This meant that potatoes were barred from large-scale cultivation because the rules allowed only grain to be planted in the open fields.[14] In France and Germany government officials and noble landowners promoted the rapid conversion of fallow land into potato fields after 1750. The potato thus became an important staple crop in northern Europe. Famines in the early 1770s contributed to its acceptance, as did government policies in several European countries and climate change during the Little Ice Age, when traditional crops in this region did not produce as reliably as before.[15][16] At times and places when and where most other crops failed, potatoes could still typically be relied upon to contribute adequately to food supplies during colder years.[17]\\r\\nIn France, at the end of the 16th century, the potato had been introduced to the Franche-Comt, the Vosges of Lorraine and Alsace. By the end of the 18th century it was written in the 1785 edition of Bon Jardinier: \\"There is no vegetable about which so much has been written and so much enthusiasm has been shown ... The poor should be quite content with this foodstuff.\\"[18] It had widely replaced the turnip and rutabaga by the 19th century.[19]\\r\\nFrench physician Antoine Parmentier studied the potato intensely and in Examen chymique des pommes de terres (\\"Chemical examination of potatoes\\") (Paris, 1774) showed their enormous nutritional value. King Louis XVI and his court eagerly promoted the new crop, with Queen Marie Antoinette even wearing a headdress of potato flowers at a fancy dress ball. The annual potato crop of France soared to 21?million hectoliters[clarification needed] in 1815 and 117?million in 1840, allowing a concomitant growth in population while avoiding the Malthusian trap. Although potatoes had become widely familiar in Russia by 1800, they were confined to garden plots until the grain failure in 1838ÿ39 persuaded peasants and landlords in central and northern Russia to devote their fallow fields to raising potatoes. Potatoes yielded from two to four times more calories per acre than grain did, and eventually came to dominate the food supply in Eastern Europe. Boiled or baked potatoes were cheaper than rye bread, just as nutritious, and did not require a gristmill for grinding. On the other hand, cash-oriented landlords realised that grain was much easier to ship, store and sell, so both grain and potatoes coexisted.[20]\\r\\nThroughout Europe, the most important new food in the 19th century was the potato, which had three major advantages over other foods for the consumer: its lower rate of spoilage, its bulk (which easily satisfied hunger) and its cheapness. The crop slowly spread across Europe, such that, for example, by 1845 it occupied one-third of Irish arable land.[citation needed] Potatoes comprised about 10% of the caloric intake of Europeans.[citation needed] Along with several other foods that either originated in the Americas or were successfully grown or harvested there, potatoes sustained European populations.[21]\\r\\nIn Britain, the potato promoted economic development by underpinning the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. It served as a cheap source of calories and nutrients that was easy for urban workers to cultivate on small backyard plots. Potatoes became popular in the north of England, where coal was readily available, so a potato-driven population boom provided ample workers for the new factories. Marxist Friedrich Engels even declared that the potato was the equal of iron for its \\"historically revolutionary role\\".[13] The Dutch potato-starch industry grew rapidly in the 19th century, especially under the leadership of entrepreneur Willem Albert Scholten (1819ÿ92).[22]\\r\\nIn Ireland, the expansion of potato cultivation was due entirely to the landless labourers, renting tiny plots from landowners who were interested only in raising cattle or in producing grain for market. A single acre of potatoes and the milk of a single cow was enough to feed a whole Irish family a monotonous but nutritionally adequate diet for a healthy, vigorous (and desperately poor) rural population. Often even poor families grew enough extra potatoes to feed a pig that they could sell for cash.[23]\\r\\nA lack of genetic diversity from the low number of varieties left the crop vulnerable to disease. In the early 1800s, a strain of potato blight (Phytophthora infestans) known as HERB-1 began to spread in the Americas, especially Central and North America destroying many crops. The blight spread to Europe in the 1840s where, because of an extreme lack of genetic diversity, the potato crops were even more susceptible. In Northern Europe there were major crop losses lasting throughout the rest of the 19th century. Ireland in particular, because of the extreme dependence of the poor, especially western Ireland, on this single staple crop, was devastated by the blight's arrival in 1845.[24][25]\\r\\nThe Lumper potato, widely cultivated in western and southern Ireland before and during the Great Famine, was bland, wet and poorly resistant to the potato blight, but yielded large crops and usually provided adequate calories for peasants and labourers. Heavy dependence on this potato led to disaster when the blight quickly turned harvest-ready and newly harvested potatoes into a putrid mush. The Irish Famine in the western and southern parts of Ireland between 1845ÿ49 was a catastrophic failure in the food supply that led to approximately a million deaths from famine and (especially) diseases that attacked weakened bodies, and to massive emigration to Britain, the U.S., Canada and elsewhere.[26] During the famine years roughly one million Irish emigrated; this tide was not turned until the 20th century, when Ireland's population stood at less than half of the pre-famine level of 8 million.\\r\\nIt is generally believed that potatoes entered Africa with colonists, who consumed them as a vegetable rather than as a staple starch.[27] Shipping records from 1567 show that the first place outside of Central and South America where potatoes were grown were the Canary Islands.[28] As in other continents, despite its advantages as an anti-famine, high-elevation alternative to grain, potatoes were first resisted by local farmers who believed they were poisonous. Colonialists also promoted them as a low cost food and so it was a symbol of domination. In former European colonies of Africa, potatoes were initially consumed only occasionally, but increased production made them a staple in certain areas. Potatoes tended to become more popular in wartime due to their being able to be stored in the ground. It was well established as a crop by the mid-20th century [16] and in present-day Africa they have become a vegetable or co-staple crop.[27]\\r\\nIn higher regions of Rwanda, potatoes have become a new staple food crop. Prior to the 1994 Rwandan genocide, consumption was as high as 153 to 200?kg per year ÿ higher than in any Western European country. Recently farmers have developed the potato as a cash crop after introducing several new varieties brought back by migrant laborers from Uganda and other varieties from Kenya.[27]\\r\\nThe potato diffused widely after 1600, becoming a major food resource in Europe and East Asia. Following its introduction into China toward the end of the Ming dynasty, the potato immediately became a delicacy of the imperial family. After the middle period of the Qianlong era (1735ÿ96) in the Qing dynasty, population increases and a subsequent need to increase grain yields coupled with greater peasant geographic mobility led to the rapid spread of potato cultivation throughout China, and it was acclimated to local natural conditions.\\r\\nBoomgaard (2003) looks at the adoption of various root and tuber crops in Indonesia throughout the colonial period and examines the chronology and reasons for progressive adoption of foreign crops: sweet potato, Irish potato, bengkuang (yam beans), and cassava.\\r\\nEdward Terry mentioned the potato in his travel accounts of the banquet at Ajmer by Asaph Khan to Sir Thomas Roe, the British Ambassador in 1675. It is the earliest mention in history of India[clarification needed]. The vegetables gardens of Surat and Karnataka had potatoes as mentioned in Fyer's travel record of 1675. The Portuguese introduced potatoes, which they called 'Batata', to India in the early seventeenth century when they cultivated it along the western coast. British traders introduced potatoes to Bengal as a root crop, 'Alu'. By the end of the 18th century, it was cultivated across northern hill areas of India.[16] Potatoes were introduced to Tibet by the 19th century through trade route from India.[29]\\r\\nThe potato was introduced to the Philippines during the late 16th century, and to Java and China during the 17th century.[citation needed]\\r\\nPotatoes were planted in Idaho as early as 1838; by 1900 the state's production exceeded a million bushels (about 27,000?tonnes[31]). Prior to 1910, the crops were stored in barns or root cellars, but, by the 1920s, potato cellars or barns came into use. U.S. potato production has increased steadily; two-thirds of the crop comes from Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and Maine, and potato growers have strengthened their position in both domestic and foreign markets.\\r\\nBy the 1960s, the Canadian Potato Research Centre in Fredericton, New Brunswick, was one of the top six potato research institutes in the world. Established in 1912 as a Dominion Experimental Station, the station began in the 1930s to concentrate on breeding new varieties of disease-resistant potatoes. In the 1950sÿ1960s, the growth of the French fry industry in New Brunswick led to a focus on developing varieties for the industry. By the 1970s, the station's potato research was broader than ever before, but the station and its research programs had changed, as emphasis was placed on serving industry rather than potato farmers in general. Scientists at the station even began describing their work using engineering language rather than scientific prose.[32] Potatoes are Canada's most important vegetable crop; they are grown commercially in all its provinces, led by Prince Edward Island.[33] In modern days potatoes have grown in popularity due to their versatility and ability to be used for many different dishes of food.\\r\\nThe first potatoes to arrive in North America from Europe were sent to Gov. Francis Wyatt of Virginia at Jamestown by Nathaniel Butler. There were two large cedar boxes that were filled with different vegetables, among them were potatoes.

This committee put in the form work for the first edition of the ASME Boiler Code - Rules for the Construction of Stationary Boilers and for the Allowable Working Pressures, which was issued in 1914 and published in 1915.[5]\\r\\nThe first edition of the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, known as the 1914 edition, was a single 114-page volume.[6][7] It developed over time into the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel code, which today has over 92,000 copies in use, in over 100 countries around the world.[5] As of March 2011[update] the document consisted of 16,000 pages in 28 volumes.[7]\\r\\nAfter the first edition of the Code, the verifications that the manufacture was to the Code was performed by independent inspectors, which resulted in a wide range of interpretations. Hence in February 1919, the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors was formed.[5]\\r\\nLIST OF SECTIONS[9]\\r\\nADDENDA\\r\\nAddenda, which include additions and revisions to the individual Sections of the Code, are issued accordingly for a particular edition of the code up until the next edition.[9] Addenda is no more in use since Code Edition 2013. It has been replaced by two years edition period.\\r\\nINTERPRETATIONS\\r\\nASME's interpretations to submitted technical queries relevant to a particular Section of the Code are issued accordingly. Interpretations are also available through the internet.[10]\\r\\nCODES CASES\\r\\nCode Cases provide rules that permit the use of materials and alternative methods of construction that are not covered by existing BPVC rules.[11] For those Cases that have been adopted will appear in the appropriate Code Cases book: \\"Boilers and Pressure Vessels\\" and \\"Nuclear Components.\\"[9]\\r\\nCodes Cases are usually intended to be incorporated in the Code in a later edition. When it is used, the Code Case specifies mandatory requirements which must be met as it would be with the Code. There are some jurisdictions that do not automatically accept Code Cases.[9]\\r\\nThe section of the ASME BPVC consists of 4 parts.\\r\\nPart A - Ferrous Material Specifications\\r\\nThis Part is a supplementary book referenced by other sections of the Code. It provides material specifications for ferrous materials which are suitable for use in the construction of pressure vessels.[12]\\r\\nThe specifications contained in this Part specify the mechanical properties, heat treatment, heat and product chemical composition and analysis, test specimens, and methodologies of testing. The designation of the specifications start with 'SA' and a number which is taken from the ASTM 'A' specifications.[12]\\r\\nPart B - Nonferrous Material Specifications\\r\\nThis Part is a supplementary book referenced by other sections of the Code. It provides material specifications for nonferrous materials which are suitable for use in the construction of pressure vessels.[12]\\r\\nThe specifications contained in this Part specify the mechanical properties, heat treatment, heat and product chemical composition and analysis, test specimens, and methodologies of testing. The designation of the specifications start with 'SB' and a number which is taken from the ASTM 'B' specifications.[12]\\r\\nPart C - Specifications for Welding Rods, Electrodes, and Filler Metals\\r\\nThis Part is a supplementary book referenced by other sections of the Code. It provides mechanical properties, heat treatment, heat and product chemical composition and analysis, test specimens, and methodologies of testing for welding rods, filler metals and electrodes used in the construction of pressure vessels.[12]\\r\\nThe specifications contained in this Part are designated with 'SFA' and a number which is taken from the American Welding Society (AWS) specifications.[12]\\r\\nPart D - Properties (Customary/Metric)\\r\\nThis Part is a supplementary book referenced by other sections of the Code. It provides tables for the design stress values, tensile and yield stress values as well as tables for material properties (Modulus of Elasticity, Coefficient of heat transfer et al.)[12]\\r\\nSection III of the ASME Code Address the rules for construction of nuclear facility components and supports. The components and supports covered by section III are intended to be installed in a nuclear power system that serves the purpose of producing and controlling the output of thermal energy from nuclear fuel and those associated systems essential to safety of nuclear power system. Section III provides requirements for new construction of nuclear power system considering mechanical and thermal stresses due to cyclic operation. Deterioration, which may occur in service as result of radiation effects, corrosion, or instability of the material, is typically not addressed.\\r\\nThe section of the ASME BPVC contains the requirements for nondestructive examinations which are referred and required by other sections of the Code.[14]\\r\\nThe section also covers the suppliers examination responsibilities, requirements of the authorized inspectors (AI) as well as the requirements for the qualification of personnel, inspection and examinations.[14][15]\\r\\nThe section of the ASME BPVC consists of 3 divisions.[16]\\r\\nThis division covers the mandatory requirements, specific prohibitions and nonmandatory guidance for materials, design, fabrication, inspection and testing, markings and reports, overpressure protection and certification of pressure vessels having an internal or external pressure which exceeds 15 psi (100 kPa).[9]\\r\\nThe pressure vessel can be either fired or unfired.[16] The pressure may be from external sources, or by the application of heating from an indirect or direct source, or any combination thereof.[9]\\r\\nThe Division is not numbered in the traditional method (Part 1, Part 2 etc.) but is structured with Subsections and Parts which consist of letters followed by a number. The structure is as follows:[9]\\r\\nThis division covers the mandatory requirements, specific prohibitions and nonmandatory guidance for materials, design, fabrication, inspection and testing, markings and reports,overpressure protection and certification of pressure vessels having an internal or external pressure which exceeds 3000 psi (20700 kPa) but less than 10,000 psi.[17]\\r\\nThe pressure vessel can be either fired or unfired.[16] The pressure may be from external sources, or by the application of heating from an indirect or direct source as a result of a process, or any combination of the two.[17]\\r\\nThe rules contained in this section can be used as an alternative to the minimum requirements specified in Division 1. Generally the Division 2 rules are more onerous than in Division 1 with respect to materials, design and nondestructive examinations but higher design stress intensity values are allowed.[16] Division 2 has also provisions for the use of finite element analysis to determine expected stress in pressure equipment, in addition to the traditional approach of design by formula (Part 5: \\"Design by Analysis requirements\\").\\r\\nThis division covers the mandatory requirements, specific prohibitions and nonmandatory guidance for materials, design, fabrication, inspection and testing, markings and reports, overpressure protection and certification of pressure vessels having an internal or external pressure which exceeds 10,000 psi (70,000 kPa).[18]\\r\\nThe pressure vessel can be either fired or unfired.[16] The pressure may be from external sources, by the application of heating from an indirect or direct source, process reaction or any combination thereof.[18]","input":"What is asme boiler and pressure vessel code?"},{"output":"in the Tampa Bay Area","context":"St. Petersburg is a city in Pinellas County, Florida, United States. As of the 2015 census estimate, the population was 257,083,[3] making it the fifth-most populous city in Florida and the largest in the state that is not a county seat (the city of Clearwater is the seat of Pinellas County).[8]\\r\\nSt. Petersburg is the second-largest city in the Tampa Bay Area, after Tampa. Together with Clearwater, these cities comprise the TampaÿSt. PetersburgÿClearwater Metropolitan Statistical Area, the second-largest in Florida with a population of around 2.8 million.[9] St. Petersburg is located on a peninsula between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, and is connected to mainland Florida to the north.[10]\\r\\nSt. Petersburg was founded in 1888 by John C. Williams, who purchased the land, and by Peter Demens, who brought the railroad industry into the area.[11][12] As a part of a coin toss bet, the winner, Peter Demens, named the land after Saint Petersburg, Russia, while Williams opted to name the first hotel built which was named the Detroit Hotel, both named after their home towns respectively.[13] St. Petersburg was incorporated as a town on February 29, 1892 and re-incorporated as a city on June 6, 1903.[11][14]\\r\\nThe city is often referred to by locals as St. Pete. Neighboring St. Pete Beach formally shortened its name in 1994 after a vote by its residents. St. Petersburg is governed by a mayor and city council.[15]\\r\\nWith an average of some 361 days of sunshine each year, and a Guinness World Record for logging the most consecutive days of sunshine (768 days),[16][17] it is nicknamed \\"The Sunshine City\\".[16] Due to its good weather and low cost of living, the city has long been a popular retirement destination, although in recent years the population has moved in a much more youthful direction.[18] American Style magazine ranked St. Petersburg its top mid-size city in 2011, citing its \\"vibrant\\" arts scene.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city was co-founded by John C. Williams, formerly of Detroit, who purchased the land in 1875, and by Peter Demens who was instrumental in bringing the terminus of the Orange Belt Railway there in 1888.[11] The first major newspaper to debut in Tampa Bay was the St. Petersburg Times which established in 1884.[20] St. Petersburg was incorporated as a town on February 29, 1892, when it had a population of only some 300 people.[14][21]\\r\\nA local legend says that John C. Williams and Peter Demens flipped a coin to see who would have the honor of naming the city.[13][22] When Demens won the coin toss the city was named after Saint Petersburg, Russia, where Peter Demens had spent half of his youth,[23] while John C. Williams named the first hotel after his birthplace, Detroit (a hotel built by Demens).[11][24] The Detroit Hotel still exists downtown, but has been turned into a condominium.[25] The oldest running hotels are the historic Pier Hotel, built in 1921, formally Hotel Cordova and The Heritage Hotel (now named Hotel Indigo), built in 1926.[26]\\r\\nPhiladelphia publisher F. A. Davis turned on St. Petersburg's first electrical service in 1897 and its first trolley service in 1904.[27] The city's first major industry was born in 1899 when Henry W. Hibbs (1862ÿ1942), a native of Newport, North Carolina, established his wholesale fish business at the end of the railroad pier, which extended out to the shipping channel. Within a year, Hibbs Fish Company was shipping more than 1,000 pounds (450?kg) of fish each day.[28]\\r\\nSt. Petersburg was incorporated into a city in June 1903.[11] With this transition, the development of the downtown waterfront had dredging of a deeper shipping channel from 1906 to 1908 which opened St. Petersburg to larger shipping. Further dredging improved the port facilities through the 1910s.[29] By then the city's population had quadrupled to a population of 4,127 citizens.[30]\\r\\nIn 1914, the Tampa Bay area was one of the first Floridian cities that fell in love with baseball tracing its roots from Tampa and St. Petersburg. The former mayor of St. Petersburg, Al Lang, had invited the St. Louis Browns to move their spring training into the city.[31] Taking place in the same year, the airplane service across Tampa Bay from St. Petersburg to Tampa and back was initiated, generally considered the first scheduled commercial airline flight. The company name was the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, and the pilot was Tony Jannus, flying a Benoist XIV flying boat.[32] The Tony Jannus Award is presented annually for outstanding achievement in the airline industry.[33] Jannus Live, a local music/entertainment venue on Central Avenue in downtown, is also named after him.[34] Soon after, St. Petersburg's first library opened on December 1, 1915 which still operates till this day as the Mirror Lake Library.[11][35]\\r\\nThe 1920s in St. Petersburg was big due to its major growth brought by tourists. Tourists came from all over by automobile, yacht, and railroad. Travel time from across the bay was cut due to the Gandy Bridge's opening in 1924, helping St. Petersburg increase in tourist numbers and helped grow it into the largest city in Pinellas County. The city also adopted the Mediterranean-style architecture brought by Snell Isles founder Perry Snell.[11] An attraction that brought on a great number of tourists and citizens was the Million Dollar Pier which was built in 1926.[36]\\r\\nTourists declined by the late 1920s and early 1930s due to the Great Depression. Shortly after near the end of the Great Depression, the city recovered due to the help of the Public Works Administration with a $10 million investment plan which helped build the St. Petersburg City Hall.[11]\\r\\nBy the 1940s the city received a large population growth due to World War II. St. Petersburg was a training ground area for the U.S. Coast Guard who had a training base and used the city's Bayboro Harbor,[28] and for the Army Air Force who was selected by the War Department to use the city as their technical service training station.[37] With both stations occupying the city, more than 100,000 troops occupied all hotels in St. Petersburg.[38] After the war, most troops who were stationed in St. Petersburg returned as residents or tourists.[11]\\r\\nIn the 1950s, St. Petersburg experienced another population increase with residents. The development of transportation was important with the increase of tourists, more automobiles were used in the city and subsequently the public street cars were removed.[11] In 1954 the original Sunshine Skyway Bridge opened its first span to link St. Petersburg with Manatee County. A year later in 1955, Highway 19 opened in the city creating a large influx of traffic. By the end of the 1950s, tourists and retirees increased in the area.[39][40]\\r\\nThe development of major transportation continued into the 1960s with the completion of the Howard Frankland Bridge in 1960, creating another connection between St. Petersburg and Tampa.[40] St. Petersburg also received its first stadium named the Bayfront Center which hosted the first professional hockey league in Tampa Bay.[41][42] A new municipal marina and the Museum of Fine Arts were also built downtown.[11] St. Petersburg is home to one of the world's largest reclaimed water systems that was built in the 1970s which flows 37 million gallons of water per day to provide for customers located throughout the city.[43][44]\\r\\nFrom May to August 1968, 211 of the city's sanitation workers struck for higher wages. The strike began approximately one month after Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination in Memphis, Tennessee while supporting that city's sanitation workers strike.\\r\\nDevelopment of the first major league baseball team to be located in the Tampa Bay area began in St. Petersburg throughout the 1970s. The city tried to encourage numerous teams through the United States to make St. Petersburg their new tenant.[11] With the need of a major league baseball team, designs for a ballpark were first presented in 1983 and construction for a permanent dome stadium began in 1986.[45] The stadium opened in 1990 as the Florida Suncoast Dome, later named the Thunderdome in 1993. After many attempts to attract tenants to the new stadium, Major League Baseball gave St. Petersburg a franchise in 1995. In 1996, the dome was renamed a third time to Tropicana Field after naming rights were established with Tropicana Dole Beverages.[46] The Tampa Bay Devil Rays was then established in 1998 after the stadium's renovation and the new team played their first game on March 31, 1998, giving the Tampa Bay area their first professional baseball team.[47]\\r\\nThe city population continued to multiply during the 20th century, booming in the 1940s and 1950s and through the 1970s as the town became a popular retirement destination for Americans from midwestern cities, reaching 238,647 in the 1980 census. By that time, however, the population had leveled off, and has grown by only 10,000 since then. In the decade from 2000 to 2010, the population of the city dropped by approximately 4000 residents, while in the same period the population of Florida increased by over two and a half million residents.[48]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 137.6 square miles (356.4?km2). 61.7 square miles (159.9?km2) of it is land, and 75.9 square miles (196.5?km2) of it (55.13%) is water.[49] St. Petersburg is bordered by three bodies of water, the Old Tampa Bay, Middle Tampa Bay, and Lower Tampa Bay, all of which form the Tampa Bay.[50][51]\\r\\nDowntown St. Petersburg is the Central Business District, containing high rises for office use, most notably the tallest building in the city, One Progress Plaza. The Tampa Bay Times newspaper is headquartered in the downtown area.[52][53] The Poynter Institute, which owns the paper, is located on 3rd Street South.[54]\\r\\nThe Mahaffey Theater complex, the Morean Arts Center, dozens of other art galleries, Haslam's Bookstore, The Coliseum, Palladium Theatre, and Jannus Live are among the galleries and cultural venues featured downtown.[55] Several prominent museums are located in the perimeter. Many of them have received notable accolades, including the Chihuly Collection presented by the Morean Arts Center, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Salvador Dal Museum, the Florida International Museum, the St. Petersburg Museum of History, and the Florida Holocaust Museum.[55] The city hosts many outdoor festivals throughout the year.[56]\\r\\nSt. Petersburg's downtown has been rated among the best in the South. The area's beaches are a 10-mile (16?km) drive from downtown. Jutting a half mile into the bay was the St. Petersburg Pier, a major tourist attraction that offered various activities. \\"The Lens\\" design which was chosen by the International Design Competition Jury and accepted by City Council later had its contract terminated by a citywide election during the summer of 2013.[57][58] Following this, the \\"Pier Park\\" was chosen out of the 16 new design teams that submitted work in late 2014 and in 2015 the Pier Park was set for construction in early 2017.[36] Downtown also contains the University of South Florida St. Petersburg and a downtown branch of St. Petersburg College.[59][60] The downtown perimeter includes several parks, most of which are waterfront or lakefront. Straub Park is nearly a half mile long, boasts a waterfront location, and is home of the St. Petersburg Museum of Fine Arts.[61] The Vinoy Park Hotel has a bayfront location, a spot on the National Register of Historic Places,[62] and an AAA Four-Diamond rating.[63] It fronts Vinoy Park, which holds music festivals, including the Warped Tour. Nearby is the historic Tramor Cafeteria building, now part of the Tampa Bay Times. The city is connected via the Looper Trolley.[64]\\r\\nMost of the dining and nightlife can be found downtown on or near Central Avenue or Beach Drive along the waterfront. Venues include Jannus Live and the State Theatre. The active nightlife scene is credited to recent demographic and regulatory changes.[65][66] In 2010, the city council voted to extend bar hours until 3 A.M., identical to cross-bay \\"rival\\" Tampa.[67][68]\\r\\nTropicana Field, home of Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays, is located in the western part of downtown. Until 2008, the team played its spring training games at nearby Progress Energy Park. This setup was unique, making St. Petersburg the first city that played host to its baseball team during spring training as well as the regular season since the 1919 Philadelphia Athletics.[69] At the end of 2007, there was a debate over a new stadium to be built on the downtown waterfront at the current Progress Energy Park site. Tropicana Field would be demolished and replaced with prime residential and retail space. Completion of the stadium was planned for 2012; however, the proposal has been tabled indefinitely while a community-based organization investigates all alternatives for new stadium construction.[70][71][72]\\r\\nWhen the Wikimedia Foundation was founded by Jimmy Wales in 2003 it was originally located in downtown St. Petersburg. The foundation adopted its articles of incorporation in the city in 2005.[73] On September 25, 2007, the Foundation announced its move in late 2007 from St. Petersburg to the San Francisco Bay Area.[74][75]\\r\\nSt. Petersburg has the third-largest dedicated public waterfront park system in North America,[76] with a waterfront park system that stretches 7 miles (11?km) and is used year-round for public events, festivals and other activities.[77] In the early 20th century, citizens and city leaders engaged in a long and boisterous debate over the future of the young city's waterfront space, with one side advocating for commercial, port and industrial development and the other side advocating for a long-term commitment to parks and public access to the waterfront. The public access and park contingent won the debate when, on Christmas Eve 1909, the city announced the acquisition of the waterfront land that is encompassed by the waterfront park system.[78]\\r\\nThe city is also becoming one of the largest destinations in Florida for kiteboarding with locations such as Fort De Soto Park, Pass-a-Grille, and Ten-Cent.[79]\\r\\nThe St. Petersburg Shuffleboard Club was established in 1924 and gained attention as the \\"World's Largest Shuffleboard Club\\" with 110 courts and over 5,000 members in the 1950s and 1960s.[80]\\r\\nSt. Petersburg is home to more than 100 neighborhoods,[81] with most of the historic districts located near the bay.[82] In the eastern center of the city is Downtown St. Petersburg, which includes the cities residential and commercial skyscrapers, art galleries, museums, and parks.[83] The downtown area is home the central business district to many start-up companies, corporation branches, banks, law firms, and restaurants.[citation needed] Apart from downtown's business and cultural aesthetics, the area resides a branch of St. Petersburg College and the University of South Florida St. Petersburg.[83] Finally, the downtown district is home to two professional sports teams, the Tampa Bay Rays who reside west of downtown at Tropicana Field, and the Tampa Bay Rowdies who are located downtown at Al Lang Stadium.[83]\\r\\nNorth of Downtown St. Petersburg lies Historic Old Northeast and Snell Isle, both are a place of residence to Mediterranean style historic and waterfront homes, parks, and recreational areas.[84][85] Old Northeast is also home to a shopping district, city landmarks, beaches, and small shops as well as small residential high rises.[84] Snell Isle however was founded by C. Perry Snell who bought up the land to develop upscale properties in the 1900s, and helped create some of St. Petersburg's resorts such as the Vinoy Park Hotel and the St. Petersburg Woman's Club;[86] both of which are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.[87]\\r\\nThe western side of St. Petersburg includes the Grand Central District and Historic Kenwood. The Grand Central District houses the cities cafes, art galleries, restaurants, and bars all owing to the Renaissance style architecture.[88][89] Whilst in Historic Kenwood is filled with art studios and galleries similarly to the Grand Central District.[90]\\r\\nSouthward to St. Petersburg is Historic Roser Park, which houses Mediterranean style housing, parks, and museums.[91] The neighborhood is divided by Booker Creek which flows into Bayboro Harbor.[92][93]\\r\\nSt. Petersburg has a humid subtropical climate (Koppen Cfa), closely bordering a tropical savanna climate, with a definite rainy season from June through September. St. Petersburg, like the rest of the Tampa Bay area, is occasionally affected by tropical storms and hurricanes. However, the last time a hurricane directly struck the city was in 1946. Many portions of St. Petersburg, especially along the bay and in south St. Petersburg, have tropical micro-climates. Due to this royal palms and coconut palms, as well as other tropical plants can be found throughout the city. For the winter of 2014ÿ15, the lowest recorded temperature at the St. Petersburg Downtown Airport was 40 degrees Fahrenheit (four degrees Celsius), which the city recorded on February 20.[94] During the summer of 2015, the highest temperature recorded in the city was 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius), occurring on both June 16 and July 20.[94] St. Petersburg has not recorded any freezing temperatures in the five-year period dating back to November 2010, which is the oldest data available from the local National Weather Service office page.[95]\\r\\nAccording to a 2010 census, the city contained 244,769 people, making St. Petersburg the largest city in Pinellas County, and 129,401 households. The population density was 3,964.4 per square mile (1530.7/km2).[99][100]\\r\\nThe racial makeup of St. Petersburg was 168,036 (68.7%) White, 58,577 (23.9%) African American, 7,779 (3.2%) Asian (0.8% Vietnamese, 0.5% Filipino, 0.5% Indian, 0.3% Chinese, 0.1% Korean, 0.1% Japanese, and 1.0% Other Asian), 723 (0.3%) Native American, 135 (0.1%) Pacific Islander, 3,474 (1.4%) from other races, and 6,045 (2.5%) from two or more races.

With 108,815 of the population in households, 3,888 (1.6%) lived in non-institutionalized group-quarters and 2,719 (1.1%) were institutionalized. There were 108,815 households, out of which 23,304 (21.4%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 37,847 (34.8%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 16,425 (15.1%) had a female householder with no husband present, 4,849 (4.5%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 9,453 (3.9%) unmarried partnerships. 39,397 households (36.2%) were made up of individuals and 28,267 (26.0%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.19. Out of 108,815 occupied households, families made up 59,121 (54.3%) while non-families made up 49,694 (45.7%); the average family size was 2.88. The median age of the city was 41.6 years.[99][100]\\r\\nAs of 2000, 23.85% of households had children under the age of 18 living with them, 37.295% were married couples living together, 13.8% had a female householder with no adult living partner present, and 43.8% were non-families. 35.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 13.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.10 and the average family size was 2.865.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2000, the city's population was spread out with 21.5% under the age of 18, 7.7% from 18 to 24, 30.2% from 25 to 44, 23.1% from 45 to 64, and 17.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39.24 years. For every 100 females there were 91.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.7 males.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs of 2000, the median income for a household in the city was $34,597, and the median income for a family was $43,198. Males had a median income of $30,794 versus $27,860 for females. The per capita income for the city was $21,107. About 9.2% of families and 13.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 19.1% of those under age 18 and 10.8% of those age 65 or over. In 2010, 17.8% of the population was under the poverty line, including 32.2% of those under age 18 and 14.1% of those age 65 or over.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs of 2000, those who spoke only English at home accounted were 88.53% of residents, Spanish was spoken by 4.43%, German by 0.78%, French by 0.72% of speakers, Vietnamese by 0.67%, Serbo-Croatian by 0.52%, and Laotian by 0.51% of the population.[101]\\r\\nSt. Petersburg has the 6th highest rate of violent crime in Florida, and the lowest number of murder and manslaughter offenses of the top 6 violent crime cities in Florida.[102] It is the 58th ranking city in the United States when it comes to violent crime.[103] It is less safe than 95% of cities in Florida.[104] Evidence of the social unrest and the schism within the city, particularly between South St. Petersburg and the rest of the city came with the St. Petersburg, Florida riots of 1996.[105] A notable murder in the city of an officer was the murder of Police Officer David Crawford by then-teenager Nicholas Lindsey.[106]\\r\\nAccording to the City of St. Petersburg, Florida's 2016 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the largest employers in the city are:[107]\\r\\nOne of the first of many major events of the year that takes place is the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Parade, which is held in the month of January.[108][109] The parade hosts many bands facing off in a Battle of the Bands, Drum Line Extravaganzas that has been duplicated throughout other cities.[110] In March the city hosts the annual Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg.

Ĳ??), usually referred to simply as First Corinthians and often written 1 Corinthians, is one of the Pauline epistles of the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The epistle says that Paul the Apostle and \\"Sosthenes our brother\\" wrote it to \\"the church of God which is at Corinth\\" 1Cor.1:1ÿ2 although the scholarly consensus holds that Sosthenes was the amanuensis who wrote down the text of the letter at Paul's direction.[1]\\r\\nThis epistle contains some well-known phrases, including: \\"all things to all men\\" (9:22), \\"through a glass, darkly\\" (13:12), and \\"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child\\" (13:11).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is consensus among historians and Christian theologians that Paul is the author of the First Epistle to the Corinthians (c. AD 53ÿ54).[2] The letter is quoted or mentioned by the earliest of sources, and is included in every ancient canon,[3] including that of Marcion. The personal and even embarrassing texts about immorality in the church increase consensus.[4]\\r\\nHowever, two passages may have been inserted at a later stage. The first passage is 1 Corinthians 11:2ÿ16, dealing with praying and prophesying with head covering.[5] The second passage is 1 Corinthians 14:34ÿ35, whose authenticity has been hotly debated. Part of the reason for doubt is that in some manuscripts, the verses come at the end of the chapter instead of at its present location. Furthermore, Paul is here appealing to the law which is uncharacteristic of him. Lastly, the verses come into conflict with 11:5 where women are described as praying and prophesying.[6]\\r\\nThe epistle was written from Ephesus (16:8), a city on the west coast of today's Turkey, about 180 miles by sea from Corinth. According to Acts of the Apostles, Paul founded the church in Corinth (Acts 18:1ÿ17), then spent approximately three years in Ephesus (Acts 19:8, 19:10, 20:31). The letter was written during this time in Ephesus, which is usually dated as being in the range of AD 53ÿ57.[7][8]\\r\\nThe traditional subscription to the epistle, translated in the King James Bible, states that this epistle was written at Philippi, perhaps arising from a misinterpretation of 16:5, \\"For I do pass through Macedonia\\", as meaning, \\"I am passing through Macedonia\\". In 16:8 Paul declares his intention of staying in Ephesus until Pentecost. This statement, in turn, is clearly reminiscent of Paul's Second Missionary Journey, when Paul traveled from Corinth to Ephesus, before going to Jerusalem for Pentecost (cf. Acts 18:22). Thus, it is possible that I Corinthians was written during Paul's first (brief) stay in Ephesus, at the end of his Second Journey, usually dated to early AD 54.[9] However, it is more likely that it was written during his extended stay in Ephesus, where he refers to sending Timothy to them (Acts 19:22, I Cor. 4:17). Also, his references to Apollos (1:12, 3:4, etc.) show that Apollos was known to Paul and the church at the time of writing, which would preclude the first recorded visit to Ephesus (See Acts 18:24ÿ28).\\r\\nThe epistle may be divided into seven parts:[10]\\r\\nNow concerning the contribution for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia Let all your things be done with charity. Greet one another with a holy kiss... I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha. The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.\\r\\nSome time before 2 Corinthians was written, Paul paid them a second visit (2 Cor. 12: 14; 2 Cor. 13: 1) to check some rising disorder (2 Cor. 2: 1; 2 Cor. 13: 2), and wrote them a letter, now lost (1 Cor. 5: 9). They had also been visited by Apollos (Acts 18: 27), perhaps by Peter (1 Cor. 1: 12), and by some Jewish Christians who brought with them letters of commendation from Jerusalem (1 Cor. 1: 12; 2 Cor. 3: 1; 2 Cor. 5: 16; 2 Cor. 11: 23).\\r\\nPaul wrote this letter to correct what he saw as erroneous views in the Corinthian church. Several sources informed Paul of conflicts within the church at Corinth: Apollos (Acts 19:1), a letter from the Corinthians, the \\"household of Chloe\\", and finally Stephanas and his two friends who had visited Paul (1:11; 16:17). Paul then wrote this letter to the Corinthians, urging uniformity of belief (\\"that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you\\", 1:10) and expounding Christian doctrine. Titus and a brother whose name is not given were probably the bearers of the letter to the church at Corinth (2 Corinthians 2:13; 8:6, 16ÿ18).\\r\\nIn general, divisions within the church at Corinth seem to be a problem, and Paul makes it a point to mention these conflicts in the beginning. Specifically, pagan roots still hold sway within their community. Paul wants to bring them back to what he sees as correct doctrine, stating that God has given him the opportunity to be a \\"skilled master builder\\" to lay the foundation and let others build upon it (1 Cor 3:10).\\r\\nLater, Paul wrote about immorality in Corinth by discussing an immoral brother, how to resolve personal disputes, and sexual purity. Regarding marriage, Paul states that it is better for Christians to remain unmarried, but that if they lacked self-control, it is better to marry than \\"burn\\" (?Ĳϫ) which Christians have traditionally thought meant to burn with sinful desires.[citation needed] The Epistle may include marriage as an apostolic practice in 1 Corinthians 9:5, \\"Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas (Peter)?\\" (In the last case, the letter concurs with Matthew 8:14, which mentions Peter having a mother-in-law and thus, by interpolation, a wife.) However, the Greek word for \\"wife\\" is the same word for \\"woman\\". The Early Church Fathers including Tertullian, Jerome, and Augustine state the Greek word is ambiguous and the women in 1 Corinthians 9:5 were women ministering to the Apostles as women ministered to Christ (cf Matthew 27:55, Luke 8:1ÿ3), and were not wives,[12] and assert they left their \\"offices of marriage\\" to follow Christ and to preach.[13]\\r\\nPaul also argues unmarried people must please God, just as married people must please their spouses. The letter is also notable for mentioning the role of women in churches, that for instance they must remain silent (1 Cor. 11:2ÿ16, 14:34ÿ35), and the role of prophecy and speaking tongues in churches. After discussing his views on worshipping idols, Paul finally ends with his views on resurrection. He states that Christ died for our sins, and was buried, and rose on the third day according to the scriptures (1 Cor. 15:3). Paul then asks: \\"Now if Christ is preached as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?\\" (1 Cor. 15:12) and addresses the question of resurrection.\\r\\nThroughout the letter, Paul presents issues that are troubling the community in Corinth and offers ways to fix them. Paul states that this letter is not meant to make them feel ashamed but to \\"admonish\\" them as beloved children. They are expected to become imitators of Jesus and follow the ways in Christ as he, Paul, teaches in all his churches (1 Cor. 4:14ÿ16).","input":"When was the book of 1 corinthians written?"},{"output":"a future where Earth is ruled by the Spiral King, Lordgenome, who forces mankind to live in isolated subterranean villages","context":"Gurren Lagann, known in Japan as Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (dº², Tengen Toppa Guren Ragan, lit. \\"Pierce the Heavens, Gurren Lagann\\"), is a Japanese mecha anime television series animated by Gainax and co-produced by Aniplex and Konami.

Gurren Lagann takes place in a fictional future where Earth is ruled by the Spiral King, Lordgenome, who forces mankind to live in isolated subterranean villages. The plot focuses on two teenagers living in a subterranean village, Simon and Kamina, who wish to go to the surface. Using a mecha known as Lagann, Simon and Kamina reach the surface and start fighting alongside other humans against Lordgenome's forces.\\r\\nIn North America, although initially announced to be licensed by ADV Films in 2007, the license was transferred to Bandai Entertainment in 2008[2] and then transferred to Aniplex of America in 2013.

These villages have no contact with the surface world or other villages and are under constant threat of earthquakes. Selected villagers called diggers are conscripted to expand their homes deeper underground. Simon, a meek young digger ostracized by his peers, finds solace in his best friend and older brother figure, an eccentric delinquent named Kamina. Kamina encourages Simon to join his gang, Team Gurren, to help him achieve his dream of visiting the surface world. One day, Simon unearths a drill-shaped key called a Core Drill, followed by a small mecha resembling a face called a Gunmen.[10][11] Shortly thereafter, a huge Gunmen crashes through the ceiling and begins attacking the village, followed by a girl named Yoko, who attempts to repel the Gunmen. Simon uses his Core Drill to activate the smaller Gunmen (which Kamina names Lagann), and it is used to destroy the larger Gunmen and break through to the surface world.\\r\\nSimon and Kamina learn from Yoko that humans on the surface are attacked each day by Gunmen piloted by beastmen, humanoid creatures who serve as Lordgenome's army. Kamina hijacks a Gunmen and names him Gurren, combining him with Lagann to form the mecha Gurren Lagann. Their actions inspire other humans to steal their own Gunmen and join Team Gurren, which makes Kamina rename it Team Dai-Gurren. Eventually Team Dai-Gurren captures an enemy Gunmen fortress to use as their base of operations, though Kamina is killed in the preceding battle by one of Lordgenome's four generals. Rossiu, a boy from another village, takes over the job of piloting Gurren, but Kamina's death causes Simon to sink into depression until he meets Nia, Lordgenome's daughter. Team Dai-Gurren is initially distrustful of her but allows her to join when it becomes apparent that she was abandoned by her father, like many who came before her. Nia helps Simon come to terms with Kamina's death, and the rest of Team Dai-Gurren prompt him to take up the role as the team's leader, leading them and other humans, who captured other Gunmen and Gunmen fortresses, to Lordgenome's palace. As the palace itself turns out to be a gigantic Gunmen called the Lazengann and launches armies of other Gunmen, the human forces hold them off while Simon, Nia, and Rossiu pilot Gurren Lagann against Lordgenome, who fights them in a similar Gunmen. When both Gunmen are damaged, he himself fights Simon in Lagann with his bare hands. Lordgenome emerges victorious, until Simon uses his Core Drill to defeat him once and for all.\\r\\nOver the next seven years, mankind prospers on the surface world with Simon and the members of Team Dai-Gurren serving as the world's government. As soon as the world's population reaches one million people, an alien race called the Anti-Spirals emerges and uses Nia to announce the Moon's collision with Earth, which will wipe out all life on the planet and prevent them from evolving to such an extent that they will risk destroying the universe in a cataclysmic event called the Spiral Nemesis. With guidance from Lordgenome resurrected as a bio-computer, who was once part of an intergalactic group of warriors who fought the Anti-Spirals and had hidden mankind underground to protect them from the Anti-Spirals, and with help from Viral, an old enemy of Simon who pilots Gurren, Simon, Gurren Lagann and Team Dai-Gurren prevent the Moon's collision, revealing it to be Lordgenome's flagship that was reprogrammed by the Anti-Spirals. Using it, they retrieve the real Moon from the pocket dimension where the Anti-Spirals had hidden it and go to the Anti-Spiral homeworld, where after significant loss, they rescue Nia, and after a battle that spans the universe, Simon in Lagann finally destroys the Anti-Spirals. This, however, causes Nia to fade away and die as her own existence is tied to that of the Anti-Spirals. Simon, finding his life in battle over, hands his Core Drill over to Gimmy and spends the rest of his life wandering the planet as a nameless vagrant.\\r\\nIn the epilogue, twenty years have passed since the teams victory over the Anti-Spirals. With many of Team Dai-Gurren retired, it is up to the new generations of pilots to prevent the Spiral Nemesis and ensure the safety of the universe. Other races across the galaxy, freed from the Anti-Spirals, contacts Earth. President Rossiu of Kamina City joins forces with them and during the twenty years, he created the Galactic Spiral Peace Conference. Yoko, now as Miss Yomako, becomes the principal of the small school she was at during her seven years absence from the team. One of her students becomes a representative the galaxy in the Grapearl Squadron. Gimmy, along with Darry and Simons Core Drill, become the new pilots of Gurren Lagann. Viral becomes the captain of the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren and an emissary for Earth. Nias grave and the wedding ring are placed next to Kaminas grave. Simon, still living as Simon the Digger, watches over them as many Grapearls are seen flying over Kamina City.\\r\\nGurren Lagann was first announced in July 2006 with Aniplex and Konami assisting Gainax in its making. Konami director Koichi Natsume suggested possibilities of the series getting multiple sequels.[12] The series was directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi who was a fan of the mecha genre, having previously done animation work for Neon Genesis Evangelion, and ever since he started working he had wanted to work in a mecha series.[13] After working on Re: Cutey Honey with Kazuki Nakashima, Imaishi appointed him as the writer, believing him to be the best choice. Imaishi was surprised with how much material Nakashima could condense into 27 episodes. Imaishi had finished writing the main storyline long before the reaching the end which facilitated the staff in making the episodes.[13] According to Gainax president Hiroyuki Yamaga the series was in planning phases for a long time. Producer Yasuhiro Takeda used the time to research how would the characters live underground although this aspect is briefly used. Once the series started production, the team did not have much time to research materials.[14]\\r\\nIn contrast to other popular series, Imaishi decided to include drills as the robot's main weapons despite its impact on the suspension of disbelief.[13] Imaishi also wanted the series to only have robots. The robots were made organic so that they would be easier to animate.[14] Nevertheless, animating episode 15 was challenging to the staff due to the amount of shots it required. Its animator Sushio called himself the \\"super animator\\" for his work.[15] Deciding the design of the Gurren Lagann was complicated since it was the basis for the other mechas appearing in the story.[15]\\r\\nIn the making of the series, the team wanted to focus more on the underground life and Simon's imprisonment but their ideas could not be used.[15] In the eighth episode Kamina dies in order to provide Simon character development and make him become the main character.[13] Simon's development kept on going until the final arc when staff planned ideas to make him surpass Kamina. The ending was written to finalize Simon's growth and not leave signs of a sequel. The finale had the pre-planned tragic event of Nia's death which left several staff members saddened. While the staff acknowledged how people were not satisfied with the sad conclusion, they noted that there were still issues that made her survival difficult for the characters.[16] Once the series ended, Yamaga had the idea of releasing a film that retells the events of the series to expand the audience.[14]\\r\\nIn an interview, the writer Kazuki Nakashima cites Ken Ishikawa, co-creator of Getter Robo, as one of Gurren Lagann's influences.[17] Gurren Lagann occasionally pays homage to Ishikawa's Getter Robo, particularly towards the end of the series, where the scale becomes absurd, with the robots steadily becoming bigger and bigger, much like Getter Robo more specifically, the manga version of Getter Robo Go. The final enemy also bears a striking resemblance to La Gooth of Records of Nothingness, another work by Ishikawa.[18] Nakashima, however, wanted to conclude the story of Gurren Lagann in a more reasonable fashion than what Ishikawa usually does in his works.[17] According to Jason Green from Anime News Network, the anime was influenced by previous Gainax anime, particularly in the character development of the protagonist Simon, who goes through three stages in his character development during the three arcs of the series. Each of these stages in his development were influenced by protagonists from several previous Gainax anime: Shinji Ikari from the Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise, Noriko Takaya from Gunbuster, and Ken Kubo from Otaku no Video.[19] The animation on the show pays special tribute to the animation and character designs of Yoshinori Kanada.\\r\\nTakami Akai, the producer of the series and a co-founder of Gainax, announced that he would resign his position effective episode five, which aired on April 29, 2007, over comments that he made regarding posts on the Japanese textboard 2channel. Akai and another Gainax employee, Keiko Mimori, made disparaging remarks about comments criticizing the animation style of the fourth episode of Gurren Lagann, which was completely directed by guest and friend Osamu Kobayashi. With regard to reading the fan criticisms, Akai stated that it was \\"like putting [his] face next to an anus and breathing deeply.\\" Fans later became aware of his comments, and he announced his departure from the company he helped found.[20]\\r\\nAs a result of the series airing at a child-friendly time slot, the staff members had problems with episode 6. Although that episode had a subplot involving peeking into the women's bath, the television stations believed it was suitable when reading the script. After seeing the finished episode, the station said that it could not be aired, and a revised version of the episode was produced.[15]\\r\\nProduced by the animation studio Gainax and directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi, Gurren Lagann aired in Japan on TXN stations between April 1 and September 30, 2007. The anime has 27 episodes plus two specials, the first being the uncensored version of the sixth episode, and the second is episode 5.5, a bonus that came with the Nintendo DS game.\\r\\nThe English version had been previously licensed by ADV Films, but was later acquired by Bandai Entertainment. A subtitle-only version was released in three volumes in July 2008, and an official English dub with the first two volumes released on November 18, 2008 called \\"Gurren Lagann Set 01\\".[citation needed] The show premiered on the Sci Fi Channel on July 28, 2008 as part of Sci Fi's Ani-Monday anime block, airing two episodes each week (and three the final week).[3] The European distribution branch of Bandai, Beez Entertainment, distributed the series in the UK and Europe but has gone out of print since January, 2012.[21] In 2013, Anime Limited announced that they have the distribution license for Gurren Lagann on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK.

In the manga, Simon attends Dai-Gurren Academy (ĸ̺?@, Dai Guren Gakuen) with his friend Kamina, and childhood friend Yoko. Simon, who lives in a run down apartment building, wishes for a normal life, and meets the mysterious Nia one day when she trips down the stairs. She immediately takes a liking to Simon and declares him her husband. Kamina finds another \\"aniki\\" in Nia, who shares his hot-blooded style. She enrolls in Dai-Gurren Academy, and all three must deal with the threat of students from Teppelin Academy, who wish to bring Nia back to her father, the principal. Another spin-off manga titled Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann 4-koma Kingdom: Yoko no Oheso-hen (dº²4ѨKINGDOM 켰Ŀĩ?, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann 4-panel Kingdom: Yoko's Belly Button Chapter) was published by Futabasha in 2008 as a compilation of various short stories.\\r\\nAn online video game was developed by Konami called Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann Chzetsu Hakkutsu ONLINE (dº² ]әEONLINE, literally \\"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Superior Excavation Online\\"). Beta testing had ended on April 16, 2007. The player takes up the role of a driller and drills for treasures in first person view.

In June 2010, Gainax re-acquired the video game rights to the series from Konami, which allowed Banpresto to include it in the latest installment of its storied Super Robot Wars franchise, 2nd Super Robot Wars Z: Destruction Chapter, released in April 2011.\\r\\nA Pachislot game based on the anime teased by Konami was later released in February 2016.[27][28]\\r\\nAn animated film entitled Gurren Lagann the Movie: Childhood's End (??? dº² S?, Gekijban Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann Gurren-hen, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann The Movie: The Crimson Lotus Chapter), once again directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi, and written by Kazuki Nakashima, was produced by Gainax and released on September 6, 2008 in Japanese theaters and the DVD was released on April 22, 2009.[29][30][31] The film is a compilation of the events of the first arc of the series (episodes one through fifteen) with around 20 minutes of newly animated scenes.

It was his 40th straight 20-point game, tying the team record set by John Havlicek during the 1971ÿ72 season.[50] The following day, he had 29 points in a 104ÿ103 loss to the Chicago Bulls, going 8 for 18 from the field in his 41st straight game with at least 20 points, breaking Havlicek's team record.[51] With just 19 points against the Atlanta Hawks on February 27, Thomas' franchise-record streak of consecutive 20-point games ended at 43. It was just the second time this season he did not register at least 20 points in a game.[52] On March 12 against Chicago, Thomas hit his 200th three-point shot of the season, becoming the third Celtics player all-time to reach that mark along with Antoine Walker and Paul Pierce.[53] With 32 points against the Milwaukee Bucks on March 29, Thomas became just the sixth Celtic ever to score 2,000 points in a single season. He also extended his streak with at least one three-pointer to a franchise-best 50 straight games.[54]\\r\\nThomas led the Celtics to a first-round win over the Chicago Bulls in a haze after learning the day before the series began that his younger sister, Chyna Thomas, had died in a car accident outside of his native Tacoma, Washington. After defeating the Bulls 4ÿ2, he flew cross-country to attend her funeral. He returned to Boston for Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals and had 33 points and nine assists in helping the Celtics defeat the Washington Wizards 123ÿ111.[55] In Game 2 against Washington, Thomas scored 53 pointsthe second-highest total in Celtics playoff historyto help Boston win 129ÿ119 in overtime and take a 2ÿ0 lead in the series. He became just the fifth Celtic to score 50 or more points in a postseason game, missing John Havlicek's team record by one point.[56] In Game 7 against Washington, Thomas scored 29 points and had 12 assists to help the Celtics advance to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2012 with a 115ÿ105 win and a 4ÿ3 series victory.[57] After losing the first two games of the conference finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers, Thomas was ruled out for the remainder of the postseason with a hip injury.[58]\\r\\nOn August 22, 2017, Thomas was traded, along with Jae Crowder, Ante ?i?i?, and the Brooklyn Nets' unprotected 2018 first-round draft pick, to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kyrie Irving.[59] However, during the post-trade physical examination by Cleveland staff, concerns were raised about the health of Thomas' previously injured hip.[60] As a result, eight days after the deal was announced, the Celtics agreed to send the Cavaliers a 2020 second-round draft pick via the Miami Heat to complete the trade.[61] It was later reported that Thomas had been playing with a number of secondary issues in his hip, such as a loss of cartilage and some arthritis, for a number of seasons.[62] On September 25, 2017, the Cavaliers deemed him a possibility of playing by the end of the year.[63] On December 21, 2017, Thomas scrimmaged with the Canton Charge of the NBA G League and dressed for the first time since joining the Cavaliers, suiting up but not playing against the Chicago Bulls.[64][65] On January 2, 2018, Thomas made his long-awaited debut for the Cavaliers, scoring 17 points in 19 minutes off the bench in a 127ÿ110 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.[66] A day later, Thomas returned to TD Garden.[67] Although he did not play in the Cavaliers' 102ÿ88 loss to the Celtics, Thomas received a standing ovation from the Celtics' fans.[67] On January 6, he had 19 points and four assists in his second appearance and first start of the season in a 131ÿ127 win over the Orlando Magic.[68] On January 20, he scored a season-high 24 points in a 148ÿ124 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder.[69]\\r\\nOn February 8, 2018, the Cavaliers traded Thomas, Channing Frye and a 2018 first-round draft pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr.[70] In his debut for the Lakers two days later, Thomas scored 22 points off the bench in a 130ÿ123 loss to the Dallas Mavericks.[71] On February 14, in his second game with the Lakers, Thomas was ejected in the first quarter after an altercation with the New Orleans Pelicans' point guard Rajon Rondo.[72]\\r\\nThomas's sister, Chyna, died in a one-car accident on Interstate 5 in Federal Way, Washington on April 15, 2017.[73]","input":"When did isaiah thomas go to the cavs?"},{"output":"Slimey the Worm","context":"Slimey the Worm is a light and dark orange striped worm that is the pet of Oscar the Grouch on Jim Henson's Muppet show Sesame Street. Introduced in Season 2 (1970ÿ1971), he is played by Martin P. Robinson and is the smallest of all characters on Sesame Street, being only 7?cm (2?in). His small size does not affect his attitude of being one not to wince at the sight of extreme activities. As Lou Berger, head writer for Sesame Street, put it, \\"Slimey shows viewers that even the smallest creature can be the most heroic, and that's an important thing for kids to see.\\" Slimey has done many extreme things, including winning a gold medal in the Worm Olympics, skydived from a plane, been shot out of a cannon whilst kissing girlfriend Glo and become the first worm in space. At first Slimey and his family did not talk, communicating by squeaking and wriggling, Slimey would be held up to Oscar's ear to talk to him. He and his family now, however, have digitally enhanced squeaky voices. Slimey's voice is currently provided by Dick Maitland. His birthday is on September 19th.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn season 29 (1997ÿ1998), Slimey undertook a 6-week journey into space. With his landing on the moon, Sesame Street changed directions from teaching children about basic literacy and numeracy, adding basic science. Slimey was accepted by WASA a parody of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, as part of the lunar program. He then trained rigorously to become an astroworm and was finally chosen as part of the mission's international crew, showing viewers that practice makes perfect. The rocket was launched using Mr. Snuffleupagus' trunk after the smoke from the rocket made him sneeze. The journey went through many troubles including the international crew's crisis but eventually landed on the moon, which was televised live by Kermit the Frog. The rocket ship landed in dramatic fashion, splashing into the water. Fortunately nobody was hurt. Slimey was the first to get out of the rocket ship and therefore became the first worm on the moon. The separation of Slimey and Oscar showed the rarely seen soft side to Oscar. The journey explored concepts such as the distance to the moon and the difference between heavy and light, as well as how scientific exploration occurs, with Slimey and the crew performing experiments and collecting samples. The mission included the song \\"Slimey to the Moon\\" sung by the famous Jazz singer Tony Bennett to the tune of \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" by Bart Howard.\\r\\nSlimey has many friends, both worm and non-worm, and also a worm family. Listed here are Slimey's main friends and his family.\\r\\nOscar is Slimey's best friend. Slimey is not only the pet of Oscar the Grouch, but also the only character with whom Oscar admits to liking. Slimey is said to bring out the best in Oscar. The friendship between the two is understood, where they do not express their feelings for each other but act in a manner which shows their strong relationship. Oscar likes Slimey because they share common interests like the love of rain, mud, and soil, and the fact that Slimey doesn't talk to him when he is trying to sleep. The two do many things together, including taking mud baths and just hanging out. In Season 36, Oscar sang the \\"Worm Workout Song,\\" a parody of the song \\"YMCA\\", while Slimey and his worm friends stretched and wiggled. Each night, or at the end of each episode (from season 35 onward) Oscar reads to Slimey chapters from the book Trash Gordon, a parody of the Flash Gordon comic strip. The book involves Gordon fighting many creatures and ends with a review of the letter and number of the day. When Slimey went into space, Oscar was distraught and could not mask missing Slimey, showing that Oscar has a caring side. Oscar's friendship with Slimey demonstrates the difficulties some children find in making friends. Slimey met Oscar in 1971. Oscar went to the park on a rainy day to see the mud puddles and found a mud puddle with a lot of worms playing in it. He then saw a lonely Slimey playing by himself. Slimey saw Oscar and crawled up his shoulder and fell asleep. Feeling sorry for the baby worm Oscar took Slimey home with him.\\r\\nOn February 14, 2000 (episode #3882), Valentine's Day, Glo Worm, a volunteer firefighter, entered Sesame Street and became the larva love of Slimey. They both announce their affection for each other but Glo is called away to fight a fire and Baby Bear is put in charge of distracting Slimey as he waits anxiously for his beloved to return. The pair hit it off so well due to their shared fondness of extreme activities, which is illustrated in a scene where they get shot out of a cannon while kissing. Another moment that featured the duo showed the couple dancing to salsa music.\\r\\nDusty and Eartha are the parents of Slimey and Sloppy. Dusty, the father, is a dark and light striped worm that is personified by the circular black glasses and brown overcoat that he wears. Eartha, the mother, has the same light and dark orange skin as her son, Slimey. She is personified by the long curled eyelashes and country hairstyle commonly sported by women of the 1960s.\\r\\nSloppy, which is short for \\"Sloppy Jalopy\\", Oscar's car on which she was born, is the yellow and brown striped baby sister of Slimey. She was born in Season 26 (1994ÿ1995) to Dusty and Eartha to demonstrate the pressures that come with becoming an elder sibling and how to cope with it through Slimey's actions to his new younger sister. This action by Jim Henson has periodically dealt with the theme of becoming an elder sibling as many of the young viewers watching Sesame Street would be going through that change. The most recent version of this is the birth of Curly Bear, the younger sister of Baby Bear in 2003.\\r\\nSquirmy is a light blue and dark blue striped worm who personifies a person from the country and is cousin to Slimey and Sloppy. She has only ever been introduced in the book The City Worm and the Country Worm by Linda Hayward, in which Slimey and Squirmy exchange visits, with Slimey going to the country and Squirmy going to the city, or more specifically Sesame Street. In the end both decide that their own environment is best for themselves.\\r\\nDirty is a green Detroit Dirt Digger. He belongs to Slimey as of Episode 4157. Oscar takes Slimey to Bug-a-Wee-Bug Shelter to adopt his first pet. Slimey chooses Dirty. After bringing him home Dirty is scared. Oscar and Slimey eventually calm Dirty down by wearing bug hats and singing \\"Welcome Bug Song\\". Dirty can write in the dirt.\\r\\nHere are listed all episodes which revolved around Slimey:","input":"What is oscar the grouch's worms name?"},{"output":"1 September 1998","context":"","input":"When was harry potter first published in the us?"},{"output":"White Feller","context":"Tonto is a fictional character; he is the Native American (either Comanche or Potawatomi) companion of the Lone Ranger, a popular American Western character created by George W. Trendle and Fran Striker. Tonto has appeared in radio and television series and other presentations of the characters' adventures righting wrongs in 19th century western America.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Italian, Porguguese, and Spanish,\\"tonto\\" translates as \\"a dumb person\\", \\"moron\\", or \\"fool\\". In the Italian version the original name is retained, but in the Spanish dubbed version, the character is called \\"Toro\\" (Spanish for \\"bull\\") or \\"Ponto\\". \\r\\n\\r\\nTonto made his first appearance on the 11th episode of the radio show, which originated on the Detroit, Michigan, radio station WXYZ. Though he became well known as the Lone Ranger's friend, Tonto was originally created just so the Lone Ranger would have someone with whom to talk.[1] Throughout the radio run (which spanned 21 years), with only a few exceptions, Tonto was played by American actor John Todd.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nJay Silverheels portrayed the (arguably best-remembered version) in the The Lone Ranger television series. This was the highest-rated television program on the ABC network in the early 1950s and its first true \\"hit\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIvan Naranjo, a Blackfoot/Southern Ute actor from Colorado, voiced the character in The Tarzan/Lone Ranger Adventure Hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Horse portrayed Tonto in the film The Legend of the Lone Ranger (1981). \\r\\n\\r\\nJohnny Depp's was the most recent portrayal, in the Disney film The Lone Ranger (2013).\\r\\n\\r\\nTonto made his first appearance on the 11th episode of the radio show The Lone Ranger.[1] Two conflicting origin stories have been given for the character Tonto and how he came to work with the Lone Ranger. As originally presented, in the December 7, 1938, radio broadcast,[citation needed] Reid had already been well established as the Lone Ranger when he met Tonto. In that episode Cactus Pete, a friend of the Lone Ranger's, tells the story of how the masked man and Tonto first met. According to that tale, Tonto had been caught in the explosion when two men dynamited a gold mine they were working. One of the men wanted to kill the wounded Tonto, but the Lone Ranger arrived on the scene and made him administer first aid. The miner subsequently decided to keep Tonto around, intending to make him the fall guy when he would later murder his partner. The Lone Ranger foiled both the attempted murder and the framing. No reason was given in the episode as to why Tonto chose to travel with the Lone Ranger, rather than continue about his business.\\r\\n\\r\\nA different version was given in later episodes of the radio drama and at the beginning of The Lone Ranger television series: Tonto rescues the sole surviving Texas Ranger of a party that was tricked into an ambush by the outlaw Butch Cavendish. Tonto recognizes the ranger as someone who had saved him when they were both boys. He refers to him by the title \\"ke-mo sah-bee\\", explaining that the phrase means \\"faithful friend\\" (radio series) or \\"trusty scout\\" (television series) in the language of his tribe. In the 2013 film, Tonto translates the word as meaning \\"wrong brother\\". Tonto buries the dead rangers, and the Lone Ranger instructs him to make a sixth empty grave to leave the impression that he, too, is dead.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe radio series identified Tonto as a chief's son in the Potawatomi nation. The Potawatomi originated in the Great Lakes region, but in the 19th century, most had been relocated to the Southwestern states. Their regalia is different from that worn by Tonto.[clarification needed] The choice to make Tonto a Potawatomi seems to come from station owner George Trendle's youth in Mullett Lake, Michigan. Located in the northern part of the Midwest, Michigan is the traditional territory of the Potawatomi, and many local institutions use Potawatomi names. Other sources [5] indicate that Camp Kee Mo Sah Bee belonged to the father-in-law of the show's director, James Jewell. According to author David Rothel, who interviewed Jewell a few months before his death,[5] Kee Mo Sah Bee and Tonto were the only two words that Jewell remembered from those days. Tonto's name may have been inspired by the name of Tonto Basin, Arizona. In the Fran Striker books, Tonto is described as a \\"half-breed\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2013 theatrical feature film of The Lone Ranger, Tonto is depicted as a Comanche tribesman.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonto first rode a horse named \\"White Feller\\" (White Fella/Fellah). When the 1938 Republic movie serial The Lone Ranger was being filmed, it was thought that having two white horses would be confusing, so the producers made \\"White Feller\\" a pinto horse, presumably on the theory that, being partly white, a pinto could still be named \\"White Feller\\". The radio series, noting that the pinto in the film had gone over well with audiences, decided that Tonto's mount would henceforth be a pinto. For several episodes, Tonto's new horse went unnamed, referred to only as \\"the paint horse\\" or simply \\"Paint\\". Eventually the name \\"Scout\\" was adopted.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe portrayal of Tonto has been seen by some Native Americans and others as degrading, notably by Native American author and poet Sherman Alexie.[7] Tonto spoke in a pidgin, saying things like, \\"That right, Kemo Sabe\\", or \\"Him say man ride over ridge on horse\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1975, poet and science fiction writer Paul O. Williams coined the term \\"tontoism\\" to refer to the practice of writing haiku with missing articles (\\"the\\", \\"a\\", or \\"an\\"), which he claimed made such haiku sound like Tonto's stunted English.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater adaptations of the character, such as The Legend of the Lone Ranger and the Filmation animated series,[citation needed] depict him as being articulate in English and speaking it carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilverheels was not above making a little fun of the character, as in a classic sketch on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson with Carson playing a career counselor and Silverheels playing Tonto looking for a new job after working \\"thirty lousy years\\" as the Lone Ranger's faithful sidekick. When asked why he was looking for a new job, Tonto replies, \\"Him finally find out what Kemo Sabe means!\\"[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nTonto has appeared in various media based on The Lone Ranger. \\r\\n\\r\\nTonto starred in his own comic book, The Lone Ranger's Companion Tonto, 31 issues of which were published by Dell Comics during the 1950s.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater depictions beginning in the 1980s have taken efforts to show Tonto as an articulate and proud warrior whom the Ranger treats as an equal partner. In the Topps Comics four-issue miniseries, The Lone Ranger and Tonto, Tonto is even shown to be a very witty, outspoken, and sarcastic character willing to punch the Lone Ranger during a heated argument and commenting on his past pop-culture depictions with the words, \\"Of course, Kemosabe. Maybe when we talked I should use that 'me Tonto' stuff, way they write about me in the dime novels. You'd like that, wouldn't you?\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, Wyatt Logan said the Native American deputy U.S. marshal Grant Johnson was inspiration for Tonto in the Timeless episode \\"Murder of Jesse James\\".","input":"What was the name of tonto's horse?"},{"output":"the second","context":"Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time.[1] It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency.[2]  For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60?seconds divided by 120 beats).  Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio signals (sound), radio waves, and light.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor cyclical processes, such as rotation, oscillations, or waves, frequency is defined as a number of cycles per unit time. In physics and engineering disciplines, such as optics, acoustics, and radio, frequency is usually denoted by a Latin letter f or by the Greek letter \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\nu }\\r\\n\\r\\n or  (nu) (see e.g. Planck's formula).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relation between the frequency and the period \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle T}\\r\\n\\r\\n of a repeating event or oscillation is given by\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SI derived unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz), named after the German physicist Heinrich Hertz. One hertz means that an event repeats once per second. A previous name for this unit was cycles per second (cps). The SI unit for period is the second.\\r\\n\\r\\nA traditional unit of measure used with rotating mechanical devices is revolutions per minute, abbreviated r/min or rpm. 60?rpm equals one hertz.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a matter of convenience, longer and slower waves, such as ocean surface waves, tend to be described by wave period rather than frequency. Short and fast waves, like audio and radio, are usually described by their frequency instead of period. These commonly used conversions are listed below:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor periodic waves in nondispersive media (that is, media in which the wave speed is independent of frequency), frequency has an inverse relationship to the wavelength,  (lambda). Even in dispersive media, the frequency f of a sinusoidal wave is equal to the phase velocity v of the wave divided by the wavelength  of the wave:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the special case of electromagnetic waves moving through a vacuum, then v = c, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and this expression becomes:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen waves from a monochrome source travel from one medium to another, their frequency remains the sameonly their wavelength and speed change.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeasurement of frequency can done in the following ways,\\r\\n\\r\\nCalculating the frequency of a repeating event is accomplished by counting the number of times that event occurs within a specific time period, then dividing the count by the length of the time period. For example, if 71 events occur within 15 seconds the frequency is:\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the number of counts is not very large, it is more accurate to measure the time interval for a predetermined number of occurrences, rather than the number of occurrences within a specified time.[4]  The latter method introduces a random error into the count of between zero and one count, so on average half a count. This is called gating error and causes an average error in the calculated frequency of \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nf\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta f={\\\\frac {1}{2T_{m}}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n, or a fractional error of \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {\\\\Delta f}{f}}={\\\\frac {1}{2fT_{m}}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n where \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle T_{m}}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the timing interval and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle f}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the measured frequency. This error decreases with frequency, so it is generally a problem at low frequencies where the number of counts N is small.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn older method of measuring the frequency of rotating or vibrating objects is to use a stroboscope. This is an intense repetitively flashing light (strobe light) whose frequency can be adjusted with a calibrated timing circuit. The strobe light is pointed at the rotating object and the frequency adjusted up and down. When the frequency of the strobe equals the frequency of the rotating or vibrating object, the object completes one cycle of oscillation and returns to its original position between the flashes of light, so when illuminated by the strobe the object appears stationary. Then the frequency can be read from the calibrated readout on the stroboscope. A downside of this method is that an object rotating at an integral multiple of the strobing frequency will also appear stationary.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigher frequencies are usually measured with a frequency counter. This is an electronic instrument which measures the frequency of an applied repetitive electronic signal and displays the result in hertz on a digital display. It uses digital logic to count the number of cycles during a time interval established by a precision quartz time base. Cyclic processes that are not electrical in nature, such as the rotation rate of a shaft, mechanical vibrations, or sound waves, can be converted to a repetitive electronic signal by transducers and the signal applied to a frequency counter. Frequency counters can currently cover the range up to about 100?GHz. This represents the limit of direct counting methods; frequencies above this must be measured by indirect methods.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove the range of frequency counters, frequencies of electromagnetic signals are often measured indirectly by means of heterodyning (frequency conversion). A reference signal of a known frequency near the unknown frequency is mixed with the unknown frequency in a nonlinear mixing device such as a diode. This creates a heterodyne or \\"beat\\" signal at the difference between the two frequencies.  If the two signals are close together in frequency the heterodyne is low enough to be measured by a frequency counter. This process only measures the difference between the unknown frequency and the reference frequency. To reach higher frequencies, several stages of heterodyning can be used. Current research is extending this method to infrared and light frequencies (optical heterodyne detection).\\r\\n\\r\\nVisible light is an electromagnetic wave, consisting of oscillating electric and magnetic fields traveling through space. The frequency of the wave determines its color: 7014400000000000000?4G1014?Hz is red light, 7014800000000000000?8G1014?Hz is violet light, and between these (in the range 4-7014800000000000000?8G1014?Hz) are all the other colors of the visible spectrum. An electromagnetic wave can have a frequency less than 7014400000000000000?4G1014?Hz, but it will be invisible to the human eye; such waves are called infrared (IR) radiation. At even lower frequency, the wave is called a microwave, and at still lower frequencies it is called a radio wave. Likewise, an electromagnetic wave can have a frequency higher than 7014800000000000000?8G1014?Hz, but it will be invisible to the human eye; such waves are called ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Even higher-frequency waves are called X-rays, and higher still are gamma rays.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of these waves, from the lowest-frequency radio waves to the highest-frequency gamma rays, are fundamentally the same, and they are all called electromagnetic radiation. They all travel through a vacuum at the same speed (the speed of light), giving them wavelengths inversely proportional to their frequencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere c is the speed of light (c in a vacuum, or less in other media), f is the frequency and  is the wavelength.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn dispersive media, such as glass, the speed depends somewhat on frequency, so the wavelength is not quite inversely proportional to frequency.\\r\\n\\r\\nSound propagates as mechanical vibration waves of pressure and displacement, in air or other substances.[5]. In general, frequency components of a sound determine its \\"color\\", its timbre. When speaking about the frequency (in singular) of a sound, it means the property that most determines pitch.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe frequencies an ear can hear are limited to a specific range of frequencies.  The audible frequency range for humans is typically given as being between about 20?Hz and 20,000?Hz (20?kHz), though the high frequency limit usually reduces with age. Other species have different hearing ranges. For example, some dog breeds can perceive vibrations up to 60,000?Hz.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many media, such as air, the speed of sound is approximately independent of frequency, so the wavelength of the sound waves (distance between repetitions) is approximately inversely proportional to frequency.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Europe, Africa, Australia, Southern South America, most of Asia, and Russia, the frequency of the alternating current in household electrical outlets is 50?Hz (close to the tone G), whereas in North America and Northern South America, the frequency of the alternating current in household electrical outlets is 60?Hz (between the tones B? and B; that is, a minor third above the European frequency). The frequency of the 'hum' in an audio recording can show where the recording was made, in countries using a European, or an American, grid frequency.","input":"What is the si unit of time period?"},{"output":"31 May 1961","context":"","input":"When did south africa leave the british empire?"},{"output":"the New England Patriots","context":"Sony Michel (born February 17, 1995) is an American football running back for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL).

He was rated by Rivals.com as a five-star recruit and was ranked as the third best running back and 13th best player overall.[3] Michel committed to the University of Georgia on April 26, 2013 to play college football.[4][5] Michel's older brother Marken Michel is a receiver for the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League, and was the 2017 West Division Most Outstanding Rookie.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichel also competed in track and field at American Heritage; as a sophomore in 2011, he earned first-place finishes in both the 100-meter dash (10.99s) and 200-meter dash (21.91s) at the FHSAA 2A District Meet.[7] He posted a personal-best time of seconds in the 100-meter dash at the 3rd Annual Miramar Invitational, where he placed first.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a true freshman at Georgia in 2014, Michel played in eight games and made one start. He missed five games due to a fractured shoulder blade.[9] He rushed for 410 yards on 64 carries with five rushing touchdowns.[10] Michel entered 2015 as a backup to Nick Chubb, but earned extensive playing time.[11][12] After Chubb was injured in a game against the Tennessee Volunteers, Michel took over as the starter and ran for 145 yards.[13] In the 2016 season, Michel totaled 840 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns to go along with 22 receptions for 149 receiving yards and a receiving touchdown.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, with true freshman Jake Fromm starting at quarterback for the Bulldogs, the team relied heavily on its senior running backs, Chubb and Michel, to carry the load. Despite remaining second in the depth chart behind Chubb, and receiving only two-thirds as many carries as Chubb, Michel had a breakout year, finishing with 1,227 rushing yards (156 carries), only 118 yards fewer than Chubb's 1,345 (223 carries). In a blowout game against Vanderbilt on October 7, Michel rushed for 150 yards and a score on only 12 carries.[15] Three weeks later, in an October 28 rout of Florida, Michel rushed for 137 yards on only 6 carries, scoring twice on runs of 74 yards and 45 yards.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichel's biggest game of the year came on New Year's Day against Oklahoma in the Rose Bowl, Georgia's first-ever College Football Playoff game. Carrying the ball only 11 times, Michel ran for 181 yards and three touchdowns, including a walk-off 27-yard scamper from the \\"Wild Dawg\\" formation (direct snap to Michel) to end the game in double overtime.[17] He also added four receptions for 41 yards and a fourth touchdown. For his performance, Michel was named Rose Bowl Offensive MVP.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nChubb and Michel's 326 combined rushing yards in the Rose Bowl put them at 8,259 career rushing yards, surpassing Eric Dickerson and Craig James' FBS record of 8,192.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichel was selected by the New England Patriots in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft with the 31st overall pick.[22] He was the third running back to be selected that year.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichel suffered a knee injury in training camp causing him to miss the entire preseason.[24] Michel made his NFL debut in a Week 2 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. He ran the ball 10 times for 34 yards and had a six-yard reception in the 31ÿ20 loss.[25] In a Week 4 victory over the Miami Dolphins, Michel had a breakout game with 26 carries for 112 yards and a touchdown.[26] In a Week 5 victory over the Indianapolis Colts, Michel rushed for 98 yards and scored a touchdown [27][28] In Week 6 against the Kansas City Chiefs, he had 106 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 43ÿ40 victory on Sunday Night Football.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichel suffered another knee injury in the October 21, 2018 game against the Chicago Bears.

Originally a constituent of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, P&O Cruises is the oldest cruise line in the world, having operated the world's first commercial passenger ships in the early 19th century. It is the sister company of, and retains strong links with, P&O Cruises Australia. P&O Cruises was de-merged from the P&O group in 2000, becoming a subsidiary of P&O Princess Cruises, which subsequently merged with Carnival Corporation in 2003, to form Carnival Corporation & plc. P&O Cruises currently operates eight cruise ships with a total passenger capacity of 14,970 and a 5% market share of all cruise lines worldwide.[1] Its most recent vessel, MV Britannia, joined the fleet in March 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nP&O Cruises originates from 1822, with the formation of the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company, which began life as a partnership between Brodie McGhie Willcox, a London ship broker, and Arthur Anderson, a sailor from the Shetland Isles. The company first operated a shipping line with routes between England and the Iberian Peninsula, adopting the name Peninsular Steam Navigation Company.[2] In 1837, the company won a contract to deliver mail to the Peninsula,[2] with its first mail ship, RMS Don Juan, departing from London on 1 September 1837. The ship collected mail from Falmouth four days later, however it hit rocks on the homeward bound leg of the trip. The companys reputation survived only because all objects including mail were rescued.\\r\\nIn 1840, the company acquired a second contract to deliver mail to Alexandria, Egypt, via Gibraltar and Malta.[2] The company was incorporated by Royal Charter the same year, becoming the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. At the time, the company had no ships available to use on the route, so agreed to merge with the Liverpool based Transatlantic Steamship Company, acquiring two ships, the 1,300-ton Great Liverpool and the newly built 1,600-ton Oriental.\\r\\nP&O first introduced passenger services in 1844, advertising sea tours to destinations such as Gibraltar, Malta and Athens, sailing from Southampton. The forerunner of modern cruise holidays, these voyages were the first of their kind, and have led to P&O Cruises being recognised as the world's oldest cruise line. The company later introduced round trips to destinations such as Alexandria and Constantinople and underwent rapid expansion in the later half of the 19th century, with its ships becoming larger and more luxurious. Notable ships of the era include the SS Ravenna built in 1880, which became the first ship to be built with a total steel superstructure, and the SS Valetta built in 1889, which was the first ship to use electric lights.\\r\\nIn 1904 the company advertised its first cruise on the 6,000-ton Vectis, a ship specially fitted out for the purpose of carrying 150 first-class passengers. Ten years later the company merged with the British India Steam Navigation Company, leaving the fleet with a total of 197 ships. In the same year the company had around two-thirds of its fleet relinquished for war service. However, the company was fortunate and only lost 17 ships in the First World War, with a further 68 lost in subsidiary companies. A major event in the companys history took place in December 1918, when P&O purchased 51% of the Orient Steam Navigation Company, which had been previously operating jointly with P&O on the Australian mail contract. During the 1920s, P&O and Orient Line took delivery of over 20 passenger liners, allowing them to expand their operations once again. Cruises began operating once again in 1925, when Ranchis maiden voyage was a cruise to Norway. During 1929, P&O offered 15 cruises, some aboard Viceroy of India, the companys first turbo-electric ship.\\r\\nThe P&O Group left the Second World War with a loss of 156 ships including popular liners such as Viceroy of India, Cathay, Oronsay and Orcades. By the late 1940s commercial aviation was beginning to take hold of the industry so newer ships became larger and faster, allowing the sailing time to Australia to be cut from five to four weeks. In 1955 P&O and Orient Lines ordered what were to be their last passenger liners  the Canberra and Oriana. These fast ships bought the Australian run down another week to just three, with Oriana recording a top speed of just over 30 knots during trials.\\r\\nDuring 1961, P&O bought out the remaining stake in Orient Lines and renamed its passenger operations as P&O-Orient Lines. The decreasing popularity of line voyages during the 1960s and 1970s meant that cruising became an important deployment for these ships in-between line voyages. In 1971 the company reorganised its 100 subsidiaries and 239 ships into several operating divisions, one of which was The Passenger Division which began with 13 ships.\\r\\nThe 1970s was a grim time for the passenger liner as many young liners were sold for scrap. Princess Cruises was acquired in 1974 which allowed the almost new Spirit of London to be transferred to the Princess fleet. This left Canberra and Oriana to serve the UK market on their own, with Arcadia deployed in Australia and Uganda offering educational cruises.\\r\\nIn February 2000, it was announced that all cruise ship operations, including P&O Cruises, were to be de-merged from the P&O group, forming a new independent company, P&O Princess Cruises. The company operated the P&O Cruises, Princess Cruises, P&O Cruises Australia, AIDA Cruises and later A'Rosa Cruises and Ocean Village fleets, before merging with Carnival Corporation to form Carnival Corporation & plc in 2003.\\r\\nIn 1977, P&O re-branded its passenger division, creating P&O Cruises and P&O Cruises Australia. In February 1979 Kungsholm, a former Swedish American Line vessel, was acquired from Flagship Cruises and after a major refit was renamed Sea Princess. Operating out of Australia, she replaced Arcadia that was then sold to Taiwanese ship breakers. In spring 1982 Oriana replaced Sea Princess in Australia, leaving Sea Princess to be transferred to the UK. When Canberra returned from the Falklands War, Sea Princess was switched to the Princess fleet in 1986 leaving just the Canberra for the UK market. With Canberra's withdrawal becoming ever more imminent, P&O ordered its first new ship for the British market, the Oriana, delivered in 1995. Canberra ran alongside her for two years until she was scrapped in 1997.\\r\\nCanberra was replaced by Star Princess, renamed Arcadia. She became the first ship in the P&O fleet to be dedicated for adults only, a role that would be continued by her replacement Adonia, the second Sea Princess. In April 2000 Aurora, a half-sister ship to Oriana entered service for P&O. Although externally Aurora is similar to her half-sister Oriana, internally she is much different. Aurora also has a larger Gross Tonnage partly due to the fact that she has an enclosed centre swimming pool.\\r\\nIn 2003 Arcadia was transferred to the new Ocean Village brand and was renamed Ocean Village. At the same time, Oceana (ex Ocean Princess) and her sister the Adonia (ex Sea Princess) were transferred to the P&O fleet. Oceana remains with P&O but Adonia was transferred back to Princess Cruises in 2005, when she was replaced by the new Arcadia, an original Vista class design. Another former Princess ship, Artemis, joined P&O in 2005, and left the fleet in 2011 to be replaced by the second Adonia, the former Royal Princess. She is even smaller than the Artemis at 30,000 gross tons and is the smallest in the fleet. The advantage of her small size is that she can visit more remote places on her 'Discovery Voyages'.\\r\\nAs of 2012, the Arcadia, Adonia and the Oriana are adult-only ships.\\r\\nP&O Cruises announced in June 2011 that it will expand its fleet with a 141,000-ton cruise ship, Britannia, built by Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri, scheduled to enter service in 2015.[3]\\r\\nOn 1 June 2011, Carnival Corporation & plc announced an order from Fincantieri for a new 145,000 ton cruise ship for P&O.[3] The ship, unnamed at the time of the announcement, is to have a capacity of 3,611 people, and will enter service in 2015.[3] According to the P&O Peninsular club magazine, the new ship will have 14 passenger decks and 1,819 cabins. P&O Cruises has also teamed up with British Hotel designers, Richmond International to design the interior of the new ship. On 15 May 2013, the keel of the new ship was laid at the Monfalcone shipyard of Fincantieri near Trieste, in Italy. The keel laying involved the placement in the dry dock of the first section of the ships hull.[4] On 24 September 2013 it was reported that the ship would be named Britannia.[5] The ceremonial float out took place on the afternoon of 14 February 2014, with the traditional champagne bottle smashed against the vessel's hull.[6]\\r\\nIn January 2014, P&O Cruises unveiled plans to introduce a new fleet-wide livery based on the UK's Union Flag design to emphasise the line's British heritage.[7]\\r\\nOn 4 June 2015, it was announced that Adonia would be transferred to Fathom, a new brand of Carnival Corporation & plc, for a maiden voyage in April 2016.[8] It was later announced on 23 November 2016 that the Fathom brand would cease dedicated sailings and Adonia would be returning to the P&O fleet in June 2017.\\r\\nOn 5 September 2016, it was announced that a new 180,000 ton ship would be built for the British cruise market, delivery expected in 2020.[9] It will be the largest cruise ship in the P&O Fleet, as well as being the largest designed for the British market, surpassing its previous holder Britannia. The new ship will be built by Meyer Werft at its shipyard in Papenburg, Germany and will feature the companys exclusive \\"green cruising\\" design as one of the first generation of cruise ships to be fully powered by Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), shippings most advanced fuel technology, which will significantly reduce air emissions.[10]. This is known as project Gala, the name of the vessel does not relate to the project name.\\r\\nMV Oriana holds the Golden Cockerel trophy for the fastest ship in the P&O fleet. Previously held by SS Oriana it passed to SS Canberra on retirement of the first Oriana in 1986. On Canberra's final cruise in 1997 the Golden Cockerel was handed over to the new Oriana when both ships were anchored off Cannes and sent boats out to perform the handover.\\r\\nP&O Cruises operates a modern fleet of 8 ships:","input":"Which is the biggest p and o ship?"},{"output":"Sergey Karjakin","context":"Chess prodigies are children who can beat experienced adult players and even Masters at chess.

One of the original eight teams in the IPL, the team has made three final appearances in the IPL, losing all (in 2009 to the Deccan Chargers, in 2011 to the Chennai Super Kings and in 2016 to the Sunrisers Hyderabad). The team also finished runners-up in the 2011 CLT20, losing the final against the Mumbai Indians.\\r\\nThe home ground of the Royal Challengers is the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore.[1] The team is currently captained by Virat Kohli and coached by Daniel Vettori.[2][3] The team holds the records of both the highest and the lowest total in the IPL (263/5 and 49).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the establishment of the Indian Premier League, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008.[4] The teams for the competition, representing 8 different cities of India, including Bangalore, were put up on auction in Mumbai on 20 February 2008. The Bangalore franchise was purchased by Vijay Mallya, who paid US$111.6?million for it. This was the second highest bid for a team, next only to Reliance Industries' bid of US$111.9?million for the Mumbai Indians.\\r\\nAhead of the 2008 player auction, the IPL named Rahul Dravid as the icon player for the Bangalore franchise, which meant that Dravid would be paid 15% more than the highest bid player at the auction. The franchise acquired a number of Indian and international players at the auction such as Jacques Kallis, Anil Kumble, Zaheer Khan, Mark Boucher, Dale Steyn and Cameron White. They also signed up Ross Taylor, Misbah-ul-Haq and India under-19 World Cup winning captain Virat Kohli in the second round of auction. The team won only 4 of the 14 matches in the inaugural season, finishing seventh in the eight-team table. Only Dravid managed to score more than 300 runs in the tournament and they had to even bench their costliest foreign player Kallis for a few of the matches due to his poor form.[5][6] The string of failures midway through the season led to the sacking of the CEO Charu Sharma, who was replaced with Brijesh Patel.[7] Team owner Vijay Mallya went on to publicly criticize Dravid and Sharma for the players selected by them at the auction and stated that his \\"biggest mistake was to abstain from the selection of the team.\\"[7] Eventually the chief cricketing officer Martin Crowe resigned.[8]\\r\\nAt the 2009 player auction, the franchise signed up Kevin Pietersen for a record sum of US$1.55 million, making him the joint costliest player, along with fellow Englishman Andrew Flintoff who was signed up by the Chennai Super Kings for the same amount. They also traded Khan for Robin Uthappa with the Mumbai Indians and also roped in local batsman Manish Pandey from them. Ahead of the tournament, which was shifted to South Africa due to the general elections, the Royal Challengers named Pietersen as the team captain for the season. Bangalore continued to struggle during the initial games of the 2009 season, winning only two of their first six games under the new captain. However, the team's fortunes improved after Pietersen left for national duty and Kumble took over the captaincy, as the team went on to win six of their remaining eight league games to finish third on the points table. The team qualified for the semifinal where they faced the Super Kings. Electing to field first, Bangalore restricted their opponents to 146 and chased down the total with 5 wickets in hand thanks to 48 and 44 by Pandey and Dravid respectively. In the final against Deccan Chargers, the Royal Challengers bowlers, led by Kumble's 4 for 16, kept the Chargers down to 143/6. However, they struggled in the runchase, with only four batsmen reaching double figures, and lost the match by six runs in a tense finish.\\r\\nIn 2010, the Royal Challengers continued under Kumble's captaincy and finished the regular season with seven wins from 14 matches and 14 points. They were one of the four teams tied on 14 points with two semifinal spots at stake; they qualified for the semifinal as their net run rate was superior to those of the Delhi Daredevils and the Kolkata Knight Riders. In the semifinal, the Royal Challengers were defeated by the table-toppers Mumbai Indians by 35 runs. With a convincing nine-wicket win over defending champions Deccan Chargers in the third-place playoff, the Royal Challengers qualified for the 2010 Champions League Twenty20. Kumble retired at the conclusion of the Champions League, having led the team to the semifinals of both the IPL and the CLT20 that year.\\r\\nOn 8 January 2011, IPL Governing Council held the auction for the season 4 of the league. The franchises had the option of retaining a maximum of four players for a sum of US$ 4.5 million. Royal Challengers however retained only one of their players, Virat Kohli, leaving the rest of the players back in the auction pool. When other IPL franchises let go the non-performers from each of their teams, RCB lost the top performers from the previous season by releasing them back to auction pool. On Day-One of the auction, Bangalore bought Sri Lankan Tillakaratne Dilshan for $650,000, their former player and Mumbai Indians spearhead Zaheer Khan for $900,000, Netherlands' Ryan ten Doeschate for $400,000, and ace middle order batsman AB de Villiers for $1.1mn, former New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori for $550,000, India's new sensation, who played with Mumbai Indians until last season, Saurabh Tiwary for a whopping $1.6 million; Australia's Dirk Nannes for $650,000 and India's young talent Cheteshwar Pujara for $700,000. West Indian batsman Chris Gayle was brought in as a replacement for the injured Dirk Nannes in the middle of the tournament. Vettori led the side for the fourth season of the IPL.\\r\\nRCB kicked off their campaign with a comfortable six-wicket win over the newly formed team, Kochi Tuskers Kerala. But then they suffered three big defeats at the hands of Mumbai Indians, Deccan Chargers and Chennai Super Kings. At this stage, speedster Dirk Nannes was ruled out of the tournament and RCB team management named West Indian opener Chris Gayle as his replacement. Gayle started off the tournament with a century (102* off 55 balls) against Kolkata Knight Riders, giving the Challengers an emphatic 9-wicket win. RCB also managed to beat Delhi Daredevils and Pune Warriors in their next two matches. They went on to beat Kings XI Punjab by a big margin of 85 runs, after Gayle smashed his second century of the tournament (107 off 49 balls). They won their next two matches against Kochi and Rajasthan Royals, both comprehensively by 9 wickets. They also defeated Kolkata in a rain-affected match at Bangalore. But then, Kings XI Punjab, riding on a blistering hundred by their skipper Adam Gilchrist, ended RCB's 7-match winning streak, with a huge 111-run margin win. In their last league match, the Challengers beat the defending champions Chennai Super Kings by 8 wickets to end at the top of the points table.

Virat Kohli scored an unbeaten 70 off just 44 balls to help RCB put up 175/4 in their 20 overs. Despite losing early wickets, Chennai went on to win the match by 6 wickets. The win took Chennai to the final and RCB faced Mumbai Indians in the 2nd qualifier in Chennai. Batting first, Royal Challengers made a massive 185/4 in 20 overs on a slow Chepauk track. Chris Gayle was the star once again for them as he scored a blistering 89 runs off 47 balls. Mumbai never looked in the hunt for a win as they collapsed to a 43-run defeat. The Royal Challengers qualified for the finals with this win and went on to face Chennai at their home ground in the finals. Winning the toss, Chennai elected to bat first in the finals. The Super Kings posted a huge total of 205/5. The Challengers did not bat well and lost the match by 4 wickets.

The Challengers, placed in Group B in the first round of the tournament, kicked off their quest for glory with a last-ball defeat to the Warriors. They suffered a big 9-wicket defeat at the hands of IPL counterparts Kolkata Knight Riders in their second group match, leaving them with two must-win matches in order to qualify for the semi-finals. They registered their first win in the competition, in emphatic manner, by beating Somerset by 51 runs, thanks to Chris Gayle's 46-ball 86. The win also consolidated their poor net run-rate. In their last group match, they faced the champions from Australia, the Southern Redbacks. Batting first, the Redbacks rode on a century by Daniel Harris (108* from 61 balls) to set RCB a target of 215. The Royal Challengers came out with a spirited batting performance with Tillakaratne Dilshan and Virat Kohli scoring half-centuries. However, the Redbacks hampered the run-chase by picking up wickets at regular stages towards the end of the innings. With six runs required off the last ball to win the match, RCB found an unlikely-hero in Arun Karthik, who struck Daniel Christian for a six over deep mid-wicket, to take RCB through to the semi-finals. The Challengers, despite being level on points with Kolkata Knight Riders and Warriors, qualified for the semis on basis of having a better net run-rate than the two teams.\\r\\nThe Royal Challengers played the New South Wales Blues in the semi-finals of the tournament. Winning the toss, Daniel Vettori put the Blues in to bat and the decision seemed to backfire as the Blues amassed 203/2 in 20 overs, mainly due to the efforts of David Warner who struck an unbeaten 123 off just 68 balls. Despite losing Dilshan early in the chase, RCB got off to a rollicking start with Chris Gayle smashing 92 runs from only 41 deliveries. He was ably supported by Kohli, who struck an unbeaten 84 from 49 balls to give RCB a comfortable 6-wicket victory with 9 balls to spare. They took on an injury-hit Mumbai Indians in the final at Chennai. Mumbai winning the toss, chose to bat and put up a modest total of 139 in 20 overs. After getting off to a blistering start with the bat, the Challengers lost wickets at regular intervals before getting bundled out for 108 in 19.2 overs, falling short of the target by 31 runs. Mumbai skipper Harbhajan Singh was awarded the Man of the Match for picking 3/20 in his four overs.\\r\\nIn the pre-season transfer window Royal Challengers Bangalore transferred Australian allrounder Andrew McDonald[9] from Delhi Daredevils.

AB de Villiers and Muttiah Muralitharan gave the team a winning start against Delhi but 3 consecutive losses followed. One of them saw the team concede a 200+ total off the last ball in Chennai while Ajinkya Rahanes ton at Bangalore included 6 fours in a single over from Aravind. The team rallied back, Chris Gayle finding his touch to hit 5 consecutive sixes off Rahul Sharma and Saurabh Tiwary hitting a six off the last ball to win the team a tight chase against Pune. Gayle shone again at Mohali in a comprehensive win while de Villiers, Tillakaratne Dilshan and KP Appanna engineered another win in Jaipur. A washed out match at Bangalore against Chennai denied the team a chance at gaining 2 points outright, the teams sharing points 1-1 each. Two subsequent losses put RCB in competition with Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings and Kings XI Punjab for the last play-offs slot. Daniel Vettori benched himself so the team could play Muttiah Muralitharan as one of the four foreigners allowed in the playing XI, Virat Kohli taking up captaincy duties. The team signed Prasanth Parameswaran who played for Kochi Tuskers Kerala in the 2011 IPL as a replacement for the injured Sreenath Aravind. A spectacular chase against Deccan Chargers at Bangalore and two routs in Mumbai and Pune put the team back on track for a place in the play-offs. RCB went down to Mumbai in a hard fought match at Bangalore but bounced back in Delhi as Chris Gayle became the first man to hit 3 centuries in the IPL, hitting 128* at Delhi.\\r\\nOther results in the tournament now placed RCB in direct competition with Chennai for the final play-offs slot. The teams were tied on points with Chennai ahead on Net Run Rate but RCB had a game in hand while Chennai had played out their games. A batting failure at Hyderabad in RCBs final game of the season led to the end of the teams 2012 campaign, making it the first time since 2009 that they failed to qualify for both the play-offs and the Champions League. Chris Gayle was the highest run scorer of the tournament for the second year in a row, scoring 733 runs at 61.08 with 7 fifties, 1 hundred and a strike rate of 160.74. Vinay Kumar finished as the 5th highest wicket taker of the tournament with his 19 wickets from 17 matches.\\r\\nBefore the auction RCB released Mohammad Kaif, Charl Langeveldt, Dirk Nannes, Luke Pomersbach and Rilee Rossouw. At the auction RCB bought Christopher Barnwell, Daniel Christian, Moiss Henriques, Ravi Rampaul, Pankaj Singh, R. P. Singh and Jaydev Unadkat. RCB kicked off their campaign by winning their first 6 home games starting with a 2 run win over Mumbai Indians where Chris Gayle scored 92* off 58 balls and Vinay Kumar picking up 3 wickets. But they suffered a super-over defeat to newly formed Sunrisers Hyderabad but then they beat the same opponents convincingly by 6 wickets where Virat Kohli smashed a brilliant 93*.They also beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 8 wickets. Gayle and Kohli were in tremendous form with the bat while Vinay Kumar was the hero with ball. RCB suffered a shock in the next match against Chennai Super Kings where R.P.Singh conceded a no-ball of the last ball of the match which was a catch.However,the team rallied back to win their next 3 games.One of the matches against Pune Warriors India saw Chris Gayle smash 175 off just 66 balls which was the highest individual score in T20 cricket and RCB put up 263-5 which was the highest total in T20 cricket. Pune never fought back in the chase and eventually lost the match by 130 runs. People often nickname Bangalore as \\"Ban-gayle-ore\\". However,the team began to lose matches away from home.One of the matches against Punjab saw David Miller score 101 off just 38 balls to guide Punjab to an unlikely victory. RCB only managed to beat Pune Warriors India and Delhi Daredevils away from home. They were now in direct competition with Sunrisers Hyderabad with 16 points from 13 matches who were also with 16 points from 13 matches.A batting failure against Kolkata and a poor fielding and bowling performance against Punjab at Bangalore left RCB in a do or die situation in their last league match against Chennai Super Kings at Bangalore. Fortunately, RCB registered a stunning win in their last match which was affected by rain. Now, RCB could only qualify for playoffs if Kolkata would beat Hyderabad. Unfortunately, Sunrisers Hyderabad won the match convincingly by 5 wickets which ended RCB's 2013 campaign. Chris Gayle was the leading run scorer for the team, scoring 708 runs and Vinay Kumar was the leading wicket taker by taking 22 wickets.\\r\\nVirat Kohli was named the captain of RCB team. Before the auction, Ab de Villiers, Chris Gayle and Virat Kohli were retained from the previous seasons.The players bought in the 2014 auctions were Albie Morkel, Mitchell Starc, Ravi Rampaul, Parthiv Patel, Ashok Dinda, Muttiah Muralitharan, Nic Maddinson, Harshal Patel, Varun Aaron, Vijay Zol and Yuvraj Singh who was the most expensive player fetching a massive 14 crore. They ended up 7th in the points table and didn't qualify for the playoffs.\\r\\nRCB retained Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Chris Gayle, Mitchell Starc, Ashok Dinda, Varun Aaron, Harshal Patel, Yuzvendra Chahal, Nic Maddinson, Rilee Rossouw, Abu Nechim, Yogesh Takawale, Vijay Zol and Sandeep Warrier for the 2015 Indian Premier League.They also bought Manvinder Bisla and Iqbal Abdulla from Kolkata Knight Riders and Mandeep Singh from Kings XI Punjab during the Transfer Window. They bought Darren Sammy, David Wiese, Adam Milne, Sean Abbott, Subramaniam Badrinath, Jalaj Saxena, Sarfaraz Khan and Dinesh Karthik for ?10.5 crore (US$1.6?million) from the 2015 Player Auctions.\\r\\nRoyal Challengers Bangalore started their season with an unconvincing win against KKR at Kolkata, supported by a knock of 96 by Chris Gayle. But they lost their next three matches in Bengaluru to SRH, MI, and CSK. Two great bowling performances ensured RCB secured dominant wins against RR and DD, winning by 9 wickets and 10 wickets respectively. Their next match against RR got washed out after a strong batting performance from RCB. They lost a close match to CSK, but recovered by crushing Kings XI Punjab by 138 runs, supported by a century by Chris Gayle, and a four wicket haul for Sreenath Aravind and Mitchell Starc. Royal Challengers' good form continued when AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli smashed the highest T20 partnership ever (later beaten by the same pair in IPL 2016) against Mumbai Indians, to secure a good win. Later, RCB lost to Kings XI Punjab in a rain affected match, putting their playoff qualification in doubt. They faced SRH in the next match, again affected by rain. Amidst a lot of drama, and stunning performances from Virat Kohli and Gayle, RCB won an unlikely match in Hyderabad. Now, the only way they could be out of the playoffs became very unlikely, yet possible. RCB lost their chance to be placed second in the points table after rain washed out their final match against DD.\\r\\nThey ended the league stage at the third position, with 7 wins from 14 matches. On 20 May, they faced the Rajasthan Royals in the Eliminator and earned a spot in Qualifier 2. However, they lost to the Chennai Super Kings in the Qualifier 2, and ended the season finishing third. Ab de Villiers, Virat Kohli, and Chris Gayle, ended by being the 4th, 5th, and 6th highest run scorers of the season respectively, while Yuzvendra Chahal was RCB's highest wicket taker, being the 3rd highest in the season.\\r\\nIn light of financial scandals involving owner/chairman Vijay Mallya, Amrit Thomas became the chairman of the Royal Challengers. RCB changed the team logo and also became the first team in IPL to adopt different jerseys for home and away matches. Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Chris Gayle, Mitchell Starc, David Wiese, Adam Milne, Varun Aaron, Mandeep Singh, Harshal Patel, Kedar Jadhav, Sarfaraz Khan, Sreenath Aravind, Yuzvendra Chahal, and Abu Nechim were retained by RCB for the 2016 Indian Premier League. From player auctions, they bought Shane Watson for ?9.5 crore (US$1.4?million), Kane Richardson and Stuart Binny for ?2 crore each, and Travis Head and Samuel Badree for ?50 lakhs each. Other players that joined the team were Sachin Baby, Iqbal Abdulla, Praveen Dubey, Akshay Karnewar, Vikramjeet Malik and Vikas Tokas. KL Rahul and Parvez Rasool also joined RCB for the IPL 2016 edition.\\r\\nRoyal Challengers Bangalore started their season with a blitz from AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli against SRH at Bengaluru, to comfortably win their first match. A bludgeoning century from Quinton de Kock meant RCB lost their second match of the season. Their form deteriorated in the coming matches, winning only one match of the next five. Although, Virat Kohli and AB de Villier's brilliant form, along with the emergence of KL Rahul as an important member of RCB's batting, were positive points. Royal Challengers needed to win at least 6 of their next seven matches to have a chance at qualifying for the playoffs. They won matches against KXIP and Rising Pune Supergiant, the new entrant in the tournament. But a loss against Mumbai Indians meant they needed 4 wins in 4 matches to qualify. Since then, Virat Kohli found himself in sublime form, with captaincy and the bat. RCB most notably defeated the Gujarat Lions by 144 runs, the highest margin in IPL history, during this 4 match winning streak. Through other match results, RCB ended at an unlikely second position at the end of the league stage. Virat Kohli dominated the run-scoring list, while Shane Watson and Yuzvendra Chahal collectively topped the wicket taking list at the end of the league stage. They faced the Gujarat Lions in the Qualifier 1 at their home ground, the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. They won by 4 wickets to make it to their third final in nine seasons. They played the final against SRH, again in Bengaluru. RCB lost a hard fought match by 8 runs, to end as runners up in this ninth season of the IPL. This is the third instance of RCB losing the finals in the IPL.\\r\\nYuzvendra Chahal and Shane Watson ended second and third respectively on the list for most wickets.\\r\\nAt the launch event of his biography, 'Driven: The Virat Kohli Story' in New Delhi, in October 2016, Kohli announced that RCB would be his permanent IPL franchise that he would play for.[10][11]\\r\\nVirat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Chris Gayle, Mitchell Starc, Adam Milne, Mandeep Singh, Harshal Patel, Kedar Jadhav, Sarfaraz Khan, Sreenath Aravind, Yuzvendra Chahal, Shane Watson, Stuart Binny, Travis Head, Samuel Badree, Sachin Baby, Iqbal Abdulla, Praveen Dubey and KL Rahul were retained by RCB for the 2017 Indian Premier League. From player auctions, they bought Tymal Mills for ?12 crore (US$1.8?million), Aniket Chaudhary for ?2 crores, Pawan Negi for ?1 crore and Billy Stanlake for ?30 lakhs. Mitchell Starc dropped out of the season to prepare for the Champions Trophy which led to the management to replace him with Tymal Mills. The team was the worst hit with injuries as their captain Virat Kohli and AB De Villiers did not play for the initial matches which led to the making of Shane Watson as the interim captain. Even their star players KL Rahul and Sarfaraz Khan were ruled out of the season due to their prolonged injuries.\\r\\nThey lost their first match of the season as they were bundled out by 172 and lost by 35 runs to Sunrisers Hyderabad in Hyderabad. But they won their second match against Delhi Daredevils in their home ground. However, they lost the next three matches in a row against Kings XI Punjab, Mumbai Indians and Rising Pune Supergiant respectively. Through AB De Villiers made a quick fire 89 off 46 balls, RCB lost the match against Kings XI Punjab as the other players made 57 dot balls. The match against Mumbai Indians saw Virat Kohli's comeback with a quick 62 off 47 balls and Samuel Badree becoming the 14th player in the IPL history to claim a hat-trick, but the lost the match as Pollard made 70 off 47 balls to win the match for them. They lost the match against Rising Pune Supergiant by a massive 27 runs. But in their next game against Gujarat Lions, they won by 20 runs and coincidentally Chris Gayle became the first player to score 10,000 runs in T20s. However, in their next game against Kolkata Knight Riders,on the day when RCB made 263/5 against Pune Warriors India which was the highest IPL score in 2013, they were bundled out for 49 all out which is the lowest IPL score and also where no batsman could score 10 runs. They kept losing matches consecutively as they could not make high scores and their big guns-Chris Gayle, Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers failing repeatedly. The pitch in M.Chinnaswamy Stadium was changed from a usual batting to the bowling pitch which made the batsman struggle for runs. They ended up at the bottom of the table and the changed their squad for each match which was the reason for its downfall. However, they finished their miserable season on a high note after winning against Delhi Daredevils by 10 runs in Delhi. They made low scores like 49 all out against Kolkata Knight Riders, 96/9 against Rising Pune Supergiant and 119 all out against Kings XI Punjab.\\r\\nVijay Mallya wanted to associate one of his top-selling liquor brands, either McDowell's No.1 or Royal Challenge with the team.[12] The latter was chosen, hence the name.\\r\\nThe logo initially consisted the RC emblem in yellow on a circular red base with the black text \\"Royal Challengers Bangalore\\" in standard format surrounding circular logo. The RC crown emblem with the roaring lion placed on the top of the logo was derived from the original Royal Challenge logo. No significant changes took place in the design of the logo except for the replacement of colour yellow with gold from 2009. This logo also had a dotted white circle around the RC emblem. The team also uses an alternate logo for the Game for Green matches where the green plants surround the logo and the text Game for Green is placed below the logo. The logo was redesigned in 2016 with the inclusion of black as a secondary color. The lion emblem in the crest was enlarged and the shield was omitted in the new design.\\r\\nThe jersey colors of the team in 2008 were red and golden yellow, the same as the unofficial Kannada flag,[13] with player names printed in white and numbers printed in black in the rear. Yellow was eliminated in future seasons and was replaced with gold. Starting from 2010, blue was introduced on the apparel as a tertiary colour. The jersey design saw tweaks every season, major being the one for 2014 where blue dominated over gold. From 2014, the player names and numbers were printed in gold. As of 2015, more yellowish shade of gold is being used on the jerseys. The blue was completely eliminated in 2016 and was replaced by black as the third colour in the two versions of the jersey - one for home matches and the other for away ones. Reebok manufactured kits for the team from 2008 to 2014. As of 2016, Zeven manufactures the kits for the team.[14]\\r\\nThe theme song of the team for the 2008 season was \\"Jeetenge Hum Shaan Se\\". The team anthem, \\"Game for More\\" was created for the 2009 season. The music was composed by Amit Trivedi and written by Anshu Sharma. A new anthem, \\"Here We Go The Royal Challengers\\" was created for the 2013 season and was used till 2015. The anthem \\"Play Bold\\" was composed by SalimÿSulaiman, sung by Siddharth Basrur and was released in 2016 during the launch of jerseys for the season. For 2017, the same anthem was recomposed and sung by Anand Bhaskar in 6 languages - English, Kannada, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi and Punjabi.\\r\\nKatrina Kaif was roped in as the brand ambassador for the team in 2008, but later stepped down due to her prior commitments with filmmakers.Deepika Padukone, Ramya, Puneeth Rajkumar, Upendra and Ganesh have been the ambassadors for the team in the initial seasons.[15] Shiva Rajkumar is the brand Ambassador for the season 11 .\\r\\nMallya's home brand Royal Challenge became the primary sponsor of the team from the start of the Indian Premier League in 2008. Since then United Spirits Limited (now a subsidiary of Diageo) used almost all advertisement slots on the apparel for the promotion of their brands. Kingfisher, McDowell's No.1, Whyte and Mackay, White Mischief were prominently advertised on the jerseys in the initial seasons. In 2014, for the first time, Huawei, a non-home brand acquired the main slot on the jersey for two seasons. In 2016 and 2017, Hero Cycles and Gionee took over at the head jersey sponsors respectively. In 2018 Eros Now have officially announced to sponsor the jersey of the team.\\r\\nIn 2015, the team had United Spirits, Huawei and Kingfisher as the principal sponsors. Midea, Tata Motors (labeled Tata Bolt), Britannia Industries, TGS Constructions, 7 UP, Ed Hardy, Allen Career Institute, DNA Network, Mallya Hospital, Fever 104 FM, Redbus, Uber and Adidas were the associate sponsors.\\r\\nIn 2016, RCB had its own brand Kingfisher by United Breweries Group along with Hero Cycles as the principle sponsors. Lloyd Air Conditioners, LYF, Tata Zest, Britannia, Himalaya Men, Acer, Ola were the associate sponsors. Zeven, a multi sports apparel brand by Mahesh Bhupathi and Shikhar Dhawan replaced Adidas as the kit sponsors. 7 UP, Manipal Hospitals, Fever 104 FM and DNA Network were the official partners for 2016.\\r\\nAs of 2017, while Zeven continued to manufacture kits for the team, Gionee became the principal sponsor. Lloyd Air Conditioners, Jio, Karnataka Tourism Jungle Lodges & Resorts, Himalaya Men, Duroflex Mattresses and 7 UPwere the associate sponsors. Other official partners included Gatorade, Wrogn, Boost, Tissot, Radio Mirchi, Acer, DNA Network, AbhiBus.com, Nissin and Galileo-iNurture.\\r\\nThe team prominently displayed the liquor brands owned by Vijay Mallya through UB Group such as Royal Challenge, McDowells No.1, White Mischief, Kingfisher etc. until 2013. In the 2014 season, no liquor brands were advertised on the apparel, however Royal Challenge Sports Gear and Kingfisher Packaged Drinking Water are displayed on the jerseys.\\r\\nThe Royal Challengers have a huge and passionate fan base all over India and especially in the city of Bangalore. The fans, known to be \\"loyal\\" and vocal in their support,[17] often turn up in large numbers for RCB's home matches turning the stadium into what is called a \\"sea of red\\".[18][19][20] They are well known for their chants of \\"R-C-B, R-C-B\\"[21][22] and the co-ordinated Mexican wave at the Chinnaswamy.[23] The stadium organisers sometimes provide the home team fans with cheer kits, RCB flags and noisemakers among other items.[24] Royal Challengers Bangalore have formed a fan-following group named as Bold Army.\\r\\nDuring the 2014 IPL, the Royal Challengers became the first team to provide free Wi-Fi connectivity to fans at their home ground. 50 access points were set up using fibre optic cables to provide the connectivity to fans on match days at the Chinnaswamy.[25]\\r\\nLast Updated on 8 May 2018 [27]","input":"How many times did rcb come to finals?"},{"output":"October 26, 2001","context":"","input":"When was the patriot act signed into law?"},{"output":"September 9, 1850","context":"","input":"When did california become part of the union?"},{"output":"Buckingham House","context":"St James's Palace is the most senior royal palace in the United Kingdom. Located in the City of Westminster, although no longer the principal residence of the monarch, it is the ceremonial meeting place of the Accession Council and the London residence of several members of the royal family.\\r\\nBuilt by King Henry VIII on the site of a leper hospital dedicated to Saint James the Less, the palace was secondary in importance to the Palace of Whitehall for most Tudor and Stuart monarchs. The palace increased in importance during the reigns of the early Georgian monarchy, but was displaced by Buckingham Palace in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. After decades of being used increasingly for only formal occasions, the move was formalised by Queen Victoria in 1837. Today the palace houses a number of official offices, societies and collections and all ambassadors and high commissioners to the United Kingdom are still accredited to the Court of St James's.\\r\\nMainly built between 1531 and 1536 in red-brick, the palace's architecture is primarily Tudor in style. A fire in 1809 destroyed parts of the structure, including the monarch's private apartments, which were never replaced. Some 17th-century interiors survive, but most were remodelled in the 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe palace was commissioned by Henry VIII, on the site of a former leper hospital dedicated to Saint James the Less.[n 1] The new palace, secondary in the king's interest to Henry's Whitehall Palace, was constructed between 1531 and 1536 as a smaller residence to escape formal court life.[2] Much smaller than the nearby Whitehall, St James's was arranged around a number of courtyards, including the Colour Court, the Ambassador's Court and the Friary Court. The most recognisable feature is the north gatehouse; constructed with four storeys, the gatehouse has two crenellated flanking octagonal towers at its corners and a central clock dominating the uppermost floor and gable; the clock is a later addition, and dates from 1731.[3] It is decorated with the initials H.A. for Henry and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. Henry constructed the palace in red brick, with detail picked out in darker brick.[2]\\r\\nThe palace was remodelled in 1544, with ceilings painted by Hans Holbein, and was described as a \\"pleasant royal house\\".[4] Two of Henry VIII's children died at Saint James's, Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset[5] and Mary I.[6] Elizabeth I often resided at the palace, and is said to have spent the night there while waiting for the Spanish Armada to sail up the Channel.[4]\\r\\nIn 1638, Charles I gave the palace to Marie de Medici, the mother of his wife Henrietta Maria. Marie remained in the palace for three years, but the residence of a Catholic former queen of France proved unpopular with parliament and she was soon asked to leave for Cologne. Charles I spent his final night at St James's before his execution.[1] Oliver Cromwell then took it over, and turned it into barracks during the English Commonwealth period. Charles II, James II, Mary II and Anne were all born at the palace.[1]\\r\\nThe palace was restored by Charles II following the demise of the Commonwealth, laying out St James's Park at the same time. It became the principal residence of the monarch in London in 1698, during the reign of William III and Mary II after Whitehall Palace was destroyed by fire, and became the administrative centre of the monarchy, a role it retains.\\r\\nThe first two monarchs of the House of Hanover used St James's Palace as their principal London residence. George I and George II both housed their mistresses, the Duchess of Kendal and the Countess of Suffolk respectively, at the palace.[1] In 1757, George II donated the Palace library to the British Museum;[7] this gift was the first part of what later became the Royal Collection.[8] In 1809, a fire destroyed part of the palace, including the monarch's private apartments at the south east corner. These apartments were not replaced, leaving the Queen's Chapel in isolation, and Marlborough Road now runs between the two buildings.[citation needed]\\r\\nGeorge III found St James's increasingly unsuitable. The Tudor palace was regarded as uncomfortable and too cramped for his ever-growing family. In 1762 George purchased Buckingham House?ÿ the predecessor to Buckingham Palace?ÿ for his queen, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz [9] The royal family began to spend the majority of their time at Buckingham House, with St James's being used for only the most formal of occasions; thrice-weekly leves and public audiences were still held there. In the late 18th century, George III refurbished the state apartments but neglected the living quarters.[10] Queen Victoria formalised the move in 1837, ending St James's status as the primary residence of the monarch. It was nevertheless where Victoria married her husband, Prince Albert, in 1840, and where, eighteen years later, Victoria and Albert's eldest child, Princess Victoria, married her husband, Prince Frederick of Prussia.[1]\\r\\nFor most of the time of the personal union between Great Britain (later the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) and the Electorate of Hanover from 1714 until 1837 the ministers of the German Chancery were working in two small rooms within St James's Palace.[citation needed]\\r\\nSecond Round Table Conference (September ÿ December 1931) pertaining to Indian independence was held here. On 12 June 1941, Representatives of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and of the exiled governments of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Yugoslavia, as well as General de Gaulle of France, met and signed the Declaration of St James's Palace which was the first of six treaties signed that established the United Nations and composed the Charter of the United Nations.[11]\\r\\nSt James's Palace is still a working palace, and the Royal Court is still formally based there, despite the monarch residing elsewhere. It is also the London residence of the Princess Royal; Princess Beatrice of York; Princess Eugenie of York; and Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy. The palace is used to host official receptions, such as those of visiting heads of state, and charities of which members of the royal family are patrons. The Palace forms part of a sprawling complex of buildings housing Court offices and officials' apartments. The immediate palace complex includes York House, the former home of the Prince of Wales and his sons, Princes William and Harry. Lancaster House located next-door, is used by HM Government for official receptions, and the nearby Clarence House, the former home of the Queen Mother is now the residence of the Prince of Wales.[12]\\r\\nThe nearby Queen's Chapel, built by Inigo Jones, adjoins St James's Palace. While the Queen's Chapel is open to the public at selected times, the Chapel Royal in the palace is not accessible to the public. They both remain active places of worship.[12]\\r\\nThe offices of the Royal Collection Department, the Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps, the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the Chapel Royal, the Gentlemen at Arms, the Yeomen of the Guard and the Queen's Watermen are all housed at St James's Palace.

John Simon says that A Dolls House is \\"the British term for what we call a 'dollhouse'\\".[6] Egil T?rnqvist says of the alternative title: \\"Rather than being superior to the traditional rendering, it simply sounds more idiomatic to Americans.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe play opens at Christmas time as Nora Helmer enters her home carrying many packages. Nora's husband Torvald is working in his study when she arrives. He playfully rebukes her for spending so much money on Christmas gifts, calling her his \\"little squirrel.\\" He teases her about how the previous year she had spent weeks making gifts and ornaments by hand because money was scarce. This year Torvald is due a promotion at the bank where he works, so Nora feels that they can let themselves go a little. The maid announces two visitors: Mrs. Kristine Linde, an old friend of Nora's, who has come seeking employment; and Dr. Rank, a close friend of the family, who is let into the study. Kristine has had a difficult few years, ever since her husband died leaving her with no money or children. Nora says that things have not been easy for them either: Torvald became sick, and they had to travel to Italy so he could recover. Kristine explains that when her mother was ill she had to take care of her brothers, but now that they are grown she feels her life is \\"unspeakably empty.\\" Nora promises to talk to Torvald about finding her a job. Kristine gently tells Nora that she is like a child. Nora is offended, so she teases the idea that she got money from \\"some admirer,\\" so they could travel to Italy to improve Torvald's health. She told Torvald that her father gave her the money, but in fact she managed to illegally borrow it without his knowledge because women couldn't do anything economical like signing checks without their husband. Over the years, she has been secretly working and saving up to pay it off.\\r\\nKrogstad, a lower-level employee at Torvald's bank, arrives and goes into the study. Nora is clearly uneasy when she sees him. Dr. Rank leaves the study and mentions that he feels wretched, though like everyone he wants to go on living. In contrast to his physical illness, he says that the man in the study, Krogstad, is \\"morally diseased.\\"\\r\\nAfter the meeting with Krogstad, Torvald comes out of the study. Nora asks him if he can give Kristine a position at the bank and Torvald is very positive, saying that this is a fortunate moment, as a position has just become available. Torvald, Kristine, and Dr. Rank leave the house, leaving Nora alone. The nanny returns with the children and Nora plays with them for a while until Krogstad creeps into the living room and surprises her. Krogstad tells Nora that Torvald intends to fire him at the bank and asks her to intercede with Torvald to allow him to keep his job. She refuses, and Krogstad threatens to blackmail her about the loan she took out for the trip to Italy; he knows that she obtained this loan by forging her father's signature. Krogstad leaves and when Torvald returns, Nora tries to convince him not to fire Krogstad. Torvald refuses to hear her pleas, explaining that Krogstad is a liar and a hypocrite and that he committed a terrible crime: he forged someone's name. Torvald feels physically ill in the presence of a man \\"poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation.\\"\\r\\nKristine arrives to help Nora repair a dress for a costume function that she and Torvald plan to attend the next day. Torvald returns from the bank, and Nora pleads with him to reinstate Krogstad, claiming she is worried Krogstad will publish libelous articles about Torvald and ruin his career. Torvald dismisses her fears and explains that, although Krogstad is a good worker and seems to have turned his life around, he must be fired because he is not deferential enough to Torvald in front of other bank personnel. Torvald then retires to his study to work.\\r\\nDr. Rank, the family friend, arrives. Nora asks him for a favor, but Rank responds by revealing that he has entered the terminal stage of tuberculosis of the spine and that he has always been secretly in love with her. Nora tries to deny the first revelation and make light of it, but is more disturbed by his declaration of love. She tries clumsily to tell him that she is not in love with him, but that she loves him dearly as a friend.\\r\\nDesperate after being fired by Torvald, Krogstad arrives at the house. Nora convinces Dr. Rank to go into Torvald's study so he will not see Krogstad. When Krogstad confronts Nora, he declares that he no longer cares about the remaining balance of Nora's loan, but that he will instead preserve the associated bond to blackmail Torvald into not only keeping him employed but also promoting him. Nora explains that she has done her best to persuade her husband, but he refuses to change his mind. Krogstad informs Nora that he has written a letter detailing her crime (forging her father's signature of surety on the bond) and put it in Torvald's mailbox, which is locked.\\r\\nNora tells Kristine of her difficult situation. Having had a relationship with Krogstad in the past before her marriage, Kristine says that they are still in love and promises to try to convince him to relent.\\r\\nTorvald enters and tries to retrieve his mail, but Nora distracts him by begging him to help her with the dance she has been rehearsing for the costume party, feigning anxiety about performing. She dances so badly and acts so childishly that Torvald agrees to spend the whole evening coaching her. When the others go to dinner, Nora stays behind for a few minutes and contemplates killing herself to save her husband from the shame of the revelation of her crime and to pre-empt any gallant gesture on his part to save her reputation.\\r\\nKristine tells Krogstad that she only married her husband because she had no other means to support her sick mother and young siblings and that she has returned to offer him her love again. She believes that he would not have stooped to unethical behavior if he had not been devastated by her abandonment and been in dire financial straits. Krogstad changes his mind and offers to take back his letter to Torvald. However, Kristine decides that Torvald should know the truth for the sake of his and Nora's marriage.\\r\\nAfter literally dragging Nora home from the party, Torvald goes to check his mail but is interrupted by Dr. Rank, who has followed them. Dr. Rank chats for a while, conveying obliquely to Nora that this is a final goodbye, as he has determined that his death is near. Dr. Rank leaves, and Torvald retrieves his letters. As he reads them, Nora steels herself to take her life. Torvald confronts her with Krogstad's letter. Enraged, he declares that he is now completely in Krogstad's power; he must yield to Krogstad's demands and keep quiet about the whole affair. He berates Nora, calling her a dishonest and immoral woman and telling her that she is unfit to raise their children. He says that from now on their marriage will be only a matter of appearances.\\r\\nA maid enters, delivering a letter to Nora. The letter is from Krogstad, yet Torvald demands to read the letter and takes it from Nora. Torvald exults that he is saved, as Krogstad has returned the incriminating bond, which Torvald immediately burns along with Krogstad's letters. He takes back his harsh words to his wife and tells her that he forgives her. Nora realizes that her husband is not the strong and gallant man she thought he was, and that he truly loves himself more than he does her.\\r\\nTorvald explains that when a man has forgiven his wife it makes him love her all the more since it reminds him that she is totally dependent on him, like a child. He dismisses the fact that Nora had to make the agonizing choice between her conscience and his health, and ignores her years of secret efforts to free them from the ensuing obligations and the danger of loss of reputation. He preserves his peace of mind by thinking of the incident as a mere mistake that she made owing to her dumbness, one of her most endearing feminine traits.\\r\\nNora, in Ibsen's A Doll's House (1879)\\r\\nNora tells Torvald that she is leaving him, and in a confrontational scene between the two of them, she expresses her reasons and explanations. She reminds him of harsh things he has said about her and about her ability to raise their children. She says he has never loved her, they have become strangers to each other. She feels betrayed by his response to the scandal involving Krogstad, and she says she must get away to understand herself. She has lost her religion. She says that she has been treated like a doll to play with for her whole life, first by her father and then by him. Concerned for the family reputation, Torvald insists that she fulfill her duty as a wife and mother, but Nora says that she has duties to herself that are just as important, and that she cannot be a good mother or wife without learning to be more than a plaything. She reveals that she had expected that he would want to sacrifice his reputation for hers and that she had planned to kill herself to prevent him from doing so. She now realizes that Torvald is not at all the kind of person she had believed him to be and that their marriage has been based on mutual fantasies and misunderstandings.\\r\\nTorvald is unable to comprehend Nora's point of view, since it contradicts all that he has been taught about the female mind throughout his life. Furthermore, he is so narcissistic that it is impossible for him to understand how he appears to her, as selfish, hypocritical, and more concerned with public reputation than with actual morality. Nora leaves her keys and wedding ring, and as Torvald breaks down and begins to cry, baffled by what has happened, Nora leaves the house, slamming the door behind her. Whether or not she ever comes back is never made clear.\\r\\nIbsen's German agent felt that the original ending would not play well in German theatres. Therefore, for it to be considered acceptable, Ibsen was forced to write an alternative ending for the German premiere. In this ending, Nora is led to her children after having argued with Torvald. Seeing them, she collapses, and the curtain is brought down. Ibsen later called the ending a disgrace to the original play and referred to it as a \\"barbaric outrage\\".[9] Virtually all productions today use the original ending, as do nearly all of the film versions of the play.\\r\\nA Doll's House was based on the life of Laura Kieler (maiden name Laura Smith Petersen), a good friend of Ibsen. Much that happened between Nora and Torvald happened to Laura and her husband, Victor. Similar to the events in the play, Laura signed an illegal loan to save her husband. She wanted the money to find a cure for her husband's tuberculosis.[10] She wrote to Ibsen, asking for his recommendation of her work to his publisher, thinking that the sales of her book would repay her debt. At his refusal, she forged a check for the money. At this point she was found out. In real life, when Victor discovered about Laura's secret loan, he divorced her and had her committed to an asylum. Two years later, she returned to her husband and children at his urging, and she went on to become a well-known Danish author, living to the age of 83.\\r\\nIbsen wrote A Doll's House at the point when Laura Kieler had been committed to the asylum, and the fate of this friend of the family shook him deeply, perhaps also because Laura had asked him to intervene at a crucial point in the scandal, which he did not feel able or willing to do. Instead, he turned this life situation into an aesthetically shaped, successful drama. In the play, Nora leaves Torvald with head held high, though facing an uncertain future given the limitations single women faced in the society of the time.\\r\\nKieler eventually rebounded from the shame of the scandal and had her own successful writing career while remaining discontented with sole recognition as \\"Ibsen's Nora\\" years afterwards.[11][12]\\r\\nIbsen started thinking about the play around May 1878, although he did not begin its first draft until a year later, having reflected on the themes and characters in the intervening period (he visualised its protagonist, Nora, for instance, as having approached him one day wearing \\"a blue woollen dress\\").[13] He outlined his conception of the play as a \\"modern tragedy\\" in a note written in Rome on 19 October 1878.[14] \\"A woman cannot be herself in modern society,\\" he argues, since it is \\"an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint.\\"[15]\\r\\nIbsen sent a fair copy of the completed play to his publisher on 15 September 1879.[16] It was first published in Copenhagen on 4 December 1879, in an edition of 8,000 copies that sold out within a month; a second edition of 3,000 copies followed on 4 January 1880, and a third edition of 2,500 was issued on 8 March.[17]\\r\\nA Doll's House received its world premiere on 21 December 1879 at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, with Betty Hennings as Nora, Emil Poulsen as Torvald, and Peter Jerndorff as Dr. Rank.[18] Writing for the Norwegian newspaper Folkets Avis, the critic Erik B?gh admired Ibsen's originality and technical mastery: \\"Not a single declamatory phrase, no high dramatics, no drop of blood, not even a tear.\\"[19] Every performance of its run was sold out.[20] Another production opened at the Royal Theatre in Stockholm, on 8 January 1880, while productions in Christiania (with Johanne Juell as Nora and Arnoldus Reimers as Torvald) and Bergen followed shortly after.[21]\\r\\nIn Germany, the actress Hedwig Niemann-Raabe refused to perform the play as written, declaring, \\"I would never leave my children!\\"[20] Since the playwright's wishes were not protected by copyright, Ibsen decided to avoid the danger of being rewritten by a lesser dramatist by committing what he called a \\"barbaric outrage\\" on his play himself and giving it an alternative ending in which Nora did not leave.[22][23] A production of this version opened in Flensburg in February 1880.[24] This version was also played in Hamburg, Dresden, Hanover, and Berlin, although, in the wake of protests and a lack of success, Niemann-Raabe eventually restored the original ending.[24] Another production of the original version, some rehearsals of which Ibsen attended, opened on 3 March 1880 at the Residenz Theatre in Munich.[24]\\r\\nIn Great Britain, the only way in which the play was initially allowed to be given in London was in an adaptation by Henry Arthur Jones and Henry Herman called Breaking a Butterfly.[25] This adaptation was produced at the Princess Theatre, 3 March 1884. Writing in 1896 in his book The Foundations of a National Drama, Jones says: \\"A rough translation from the German version of A Doll's House was put into my hands, and I was told that if it could be turned into a sympathetic play, a ready opening would be found for it on the London boards. I knew nothing of Ibsen, but I knew a great deal of Robertson and H. J. Byron. From these circumstances came the adaptation called Breaking a Butterfly.\\"[26] H. L. Mencken writes that it was A Dolls House denaturized and dephlogisticated.  Toward the middle of the action Ibsen was thrown to the fishes, and Nora was saved from suicide, rebellion, flight and immortality by making a faithful old clerk steal her fateful promissory note from Krogstads desk.  The curtain fell upon a happy home.[27]\\r\\nBefore 1899 there were two private productions of the play in London (in its original form as Ibsen wrote it)  one featured George Bernard Shaw in the role of Krogstad.[8] The first public British production of the play in its regular form opened on 7 June 1889 at the Novelty Theatre, starring Janet Achurch as Nora and Charles Charrington as Torvald.[28][29][30] Achurch played Nora again for a 7-day run in 1897. Soon after its London premiere, Achurch brought the play to Australia in 1889.[31]\\r\\nThe play was first seen in America in 1883 in Louisville, Kentucky; Helena Modjeska acted Nora.[29] The play made its Broadway premiere at the Palmer's Theatre on 21 December 1889, starring Beatrice Cameron as Nora Helmer.[32] It was first performed in France in 1894.[21] Other productions in the United States include one in 1902 starring Minnie Maddern Fiske, a 1937 adaptation with acting script by Thornton Wilder and starring Ruth Gordon, and a 1971 production starring Claire Bloom.\\r\\nA new translation by Zinnie Harris at the Donmar Warehouse, starring Gillian Anderson, Toby Stephens, Anton Lesser, Tara FitzGerald and Christopher Eccleston opened in May 2009.[33] In August 2013, Young Vic,[34] London, Great Britain, produced a new adaptation[35] of A Doll's House directed by Carrie Cracknell[36] based on the English language version by Simon Stephens. In September 2014, in partnership with Brisbane Festival, La Boite located in Brisbane, Australia, hosted an adaptation of A Doll's House written by Lally Katz and directed by Stephen Mitchell Wright.[37] In June 2015, Space Arts Centre in London staged an adaptation of A Doll's House featuring the discarded alternate ending.[38] 'Manaveli' Toronto is preparing to stage a Tamil version of A Doll's House(??? ?????????? ????)on 30th June 2018, Directed by Mr P Wikneswaran.[39]\\r\\nA Doll's House questions the traditional roles of men and women in 19th-century marriage.[22] To many 19th-century Europeans, this was scandalous. The covenant of marriage was considered holy, and to portray it as Ibsen did was controversial.[40] However, the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw found Ibsen's willingness to examine society without prejudice exhilarating.[41]\\r\\nThe Swedish playwright August Strindberg criticised the play in his volume of essays and short stories Getting Married (1884).[42] Strindberg questioned Noras walking out and leaving her children behind with a man that she herself disapproved of so much that she would not remain with him. Strindberg also considers that Noras involvement with an illegal financial fraud that involved Nora forging a signature, all done behind her husbands back, and then Noras lying to her husband regarding Krogstads blackmail, are serious crimes that should raise questions at the end of the play, when Nora is moralistically judging her husband. And Strindberg points out that Noras complaint that she and Torvald have never exchanged one serious word about serious things, is contradicted by the discussions that occur in act one and two.[43]\\r\\nThe reasons Nora leaves her husband are complex, and various details are hinted at throughout the play. In the last scene, she tells her husband she has been greatly wronged by his disparaging and condescending treatment of her, and his attitude towards her in their marriage  as though she were his doll wife  and the children in turn have become her dolls, leading her to doubt her own qualifications to raise her children. She is troubled by her husbands behavior in regard to the scandal of the loaned money. She does not love her husband, she feels they are strangers, she feels completely confused, and suggests that her issues are shared by many women. George Bernard Shaw suggests that she left to begin a journey in search of self-respect and apprenticeship to life, and that her revolt is the end of a chapter of human history.[8][44][3]\\r\\nIbsen was inspired by the belief that \\"a woman cannot be herself in modern society,\\" since it is \\"an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint.\\"[15] Its ideas can also be seen as having a wider application: Michael Meyer argued that the play's theme is not women's rights, but rather \\"the need of every individual to find out the kind of person he or she really is and to strive to become that person.\\"[45] In a speech given to the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights in 1898, Ibsen insisted that he \\"must disclaim the honor of having consciously worked for the women's rights movement,\\" since he wrote \\"without any conscious thought of making propaganda,\\" his task having been \\"the description of humanity.\\"[46]\\r\\nBecause of the departure from traditional behavior and theatrical convention involved in Nora's leaving home, her act of slamming the door as she leaves has come to represent the play itself.[47][48] One critic noted, \\"That slammed door reverberated across the roof of the world.\\"[49]\\r\\nA Doll's House has been adapted for the cinema on many occasions, including:\\r\\nA Doll's House By Henrik Ibsen (Summary, Book Review, Online Reading, PDF, Download)","input":"Where was a doll's house first performed?"},{"output":"the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO)","context":"Local residents\\r\\nCORE member\\r\\nSNCC members\\r\\nNAACP member\\r\\nState of Mississippi\\r\\nCongressman\\r\\nMSSC member\\r\\nKlan member\\r\\nFreedom Summer, or the Mississippi Summer Project, was a volunteer campaign in the United States launched in June 1964 to attempt to register as many African-American voters as possible in Mississippi. Blacks had been cut off from voting since the turn of the century due to barriers to voter registration and other laws. The project also set up dozens of Freedom Schools, Freedom Houses, and community centers in small towns throughout Mississippi to aid the local black population.\\r\\nThe project was organized by the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO), a coalition of the Mississippi branches of the four major civil rights organizations (SNCC, CORE, NAACP and SCLC). Most of the impetus, leadership, and financing for the Summer Project came from the SNCC. Robert Parris Moses (Bob Moses), SNCC field secretary and co-director of COFO, directed the summer project.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFreedom Summer was built on the years of earlier work by thousands of African Americans, connected through their churches, who lived in Mississippi. In 1963, SNCC organized a mock \\"Freedom Vote\\" designed to demonstrate the will of Black Mississippians to vote, if not impeded by terror and intimidation. The Mississippi voting registration procedure at the time required Blacks to fill out a 21-question registration form and to answer, to the satisfaction of the white registrars, a question on interpretation of any one of 285 sections of the state constitution.[2] The registrars ruled subjectively on the applicant's qualifications, and decided against most blacks, not allowing them to register.\\r\\nIn 1963, volunteers set up polling places in Black churches and business establishments across Mississippi. After registering on a simple registration form, voters would select candidates to run in the following year's election. Candidates included Rev. Edwin King of Tougaloo College and Aaron Henry, from Clarksdale, Mississippi.[3] Local civil rights workers and volunteers, along with students from northern universities, organized and implemented the mock election, in which tens of thousands voted.\\r\\nBy 1964, students and others had begun the process of integrating public accommodations, registering adults to vote, and above all strengthening a network of local leadership. Building on the efforts of 1963 (including the Freedom Ballot and registration efforts in Greenwood), Moses prevailed over doubts among SNCC and COFO workers, and planning for Freedom Summer began in February 1964. Speakers recruited for workers on college campuses across the country, drawing standing ovations for their dedication in braving the routine violence perpetrated by police, sheriffs, and others in Mississippi. SNCC recruiters interviewed dozens of potential volunteers, weeding out those with a \\"John Brown complex\\"[4][5] and informing others that their job that summer would not be to \\"save the Mississippi Negro\\" but to work with local leadership to develop the grassroots movement.\\r\\nMore than 1,000 out-of-state volunteers participated in Freedom Summer alongside thousands of black Mississippians. Volunteers were the brightest of their generation, came from the best universities from the biggest states, mostly from the North, usually were rich, 90 percent were white. Though SNCC's committee agreed to recruit only one hundred white students for the project in December 1963, white civil rights leaders such as Allard Lowenstein went on and recruited a much larger number of white volunteers, to bring more attention.[6] Two one-week orientation sessions for the volunteers were held at Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio (now part of Miami University), from June 14 to June 27,[7] after Berea College backed out of hosting the sessions due to alumni pressure against it.[8]\\r\\nOrganizers focused on Mississippi because it had the lowest percentage of any state in the country of African Americans registered to vote, and they constituted more than one-third of the population. In 1962 only 6.7% of eligible black voters were registered.[9]\\r\\nSouthern states had effectively disenfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites in the period from 1890 to 1910 by passing state constitutions, amendments and other laws that imposed burdens on voter registration: charging poll taxes, requiring literacy tests administered subjectively by white registrars, making residency requirements more difficult, as well as elaborate record keeping to document required items. They maintained this exclusion of blacks from politics well into the 1960s, which extended to excluding them from juries and imposing Jim Crow segregation laws for public facilities.\\r\\nMost of these methods survived US Supreme Court challenges and, if overruled, states had quickly developed new ways to exclude blacks, such as use of grandfather clauses and white primaries. In some cases, would-be voters were harassed economically, as well as by physical assault. Lynchings had been high at the turn of the century and continued for years.[10]\\r\\nDuring the ten weeks of Freedom Summer, a number of other organizations provided support for the COFO Summer Project. More than 100 volunteer doctors, nurses, psychologists, medical students and other medical professionals from the Medical Committee for Human Rights (MCHR) provided emergency care for volunteers and local activists, taught health education classes, and advocated improvements in Mississippi's segregated health system.\\r\\nVolunteer lawyers from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund Inc (\\"Ink Fund\\"), National Lawyers Guild, Lawyer's Constitutional Defense Committee (LCDC) an arm of the ACLU, and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law (LCCR) provided free legal services  handling arrests, freedom of speech, voter registration and other matters.\\r\\nThe Commission on Religion and Race (CORR), an endeavor of the National Council of Churches (NCC), brought Christian and Jewish clergy and divinity students to Mississippi to support the work of the Summer Project. In addition to offering traditional religious support to volunteers and activists, the ministers and rabbis engaged in voting rights protests at courthouses, recruited voter applicants and accompanied them to register, taught in Freedom Schools, and performed office and other support functions.\\r\\nMany of Mississippi's white residents deeply resented the outsiders and any attempt to change the residents' society. Locals routinely harassed volunteers. Newspapers called them \\"unshaven and unwashed trash\\". The volunteers' presence in local black communities drew drive-by shootings, Molotov cocktails thrown at host homes, and constant harassment. State and local governments, the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission (which was tax-supported and spied on citizens), police, White Citizens' Council, and Ku Klux Klan used arrests, arson, beatings, evictions, firing, murder, spying, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent blacks from registering to vote or achieving social equality.[11]\\r\\nOver the course of the ten-week project:[12]\\r\\nVolunteers were attacked almost as soon as the campaign started. On June 21, 1964, James Chaney (a black Congress of Racial Equality [CORE] activist from Mississippi), Andrew Goodman (a summer volunteer), and Michael Schwerner (a CORE organizer) - both Jews from New York City - were arrested by Cecil Price, a Neshoba County deputy sheriff and KKK member. The three were held in jail until after nightfall, then released. They drove away into an ambush on the road by Klansmen, who abducted and killed them. Goodman and Schwerner were shot at point-blank range. Chaney was chased, beaten mercilessly, and shot three times. After weeks of searching in which federal law enforcement participated, on August 4, 1964, their bodies were found to have been buried in an earthen dam.[13] The men's disappearance the night of their release from jail was reported on TV and on newspaper front pages, shocking the nation. It drew massive media attention to Freedom Summer and to Mississippi's \\"closed society.\\"\\r\\nWhen the men went missing, SNCC and COFO workers began phoning the FBI requesting an investigation. The parents of the missing children were able to pressure on Washington that much, so they arranged the meetings with President Johnson and Attorney General Robert Kenedy. Finally, after some 36 hours, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy authorized the FBI to get involved in the search. FBI agents began swarming around Philadelphia, Mississippi, where Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner had been arrested after they had investigated the burning of a local black church that was a center for political organizing. For the next seven weeks, FBI agents and sailors from a nearby naval airbase searched for the bodies, wading into swamps and hacking through underbrush. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover went to Mississippi on July 10 to open the first FBI branch office there.\\r\\nThroughout the search, Mississippi newspapers and word-of-mouth perpetuated the common belief that the disappearance was \\"a hoax\\" designed to draw publicity. The search of rivers and swamps turned up the bodies of eight other blacks who appeared to have been murdered: a boy and seven men. Herbert Oarsby, a 14-year-old youth, was found wearing a CORE T-shirt. Charles Eddie Moore was among 600 students expelled in April 1964 from Alcorn A&M for participating in civil rights protests. After he returned home, he was abducted and killed by KKK members in Franklin County, Mississippi on May 2, 1964 with his friend Henry Hezekiah Dee.[14] The other five men were never identified. When they had been disappeared, their families could not get local law enforcement to investigate.\\r\\nWith participation in the regular Mississippi Democratic Party blocked by segregationists, COFO established the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) as a non-exclusionary rival to the regular party organization. It intended to gain recognition of the MFDP by the national Democratic Party as the legitimate party organization in Mississippi. Delegates were elected to go to the Democratic national convention to be held that year.\\r\\nBefore the convention was held, Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\\r\\nWhen the forces of white supremacy continued to block black voter registration, the Summer Project switched to building the MFDP. Though the MFDP challenge had wide support among many convention delegates, Lyndon B. Johnson feared losing Southern support in the coming campaign. He did not allow the MFDP to replace the regulars, but the continuing issue of political oppression in Mississippi was covered widely by the national press.\\r\\nIn addition to voter registration and the MFDP, the Summer Project also established a network of 30 to 40 voluntary summer schools ÿ called \\"Freedom Schools\\" ÿ as an alternative to Mississippi's totally segregated and underfunded schools for blacks. Over the course of the summer, more than 3,500 students attended Freedom Schools, which taught subjects that the public schools avoided, such as black history and constitutional rights.[15]\\r\\nFreedom Schools were held in churches, on back porches, and under the trees of Mississippi. Students ranged from small children to elderly adults, with the average age around 15. Most of the volunteer teachers were college students. Under the direction of Spelman College professor Staughton Lynd, the goal was to teach voter literacy, and political organization skills, as well as academic skills, and to help with confidence. The curriculum was directly linked to the formation of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. As Edwin King, who ran for Lieutenant Governor on the MFDP ticket, stated, \\"Our assumption was that the parents of the Freedom School children, when we met them at night, that the Freedom Democratic Party would be the PTA.\\"\\r\\nThe Freedom Schools operated on a basis of close interaction and mutual trust between teachers and students. The core curriculum focused on basic literacy and arithmetic, black history and current status, political processes, civil rights, and the freedom movement. The content varied from place to place and day to day according to the questions and interests of the students.[16]\\r\\nThe volunteer Freedom School teachers were as profoundly affected by their experience as were the students. Pam Parker, a teacher in the Holly Springs school, wrote of the experience:\\r\\nThe atmosphere in the class is unbelievable. It is what every teacher dreams about  real, honest enthusiasm and desire to learn anything and everything. The girls come to class of their own free will. They respond to everything that is said. They are excited about learning. They drain me of everything that I have to offer so that I go home at night completely exhausted but very happy in spirit...[17]\\r\\nApproximately fifty Freedom Libraries were established throughout Mississippi. These libraries provided library services and literacy guidance for many African Americans, some who had never had access to libraries before. Freedom Libraries ranged in size from a few hundred volumes to more than 20,000. The Freedom Libraries operated on small budgets and were usually run by volunteers. Some libraries were housed in newly constructed facilities while others were located in abandoned buildings.[18]\\r\\nThe volunteers were housed by local black families who refused to be intimidated by segregationist threats of violence. However, project organizers were unable to place all the volunteers in private homes. To accommodate the overflow, the remaining volunteers were placed either in the project office or in Freedom Houses. Volunteers believed that it was important to free themselves from their race and class backgrounds, so the Freedom Houses would become places where cultural exchange would happen, so the Freedom Houses were free from segregation.\\r\\nOf course, the practice of group living was already well established among American college students, for example, and soon the houses became communal living centers. Freedom houses also played a significant role in the volunteers' sexual activities during the summer. They considered themselves free from the restraints of racism and consequently free to truly love one another. As such, for many of them, interracial sex became the ultimate expression of SNCC ideology, which emphasized the notions of freedom and equality. At the beginning of the summer the Freedom Houses were places to accommodate the overflow of volunteers, but in the eyes of volunteers by the end of summer they had become structural and symbolical expressions of the link between personal and political change. One volunteer said:\\r\\n\\" You never knew what was going to happen [in the Freedom Houses] from one minute to the next  I slept on the cot on a kind of side porch andI'd drag in some nights and there'd be a wild party raging on the porch. So I'd drag my cot off in search of a quiet corner [only to find] an intense philosophical discussion going on in one corner people making peanut butter sandwiches-always peanut butter in another [And] some soap opera romantic entanglement being played out in another... It was real three-ring circus\\" [19]\\r\\nFreedom Summer did not succeed in getting many voters registered, but it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that had supported the Jim Crow system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by black civil rights workers. The events that summer had captured national attention (as had the mass protests and demonstrations in previous years). Some black activists felt the media had reacted only because northern white students were killed and felt embittered.[9] Many blacks also felt the white students were condescending and paternalistic to the local people and were ascending to an inappropriate dominance over the civil rights movement. Leading up to the November 1964 election, repression persisted in Mississippi, with nuisance arrests, beatings, and church burnings continuing. The discontent with the white students and the increasing need for armed defense against segregationists helped create demand for a black power direction in SNCC.[20]\\r\\nAlmost all the volunteers have recounted that the summer was one of the defining periods of their lives.[21] They had trouble readjusting to life outside Mississippi. They came with a positive image of the government, but the events of the Freedom Summer upset this simplistic distinction between 'good guys' and 'bad guys'. They saw that those two ideas were linked together. They experienced such lawlessness that they became critical toward American society and federal agencies, like the FBI. Most of the volunteers became politicized in Mississippi. They left intent on carrying on the fight in the North. After that summer, many Christians faced a religious crisis. Personal transformation of volunteers led to social changes. It increased student activity in civil rights movements. These students also played a role later in the resurgence of leftist activism in the United States of America.\\r\\nLong-term volunteers staffed the COFO and SNCC offices throughout Mississippi. After the flood of summer workers in 1964, their leadership decided that projects should continue the following summer, but under the direction of local leadership. This was challenged by Northern establishment members of the coalition, beginning with Americans for Democratic Action, who also disapproved of the MFDP. This encouraged the NAACP to withdraw from COFO, both because they did not want to anger liberal Democrats, and because they resented the organizational competition from SNCC. After the MFDP was denied voting status at the 1964 Democratic National Convention, Bob Moses was deeply disillusioned and bowed out of both MFDP and COFO. COFO collapsed in 1965, leaving organizing priorities to be set by locals.[22]\\r\\nAmong many notable veterans of Freedom Summer was Heather Booth, Marshall Ganz, and Mario Savio. Julian Bond has led civil rights in a variety of positions, including as an elected official. After the summer, Heather Booth returned to Illinois, where she became a founder of the Chicago Women's Liberation Union and later the Midwest Academy. Marshall Ganz returned to California, where he worked for many years on the staff of the United Farm Workers. He later taught organizing strategies. In 2008 he played a crucial role in organizing Barack Obama's field staff for the campaign. Mario Savio returned to the University of California, Berkeley, where he became a leader of the Free Speech Movement.\\r\\nIn Mississippi, controversy raged over the three murders. Mississippi state and local officials did not indict anyone. The FBI continued to investigate. Agents infiltrated the KKK and paid informers to reveal secrets of their \\"klaverns\\". In the fall of 1964, informants told the FBI about the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. On December 4, the FBI arrested 19 men as suspects. All were freed on a technicality, starting a three-year battle to bring them to justice. In October 1967, the men, including the Klan's Imperial Wizard Samuel Bowers, who had allegedly ordered the murders, went on trial in the federal courthouse in Meridian. Seven were ultimately convicted of federal crimes related to the murders. All were sentenced to 3ÿ10 years, but none served more than six years. This marked the first time since Reconstruction that white men had been convicted of civil rights violations against blacks in Mississippi.\\r\\nMississippi began to make some racial progress but white supremacy was resilient, especially in rural areas. In 1965 Congress passed the federal Voting Rights Act, which provided for federal oversight and enforcement to facilitate registration and voting in areas of historically low turnout. Mississippi's legislature passed several laws to dilute the power of black votes. Only with Supreme Court rulings and more than a decade of cooling did black voting become a reality in Mississippi. The seeds planted during Freedom Summer bore fruit in the 1980s and 1990s, when Mississippi elected more black officials than any other state. Since redistricting in 2003, Mississippi has had four congressional districts. Mississippi's 2nd congressional district, covering a concentration of black population in the western part of the state, including the Mississippi Delta, is black majority.\\r\\nRenewed investigation of the 1964 murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner led to a trial by the state in 2005. As a result of investigative reporting by Jerry Mitchell (an award-winning reporter for the Jackson Clarion-Ledger), high school teacher Barry Bradford, and three of his students from Illinois (Brittany Saltiel, Sarah Siegel, and Allison Nichols), Edgar Ray Killen, one of the leaders of the killings and a former Ku Klux Klan klavern recruiter, was indicted for murder. He was convicted of three counts of manslaughter.[23] The Killen verdict was announced on June 21, 2005, the forty-first anniversary of the crime. Killen's lawyers appealed the verdict, but his sentence of 3 times 20 years in prison was upheld on January 12, 2007, in a hearing by the Supreme Court of Mississippi.","input":"What organization conducted its mississippi freedom summer project in 1964?"},{"output":"19 consonants","context":"Korean, Jeju, Cia-Cia\\r\\nHangul (/?h?n?u?l/ HAHN-gool;[1] from Korean hangeul ?? [ha(?)n.?l]) or Chos?n'g?l, is the Korean alphabet. It has been used to write the Korean language since its creation in the 15th century by Sejong the Great.[2][3]\\r\\nIt is the official writing system of North Korea and South Korea. It is a co-official writing system in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County in Jilin Province, China. It is sometimes used to write the Cia-Cia language spoken near the town of Bau-Bau, Indonesia.\\r\\nThe alphabet consists of 14 consonants and 10 vowels. Its letters are grouped into syllabic blocks, vertically and horizontally. For example, the Korean word for \\"honeybee\\" is written ??, not ??????.[4] As it combines the features of alphabetic and syllabic writing systems, it has been described as an \\"alphabetic syllabary\\" by some linguists.[5][6] As in traditional Chinese writing, Korean texts were traditionally written top to bottom, right to left, and are occasionally still written this way for stylistic purposes. Today, it is typically written from left to right with spaces between words and western-style punctuation.[7]\\r\\nSome linguists consider it the most logical writing system in the world, partly because the shapes of its consonants mimic the shapes of the speaker's mouth when pronouncing each consonant.[5][7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Korean alphabet was originally called Hunminjeongeum (????), after the document that introduced the script to the Korean people in 1446.[10]\\r\\nToday, South Koreans call the Korean alphabet hangeul (??), a name coined by Korean linguist Ju Si-gyeong in 1912. The name combines the ancient Korean word han (?), meaning \\"great\\", and geul (?), meaning \\"script\\". The word han is used to refer to Korea in general, so the name also means \\"Korean script\\".[11] It has been romanized in multiple ways:\\r\\nNorth Koreans call the Korean alphabet Chos?n'g?l (???) after Chos?n, the North Korean name for Korea.[12] The McCuneÿReischauer system is used there.\\r\\nUntil the early 20th century, the Korean elite preferred to write using Chinese characters called Hanja. They referred to Hanja as jinseo (??) or \\"true letters\\". Some accounts say the elite referred to Hangul derisively as amkeul (??) meaning \\"women's script\\", and ahaetgeul (???) meaning \\"children's script\\", though there is no written evidence of this.[13]\\r\\nSupporters of Hangul referred to it as jeong-eum (??) meaning \\"correct pronunciation\\", gungmun (??) meaning \\"national script\\", and eonmun (??) meaning \\"vernacular script\\".[13]\\r\\nBefore the creation of Hangul, Koreans primarily wrote using Classical Chinese alongside native phonetic writing systems that predate Hangul by hundreds of years, including Idu script, Hyangchal, Gugyeol and Gakpil.[14][15][16][17] However, due to fundamental differences between the Korean and Chinese languages, and the large number of characters, many lower class Koreans were illiterate.[18] To promote literacy among the common people, the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty, Sejong the Great, personally created and promulgated a new alphabet.[3][18][19]\\r\\nHangul was designed so that people with little education could learn to read and write. A popular saying about the alphabet is, \\"A wise man can acquaint himself with them before the morning is over; even a stupid man can learn them in the space of ten days.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe project was completed in late December 1443 or January 1444, and described in 1446 in a document titled Hunminjeongeum (\\"The Proper Sounds for the Education of the People\\"), after which the alphabet itself was originally named.[13] The publication date of the Hunminjeongeum, October 9, became Hangul Day in South Korea. Its North Korean equivalent, Chos?n'g?l Day, is on January 15.\\r\\nAnother document published in 1446 and titled Hunmin Jeongeum Haerye (\\"Hunmin Jeongeum Explanation and Examples\\") was discovered in 1940. This document explains that the design of the consonant letters is based on articulatory phonetics and the design of the vowel letters are based on the principles of yin and yang and vowel harmony.\\r\\nHangul faced opposition in the 1440s by the literary elite, including politician Choe Manri and other Korean Confucian scholars. They believed Hanja was the only legitimate writing system. They also saw the circulation of Hangul as a threat to their status.[18] However, Hangul entered popular culture as King Sejong had intended, used especially by women and writers of popular fiction.[21] King Yeonsangun banned the study and publication of Hangul in 1504, after a document criticizing the king entered the public.[22] Similarly, King Jungjong abolished the Ministry of Eonmun, a governmental institution related to Hangul research, in 1506.[23]\\r\\nThe late 16th century, however, saw a revival of Hangul as gasa and sijo poetry flourished. In the 17th century, Hangul novels became a major genre.[24] However, the use of Hangul had gone without standardization for so long that spelling had become quite irregular.[21]\\r\\nIn 1796, the Dutch scholar Isaac Titsingh became the first person to bring a book written in Hangul to the West. His small library included the Japanese book, Sangoku Tsran Zusetsu (An Illustrated Description of Three Countries) by Hayashi Shihei.[25] This book, which was published in 1785, described the Joseon Kingdom[26] and Hangul.[27] In 1832, the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland supported the posthumous abridged publication of Titsingh's French translation.[28]\\r\\nThanks to growing Korean nationalism, the Gabo Reformists' push, and Western missionaries' promotion of Hangul in schools and literature[29] Hangul was adopted in official documents for the first time in 1894.[22] Elementary school texts began using Hangul in 1895, and Tongnip Sinmun, established in 1896, was the first newspaper printed in both Hangul and English.[30]\\r\\nDuring the Japanese forced occupation, which began in 1910, Japanese was made the official language of Korea. However, Hangul was still taught in Korean-established schools built after the annexation and Korean was written in a mixed Hanja-Hangul script, where most lexical roots were written in Hanja and grammatical forms in Hangul. and Japan banned earlier Korean literature from the public schooling, which became mandatory for children.\\r\\nHangul orthography was partially standardized in 1912, when the vowel arae-a (?)ÿwhich has now disappeared from Koreanÿwas restricted to Sino-Korean roots: the emphatic consonants were standardized to ?, ?, ?, ?, ? and final consonants restricted to ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?. Long vowels were marked by a diacritic dot to the left of the syllable, but this was dropped in 1921.[21]\\r\\nA second colonial reform occurred in 1930. The arae-a was abolished: the emphatic consonants were changed to ?, ?, ?, ?, ? and more final consonants ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? were allowed, making the orthography more morphophonemic. The double-consonant ? was written alone (without a vowel) when it occurred between nouns, and the nominative particle -? was introduced after vowels, replacing -?.[21]\\r\\nJu Si-gyeong, the linguist who had coined the term Hangul to replace Eonmun or \\"Vulgar Script\\" in 1912, established the Korean Language Research Society (later renamed the Hangul Society), which further reformed orthography with Standardized System of Hangul in 1933. The principal change was to make Hangul as morphophonemically practical given the existing letters.[21] A system for transliterating foreign orthographies was published in 1940.\\r\\nHowever, Japan banned the Korean language from schools in 1938 as part of a policy of cultural assimilation,[31] and all Korean-language publications were outlawed in 1941.[32]\\r\\nThe definitive modern Hangul orthography was published in 1946, just after Korean independence from Japanese rule. In 1948, North Korea attempted to make the script perfectly morphophonemic through the addition of new letters, and in 1953, Syngman Rhee in South Korea attempted to simplify the orthography by returning to the colonial orthography of 1921, but both reforms were abandoned after only a few years.[21]\\r\\nBoth South Korea and North Korea have used Hangul or mixed script as their official writing system, with ever-decreasing use of Hanja. Beginning in the 1970s, Hanja began to experience a gradual decline in commercial or unofficial writing in the South due to government intervention, with some South Korean newspapers now only using Hanja as abbreviations or disambiguation of homonyms. There has been widespread debate as to the future of Hanja in South Korea. North Korea instated Hangul as its exclusive writing system in 1949, and banned the use of Hanja completely.\\r\\nWhile both North Korea and South Korea claim 99 percent literacy, a 2003 study found that 25 percent of those in the older generation in the South were not completely literate in Hangul.[33]\\r\\nThe Hunminjeongeum Society in Seoul attempts to spread the use of Hangul to unwritten languages of Asia.[34] In 2009, Hangul was unofficially adopted by the town of Bau-Bau, in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, to write the Cia-Cia language.[35][36][37] A number of Indonesian Cia-Cia speakers who visited Seoul generated large media attention in South Korea, and they were greeted on their arrival by Oh Se-hoon, the mayor of Seoul.[38] It was confirmed in October 2012 that the attempts to disseminate Hangul in Indonesia failed.[39] Some people continue to use Hangul at home or co-officially.\\r\\nHangul letters are called \\"jamo (??)\\". There are 19 consonants and 21 vowels used in modern Hangul.\\r\\nThe following consonants are used in modern Hangul:\\r\\nThe chart below shows all 19 consonants in South Korean alphabetic order with Revised Romanization equivalents for each letter. Hangul consonants may sound differently depending on whether they are the initial or final letter in a syllable. Some consonants only appear in either the initial or final position in a syllable.\\r\\n(e.g. ?? - kang+ru = kang+nu, ?? - iss+eo = is-seo, -??? - -hap+ni+da = -ham-ni-da)\\r\\n(k)\\r\\n(kk)\\r\\n(n)\\r\\n(t)\\r\\n(-)\\r\\n(l)\\r\\n(m)\\r\\n(p)\\r\\n(-)\\r\\n(t)\\r\\n(ss/ s/ t/ n)\\r\\n(ng)\\r\\n(t)\\r\\n(-)\\r\\n(t)\\r\\n(k)\\r\\n(t)\\r\\n(p)\\r\\n(h)\\r\\nl+h\\r\\nHangul consonants can be combined into 11 consonant clusters, which always appear in the final position in a syllable.

Linguists disagree on the number of phonemes versus diphthongs among Hangul vowels.[40]\\r\\nHangul alphabetic order is called the ganada order, (??? ?) after the first three letters of the alphabet. The alphabetical order of Hangul does not mix consonants and vowels. Rather, first are velar consonants, then coronals, labials, sibilants, etc. The vowels come after the consonants.\\r\\nThe order from the Hunminjeongeum in 1446 was:\\r\\nIn 1527, Choe Sejin reorganized the alphabet:\\r\\nThis is the basis of the modern alphabetic orders. It was before the development of the Korean tense consonants and the double letters that represent them, and before the conflation of the letters ? (null) and ? (ng). Thus, when the South Korean and North Korean governments implemented full use of Hangul, they ordered these letters differently, with South Korea grouping similar letters together, and North Korea placing new letters at the end of the alphabet.\\r\\nThe new, double, letters are placed at the end of the consonants, just before the null ?, so as not to alter the traditional order of the rest of the alphabet.\\r\\nAll digraphs and trigraphs, including the old diphthongs ? and ?, are placed after the simple vowels, again maintaining Choe's alphabetic order.\\r\\nThe order of the final letters is:\\r\\nUnlike when it is initial, this ? is pronounced, as the nasal ? ng, which occurs only as a final in the modern language. The double letters are placed to the very end, as in the initial order, but the combined consonants are ordered immediately after their first element.\\r\\nIn the Southern order a more modern order is maintained where double letters are placed immediately after their single counterparts:\\r\\nThe modern monophthongal vowels come first, with the derived forms interspersed according to their form: i is added first, then iotized, then iotized with added i. Diphthongs beginning with w are ordered according to their spelling, as ? or ? plus a second vowel, not as separate digraphs.\\r\\nThe order of the final letters (??) is:\\r\\n(\\"None\\" means there is no final letter.)\\r\\nEvery syllable begins with a consonant (or the silent ?) that is followed by a vowel (e.g. ? + ? = ?). Some syllables such as \\"?\\" and \\"?\\" have a final consonant or final consonant cluster (??). Then, 399 combinations are possible for \\"two-letter syllables\\" and 10,773 possible combinations for syllables with more than two \\"letters\\" (27 possible final endings), for a total of 11,172 possible combinations of Hangul \\"letters\\" to form syllables.\\r\\nHangul letters were named by Korean linguist Choe Sejin in 1527. South Korea uses Choe's traditional names, most of which follow the format of letter + i + eu + letter. However, as the syllables ? euk, ? eut, and ? eut did not occur in the language, Choe gave those letters the modified names ?? giyeok, ?? digeut, and ?? siot, using native syllables.\\r\\nOriginally, Choe gave ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, and ? the irregular one-syllable names of ji, chi, ki, ti, pi, and hi, because they should not be used as final consonants, as specified in Hunminjeongeum. However, after establishment of the new orthography in 1933, which let all consonants be used as finals, the names changed to the present forms.\\r\\nNorth Korea regularized Choe's original names when it made Hangul its official orthography.\\r\\nThe chart below shows names used in South Korea for Hangul consonants. The letters are arranged in the South Korean alphabetic order, and the letter names are romanized in the Revised Romanization system, which is the official romanization system of South Korea. The tense consonants are described with the word ? ssang meaning \\"double\\".\\r\\nThe names of Hangul vowels are the same as the sound of each vowel. For example, ? is called ? a.\\r\\nThe chart below shows names used in North Korea for Hangul consonants. The letters are arranged in North Korean alphabetic order, and the letter names are romanized with the McCune-Reischauer system, which is widely used in North Korea. The tense consonants are described with the word ? toen meaning \\"hard\\".\\r\\nIn North Korea, an alternative way to refer to a consonant is letter + ? (?), for example, k? (?) for the letter ?, and ss? (?) for the letter ?.\\r\\nAs in South Korea, the names of Hangul vowels are the same as the sound of each vowel.\\r\\nHangul letters have adopted certain rules of Chinese calligraphy, although ? and ? use a circle, which is not used in printed Chinese characters.\\r\\n? (giyeok ??)\\r\\n? (nieun ??)\\r\\n? (digeut ??)\\r\\n? (rieul ??)\\r\\n? (mieum ??)\\r\\n? (bieup ??)\\r\\n? (siot ??)\\r\\n? (ieung ??)\\r\\n? (jieut ??)\\r\\n? (chieut ??)\\r\\n? (kieuk ??)\\r\\n? (tieut ??)\\r\\n? (pieup ??)\\r\\n? (hieut ??)\\r\\n? (a)\\r\\n? (ae)\\r\\n? (eo)\\r\\n? (e)\\r\\n? (o)\\r\\n? (u)\\r\\n? (eu)\\r\\nFor the iotized vowels, which are not shown, the short stroke is simply doubled.\\r\\nScripts typically transcribe languages at the level of morphemes (logographic scripts like Hanja), of syllables (syllabaries like kana), of segments (alphabetic scripts like the Latin script used to write English and many other languages), or, on occasion, of distinctive features. Hangul incorporates aspects of the latter three, grouping sounds into syllables, using distinct symbols for segments, and in some cases using distinct strokes to indicate distinctive features such as place of articulation (labial, coronal, velar, or glottal) and manner of articulation (plosive, nasal, sibilant, aspiration) for consonants, and iotation (a preceding i-sound), harmonic class and i-mutation for vowels.\\r\\nFor instance, the consonant ? t [t?] is composed of three strokes, each one meaningful: the top stroke indicates ? is a plosive, like ? ?, ? g, ? d, ? j, which have the same stroke (the last is an affricate, a plosiveÿfricative sequence); the middle stroke indicates that ? is aspirated, like ? h, ? k, ? ch, which also have this stroke; and the bottom stroke indicates that ? is alveolar, like ? n, ? d, and ? l. (This element is said to represent the shape of the tongue when pronouncing coronal consonants, though this is not certain.) Two consonants, ? and ?, have dual pronunciations, and appear to be composed of two elements corresponding to these two pronunciations: [?]~silence for ? and [m]~[w] for obsolete ?.\\r\\nWith vowel letters, a short stroke connected to the main line of the letter indicates that this is one of the vowels that can be iotated; this stroke is then doubled when the vowel is iotated. The position of the stroke indicates which harmonic class the vowel belongs to, \\"light\\" (top or right) or \\"dark\\" (bottom or left). In the modern alphabet, an additional vertical stroke indicates i-mutation, deriving ? [?], ? [e], ? [?], and ? [y] from ? [a], ? [?], ? [o], and ? [u]. However, this is not part of the intentional design of the script, but rather a natural development from what were originally diphthongs ending in the vowel ? [i]. Indeed, in many Korean dialects,[citation needed] including the standard dialect of Seoul, some of these may still be diphthongs.\\r\\nSome linguists have praised Hangul for its featural design; beyond the fact that the shapes of the letters are related to the features of the sounds they represent, Hangul attracts approval for the fact that vowels are made from vertical or horizontal lines so that they are easily distinguishable from consonants.\\r\\nAlthough the design of the script may be featural, for all practical purposes it behaves as an alphabet. The letter ? is not read as three letters alveolar aspirated plosive, for instance, but as a single consonant t. Likewise, the former diphthong ? is read as a single vowel e.\\r\\nBeside the letters, Hangul originally employed diacritic marks to indicate pitch accent. A syllable with a high pitch (??) was marked with a dot (???) to the left of it (when writing vertically); a syllable with a rising pitch (??) was marked with a double dot, like a colon (???). These are no longer used. Although vowel length is still phonemic in Korean, it is no longer written.\\r\\nThe consonant letters fall into five homorganic groups, each with a basic shape, and one or more letters derived from this shape by means of additional strokes. In the Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye account, the basic shapes iconically represent the articulations the tongue, palate, teeth, and throat take when making these sounds.\\r\\nThe Korean names for the groups are taken from Chinese phonetics:\\r\\nVowel letters are based on three elements:\\r\\nShort strokes (dots in the earliest documents) were added to these three basic elements to derive the vowel letter:\\r\\nHangul never had a w, except in Sino-Korean vocabulary. Since an o or u before an a or eo became a [w] sound, and [w] occurred nowhere else, [w] could always be analyzed as a phonemic o or u, and no letter for [w] was needed. However, vowel harmony is observed: \\"dark\\" ??u with \\"dark\\" ??eo for ? wo; \\"bright\\" ??o with \\"bright\\" ??a for ? wa:\\r\\nThe compound vowels ending in ? i were originally diphthongs. However, several have since evolved into pure vowels:\\r\\nThere is no letter for y. Instead, this sound is indicated by doubling the stroke attached to the baseline of the vowel letter. Of the seven basic vowels, four could be preceded by a y sound, and these four were written as a dot next to a line. (Through the influence of Chinese calligraphy, the dots soon became connected to the line: ????.) A preceding y sound, called \\"iotation\\", was indicated by doubling this dot: ???? yeo, ya, yu, yo. The three vowels that could not be iotated were written with a single stroke: ??? eu, (arae a), i.\\r\\nThe simple iotated vowels are:\\r\\nThere are also two iotated diphthongs:\\r\\nThe Korean language of the 15th century had vowel harmony to a greater extent than it does today. Vowels in grammatical morphemes changed according to their environment, falling into groups that \\"harmonized\\" with each other. This affected the morphology of the language, and Korean phonology described it in terms of yin and yang: If a root word had yang ('bright') vowels, then most suffixes attached to it also had to have yang vowels; conversely, if the root had yin ('dark') vowels, the suffixes had to be yin as well. There was a third harmonic group called \\"mediating\\" ('neutral' in Western terminology) that could coexist with either yin or yang vowels.\\r\\nThe Korean neutral vowel was ? i. The yin vowels were ??? eu, u, eo; the dots are in the yin directions of 'down' and 'left'. The yang vowels were ??? ?, o, a, with the dots in the yang directions of 'up' and 'right'. The Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye states that the shapes of the non-dotted letters ??? were chosen to represent the concepts of yin, yang, and mediation: Earth, Heaven, and Human. (The letter ? ? is now obsolete except in the Jeju language.)\\r\\nThe third parameter in designing the vowel letters was choosing ? as the graphic base of ? and ?, and ? as the graphic base of ? and ?. A full understanding of what these horizontal and vertical groups had in common would require knowing the exact sound values these vowels had in the 15th century.\\r\\nThe uncertainty is primarily with the three letters ???. Some linguists reconstruct these as *a, *?, *e, respectively; others as *?, *e, *a. A third reconstruction is to make them all middle vowels as *?, *?, *a.[41] With the third reconstruction, Middle Korean vowels actually line up in a vowel harmony pattern, albeit with only one front vowel and four middle vowels:\\r\\nHowever, the horizontal letters ??? eu,?u,?o do all appear to have been mid to high back vowels, [*?, *u, *o], and thus to have formed a coherent group phonetically in every reconstruction.\\r\\nThe generally accepted account[nb 1][42] on the design of the letters is that the vowels are derived from various combinations of the following three components: ? ? ?. Here, ? symbolically stands for the (sun in) heaven, ? stands for the (flat) earth, and ? stands for an (upright) human. The original sequence of the Korean vowels, as stated in Hunminjeongeum, listed these three vowels first, followed by various combinations. Thus, the original order of the vowels was: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?. Note that two positive vowels (? ?) including one ? are followed by two negative vowels including one ?, then by two positive vowels each including two of ?, and then by two negative vowels each including two of ?.\\r\\nThe same theory provides the most simple explanation of the shapes of the consonants as an approximation of the shapes of the most representative organ needed to form that sound. The original order of the consonants in Hunmin Jeong-eum was: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?.\\r\\n? representing the /k/ sound geometrically describes a tongue just before the moment of pronunciation as the tongue blocks the passage of air.\\r\\n? representing the /k?/ sound is derived from ? by adding another stroke.\\r\\n? representing the /?/ sound may have been derived from ? by addition of a stroke.\\r\\n? representing the /t/ sound is derived from ? by addition of a stroke.\\r\\n? representing the /t?/ sound is derived from ? by adding another stroke.\\r\\n? representing the /n/ sound geometrically describes a tongue making contact with an upper palate just before making the \\"n\\" sound.\\r\\n? representing the /p/ sound is derived from ? by adding strokes.\\r\\n? representing the /p?/ sound is a variant of ?, which is obtained by rotating 90 degrees and extending the horizontal strokes.\\r\\n? representing the /m/ sound geometrically describes a closed mouth before opening the lips.\\r\\n? representing the /t?/ sound is derived from the shape of ? by adding strokes.\\r\\n? representing the /t??/ sound is derived from ? by adding another stroke.\\r\\n? representing the /s/ sound geometrically describes a near contact between the tongue and the teeth.[citation needed]\\r\\n? representing the /?/ sound geometrically describes an open throat with a bar to indicate that there is an aspiration.\\r\\n? representing the /h/ sound is derived from ? with the extra stroke representing a stronger flow of the aspiration.\\r\\n? representing the absence of a consonant geometrically describes an open mouth, which necessarily accompanies the following vowel.\\r\\n? representing the /?/ and /l/ sounds geometrically describes a backward-bending tongue.\\r\\n? representing a weak /z/ sound is also derived from the shape of the teeth, but has a different origin than ?[clarification needed] and is not derived from ? by addition of a stroke.\\r\\nAlthough the Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye explains the design of the consonantal letters in terms of articulatory phonetics, as a purely innovative creation, several theories suggest which external sources may have inspired or influenced King Sejong's creation. Professor Gari Ledyard of Columbia University studied possible connections between Hangul and the Mongol 'Phags-pa script of the Yuan dynasty. He believed that the role of 'Phags-pa script in the creation of Hangul was quite limited:\\r\\nIt should be clear to any reader that in the total picture, that ['Phags-pa script's] role was quite limited ... Nothing would disturb me more, after this study is published, than to discover in a work on the history of writing a statement like the following: \\"According to recent investigations, the Korean alphabet was derived from the Mongol's phags-pa script.\\"[43] An affine theory states that the consonants are derived from the shape of the speaker's lips and tongue during the pronunciation of the consonants (initially, at least), but this would appear somewhat to strain credulity.[44]\\r\\nLedyard posits that five of the Hangul letters have shapes inspired by 'Phags-pa; a sixth basic letter, the null initial ?, was invented by Sejong. The rest of the letters were derived internally from these six, essentially as described in the Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye. However, the five borrowed consonants were not the graphically simplest letters considered basic by the Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye, but instead the consonants basic to Chinese phonology: ?, ?, ?, ?, and ?.\\r\\nThe Hunmin Jeong-eum states that King Sejong adapted the m (gojeon, \\"GѸ Seal Script\\") in creating Hangul. The m has never been identified. The primary meaning of  gѸ is \\"old\\" (\\"Old Seal Script\\"), frustrating philologists because Hangul bears no functional similarity to Chinese m zhunz seal scripts. However, Ledyard believes  gѸ may be a pun on з MnggѸ \\"Mongol\\", and that m is an abbreviation of зm \\"Mongol Seal Script\\", that is, the formal variant of the 'Phags-pa alphabet written to look like the Chinese seal script. There were 'Phags-pa manuscripts in the Korean palace library, including some in the seal-script form, and several of Sejong's ministers knew the script well.\\r\\nIf this was the case, Sejong's evasion on the Mongol connection can be understood in light of Korea's relationship with Ming China after the fall of the Mongol Yuan dynasty, and of the literati's contempt for the Mongols as \\"barbarians\\".\\r\\nAccording to Ledyard, the five borrowed letters were graphically simplified, which allowed for consonant clusters and left room to add a stroke to derive the aspirate plosives, ????. But in contrast to the traditional account, the non-plosives (? ? ? ?) were derived by removing the top of the basic letters. He points out that while it is easy to derive ? from ? by removing the top, it is not clear how to derive ? from ? in the traditional account, since the shape of ? is not analogous to those of the other plosives.\\r\\nThe explanation of the letter ng also differs from the traditional account. Many Chinese words began with ng, but by King Sejong's day, initial ng was either silent or pronounced [?] in China, and was silent when these words were borrowed into Korean. Also, the expected shape of ng (the short vertical line left by removing the top stroke of ?) would have looked almost identical to the vowel ? [i]. Sejong's solution solved both problems: The vertical stroke left from ? was added to the null symbol ? to create ? (a circle with a vertical line on top), iconically capturing both the pronunciation [?] in the middle or end of a word, and the usual silence at the beginning. (The graphic distinction between null ? and ng ? was eventually lost.)\\r\\nAnother letter composed of two elements to represent two regional pronunciations was ?, which transcribed the Chinese initial a. This represented either m or w in various Chinese dialects, and was composed of ? [m] plus ? (from 'Phags-pa [w]). In 'Phags-pa, a loop under a letter represented w after vowels, and Ledyard hypothesized that this became the loop at the bottom of ?. In 'Phags-pa the Chinese initial a is also transcribed as a compound with w, but in its case the w is placed under an h. Actually, the Chinese consonant series a w, v, f is transcribed in 'Phags-pa by the addition of a w under three graphic variants of the letter for h, and Hangul parallels this convention by adding the w loop to the labial series ??? m, b, p, producing now-obsolete ??? w, v, f. (Phonetic values in Korean are uncertain, as these consonants were only used to transcribe Chinese.)\\r\\nAs a final piece of evidence, Ledyard notes that most of the borrowed Hangul letters were simple geometric shapes, at least originally, but that ? d [t] always had a small lip protruding from the upper left corner, just as the 'Phags-pa d [t] did. This lip can be traced back to the Tibetan letter d.\\r\\nNumerous obsolete Hangul letters and sequences are no longer used in Korean. Some of these letters were only ever used to represent the sounds of Chinese rime tables. Some of the Korean sounds represented by these obsolete letters still exist in some dialects.\\r\\nIn the original Hangul system, double letters were used to represent Chinese voiced (??) consonants, which survive in the Shanghainese slack consonants and were not used for Korean words. It was only later that a similar convention was used to represent the modern \\"tense\\" (faucalized) consonants of Korean.\\r\\nThe sibilant (\\"dental\\") consonants were modified to represent the two series of Chinese sibilants, alveolar and retroflex, a \\"round\\" vs. \\"sharp\\" distinction (analogous to s vs sh) which was never made in Korean, and was even being lost from southern Chinese. The alveolar letters had longer left stems, while retroflexes had longer right stems:\\r\\nTo make Hangul a perfect morphophonological fit to the Korean language, North Korea introduced six new letters, which were published in the New Orthography for the Korean Language and used officially from 1948 to 1954.\\r\\nTwo obsolete letters were restored: ??? (??), which was used to indicate an alternation in pronunciation between initial /l/ and final /d/; and ??? (??), which was only pronounced between vowels. Two modifications of the letter ? were introduced, one for a ?, which is silent finally, and one for a ?, which doubled between vowels. A hybrid ?-? letter was introduced for words that alternated between those two sounds (that is, a /b/, which became /w/ before a vowel). Finally, a vowel ?1? was introduced for variable iotation.\\r\\nHangul Jamo (U+1100ÿU+11FF) and Hangul Compatibility Jamo (U+3130ÿU+318F) blocks were added to the Unicode Standard in June 1993 with the release of version 1.1. The characters were relocated to their present locations in July, 1996 with the release of version 2.0.\\r\\nHangul Jamo Extended-A (U+A960ÿU+A97F) and Hangul Jamo Extended-B (U+D7B0ÿU+D7FF) blocks were added to the Unicode Standard in October 2009 with the release of version 5.2.\\r\\nParenthesised (U+3200ÿU+321E) and circled (U+3260ÿU+327E) Hangul compatibility characters are in the Enclosed CJK Letters and Months block:\\r\\nHalf-width Hangul compatibility characters (U+FFA0ÿU+FFDC) are in the Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms block:\\r\\nHangul in other Unicode blocks:\\r\\nExcept for a few grammatical morphemes prior to the twentieth century, no letter stands alone to represent elements of the Korean language. Instead, letters are grouped into syllabic or morphemic blocks of at least two and often three: a consonant or a doubled consonant called the initial (??, ? choseong syllable onset), a vowel or diphthong called the medial (??, ? jungseong syllable nucleus), and, optionally, a consonant or consonant cluster at the end of the syllable, called the final (??, ? jongseong syllable coda). When a syllable has no actual initial consonant, the null initial ? ieung is used as a placeholder. (In modern Hangul, placeholders are not used for the final position.) Thus, a block contains a minimum of two letters, an initial and a medial. Although the Hangul had historically been organized into syllables, in the modern orthography it is first organized into morphemes, and only secondarily into syllables within those morphemes, with the exception that single-consonant morphemes may not be written alone.\\r\\nThe sets of initial and final consonants are not the same. For instance, ? ng only occurs in final position, while the doubled letters that can occur in final position are limited to ? ss and ? kk.\\r\\nNot including obsolete letters, 11,172 Hangul blocks are possible.\\r\\nEgyptian hieroglyphs 32 c. BCE\\r\\nHangul 1443 (probably influenced by Tibetan)\\r\\nThe placement or \\"stacking\\" of letters in the block follows set patterns based on the shape of the medial.\\r\\nConsonant and vowel sequences such as ? bs, ? wo, or obsolete ? bsd, ? ye are written left to right.\\r\\nVowels (medials) are written under the initial consonant, to the right, or wrap around the initial from bottom to right, depending on their shape: If the vowel has a horizontal axis like ? eu, then it is written under the initial; if it has a vertical axis like ? i, then it is written to the right of the initial; and if it combines both orientations, like ? ui, then it wraps around the initial from the bottom to the right:\\r\\nA final consonant, if present, is always written at the bottom, under the vowel. This is called ?? batchim \\"supporting floor\\":\\r\\nA complex final is written left to right:\\r\\nBlocks are always written in phonetic order, initial-medial-final. Therefore:\\r\\nNormally the resulting block is written within a square of the same size and shape as a Hanja (Chinese character) by compressing or stretching the letters to fill the bounds of the block; therefore someone not familiar with the scripts may mistake Hangul for Hanja or Chinese.\\r\\nHowever, some recent fonts (for example Eun,[48] HY????M, UnJamo]) move towards the European practice of letters whose relative size is fixed, and use whitespace to fill letter positions not used in a particular block, and away from the East Asian tradition of square block characters (Դݔ). They break one or more of the traditional rules:\\r\\nThese fonts have been used as design accents on signs or headings, rather than for typesetting large volumes of body text.\\r\\nThere was a minor and unsuccessful movement in the early twentieth century to abolish syllabic blocks and write the letters individually and in a row, in the fashion of the European alphabets: e.g. ?????? for ?? Hangeul.[49]\\r\\nAvant-garde typographer Ahn Sangsu made a font for the \\"Hangul Dada\\" exposition that exploded the syllable blocks; but while it strings out the letters horizontally, it retains the distinctive vertical position each letter would normally have within a block, unlike the century-old linear writing proposals.[50]\\r\\nWhile Koreans have largely accepted the European-derived conventions of writing successive syllables left-to-right in horizontal lines instead of in vertical columns, adding spaces between words, and European-style punctuation, they rejected eliminating syllabic blocks, the most distinctive feature of this writing system.\\r\\nUntil the 20th century, no official orthography of Hangul had been established. Due to liaison, heavy consonant assimilation, dialectical variants and other reasons, a Korean word can potentially be spelled in multiple ways. Sejong seemed to prefer morphophonemic spelling (representing the underlying root forms) rather than a phonemic one (representing the actual sounds). However, early in its history Hangul was dominated by phonemic spelling. Over the centuries the orthography became partially morphophonemic, first in nouns and later in verbs. Modern Hangul is as morphophonemic as is practical. The difference between phonetic Romanization, phonemic orthography and morpho-phonemic orthography can be illustrated with the phrase motaneun sarami:\\r\\nmotaneun sarami\\r\\n[mo.t?a.n?n.sa.?a.mi]\\r\\na person who cannot do it\\r\\n??????\\r\\n/mo.t?a.n?n.sa.la.mi/\\r\\n??????\\r\\n|mot-ha-n?n-sa.lam-i|\\r\\nAfter the Gabo Reform in 1894, the Joseon Dynasty and later the Korean Empire started to write all official documents in Hangul. Under the government's management, proper usage of Hangul and Hanja, including orthography, was discussed, until the Korean Empire was annexed by Japan in 1910.\\r\\nThe Government-General of Korea popularized a writing style that mixed Hanja and Hangul, and was used in the later Joseon dynasty. The government revised the spelling rules in 1912, 1921 and 1930, to be relatively phonemic.\\r\\nThe Hangul Society, founded by Ju Si-gyeong, announced a proposal for a new, strongly morphophonemic orthography in 1933, which became the prototype of the contemporary orthographies in both North and South Korea. After Korea was divided, the North and South revised orthographies separately. The guiding text for Hangul orthography is called Hangeul Matchumbeop, whose last South Korean revision was published in 1988 by the Ministry of Education.\\r\\nSince the Late Joseon dynasty period, various Hanja-Hangul mixed systems were used. In these systems, Hanja were used for lexical roots, and Hangul for grammatical words and inflections, much as kanji and kana are used in Japanese. Hanja have been almost entirely phased out of daily use in North Korea, and in South Korea they are mostly restricted to parenthetical glosses for proper names and for disambiguating homonyms.\\r\\nIndo-Arabic numerals are mixed in with Hangul, as in 2007? 3? 22? (22 March 2007). In Korean pop-culture Roman words may be injected for artistic purposes.\\r\\nLatin script and occasionally other scripts may be sprinkled within Korean texts for illustrative purposes, or for unassimilated loanwords. Very occasionally non-Hangul letters may be mixed into Hangul syllabic blocks, as G? Ga at right.\\r\\nBecause of syllable clustering, words are shorter on the page than their linear counterparts would be, and the boundaries between syllables are easily visible (which may aid reading, if segmenting words into syllables is more natural for the reader than dividing them into phonemes).[51] Because the component parts of the syllable are relatively simple phonemic characters, the number of strokes per character on average is lower than in Chinese characters. Unlike syllabaries, such as Japanese kana, or Chinese logographs, none of which encode the constituent phonemes within a syllable, the graphic complexity of Korean syllabic blocks varies in direct proportion with the phonemic complexity of the syllable.[52] Unlike linear alphabets such as those derived from Latin, Korean orthography allows the reader to \\"utilize both the horizontal and vertical visual fields\\".[53] Finally, since Hangul syllables are represented both as collections of phonemes and as unique-looking graphs, they may allow for both visual and aural retrieval of words from the lexicon.\\r\\nHangul may be written either vertically or horizontally. The traditional direction is from top to bottom, right to left. Horizontal writing in the style of the Latin script was promoted by Ju Si-gyeong, and has become overwhelmingly prevalent.\\r\\nIn Hunmin Jeongeum, Hangul was printed in sans-serif angular lines of even thickness. This style is found in books published before about 1900, and can be found in stone carvings (on statues, for example).\\r\\nOver the centuries, an ink-brush style of calligraphy developed, employing the same style of lines and angles as traditional Korean calligraphy. This brush style is called gungche (?? ?mN), which means \\"Palace Style\\" because the style was mostly developed and used by the maidservants (gungnyeo, ?? ?mW) of the court in Joseon dynasty.\\r\\nModern styles that are more suited for printed media were developed in the 20th century. In 1993, new names for both Myeongjo (]) and Gothic styles were introduced when Ministry of Culture initiated an effort to standardize typographic terms, and the names Batang (??, meaning \\"background\\") and Dotum (??, meaning \\"stand out\\") replaced Myeongjo and Gothic respectively. These names are also used in Microsoft Windows.\\r\\nA sans-serif style with lines of equal width is popular with pencil and pen writing and is often the default typeface of Web browsers. A minor advantage of this style is that it makes it easier to distinguish -eung from -ung even in small or untidy print, as the jongseong ieung (?) of such fonts usually lacks a serif that could be mistaken for the short vertical line of the letter ? (u).","input":"How many letters are in the korean alphabet?"},{"output":"General Sherman","context":"General Sherman is a giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) tree located in the Giant Forest of Sequoia National Park in Tulare County, in the U.S. state of California. By volume, it is the largest known living single-stem tree on Earth.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the General Sherman is the largest currently living tree, it is not the largest historically-recorded tree. The Crannell Creek Giant, a coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) near Trinidad, California, is estimated to have been 15 to 25% larger than the General Sherman tree by volume. That tree was cut down in the mid-1940s. Another larger coast redwood, near 90,000 cubic feet, the Lindsey Creek tree, was reported in a 1905 Humboldt Times Standard article.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe General Sherman was named after the American Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, in 1879 by naturalist James Wolverton, who had served as a lieutenant in the 9th Indiana Cavalry under Sherman. In 1931, following comparisons with the nearby General Grant tree, General Sherman was identified as the largest tree in the world. One result of this process was that wood volume became widely accepted as the standard for establishing and comparing the size of different trees.[1][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2006 the largest branch on the tree (seen most commonly, in older photos, as an \\"L\\" or golf-club shape, protruding from about a quarter of the way down the trunk) broke off.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (formally called the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, and commonly referred to as the Kennedy Center) is the United States National Cultural Center, located on the Potomac River, adjacent to the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., named in 1964 as a memorial to President John F. Kennedy. Opened on September 8, 1971, the performing arts center is a multi-dimensional facility: it produces a wide array of performances encompassing the genres of theater, dance, ballet, and orchestral, chamber, jazz, popular, and folk music; offers multi-media performances for adults and children; and is a nexus of performing arts education.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the approximately 3,500 performances held annually for audiences totaling nearly two million, the center hosts touring productions and television and radio broadcasts that, collectively, are seen by 20 million more. Now in its 45th season, the center presents music, dance and theater and supports artists in the creation of new work. With its artistic affiliate, the National Symphony Orchestra, the center's achievements as a commissioner, producer, and nurturer of developing artists have resulted in over 200 theatrical productions, dozens of new ballets, operas, and musical works.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthorized by the 1958 National Cultural Center Act of Congress, which requires that its programming be sustained through private funds, the center represents a publicÿprivate partnership. Its activities include educational and outreach initiatives, almost entirely funded through ticket sales and gifts from individuals, corporations and private foundations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building, designed by architect Edward Durell Stone, was constructed by Philadelphia contractor John McShain, and is administered as a bureau of the Smithsonian Institution. It receives annual federal funding to pay for its maintenance and operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea for a national cultural center dates to 1933 when First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt discussed ideas for the Emergency Relief and Civil Works Administration to create employment for unemployed actors during the Great Depression.[1] Congress held hearings in 1935 on plans to establish a Cabinet level Department of Science, Art and Literature, and to build a monumental theater and arts building on Capitol Hill near the Supreme Court building. A 1938 congressional resolution called for construction of a \\"public building which shall be known as the National Cultural Center\\" near Judiciary Square, but nothing materialized.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea for a national theater resurfaced in 1950, when U.S. Representative Arthur George Klein of New York introduced a bill to authorize funds to plan and build a cultural center. The bill included provisions that the center would prohibit any discrimination of cast or audience. In 1955, the Stanford Research Institute was commissioned to select a site and provide design suggestions for the center.[2] From 1955 to 1958, Congress debated the idea amid much controversy. A bill was finally passed in Congress in the summer of 1958 and on September 4, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law the National Cultural Center Act which provided momentum for the project.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the first time that the federal government helped finance a structure dedicated to the performing arts. The legislation required a portion of the costs, estimated at $10ÿ25 million, to be raised within five years of the bill's passage.[4] Edward Durell Stone was selected as architect for the project in June 1959.[5] He presented preliminary designs to the President's Music Committee in October 1959, along with estimated costs of $50 million, double the original estimates of $25ÿ30 million. By November 1959, estimated costs had escalated to $61 million.[6] Despite this, Stone's design was well received in editorials in The Washington Post, Washington Star, and quickly approved by the United States Commission of Fine Arts, National Capital Planning Commission, and the National Park Service.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Cultural Center was renamed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1964, following the assassination of President Kennedy.[8]\\r\\nThe National Cultural Center Board of Trustees, a group Eisenhower established January 29, 1959, led fundraising.[4] Fundraising efforts were not successful, with only $13,425 raised in the first three years.[9] President John F. Kennedy was interested in bringing culture to the nation's capital, and provided leadership and support for the project.[10] In 1961, President Kennedy asked Roger L. Stevens to help develop the National Cultural Center, and serve as chairman of the Board of Trustees. Stevens recruited First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy as Honorary Chairman of the Center, and former First Lady Mamie Eisenhower as co-chairman.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total cost of construction was $70 million.[8] Congress allocated $43 million for construction costs, including $23 million as an outright grant and the other $20 million in bonds.[10] Donations also comprised a significant portion of funding, including $5 million from the Ford Foundation, and approximately $500,000 from the Kennedy family.[12][13] Other major donors included J. Willard Marriott, Marjorie Merriweather Post, John D. Rockefeller III, and Robert W. Woodruff, as well as many corporate donors.[13] Foreign countries provided gifts to the Kennedy Center, including a gift of 3,700 tons of Carrara marble from Italy (worth $1.5 million) from the Italian government, which was used in the building's construction.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson dug the ceremonial first-shovel of earth at the groundbreaking for the Kennedy Center December 2, 1964.[15] However, debate continued for another year over the Foggy Bottom site, with some advocating for another location on Pennsylvania Avenue.[12] Excavation of the site got underway on December 11, 1965, and the site was cleared by January 1967.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first performance was September 5, 1971, with 2,200 members of the general public in attendance to see a premiere of Leonard Bernstein's Mass in the Opera House,[8] while the Center's official opening took place September 8, 1971, with a formal gala and premiere performance of the Bernstein Mass.[17] The Concert Hall was inaugurated September 9, 1971, with a performance by the National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Antal Dorti.[17] Alberto Ginastera's opera, Beatrix Cenci premiered at the Kennedy Center Opera House September 10, 1971. The Eisenhower Theater was inaugurated October 18, 1971, with a performance of A Doll's House starring Claire Bloom.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nArchitect Edward Durell Stone designed the Kennedy Center.[19] Overall, the building is 100 feet (30?m) high, 630 feet (190?m) long, and 300 feet (91?m) wide. The Kennedy Center features a 630-foot-long (190?m), 63-foot-high (19?m) grand foyer, with 16 hand-blown Orrefors crystal chandeliers (a gift from Sweden) and red carpeting. The Hall of States and the Hall of Nations are both 250-foot-long (76?m), 63-foot-high (19?m) corridors. The building has drawn criticism about its location (far away from Washington Metro stops), and for its scale and form,[19] although it has also drawn praise for its acoustics, and its terrace overlooking the Potomac River.[19] In her book On Architecture, Ada Louise Huxtable called it \\"gemtlich Speer.\\"[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nCyril M. Harris designed the Kennedy Center's auditoriums and their acoustics.[21] A key consideration is that many aircraft fly along the Potomac River and overhead the Kennedy Center, as they take off and land at the nearby Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Helicopter traffic over the Kennedy Center is also fairly high. To keep out this noise, the Kennedy Center was designed as a box within a box, giving each auditorium an extra outer shell.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the original structure was marked for expansion, a competition in 2013 selected Steven Holl Architects  to undertake the design.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plaza entrance of the Kennedy Center features two tableaus by German sculptor Jrgen Weber; created between 1965 and 1971, which were a gift to the Kennedy Center from the West German government. Near the north end of the plaza is a display of nude figures in scenes representing war and peace, called War or Peace. The piece, 8?ft G?50?ft G?1.5?ft (2.44?m G?15.24?m G?0.46?m), depicts five scenes showing the symbolism of war and peace: a war scene, murder, family, and creativity.[24] At the south end is America which represents Weber's image of America (8 G 50 G 1.5?ft.). Four scenes are depicted representing threats to liberty, technology, foreign aid and survival, and free speech.[25] It took the artist four years to sculpt the two reliefs in plaster, creating 200 castings, and another two years for the foundry in Berlin to cast the pieces. In 1994, the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program surveyed War or Peace and America and described them as being well maintained.[24][25] Another sculpture Don Quixote by Aurelio Teno occupies a site near the northeast corner of the building. King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia of Spain gave the sculpture to the United States for its Bicentennial, June 3, 1976.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kennedy Center has three main theaters: the Concert Hall, the Opera House, and the Eisenhower Theater.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Concert Hall, located at the south end of the Center, seats 2,442 including chorister seats and stage boxes, and has a seating arrangement similar to that used in many European halls such as Musikverein in Vienna. The Concert Hall is the largest performance space in the Kennedy Center and is the home of the National Symphony Orchestra. A 1997 renovation brought a high-tech acoustical canopy, handicap-accessible locations on every level, and new seating sections (onstage boxes, chorister seats, and parterre seats). The Hadeland crystal chandeliers, given by the government of Norway, were repositioned to provide a clearer view.[14] Canadian organbuilder Casavant Frres constructed and installed a new pipe organ in 2012.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Opera House, in the middle, has about 2,300 seats. Its interior features include walls covered in red velvet, a distinctive red and gold silk curtain, given by the Japanese government, and Lobmeyr crystal chandelier with matching pendants, which were a gift from the government of Austria.[14] It is the major opera, ballet, and large-scale musical venue of the Center, and closed during the 2003/2004 season for extensive renovations which provided a revised seating arrangement and redesigned entrances at the orchestra level. It is the home of the Washington National Opera and the annual Kennedy Center Honors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eisenhower Theater, on the north side, seats about 1,163 and is named for President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who signed the National Cultural Center Act into law on September 2, 1958. It primarily hosts plays and musicals, smaller-scale operas, ballet and contemporary dance. The theater contains an orchestra pit for up to 35 musicians that is convertible to a forestage or additional seating space. The venue reopened in October 2008, following a 16-month renovation which altered the color scheme and seating arrangements.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther performance venues in the Center include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kennedy Center offers one of the few open-air rooftop terraces in downtown Washington, D.C.; it is free of charge to the public from 10:00?a.m. until midnight each day, except when closed for private events. The wide terrace provides views in all four directions overlooking the Rosslyn skyline in Arlington, Virginia, to the West; the Potomac River and National Airport to the South; the Washington Harbor and the Watergate Complex to the North; and the Lincoln Memorial, Department of State buildings, George Washington University and the Saudi Embassy to the East.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorld premiere performances of Kennedy Center-commissioned works have been offered through a commissioning program for new ballet and dance works. These works have been created by America's foremost choreographersPaul Taylor, Lar Lubovitch, and Merce Cunninghamfor leading American dance companies including American Ballet Theatre, Ballet West, Houston Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, Pennsylvania Ballet, and the San Francisco Ballet. Since 1999, the Kennedy Center has supported and produced the Suzanne Farrell Ballet in performances at the Center and on extended tours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Center sponsors two annual dance residency programs for young people; Exploring Ballet with Suzanne Farrell and the Dance Theatre of Harlem Residency Program, both now in their second decade. The Kennedy Center's Contemporary Dance series offers a wide range of artistic perspectives, from the foremost masters of the genre to the art form's newest and most exciting artists. In the 2008/2009 series, the Kennedy Center recognized Modern Masters of American Dance, bringing Martha Graham Dance Company, Merce Cunningham Dance Company, Lim܇n Dance Company, Mark Morris Dance Group, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company and Paul Taylor Dance Company.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years the Kennedy Center has dramatically expanded its education programs to reach young people, teachers, and families throughout the nation. The 2005 opening of the Family Theater has helped achieve this.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor over 35 years, the Kennedy Center Education Department has provided arts experiences through performances, residencies, workshops, conferences, career development programs, symposia, and on-line and print resources. In the past year, the Center's education programs have directly impacted more than 11 million people across the nation. The Education Department fosters understandings and participation in the performing arts through programs and performances for diverse populations of all ages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2008ÿ2009 season programming for Performances for Young Audiences reached more than 100 performances for young people and their families and over 110 performances for school audiences. The season included four Kennedy Center-commissioned world premieres: The Trumpet of the Swan, a musical adapted by Pulitzer Prize winner Marsha Norman from the book by E.B. White with music by Jason Robert Brown; Mermaids, Monsters, and the World Painted Purple, a new play by Marco Ramirez; Unleashed! The Secret Lives of White House Pets, a new play by Allyson Currin in collaboration with the White House Historical Association; and OMAN...O man!, a new dance production conceived and directed by Debbie Allen and is part of the Center's Arab festival, Arabesque: Arts of the Arab World. Theater for Young Audiences on Tour toured with two nationally touring productions of The Phantom Tollbooth and Blues Journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 8, 2016 it was announced that the Kennedy Center Theater for Young Audiences-commissioned musical Elephant & Piggies We are in a Play!, with book and lyrics by Mo Willems and music by Deborah Wicks La Puma, will transfer to the Off-Broadway New Victory Theater in January 2017.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of the National Symphony Orchestra will continue to present Teddy Bear Concerts throughout its seasons. During these concerts, children aged three to five bring their favorite stuffed animal to interactive musical programs featuring members of the NSO. Members of the NSO present NSO Ensemble Concerts, connecting music with various school subjects such as science and math, Kinderkonzerts, introducing kids to orchestral instruments and classical composers, as well as NSO Family Concerts.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarted in 1969 by Roger L. Stevens, the Kennedy Center's founding chairman, the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival (KCACTF) is a national theater program involving 18,000 students from colleges and universities nationwide which has served as a catalyst in improving the quality of college theater in the United States. The KCACTF has grown into a network of more than 600 academic institutions throughout the country, where theater departments and student artists showcase their work and receive outside assessment by KCACTF respondents. Since its establishment in 1969, KCACTF has reached more than 17.5 million theatergoing students and teachers nationwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kennedy Center's CETA program's mission is make the arts a critical component in every child's education. CETA, which stands for Changing Education Through the Arts, creates professional development opportunities for teachers and school administrators. Each year over 700 teachers participate in approximately 60 courses that focus on ways to integrate the arts into their teaching.[29] The Kennedy Center's CETA program also partners with sixteen schools in the Washington DC Metro area to develop long-range plan for arts integration at their school. Two of these schools, Kensington Parkwood Elementary School in Kensington, MD and Woodburn Elementary School for the Fine and Communicative Arts in Falls Church, Virginia serve as Research and Development schools for CETA.\\r\\n\\r\\nExploring Ballet with Suzanne Farrell is a three-week summer ballet intensive for international pre-professional ballerinas ages 14ÿ18. Suzanne Farrell, one of the most revered ballerinas of the 20th century, has been hosting this Balanchine-inspired intensive at the Kennedy Center since 1993.[30][31] During their three weeks in Washington, D.C., Farrell's students practice technique and choreography during  twice daily classes, six days per week. Outside of the classroom, excursions, activities and performance events are planned for EBSF students to fully immerse themselves in the culture of the nation's capital.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kennedy Center presents festivals celebrating cities, countries, and regions of the world. The festivals are filled with a wide range of performing arts, visual arts, cuisine, and multi-media. In 2008, the Center presented an exploration of the culture of Japan entitled Japan! culture + hyperculture. The 2009 Arab festival was an unprecedented exploration of the culture of the 22 Arab countries in the League of Arab States, titled Arabesque: Arts of the Arab World. In 2011, the Kennedy Center presented maximum INDIA, a three-week-long celebration of the arts and culture of the sub-continent.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its establishment in September 1971, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has showcased world-class jazz in solo, various ensembles, and big band settings. In 1994, the Kennedy Center appointed Dr. Billy Taylor as Artistic Advisor for Jazz, and his first installation was his own radio show Billy Taylor's Jazz at the Kennedy Center. Featuring his trio and guest artists in performance and discussion, the series ran for seven seasons on NPR. Since Taylor's appointment in 1994, the Center has initiated numerous performance programs to promote jazz on a national stage, featuring leading international artists and rising stars, including: the Art Tatum Piano Panorama, named after Dr. Taylor's mentor; the Louis Armstrong Legacy, highlighting vocalists; the Mary Lou Williams Women in Jazz Festival, the first festival by a major institution promoting outstanding female jazz artists; Beyond Category, featuring artists whose work transcends genre; the Platinum Series, with internationally acclaimed headliners; Jazz Ambassadors with the United States Department of State, sending musicians on worldwide goodwill tours (1998ÿ2004); the KC Jazz Club, a highly praised intimate setting; and Discovery Artists in the KC Jazz Club, highlighting up-and-coming talent. Kennedy Center and NPR annually collaborated on the beloved holiday broadcast 'NPR's Piano Jazz Christmas', until the retirement of host Marian McPartland, and hence the show, in 2011. Since 2003, the Center's jazz programs have been regularly broadcast on NPR's JazzSet with Dee Dee Bridgewater. Recent highlights, produced by the Center, have included Great Vibes, A Salute to Lionel Hampton (1995); Billy Taylor's 80th Birthday Celebration (2002); Nancy Wilson, A Career Celebration (2003); Michel Legrand with Patti Austin, part of the Center's Festival of France (2004); A Tribute to Shirley Horn (2004); James Moody's 80th Birthday (2005); and Benny Golson at 80 (2009). In March 2007, the Center hosted a once-in-a-lifetime celebration, Jazz in Our Time, which bestowed the Center's Living Jazz Legend Award to over 30 revered artists. During Dr. Taylor's tenure, the Center has created recognized educational initiatives, including national jazz satellite distance-learning programs; adult lecture series; master classes and workshops with national artists and local metropolitan Washington, D.C. students; and Betty Carter's Jazz Aheadcontinuing the singer's legacy of identifying outstanding young talent. In 2015, Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett performed there as part of their Cheek to Cheek Tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Symphony Orchestra, the Kennedy Center's artistic affiliate since 1987, has commissioned dozens of new works, among them Stephen Albert's RiverRun, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Music; Morton Gould's Stringmusic, also a Pulitzer Prize-winner; William Bolcom's Sixth Symphony, and Michael Daugherty's UFO, a concerto for solo percussion and orchestra.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to its regular season concerts, the National Symphony Orchestra presents a host of outreach, education, and pops programs, as well as concerts at Wolf Trap each year. The annual American Residencies for the Kennedy Center is a program unique to the National Symphony Orchestra and the Center. The Center sends the Orchestra to a different state each year for an intensive period of performances and teaching encompassing full orchestral, chamber, and solo concerts, master classes and other teaching sessions. The Orchestra has given these residencies in 20 states so far: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North and South Carolina, Oklahoma, North and South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Nevada, and Wyoming/Montana.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NSO recording of John Corigliano's Of Rage and Remembrance won a Grammy Award in 1996.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kennedy Center is the only U.S. institution that presents a free performance 365 days a year. The Millennium Stage, created as part of the Center's Performing Arts for Everyone initiative in 1997 and underwritten by James A. Johnson and Maxine Isaacs, features a broad spectrum of performing arts, from dance and jazz, to chamber music and folk, comedy, storytelling and theater. In the past twelve years, over three million people have attended Millennium Stage performances. The Millennium Stage has presented more than 42,000 artists, which includes over 4,000 international artists from more than 70 countries; performers representing all 50 states; and 20,000 Washington-area ensembles and solo artists. The Charlie Byrd Trio and the Billy Taylor Trio were the first artists to delight audiences with a free performance on March 1, 1997. In 1999, the Center began web-casting each night's live performance, and continues to archive and maintain each event in a database of over 3,000 performances which may be accessed via the Center's website. Performing Arts for Everyone initiatives also include low- and no-cost tickets available to performances on every stage of the Kennedy Center, and several outreach programs designed to increase access to Kennedy Center tickets and performances.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Center has co-produced more than 300 new works of theater over the past 43 years, including Tony-winning shows ranging from Annie in 1977 to A Few Good Men, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, The King and I, Titanic, and the American premiere of Les Misrables. The Center also produced the Sondheim Celebration (six Stephen Sondheim musicals) in 2002, Tennessee Williams Explored (three of Tennessee Williams' classic plays) in 2004, Mame starring Christine Baranski in 2006, Carnival! in 2007, August Wilson's Pittsburgh Cycle (Wilson's complete ten-play cycle performed as fully staged readings) and Broadway: Three Generations both in 2008, and a new production of Ragtime in 2009. The Kennedy Center Fund for New American Plays has provided critical support in the development of 135 new theatrical works. In 2011, a new production of Follies starring Bernadette Peters opened at the Eisenhower Theater, and transferred to Broadway that fall.[needs update]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1978, the Kennedy Center Honors have been awarded annually by the Center's Board of Trustees. Each year, five artists or groups are honored for their lifetime contributions to American culture and the performing arts, including dance, music, theater, opera, film, and television.[32] The Center has awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany local arts organizations present (or have presented) their work at the Kennedy Center. Some of these include:\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the American Bicentennial, the Kennedy Center hosted numerous special events throughout 1976, including six commissioned plays.[35] The center hosted free performances by groups from each state.[36] In December 1976, Mikhail Baryshnikov's version of The Nutcracker ballet played for two weeks.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kennedy Center also hosts special inauguration events and galas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1977, the Opera House hosted George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra with Rex Harrison and Elizabeth Ashley.[38] The American Ballet Theatre has also frequently performed at the Kennedy Center.[39] The troupe's 2004 production of Swan Lake, choreographed by Kevin McKenzie, was taped there, shown on PBS in June 2005, and released on DVD shortly after.\\r\\n\\r\\nProductions of The Lion King and Trevor Nunn's production of My Fair Lady (choreographed by Matthew Bourne) were presented in the 2007ÿ2008 season, to name a few.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kennedy Center stages free daily performances on its Millennium Stage in the Grand Foyer. Featured on the Millennium Stage are a range             of art forms, including performing artists and groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two theaters of The Millennium Stage are equipped with lights, sound systems, and cameras. Every free event performed at this stage is recorded and archived on the Kennedy Center's website. These archives have been available to the public for free since 2009.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nVSA (formerly VSA arts) is an international nonprofit organization founded in 1974 by Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith to create a society where people with disabilities learn through, participate in, and enjoy the arts. VSA provides educators, parents, and artists with resources and the tools to support arts programming in schools and communities. VSA showcases the accomplishments of artists with disabilities and promotes increased access to the arts for people with disabilities. Each year 7 million people participate in VSA programs through a nationwide network of affiliates and in 54 countries around the world. Affiliated with the Kennedy Center since 2005, VSA was officially merged into the organization in 2011 to become part of the Center's Department of VSA and Accessibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 16, 1971, Congress authorized appropriations for one year to the Board of Trustees for operating and maintenance expenses. In following years, the appropriations were provided to the National Park Service for operations, maintenance, security, safety and other functions not directly related to the performing arts activities.[42] The National Park Service and the Kennedy Center signed a cooperative agreement requiring each party to pay a portion of the operating and maintenance costs based on what proportion of time the building was to be used for performing arts functions. The agreement did not specify who was responsible for long-term capital improvement projects at the Kennedy Center, along with only periodic funding by Congress for one-time projects.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fiscal years 1991 and 1992, Congress recommended that $27.7 million be allocated for capital improvement projects at the Center, including $12 million for structural repairs to the garage and $15.7 million for structural and mechanical repairs, as well as projects for improving handicapped access.[44] In 1994, Congress gave full responsibility to the Kennedy Center for capital improvement projects and facility management.[45] From 1995 to 2005, over $200 million of federal funds were allocated to the Kennedy Center for long-term capital projects, repairs, and to bring the center into compliance with modern fire safety and accessibility codes.[45] Improvements included renovation of the Concert Hall, Opera House, plaza-level public spaces, and a new fire alarm system.[46] The renovations projects were completed 13 to 50 percent over budget, due to modifications of plans during the renovations resulting in overtime and other penalties.[47] Renovations to the Eisenhower Theater were completed in 2008.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Center is currently engaged in an 60,000 square feet (5,600?m2) expansion project on four acres in the Center's South Plaza. The project will add classroom, rehearsal, and performance space and includes construction of three pavilions (the Welcome Pavilion, the Skylight Pavilion, and the River Pavilion), reflecting pool, a tree grove, a sloping lawn to be used for outdoor performances, and a pedestrian bridge over Rock Creek Parkway.[48][49] The architect is Steven Holl,[49] with assistance from architectural firm BNIM.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlans for the project began after David M. Rubenstein donated $50 million to the center.[50] A groundbreaking ceremony took place in December 2014. Originally estimated to cost $100 million, the cost of the project grew to $175 million, and design changes and a major D.C. sewer project significantly delayed construction. The opening of the expansion is set for September 2019.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 1980, daily operations of the Kennedy Center were overseen by the chairman of the board of directors, and by the board itself. Aspects of the center's programming and operations were overseen by various other people. George London was the Kennedy Center's first executive director (often called \\"artistic director\\" by the press, although that was not the formal title), serving from 1968 to 1970,[51] while William McCormick Blair, Jr. was its first administrative director.[52] Julius Rudel took over as music director in 1971.[53] In 1972, Martin Feinstein replaced London and held the position of artistic director until 1980.[54] Marta Casals Istomin was named the first female artistic director in 1980, a position she held until 1990;[55] she was also the first person to be formally invested with that title.[56][57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991, the board created the position of chief operating officer to remove the day-to-day operations of the Kennedy center from the chairman and board. Lawrence Wilker was hired to fill the position, which later was retitled president.[58] The artistic director continued to oversee artistic programming, under the president's direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Kaiser became president of the Kennedy Center in 2001. He left the organization when his contract expired in September 2014.[58][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2014, Deborah F. Rutter became its third president; she is the first woman to hold that post. Rutter had previously been president of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Association, a position she held from 2003.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kennedy Center Board of Trustees, formally known as the Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, maintains and administers the Center and its site. David M. Rubenstein is the chairman of the board.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe honorary chair members of the board are the First Lady and her living predecessors. Members of the board are specified by 20 USC 76h and include ex officio members such as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Librarian of Congress, the Secretary of State (substituting for the Director of the United States Information Agency after that agency was abolished), the Chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, the Superintendent of Schools of the District of Columbia, the Director of the National Park Service, the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, as well as 36 general trustees appointed by the President of the United States for six-year terms.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes","input":"How many theaters are in the kennedy center?"},{"output":"Captain America: Civil War (2016)","context":"","input":"When was black panther first introduced in marvel movies?"},{"output":"Union of South Africa","context":"","input":"What is the old name for south africa?"},{"output":"James Cameron","context":"","input":"Who is the director of the film avatar?"},{"output":"28 March 2017","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British one pound (S1) coin is a denomination of the pound sterling. Its obverse bears the Latin engraving ELIZABETH II D G REG Dei Gratia Regina meaning, Elizabeth II, by the grace of God, Queen and F D meaning Fidei defensor,[1] Defender of the Faith.[2] It has featured the profile of Queen Elizabeth II since the original coin's introduction on 21 April 1983.[3] Four different portraits of the Queen have been used, with the latest design by Jody Clark being introduced in 2015. The design on the reverse side of the current, 12-sided coin features four emblems to represent each of the nations of the United Kingdom ÿ the English rose, the leek for Wales, the Scottish thistle, and the shamrock for Northern Ireland ÿ emerging from a single stem within a crown. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe original, round S1 coin replaced the Bank of England S1 note, which ceased to be issued at the end of 1984 and was removed from circulation on 11 March 1988, though still redeemable at the Bank's offices, like all English banknotes. One-pound notes continue to be issued in Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, and by the Royal Bank of Scotland, but the pound coin is much more widely used. A new, dodecagonal (12-sided) design of coin was introduced on 28 March 2017 [4] and both new and old versions of the one pound coin circulated together until the older design was withdrawn from circulation on 15 October 2017. After that date, the older coin could only be redeemed at banks,[5] although some retailers announced they would continue to accept it for a limited time.[6] The original round pound remains legal tender on the Isle of Man.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main purpose of redesigning the coin was to combat counterfeiting. As of March 2014 there were an estimated 1,553 million of the original nickel-brass coins in circulation,[8] of which the Royal Mint estimated in 2014 that just over 3% were counterfeit.[9][10] The new coin, in contrast, is bimetallic like the current S2 coin, and features an undisclosed hidden security feature called \\"iSIS\\" (Integrated Secure Identification Systems).[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, four different portraits of Elizabeth II have appeared on the obverse. For the first three of these, the inscription was ELIZABETH II D.G.REG.F.D. 2013,[13] where 2013 is replaced by the year of minting. The fourth design, unveiled in March 2015,[14] expanded the inscription slightly to ELIZABETH II DEI.GRA.REG.FID.DEF. 2015. The 12-sided design, introduced in March 2017, reverted to D.G.REG.F.D.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2005 the Royal Mint launched a competition to find new reverse designs for all circulating coins apart from the S2 coin.[18] The winner, announced in April 2008, was Matthew Dent, whose designs were gradually introduced into the circulating British coinage from mid-2008.[19] The designs for the 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p coins depict sections of the Royal Shield that form the whole shield when placed together. The shield in its entirety was featured on the S1 coin. The coin's obverse remained unchanged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design of the reverse of the original coin was changed each year from 1983 to 2008 to show, in turn, an emblem representing the UK, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and England, together with an appropriate edge inscription. This edge inscription could frequently be \\"upside-down\\" (when obverse is facing upward).[20] From 2008, national-based designs were still minted, but alongside the new standard version and no longer in strict rotation. The inscription ONE POUND appeared on all reverse designs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn common with non-commemorative S2 coins, the round S1 coin (except 2004ÿ07 and the 2010ÿ11 \\"capital cities\\" designs) had a mint mark: a small crosslet found on the milled edge that represents Llantrisant in South Wales, where the Royal Mint has been based since 1968.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reverse of the new 12-sided, bimetallic pound coin, introduced on 28 March 2017,[4] was chosen by a public design competition.[22] The competition to design the reverse of this coin was opened in September 2014.[23] It was won in March 2015 by 15-year-old David Pearce from Walsall, and unveiled by Chancellor George Osborne during his Budget announcement. The design features a rose, leek, thistle and shamrock bound by a crown.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll years except 1998 and 1999 have been issued into circulation, although the number issued has varied enormously ÿ 1983, 1984 and 1985 in particular had large mintages to facilitate the changeover from paper notes, while some years such as 1988 are only rarely seen (although 1988 is more noticeable as it has a unique reverse). Production since 1997 has been reduced, thanks to the introduction of the circulating two pound coin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final round coins minted for 2016 and the 2015 Shield of the Royal Arms 5th portrait did not enter circulation, as they were only available through commemorative sets.[31] These were the shield from the Royal Coat of Arms by Matthew Dent, and a design by Gregory Cameron, Bishop of St Asaph, of four heraldic beasts.[30][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring later years of the round pound's use, Royal Mint surveys estimated the proportion of counterfeit S1 coins in circulation. This was estimated at 3.04% in 2013, a rise from 2.74%.[9][10] The figure previously announced in 2012 was 2.86%, following the prolonged rise from 0.92% in 2002ÿ2003 to 0.98% in 2004, 1.26% in 2005, 1.69% in 2006, 2.06% in 2007, 2.58% in 2008, 2.65% in 2009, 3.07% in 2010 and 3.09% in 2011.[34][35] Figures were generally reported in the following year; in 2008 (as reported in 2009), the highest levels of counterfeits were in Northern Ireland (3.6%) and the South East and London (2.97%), with the lowest being in Northwest England.[36][37][38] Coin testing companies estimated in 2009 that the actual figure was about twice the Mint's estimate, suggesting that the Mint was underplaying the figures so as not to undermine confidence in the coin.[39] It is illegal to pass on counterfeit currency knowingly; the official advice is to hand it in, with details of where received, to the police, who will retain it and investigate.[40][41] One article suggested \\"given that fake coins are worthless, you will almost certainly be better off not even looking\\".[39] The recipient also has recourse against the supplier in such cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nCounterfeits are put into circulation by dishonest people, then circulated inadvertently by others who are unaware; in many cases banks do not check, and circulate counterfeits. A 2011 BBC television programme withdrew 1,000 S1 coins from each of five major banks and found that each batch contained between 32 and 38 counterfeits; the Mint estimated that about 31 per 1,000 S1 coins were counterfeit.[40] Some of the counterfeits were found by automated machinery, others could be detected only by expert visual inspection.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2010, following speculation that the Royal Mint would have to consider replacing S1 coins with a new design because of the fakes, bookmakers Paddy Power offered odds of 6/4 (bet S4 to win S6, plus the S4 stake back; decimal odds of 2.5), that the S1 coin would be removed from circulation.[37][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome counterfeits were of poor quality, with obviously visible differences  (less sharply defined, lacking intricate details, edge milling and markings visibly wrong). Many better counterfeits can be detected by comparing the orientation of the obverse and reversethey should match in genuine modern UK coins, but very often did not in counterfeit round S1.[40][41] The design on the reverse must be correct for the stamped year (e.g., a 1996 coin should have a Celtic cross).[43] It was difficult to manufacture round pounds with properly-produced edges; the milling (grooves) was often incomplete or poor and the inscription (often \\"DECUS ET TUTAMEN\\") sometimes poorly produced or in the wrong typeface.[40] A shiny coin with less wear than its date suggests is also suspect, although it may be a genuine coin that has rarely been used.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nCounterfeit coins are made by different processes including casting, stamping, electrotyping, and copying with a pantograph or spark erosion.[44] In a 2009 survey, 99% of fake S1 coins found in cash centres were made of a nickel-brass, of which three fifths contained some lead and a fifth were of a very similar alloy to that used by the Royal Mint.  The remaining 1% were made of simple copper-zinc brass, or lead or tin, or both.[45] Those made of lead or tin may have a gold-coloured coating; counterfeits made of acrylic plastic containing metal powder to increase weight were occasionally found.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final 'round pounds' were minted in December 2015; the replacement, a new 12-sided design, was introduced in 2017[46], the earliest dated as 2016. The coin has a 12-edged shape, similar to the pre-decimal brass threepence coin; it has roughly the same size as the previous S1 coin, and is bi-metallic like most S2 coins. The new design is intended to make counterfeiting more difficult, and also has an undisclosed hidden security feature called \\"iSIS\\" (Integrated Secure Identification Systems).[22][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent two-pound coins, being bi-metallic (excluding some rarely tendered commemorative issues), remain harder to counterfeit than the round pound was; such counterfeits would often easily seen to have wrong colour(s).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the round pound was operational, others that entered circulation, although not legal tender, in the UK were some S1 coins of British Crown Dependencies, Gibraltar and UK South Atlantic Overseas Territories.  Most coins of these territories, in all denominations, were of the same size and composition as a UK equivalent and most bore the same portraits of the UK monarch.[48][49] None of these territories rushed to replace their round pound coins except Gibraltar after the UK did so, which continues to use gibraltarian pound coins as legal tender as well as the new UK pound coins.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an April 1993 The New Yorker article \\"Real Britannia\\", Julian Barnes describes the meetings to choose the 1994ÿ1997 reverse designs.[50] This is reprinted in his book Letters from London as \\"Britannia's New Bra Size\\".","input":"When was the first new pound coin made?"},{"output":"June 27, 1954","context":"","input":"When did the first nuclear power plant open?"},{"output":"fruits","context":"The bell pepper (also known as sweet pepper or pepper in the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland, and capsicum /?k?ps?k?m/[1] in Australia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Singapore and New Zealand) is a cultivar group of the species Capsicum annuum.[2] Cultivars of the plant produce fruits in different colors, including red, yellow, orange, green, chocolate/brown, vanilla/white, and purple.

Today, China is the world's largest pepper producer, followed by Mexico and Indonesia.\\r\\nIdeal growing conditions for bell peppers include warm soil, ideally 21 to 29?C (70 to 84?F), that is kept moist but not waterlogged.[4] Bell peppers are sensitive to an abundance of moisture and extreme temperatures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe misleading name \\"pepper\\" was given by Europeans when Christopher Columbus brought the plant back to Europe.[5] At that time, black pepper (peppercorns), from the unrelated plant Piper nigrum originating from India, was a highly prized condiment; the name \\"pepper\\" was at that time applied in Europe to all known spices with a hot and pungent taste and was therefore naturally extended to the newly discovered Capsicum genus. The most commonly used alternative name of the plant family, \\"chile\\", is of Mexican origin, from the Nahuatl word chilli. Botanically speaking, bell peppers are fruits; however, they are correctly considered vegetables in culinary contexts.\\r\\nThe bell pepper is the only member of the Capsicum genus that does not produce capsaicin,[6] a lipophilic chemical that can cause a strong burning sensation when it comes in contact with mucous membranes. The lack of capsaicin in bell peppers is due to a recessive form of a gene that eliminates capsaicin and, consequently, the \\"hot\\" taste usually associated with the rest of the Capsicum genus.[7] This recessive gene is overwritten in the Mexibelle pepper, a hybrid variety of bell pepper that produces small amounts of capsaicin (and is thus mildly pungent). Sweet pepper cultivars produce non-pungent capsaicinoids,[8] with many physiological effects similar to the more pungent sister compound capsaican.[9]\\r\\nThe terms \\"bell pepper\\" (US), \\"pepper\\" (UK), and \\"capsicum\\" (Pakistan, India, Australia, and New Zealand) are often used for any of the large bell-shaped vegetables, regardless of their color. In British and Canadian English, the vegetable is simply referred to as a \\"pepper\\", or additionally by color (as in the term \\"green pepper\\", for example), whereas in the United States and Malaysia, they are usually referred to as \\"bell peppers\\". In parts of the U.S. Midwest, bell peppers are called \\"mangoes.\\"[10] Canadian English uses both \\"bell pepper\\" and \\"pepper\\" interchangeably.\\r\\nIn some languages, the term \\"paprika\\", which has its roots in the word for pepper, is used for both the spice and the fruit ÿ sometimes referred to by their color (e.g., \\"groene paprika\\", \\"gele paprika\\", in Dutch, which are green and yellow, respectively). The bell pepper is called \\"\\" (papurika) or \\"Ѩ\\" (piiman, from Portuguese piment?o) in Japan.[11] In Switzerland, the fruit is mostly called \\"peperone\\", which is the Italian name of the fruit. In France, it is called \\"poivron\\", with the same root as \\"poivre\\" (meaning \\"pepper\\") or \\"piment\\". In Spain it is called \\"pimiento\\", which would be the masculine form of the traditional spice, \\"pimienta\\". In South Korea, the word \\"??\\" (pimang from the Japanese \\"Ѩ\\" (piiman)) refers to green bell peppers, whereas \\"????\\" (papeurika from paprika) refers to bell peppers of other colors. In Sri Lanka, the fruit used as a vegetable is called \\"maalu miris\\".\\r\\nThe most common colors of bell peppers are green, yellow, orange and red. More rarely, brown, white, lavender, and dark purple peppers can be seen, depending on the variety. Most typically, unripe fruits are green or, less commonly, pale yellow or purple. Red bell peppers are simply ripened green peppers,[12] although the Permagreen variety maintains its green color even when fully ripe. As such, mixed colored peppers also exist during parts of the ripening process. Green peppers are less sweet and slightly more bitter than yellow or orange peppers, with red bell peppers being the sweetest. The taste of ripe peppers can also vary with growing conditions and post-harvest storage treatment; the sweetest fruits are allowed to ripen fully on the plant in full sunshine, while fruit harvested green and after-ripened in storage is less sweet.[citation needed]\\r\\nBell peppers are rich sources of antioxidants and vitamin C. The level of carotene, like lycopene, is nine times higher in red bell peppers. Red bell peppers have twice the vitamin C content of green bell peppers.[13]\\r\\nRed and green bell peppers are high in para-coumaric acid.\\r\\nThe characteristic aroma of green bell peppers is caused by 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP). Its detection threshold in water is estimated to be 2?ng/L.[14] The same chemical is responsible for characteristic Cabernet Sauvignon green note.\\r\\nOrange bell pepper\\r\\nA variety of colored bell peppers\\r\\nA whole and halved red bell pepper\\r\\nA whole purple pepper\\r\\nRed bell peppers\\r\\nJapanese green pepper\\r\\nGreen, yellow and red peppers\\r\\nQuadrato d'Asti Giallo bell pepper flower\\r\\nSecondary fruit growing inside a capsicum annuum\\r\\nRed bell pepper as decoration\\r\\nYellow bell pepper plant\\r\\nGreen bell pepper plant\\r\\nBell Pepper with Cyclamen Mite damage","input":"Is red bell pepper a fruit or vegetable?"},{"output":"Extravehicular activity (EVA)","context":"Extravehicular activity (EVA) is any activity done by an astronaut or cosmonaut outside a spacecraft beyond the Earth's appreciable atmosphere. The term most commonly applies to a spacewalk made outside a craft orbiting Earth (such as the International Space Station), but also has applied to lunar surface exploration (commonly known as moonwalks) performed by six pairs of American astronauts in the Apollo program from 1969 to 1972. On each of the last three of these missions, astronauts also performed deep-space EVAs on the return to Earth, to retrieve film canisters from the outside of the spacecraft. Astronauts also used EVA in 1973 to repair launch damage to Skylab, the United States' first space station.\\r\\nA \\"Stand-up\\" EVA (SEVA) is when an astronaut does not fully leave a spacecraft, but is completely reliant on the spacesuit for environmental support.[1] Its name derives from the astronaut \\"standing up\\" in the open hatch, usually to record or assist a spacewalking astronaut.\\r\\nEVAs may be either tethered (the astronaut is connected to the spacecraft; oxygen and electrical power can be supplied through an umbilical cable; no propulsion is needed to return to the spacecraft), or untethered. Untethered spacewalks were only performed on three missions in 1984 using the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), and on a flight test in 1994 of the Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER), a safety device worn on tethered U.S. EVAs.\\r\\nThe Soviet Union/Russia, the United States, and China have conducted EVAs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNASA planners invented the term extravehicular activity (abbreviated with the acronym EVA) in the early 1960s for the Apollo program to land men on the Moon, because the astronauts would leave the spacecraft to collect lunar material samples and deploy scientific experiments. To support this, and other Apollo objectives, the Gemini program was spun off to develop the capability for astronauts to work outside a two-man Earth orbiting spacecraft. However, the Soviet Union was fiercely competitive in holding the early lead it had gained in manned spaceflight, so the Soviet Communist Party, led by Nikita Khrushchev, ordered the conversion of its single-pilot Vostok capsule into a two- or three-person craft named Voskhod, in order to compete with Gemini and Apollo.[2] The Soviets were able to launch two Voskhod capsules before U.S. was able to launch its first manned Gemini.\\r\\nThe Voskhod's avionics required cooling by cabin air to prevent overheating, therefore an airlock was required for the spacewalking cosmonaut to exit and re-enter the cabin while it remained pressurized. By contrast, the Gemini avionics did not require air cooling, allowing the spacewalking astronaut to exit and re-enter the depressurized cabin through an open hatch. Because of this, the American and Soviet space programs developed different definitions for the duration of an EVA. The Soviet (now Russian) definition begins when the outer airlock hatch is open and the cosmonaut is in vacuum. An American EVA began when the astronaut had at least his head outside the spacecraft.[3] The USA has changed its EVA definition since.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first EVA was performed on March 18, 1965, by Soviet cosmonaut Alexey Leonov, who spent 12 minutes outside the Voskhod 2 spacecraft. Carrying a white metal backpack containing 45 minutes worth of breathing and pressurization oxygen, Leonov had no means to control his motion other than pulling on his 15.35?m (50.4?ft) tether. After the flight, he claimed this was easy, but his space suit ballooned from its internal pressure against the vacuum of space, stiffening so much that he could not activate the shutter on his chest-mounted camera.[4]\\r\\nAt the end of his space walk, the suit stiffening caused a more serious problem: Leonov had to re-enter the capsule through the inflatable cloth airlock, 1.2?m (3?ft 11?in) in diameter and 2.5?m (8?ft 2?in) long. He improperly entered the airlock head-first and got stuck sideways. He could not get back in without reducing the pressure in his suit, risking \\"the bends\\". This added another 12 minutes to his time in vacuum, and he was overheated by 1.8?C (3.2?F) from the exertion. It would be almost four years before the Soviets tried another EVA. They misrepresented to the press how difficult Leonov found it to work in weightlessness and concealed the problems encountered until after the end of the Cold War.[4][5]\\r\\nThe first American spacewalk was performed on June 3, 1965, by Ed White from the second manned Gemini flight, Gemini 4, for 21 minutes. White was tethered to the spacecraft, and his oxygen was supplied through a 25-foot (7.6?m) umbilical, which also carried communications and biomedical instrumentation. He was the first to control his motion in space with a Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit, which worked well but only carried enough propellant for 20 seconds. White found his tether useful for limiting his distance from the spacecraft but difficult to use for moving around, contrary to Leonov's claim.[4] However, a defect in the capsule's hatch latching mechanism caused difficulties opening and closing the hatch, which delayed the start of the EVA and put White and his crewmate at risk of not getting back to Earth alive.[6]\\r\\nNo EVAs were planned on the next three Gemini flights. The next EVA was planned to be made by David Scott on Gemini 8, but that mission had to be aborted due to a critical spacecraft malfunction before the EVA could be conducted. Astronauts on the next three Gemini flights (Eugene Cernan, Michael Collins, and Richard Gordon), performed several EVAs, but none was able to successfully work for long periods outside the spacecraft without tiring and overheating. Cernan attempted but failed to test an Air Force Astronaut Maneuvering Unit which included a self-contained oxygen system.\\r\\nOn November 13, 1966, Edwin \\"Buzz\\" Aldrin became the first to successfully work in space without tiring, on the Gemini 12 last flight. Aldrin worked outside the spacecraft for 2 hours and 6 minutes, in addition to two stand-up EVAs in the spacecraft hatch for an additional 3 hours and 24 minutes. Aldrin's interest in scuba diving inspired the use of underwater EVA training to simulate weightlessness, which has been used ever since to allow astronauts to practice techniques of avoiding wasted muscle energy.\\r\\nOn January 16, 1969, Soviet cosmonauts Aleksei Yeliseyev and Yevgeny Khrunov transferred from Soyuz 5 to Soyuz 4, which were docked together. This was the second Soviet EVA, and it would be almost another nine years before the Soviets performed their third.[4]\\r\\nAmerican astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin performed the first EVA on the lunar surface on July 21, 1969 (UTC), after landing their Apollo 11 Lunar Module spacecraft. This first Moon walk, using self-contained Portable Life Support Systems, lasted 2 hours 36 minutes. A total of fifteen Moon walks were performed among six Apollo crews, including Charles \\"Pete\\" Conrad, Alan Bean, Alan Shepard, Edgar Mitchell, David Scott, James Irwin, John Young, Charles Duke, Eugene Cernan, and Harrison \\"Jack\\" Schmitt. Cernan was the last Apollo astronaut to step off the surface of the Moon.[4]\\r\\nApollo 15 Command Module Pilot Al Worden made an EVA on August 5, 1971, on the return trip from the Moon, to retrieve a film and data recording canister from the Service Module. He was assisted by Lunar Module Pilot James Irwin standing up in the Command Module hatch. This procedure was repeated by Ken Mattingly and Charles Duke on Apollo 16, and by Ronald Evans and Harrison Schmitt on Apollo 17.[4]\\r\\nThe first EVA repairs of a spacecraft were made by Charles \\"Pete\\" Conrad, Joseph Kerwin, and Paul J. Weitz on May 26, June 7, and June 19, 1973, on the Skylab 2 mission. They rescued the functionality of the launch-damaged Skylab space station by freeing a stuck solar panel, deploying a solar heating shield, and freeing a stuck circuit breaker relay. The Skylab 2 crew made three EVAs, and a total of ten EVAs were made by the three Skylab crews.[4] They found that activities in weightlessness required about 2? times longer than on Earth because many astronauts suffered spacesickness early in their flights.[7]\\r\\nAfter Skylab, no more EVAs were made by the United States until the advent of the Space Shuttle program in the early 1980s. In this period, the Soviets resumed EVAs, making four from the Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 space stations between December 20, 1977, and July 30, 1982.[4]\\r\\nWhen the United States resumed EVAs on April 7, 1983, astronauts started using an Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) for self-contained life support independent of the spacecraft. STS-6 was the first Space Shuttle mission during which a spacewalk was conducted. Also, for the first time, American astronauts used an airlock to enter and exit the spacecraft like the Soviets. Accordingly, the American definition of EVA start time was redefined to when the astronaut switches the EMU to battery power.[citation needed]\\r\\nChina became the third country to independently carry out an EVA on September 27, 2008 during the Shenzhou 7 mission. Chinese astronaut Zhai Zhigang completed a spacewalk wearing the Chinese-developed Feitian space suit, with astronaut Liu Boming wearing the Russian-derived Orlan space suit to help him. Zhai completely exited the craft, while Liu stood by at the airlock, straddling the portal.\\r\\nThe first spacewalk, made by Soviet cosmonaut Alexey Leonov, was commemorated in 1965 with several Eastern Bloc stamps (see Alexey Leonov#Stamps). Since the Soviet Union did not publish details of the Voskhod spacecraft at the time, the spaceship depiction in the stamps was purely fictional.\\r\\nThe U.S. Post Office issued a postage stamp in 1967 commemorating Ed White's first American spacewalk. The engraved image has an accurate depiction of the Gemini IV spacecraft and White's space suit.[15]\\r\\nNASA \\"spacewalkers\\" during the space shuttle program were designated as EV-1, EV-2, EV-3 and EV-4 (assigned to mission specialists for each mission, if applicable).[16][17]\\r\\nFor EVAs from the International Space Station, NASA now routinely employs a camp-out procedure to reduce the risk of decompression sickness.[18] This was first tested by the Expedition 12 crew. During a camp out, astronauts sleep overnight in the airlock prior to an EVA, lowering the air pressure to 10.2?psi (70?kPa), compared to the normal station pressure of 14.7?psi (101?kPa).[18] Spending a night at the lower air pressure helps flush nitrogen from the body, thereby preventing \\"the bends\\".[19][20] More recently astronauts have been using the In-Suit Light Exercise protocol rather than camp-out to prevent decompression sickness.[21][22]","input":"What is a mission performed outside the space station?"},{"output":"expansion of the CGG triplet repeat within the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome","context":"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder.[1] Symptoms often include mild to moderate intellectual disability.[1] Physical features may include a long and narrow face, large ears, flexible fingers, and large testicles.[1] About a third of people have features of autism such as problems with social interactions and delayed speech.[1] Hyperactivity is common and seizures occur in about 10%.[1] Males are usually more affected than females.[1]\\r\\nFragile X syndrome is typically due to an expansion of the CGG triplet repeat within the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome.[1] This results in not enough fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is required for normal development of the connection between neurons.[1] Diagnosis is by genetic testing to determine the number of CGG repeats in the FMRI gene.[3] Normal is between 5 and 40 repeats, fragile X syndrome occurs with more than 200, and a premutation is said to be present when a middle number of repeats occur.[1] Testing for premutation carriers may allow for genetic counseling.[3]\\r\\nThere is no cure.[2] Early intervention is recommended as it provides the most opportunity for developing a full range of skills.[4] These interventions may include special education, speech therapy, physical therapy, or behavioral therapy.[2][5] Medications may be used to treat associated seizures, mood problems, or ADHD.[6] Fragile X syndrome occurs in about 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost young children do not show any physical signs of FXS.[7] It is not until puberty that physical features of FXS begin to develop.[7] Aside from intellectual disability, prominent characteristics of the syndrome may include an elongated face, large or protruding ears, flat feet, larger testes (macroorchidism), and low muscle tone.[8][9] Recurrent otitis media (middle ear infection) and sinusitis is common during early childhood. Speech may be cluttered or nervous. Behavioral characteristics may include stereotypic movements (e.g., hand-flapping) and atypical social development, particularly shyness, limited eye contact, memory problems, and difficulty with face encoding. Some individuals with fragile X syndrome also meet the diagnostic criteria for autism.\\r\\nMales with a full mutation display virtually complete penetrance and will therefore almost always display symptoms of FXS, while females with a full mutation generally display a penetrance of about 50% as a result of having a second, normal X chromosome.[10] Females with FXS may have symptoms ranging from mild to severe, although they are generally less affected than males.\\r\\nIndividuals with FXS may present anywhere on a continuum from learning disabilities in the context of a normal intelligence quotient (IQ) to severe intellectual disability, with an average IQ of 40 in males who have complete silencing of the FMR1 gene.[9] Females, who tend to be less affected, generally have an IQ which is normal or borderline with learning difficulties. The main difficulties in individuals with FXS are with working and short-term memory, executive function, visual memory, visual-spatial relationships, and mathematics, with verbal abilities being relatively spared.[9][13]\\r\\nData on intellectual development in FXS are limited. However, there is some evidence that standardized IQ decreases over time in the majority of cases, apparently as a result of slowed intellectual development. A longitudinal study looking at pairs of siblings where one child was affected and the other was not found that affected children had an intellectual learning rate which was 55% slower than unaffected children.[13]\\r\\nWhen both autism and FXS are present, a greater language deficit and lower IQ is observed as compared to children with only FXS.[14]\\r\\nFragile X syndrome co-occurs with autism in many cases and is a suspected genetic cause of the autism in these cases.[8][15] This finding has resulted in screening for FMR1 mutation to be considered mandatory in children diagnosed with autism.[8] Of those with fragile X syndrome, prevalence of concurrent autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been estimated to be between 15 and 60%, with the variation due to differences in diagnostic methods and the high frequency of autistic features in individuals with fragile X syndrome not meeting the DSM criteria for an ASD.[15]\\r\\nAlthough individuals with FXS have difficulties in forming friendships, those with FXS and ASD characteristically also have difficulties with reciprocal conversation with their peers. Social withdrawal behaviors, including avoidance and indifference, appear to be the best predictors of ASD in FXS, with avoidance appearing to be correlated more with social anxiety while indifference was more strongly correlated to severe ASD.[15] When both autism and FXS are present, a greater language deficit and lower IQ is observed as compared to children with only FXS.[14]\\r\\nGenetic mouse models of FXS have also been shown to have autistic-like behaviors.[16][17][18][19][20]\\r\\nFXS is characterized by social anxiety, including poor eye contact, gaze aversion, prolonged time to commence social interaction, and challenges forming peer relationships.[21] Social anxiety is one of the most common features associated with FXS, with up to 75% of males in one series characterized as having excessive shyness and 50% having panic attacks.[15] Social anxiety in individuals with FXS is related to challenges with face encoding, the ability to recognize a face that one has seen before.[22]\\r\\nIt appears that individuals with FXS are interested in social interaction and display greater empathy than groups with other causes of intellectual disability, but display anxiety and withdrawal when placed in unfamiliar situations with unfamiliar people.[15][21] This may range from mild social withdrawal, which is predominantly associated with shyness, to severe social withdrawal, which may be associated with co-existing autism spectrum disorder.[15]\\r\\nFemales with FXS frequently display shyness, social anxiety and social avoidance or withdrawal.[9] In addition, premutation in females has been found to be associated with social anxiety.\\r\\nIndividuals with FXS show decreased activation in the prefrontal regions of the brain.\\r\\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is found in the majority of males with FXS and 30% of females, making it the most common psychiatric diagnosis in those with FXS.[8][21] Hyperactivity and disruptive behavior peak in the preschool years and then gradually decline with age, although inattentive symptoms are generally lifelong.[21]\\r\\nAside from the characteristic social phobia features, a range of other anxiety symptoms are very commonly associated with FXS, with symptoms typically spanning a number of psychiatric diagnoses but not fulfilling any of the criteria in full.[21] Behaviors such as hand flapping and biting, as well as aggression, can be an expression of anxiety. Although only a minority will meet the criteria for obsessiveÿcompulsive disorder (OCD), a significant majority will feature obsessive-type symptoms. However, as individuals with FXS generally find these behaviors pleasurable, unlike individuals with OCD, they are more frequently referred to as stereotypic behaviors.\\r\\nMood symptoms in individuals with FXS rarely meet diagnostic criteria for a major mood disorder as they are typically not of sustained duration.[21] Instead, these are usually transient and related to stressors, and may involve labile (fluctuating) mood, irritability, self-injury and aggression.\\r\\nIndividuals with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) are likely to experience combinations of dementia, mood, and anxiety disorders. Males with the FMR1 premutation and clinical evidence of FXTAS were found to have increased occurrence of somatization, obsessiveÿcompulsive disorder, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism.[23]\\r\\nChildren with fragile X have very short attention spans, are hyperactive, and show hypersensitivity to visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory stimuli. These children have difficulty in large crowds due to the loud noises and this can lead to tantrums due to hyperarousal. Children with FXS pull away from light touch and can find textures of materials to be irritating. Transitions from one location to another can be difficult for children with FXS. Behavioral therapy can be used to decrease the childs sensitivity in some cases.[12]\\r\\nPerseveration is a common communicative and behavioral characteristic in FXS. Children with FXS may repeat a certain ordinary activity over and over. In speech, the trend is not only in repeating the same phrase but also talking about the same subject continually. Cluttered speech and self-talk are commonly seen. Self-talk includes talking with oneself using different tones and pitches.[12]\\r\\nOphthalmologic problems include strabismus. This requires early identification to avoid amblyopia. Surgery or patching are usually necessary to treat strabismus if diagnosed early. Refractive errors in patients with FXS are also common.[14]\\r\\nIndividuals with FXS are at a higher risk of developing seizures, with rates between 10% and 40% reported in the literature.[24] In larger study populations the frequency varies between 13% and 18%,[9][24] consistent with a recent survey of caregivers which found that 14% of males and 6% of females experienced seizures.[24] The seizures tend to be partial, are generally not frequent, and are amenable to treatment with medication.\\r\\nIndividuals who are carriers of premutation alleles are at risk for developing fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease.[10][25] It is seen in approximately half of male carriers over the age of 70, while penetrance in females is lower. Typically, onset of tremor occurs in the sixth decade of life, with subsequent progression to ataxia (loss of coordination) and gradual cognitive decline.[25]\\r\\nFrom their 40s onward, males with FXS begin developing progressively more severe problems in performing tasks that require the central executive of working memory. Working memory involves the temporary storage of information 'in mind', while processing the same or other information. Phonological memory (or verbal working memory) deteriorates with age in males, while visual-spatial memory is not found to be directly related to age. Males often experience an impairment in the functioning of the phonological loop. The CGG length is significantly correlated with central executive and the visualÿspatial memory. However, in a premutation individual, CGG length is only significantly correlated with the central executive, not with either phonological memory or visualÿspatial memory.[26]\\r\\nAbout 20% of women who are carriers for the fragile X premutation are affected by fragile X-related primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), which is defined as menopause before the age of 40.[10][25] The number of CGG repeats correlates with penetrance and age of onset.[10] However premature menopause is more common in premutation carriers than in women with the full mutation, and for premutations with more than 100 repeats the risk of FXPOI begins to decrease.[27] Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) is one of three Fragile X-associated Disorders (FXD) caused by changes in the FMR1 gene.FXPOI affects female premutation carriers of Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by the FMR1 gene, when their ovaries are not functioning properly. Women with FXPOI may develop menopause-like symptoms but they are not actually menopausal. Women with FXPOI can still get pregnant in some cases because their ovaries occasionally release viable eggs.[28]\\r\\nFragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder which occurs as a result of a mutation of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome, most commonly an increase in the number of CGG trinucleotide repeats in the 5' untranslated region of FMR1.[10][25] Mutation at that site is found in 1 out of about every 2000 males and 1 out of about every 259 females. Incidence of the disorder itself is about 1 in every 3600 males and 1 in 4000ÿ6000 females.[29] Although this accounts for over 98% of cases, FXS can also occur as a result of point mutations affecting FMR1.[10][25]\\r\\nIn unaffected individuals, the FMR1 gene contains 5ÿ44 repeats of the sequence CGG, most commonly 29 or 30 repeats.[10][25][30] Between 45-54 repeats is considered a \\"grey zone\\", with a premutation allele generally considered to be between 55 and 200 repeats in length. Individuals with fragile X syndrome have a full mutation of the FMR1 allele, with over 200 CGG repeats.[8][30][31] In these individuals with a repeat expansion greater than 200, there is methylation of the CGG repeat expansion and FMR1 promoter, leading to the silencing of the FMR1 gene and a lack of its product.\\r\\nThis methylation of FMR1 in chromosome band Xq27.3 is believed to result in constriction of the X chromosome which appears 'fragile' under the microscope at that point, a phenomenon that gave the syndrome its name. One study found that FMR1 silencing is mediated by the FMR1 mRNA. The FMR1 mRNA contains the transcribed CGG-repeat tract as part of the 5' untranslated region, which hybridizes to the complementary CGG-repeat portion of the FMR1 gene to form an RNA{DNA duplex.[32]\\r\\nFragile X syndrome has traditionally been considered an X-linked dominant condition with variable expressivity and possibly reduced penetrance.[9] However, due to genetic anticipation and X-inactivation in females, the inheritance of Fragile X syndrome does not follow the usual pattern of X-linked dominant inheritance and some scholars have suggested discontinuing labeling X-linked disorders as dominant or recessive.[33] Females with full FMR1 mutations may have a milder phenotype than males due to variability in X-inactivation.\\r\\nBefore the FMR1 gene was discovered, analysis of pedigrees showed the presence of male carriers who were asymptomatic, with their grandchildren affected by the condition at a higher rate than their siblings suggesting that genetic anticipation was occurring.[10] This tendency for future generations to be affected at a higher frequency became known as the Sherman paradox after its description in 1985.[10][34] Due to this, male children often have a greater degree of symptoms than their mothers.[35]\\r\\nThe explanation for this phenomenon is that male carriers pass on their premutation to all of their daughters, with the length of the FMR1 CGG repeat typically not increasing during meiosis, the cell division that is required to produce sperm.[10][25] Incidentally, males with a full mutation only pass on premutations to their daughters.[25] However, females with a full mutation are able to pass this full mutation on, so theoretically there is a 50% chance that a child will be affected.[25][30] In addition, the length of the CGG repeat frequently does increase during meiosis in female premutation carriers due to instability and so, depending on the length of their premutation, they may pass on a full mutation to their children who will then be affected.\\r\\nFMRP is found throughout the body, but in highest concentrations within the brain and testes.[8][10] It appears to be primarily responsible for selectively binding to around 4% of mRNA in mammalian brains and transporting it out of the cell nucleus and to the synapses of neurons. Most of these mRNA targets have been found to be located in the dendrites of neurons, and brain tissue from humans with FXS and mouse models shows abnormal dendritic spines, which are required to increase contact with other neurons. The subsequent abnormalities in the formation and function of synapses and development of neural circuits result in impaired neuroplasticity, an integral part of memory and learning.[8][10][36] Wiring changes have long been suspected to be involved in the sensory pathophysiology[37] and most recently a range of circuit alterations have been shown, involving structurally increased local connectivity and functionally decreased long-range connectivity.[38]\\r\\nIn addition, FMRP has been implicated in several signalling pathways that are being targeted by a number of drugs undergoing clinical trials. The group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) pathway, which includes mGluR1 and mGluR5, is involved in mGluR-dependent long term depression (LTD) and long term potentiation (LTP), both of which are important mechanisms in learning.[8][10] The lack of FMRP, which represses mRNA production and thereby protein synthesis, leads to exaggerated LTD. FMRP also appears to affect dopamine pathways in the prefrontal cortex which is believed to result in the attention deficit, hyperactivity and impulse control problems associated with FXS.[8][10][21] The downregulation of GABA pathways, which serve an inhibitory function and are involved in learning and memory, may be a factor in the anxiety symptoms which are commonly seen in FXS.\\r\\nCytogenetic analysis for fragile X syndrome was first available in the late 1970s when diagnosis of the syndrome and carrier status could be determined by culturing cells in a folate deficient medium and then assessing for \\"fragile sites\\" (discontinuity of staining in the region of the trinucleotide repeat) on the long arm of the X chromosome.[39] This technique proved unreliable, however, as the fragile site was often seen in less than 40% of an individual's cells. This was not as much of a problem in males, but in female carriers, where the fragile site could generally only be seen in 10% of cells, the mutation often could not be visualised.\\r\\nSince the 1990s, more sensitive molecular techniques have been used to determine carrier status.[39] The fragile X abnormality is now directly determined by analysis of the number of CGG repeats using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and methylation status using Southern blot analysis.[9] By determining the number of CGG repeats on the X chromosome, this method allows for more accurate assessment of risk for premutation carriers in terms of their own risk of fragile X associated syndromes, as well as their risk of having affected children. Because this method only tests for expansion of the CGG repeat, individuals with FXS due to missense mutations or deletions involving FMR1 will not be diagnosed using this test and should therefore undergo sequencing of the FMR1 gene if there is clinical suspicion of FXS.\\r\\nPrenatal testing with chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis allows diagnosis of FMR1 mutation while the fetus is in utero and appears to be reliable.[9]\\r\\nEarly diagnosis of fragile X syndrome or carrier status is important for providing early intervention in children or fetuses with the syndrome, and allowing genetic counselling with regards to the potential for a couple's future children to be affected. Most parents notice delays in speech and language skills, difficulties in social and emotional domains as well as sensitivity levels in certain situations with their children.[40]\\r\\nThere are no current treatments or cures for the underlying defects of FXS. Management of FXS may include speech therapy, behavioral therapy, sensory integration occupational therapy, special education, or individualised educational plans, and, when necessary, treatment of physical abnormalities. Persons with fragile X syndrome in their family histories are advised to seek genetic counseling to assess the likelihood of having children who are affected, and how severe any impairments may be in affected descendants.[41]\\r\\nCurrent trends in treating the disorder include medications for symptom-based treatments that aim to minimize the secondary characteristics associated with the disorder. If an individual is diagnosed with FXS, genetic counseling for testing family members at risk for carrying the full mutation or premutation is a critical first-step. Due to a higher prevalence of FXS in boys, the most commonly used medications are stimulants that target hyperactivity, impulsivity, and attentional problems.[9] For co-morbid disorders with FXS, antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are utilized to treat the underlying anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and mood disorders. Following antidepressants, antipsychotics such as Risperdal and Seroquel are used to treat high rates of self-injurious, aggressive and aberrant behaviors in this population (Bailey Jr et al., 2012). Anticonvulsants are another set of pharmacological treatments used to control seizures as well as mood swings in 13%ÿ18% of individuals suffering from FXS. Drugs targeting the mGluR5 (metabotropic glutamate receptors) that are linked with synaptic plasticity are especially beneficial for targeted symptoms of FXS.[9] Lithium is also currently being used in clinical trials with humans, showing significant improvements in behavioral functioning, adaptive behavior, and verbal memory. Alongside pharmacological treatments, environmental influences such as home environment and parental abilities as well as behavioral interventions such as speech therapy, sensory integration, etc. all factor in together to promote adaptive functioning for individuals with FXS.[41]\\r\\nCurrent pharmacological treatment centers on managing problem behaviors and psychiatric symptoms associated with FXS. However, as there has been very little research done in this specific population, the evidence to support the use of these medications in individuals with FXS is poor.[42]\\r\\nADHD, which affects the majority of boys and 30% of girls with FXS, is frequently treated using stimulants.[8] However, the use of stimulants in the fragile X population is associated with a greater frequency of adverse events including increased anxiety, irritability and mood lability.[21] Anxiety, as well as mood and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, may be treated using SSRIs, although these can also aggravate hyperactivity and cause disinhibited behavior.[9][21] Atypical antipsychotics can be used to stabilise mood and control aggression, especially in those with comorbid ASD. However, monitoring is required for metabolic side effects including weight gain and diabetes, as well as movement disorders related to extrapyramidal side effects such as tardive dyskinesia. Individuals with coexisting seizure disorder may require treatment with anticonvulsants.\\r\\nA 2013 review stated that life expectancy for FXS was 12 years lower than the general population and that the causes of death were similar to those found for the general population.[43]\\r\\nFragile X syndrome is the most translated neurodevelopmental disorder under study.[44] The increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease in FXS has led to the development of therapies targeting the affected pathways. Evidence from mouse models shows that mGluR5 antagonists (blockers) can rescue dendritic spine abnormalities and seizures, as well as cognitive and behavioral problems, and may show promise in the treatment of FXS.[8][45][46] Two new drugs, AFQ-056 (mavoglurant) and dipraglurant, as well as the repurposed drug fenobam are currently undergoing human trials for the treatment of FXS.[8][47] There is also early evidence for the efficacy of arbaclofen, a GABAB agonist, in improving social withdrawal in individuals with FXS and ASD.[8][15]\\r\\nIn addition, there is evidence from mouse models that minocycline, an antibiotic used for the treatment of acne, rescues abnormalities of the dendrites. An open trial in humans has shown promising results, although there is currently no evidence from controlled trials to support its use.[8]\\r\\nThe first complete DNA sequence of the repeat expansion in someone with the full mutation was generated by scientists in 2012 using SMRT sequencing.[48]\\r\\nIn 1943, James Purdon Martin and Julia Bell described a pedigree of X-linked mental disability, without considering the macroorchidism (larger testicles).[49] In 1969, Herbert Lubs first sighted an unusual \\"marker X chromosome\\" in association with mental disability.[50] In 1970, Frederick Hecht coined the term \\"fragile site\\". And, in 1985, Felix F. de la Cruz outlined extensively the physical, psychological, and cytogenic characteristics of those afflicted in addition to prospects for therapy.[51] Continued advocacy later won him an honour through the FRAXA Research Foundation in December 1998.[52]","input":"How did fragile x syndrome get its name?"},{"output":"Detroit, Michigan","context":"","input":"Where did techno music originated in the 1980s?"},{"output":"125,000","context":"The military history of African Americans spans from the arrival of the first enslaved Africans during the colonial history of the United States to the present day. In every war fought by or within the United States, African-Americans participated, including the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the MexicanÿAmerican War, the Civil War, the SpanishÿAmerican War, the World Wars, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as other minor conflicts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOrigins of the civil rights movement { Civil rights movement { Black Power movement\\r\\nAfrican-Americans as slaves and free blacks served on both sides during the war. Gary Nash reports that recent research concludes there were about 9000 black Patriot soldiers, counting the Continental Army and Navy, and state militia units, as well as privateers, wagoneers in the Army, servants to officers, and spies.[1] Ray Raphael notes that while thousands did join the Loyalist cause, \\"A far larger number, free as well as slave, tried to further their interests by siding with the patriots.\\"[2]\\r\\nBlack soldiers served in Northern militias from the outset, but this was forbidden in the South, where slave-owners feared arming slaves. Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of Virginia, issued an emancipation proclamation in November 1775, promising freedom to runaway slaves who fought for the British; Sir Henry Clinton issued a similar edict in New York in 1779.[3] Over 100,000 slaves escaped to the British lines, although possibly as few as 1,000 served under arms. Many of the rest served as orderlies, mechanics, laborers, servants, scouts and guides, although more than half died in smallpox epidemics that swept the British forces, and many were driven out of the British lines when food ran low. Despite Dunmore's promises, the majority were not given their freedom.[citation needed] Many Black Loyalists' descendants now live in Canada and Sierra Leone. Many of the Black Loyalists performed military service in the British Army, particularly as part of the only Black regiment of the war, the Black Pioneers, and others served non-military roles.\\r\\nIn response, and because of manpower shortages, Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. All-black units were formed in Rhode Island and Massachusetts; many were slaves promised freedom for serving in lieu of their masters; another all-African-American unit came from Haiti with French forces. At least 5,000 African-American soldiers fought as Revolutionaries, and at least 20,000 served with the British.\\r\\nPeter Salem and Salem Poor are the most noted of the African-American Patriots during this era, and Colonel Tye was perhaps the most noteworthy Black Loyalist.\\r\\nBlack volunteers also served with various of the South Carolina guerrilla units, including that of the \\"Swamp Fox\\", Francis Marion,[4] half of whose force sometimes consisted of free Blacks. These Black troops made a critical difference in the fighting in the swamps, and kept Marion's guerrillas effective even when many of his White troops were down with malaria or yellow fever.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first black American to fight in the Marines was John Martin, also known as Keto, the slave of a Delaware man, recruited in April 1776 without his owner's permission by Captain of the Marines Miles Pennington of the Continental brig USS Reprisal. Martin served with the Marine platoon on the Reprisal for a year and a half and took part in many ship-to-ship battles including boardings with hand-to-hand combat, but he was lost with the rest of his unit when the brig sank in October 1777.[5] At least 12 other black men served with various American Marine units in 1776ÿ1777; more may have been in service but not identified as blacks in the records. However, in 1798 when the United States Marine Corps (USMC) was officially re-instituted, Secretary of War James McHenry specified in its rules: \\"No Negro, Mulatto or Indian to be enlisted\\".[5] Marine Commandant William Ward Burrows instructed his recruiters regarding USMC racial policy, \\"You can make use of Blacks and Mulattoes while you recruit, but you cannot enlist them.\\"[5] This policy was in line with long-standing British naval practice which set a higher standard of unit cohesion for Marines, the unit to be made up of only one race, so that the members would remain loyal, maintain shipboard discipline and help put down mutinies.[5] The USMC maintained this policy until 1942.[6][7]\\r\\nDuring the War of 1812, about one-quarter of the personnel in the American naval squadrons of the Battle of Lake Erie were black, and portrait renderings of the battle on the wall of the nation's Capitol and the rotunda of Ohio's Capitol show that blacks played a significant role in it. Hannibal Collins, a freed slave and Oliver Hazard Perry's personal servant, is thought to be the oarsman in William Henry Powell's Battle of Lake Erie.[9] Collins earned his freedom as a veteran of the Revolutionary War, having fought in the Battle of Rhode Island. He accompanied Perry for the rest of Perry's naval career, and was with him at Perry's death in Trinidad in 1819.[10]\\r\\nNo legal restrictions regarding the enlistment of blacks were placed on the Navy because of its chronic shortage of manpower. The law of 1792, which generally prohibited enlistment of blacks in the Army became the United States Army's official policy until 1862. The only exception to this Army policy was Louisiana, which gained an exemption at the time of its purchase through a treaty provision, which allowed it to opt out of the operation of any law, which ran counter to its traditions and customs. Louisiana permitted the existence of separate black militia units which drew its enlistees from freed blacks.\\r\\nA militia unit, The Louisiana Battalion of Free Men of Color, and a unit of black soldiers from Santo Domingo offered their services and were accepted by General Andrew Jackson in the Battle of New Orleans, a victory that was achieved after the war was officially over.[11]\\r\\nBlacks fought at the Battle of Bladensburg 24 August 1814, many as members of Commodore Joshua Barney's naval flotilla force. This force provided crucial artillery support during the battle. One of the best accounts is that Charles Ball born 1785. Ball served with Commodore Joshua at the Battle of Bladensburg and later helped man the defenses at Baltimore. In his 1837 memoir, Ball reflected on the Battle of Bladensburg: I stood at my gun, until the Commodore was shot down if the militia regiments, that lay upon our right and left, cold have been brought to charge the British, in close fight, as they crossed the bridge, we should have killed or taken the whole of them in a short time; but the militia ran like sheep chased by dogs. [12] Barneys flotilla group included numerous African Americans who provided artillery support during the battle. Modern scholars estimate blacks made up between 15 -20?%, of the American naval forces in the War of 1812.[13]\\r\\nJust before the battle Commodore Barney on being asked by President James Madison if his negroes would not run on the approach of the British? replied: No Sirthey dont know how to run; they will die by their guns first. [14] The Commodore was correct, the men did not run, one such man was young sailor Harry Jones (no.35), apparently a free black. Harry Jones was wounded in the final action at Bladensburg. Due to the severity of Jones wounds, he remained a patient at the Naval Hospital Washington DC for nearly two months. [15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrican Americans also served with the British. On 2 April 1814, Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane issued a proclamation to all persons wishing to emigrate, similar to the aforementioned Dunmore's Proclamantion some 40 years previous. Any persons would be received by the British, either at a military outpost or aboard British ships; those seeking sanctuary could enter His Majesty's forces, or go \\"as free settlers to the British possessions in North America or the West Indies\\".[16][17] Among those who went to the British, some joined the Corps of Colonial Marines, an auxiliary unit of marine infantry, embodied on 14 May 1814.\\r\\nA number of African Americans in the Army during the MexicanÿAmerican War were servants of the officers who received government compensation for the services of their servants or slaves. Also, soldiers from the Louisiana Battalion of Free Men of Color participated in this war. African Americans also served on a number of naval vessels during the MexicanÿAmerican War, including the USS Treasure, and the USS Columbus.[11]\\r\\nThe history of African Americans in the U.S. Civil War is marked by 186,097 (7,122 officers, 178,975 enlisted)[18] African-American men, comprising 163 units, who served in the Union Army during the Civil War, and many more African Americans served in the Union Navy. Both free African Americans and runaway slaves joined the fight.\\r\\nOn the Confederate side, blacks, both free and slave, were used for labor. In the final months of the war, the Confederate Army was desperate for additional soldiers so the Confederate Congress voted to recruit black troops for combat; they were to be promised their freedom. Units were in training when the war ended, and none served in combat.[19]\\r\\nFrom 1863 to the early 20th century, African-American units were utilized by the Army to combat the Native Americans during the Indian Wars.[20] The most noted among this group were the Buffalo Soldiers:\\r\\nAt the end of the U.S. Civil War the army reorganized and authorized the formation of two regiments of black cavalry (the 9th and 10th US Cavalry). Four regiments of infantry (the 38th, 39th, 40th and 41st US Infantry) were formed at the same time. In 1869, the four infantry regiments were merged into two new ones (the 24th and 25th US Infantry). These units were composed of black enlisted men commanded by white officers such as Benjamin Grierson, and occasionally, an African-American officer such as Henry O. Flipper. The \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\" served a variety of roles along the frontier from building roads to guarding the U.S. mail.[21]\\r\\nThese regiments served at a variety of posts in the southwest United States and Great Plains regions. During this period they participated in most of the military campaigns in these areas and earned a distinguished record. Thirteen enlisted men and six officers from these four regiments earned the Medal of Honor during the Indian Wars.[22]\\r\\nAfter the Indian Wars ended in the 1890s, the regiments continued to serve and participated in the SpanishÿAmerican War (including the Battle of San Juan Hill), where five more Medals of Honor were earned.[23] They took part in the 1916 Punitive Expedition into Mexico and in the PhilippineÿAmerican War.\\r\\nIn addition to the African Americans who served in regular army units during the SpanishÿAmerican War, five African-American Volunteer Army units and seven African-American National Guard units served.\\r\\nVolunteer Army:\\r\\nNational Guard:\\r\\nOf these units, only the 9th U.S., 8th Illinois, and 23rd Kansas served outside the United States during the war. All three units served in Cuba and suffered no losses to combat.\\r\\nAfter the Treaty of Paris, the islands of the Philippines became a colony of the United States. When the U.S. military started to send soldiers into the islands, native rebels, who had already been fighting their former Spanish rulers, opposed U.S. colonization and retaliated, causing an insurrection. In what would be known as the Philippine-American War, the U.S. military also sent colored regiments and units to stop the insurrection. However, due to the discrimination of African-American soldiers, some of them defected to the Philippine Army.\\r\\nOne of those that defected was David Fagen, who was given the rank of captain in the Philippine Army. Fagen served in the 24th Regiment of the U.S. Army, but on November 17, 1899,[25] he defected to the Filipino army.[26] He became a successful guerrilla leader and his capture became an obsession to the U.S. military and American public. His defection was likely the result of differential treatment by American occupational forces toward black soldiers, as well as common American forces derogatory treatment and views of the Filipino occupational resistance, who were frequently referred to as \\"niggers\\" and \\"gugus\\".[27]\\r\\nAfter two other black deserters were captured and executed, President Theodore Roosevelt announced he would stop executing captured deserters.[28] As the war ended, the US gave amnesties to most of their opponents. A substantial reward was offered for Fagen, who was considered a traitor. There are two conflicting versions of his fate: one is that his was the partially decomposed head for which the reward was claimed, the other is that he took a local wife and lived peacefully in the mountains.[29]\\r\\nThe U.S. armed forces remained segregated through World War I. Still, many African Americans eagerly volunteered to join the Allied cause following America's entry into the war. By the time of the armistice with Germany on November 11, 1918, over 350,000 African Americans had served with the American Expeditionary Force on the Western Front.[30]\\r\\nMost African-American units were largely relegated to support roles and did not see combat. Still, African Americans played a notable role in America's war effort. For example, the 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the \\"Harlem Hellfighters\\", was assigned to the French Army and served on the front lines for six months. 171 members of the 369th were awarded the Legion of Merit.\\r\\nCorporal Freddie Stowers of the 371st Infantry Regiment that was seconded to the 157th French Army division called the Red Hand Division in need of reinforcement under the command of the General Mariano Goybet was posthumously awarded a Medal of Honor[31]the only African American to be so honored for actions in World War I. During action in France, Stowers had led an assault on German trenches, continuing to lead and encourage his men even after being twice wounded. Stowers died from his wounds, but his men continued the fight and eventually defeated the German troops. Stowers was recommended for the Medal of Honor shortly after his death, but the nomination was, according to the Army, misplaced. In 1990, under pressure from Congress, the Department of the Army launched an investigation. Based on findings from this investigation, the Army Decorations Board approved the award of the Medal of Honor to Stowers. On April 24, 1991ÿ73 years after he was killed in actionStowers' two surviving sisters received the Medal of Honor from President George H. W. Bush at the White House. The success of the investigation leading to Stowers' Medal of Honor later sparked a similar review that resulted in six African Americans being posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in World War II. Vernon Baker was the only recipient who was still alive to receive his award.[32]\\r\\nSome of the most notable[according to whom?] African-American units which served in World War I were:\\r\\nSupport units included:\\r\\nA complete list of African-American units that served in the war is published in the book Willing Patriots: Men of Color in World War One. The book is cited in the \\"Further reading\\" section of this article.\\r\\nEven though the U.S. government was nominally neutral in the wars waged by Fascists against Ethiopia and Fascists and Nazis against the Spanish Republic in the mid-1930s, African Americans found it hard to be neutral and many became Antifascist.[37]\\r\\nOn October 4, 1935, Fascist Italy invaded Ethiopia. Being the only non-colonized African country besides Liberia, the invasion of Ethiopia caused a profound response amongst African Americans.[38] African Americans organized to raise money for medical supplies, and many volunteered to fight for the African kingdom.[39] Within eight months, however, Ethiopia was overpowered by the advanced weaponry and mustard gas of the Italian forces.\\r\\nMany years later Haile Selassie I would comment on the efforts: \\"We can never forget the help Ethiopia received from Negro Americans during the crisis. ... It moved me to know that Americans of African descent did not abandon their embattled brothers, but stood by us.\\"[39]\\r\\nWhen General Franco rebelled against the newly established secular Spanish Republic, a number of African Americans volunteered to fight for Republican Spain. Many African Americans who were in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade had Communist ideals. Among these, there was Vaughn Love who went to fight for the Spanish loyalist cause because he considered Fascism to be the \\"enemy of all black aspirations.\\"\\r\\nAfrican-American activist and World War I veteran Oliver Law, fighting in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish Civil War, is believed to have been the first African-American officer to command an integrated unit of soldiers.[40]\\r\\nJames Peck was an African-American man from Pennsylvania who was turned down when he applied to become a military pilot in the US. He then went on to serve in the Spanish Republican Air Force until 1938.[41] Peck was credited with shooting down five Aviaci܇n Nacional planes, two Heinkel He-51s from the Legion Condor and three Fiat CR.32 Fascist Italian fighters.\\r\\nSalaria Kea was a young African-American nurse from Harlem Hospital who served as a military nurse with the American Medical Bureau in the Spanish Civil War. She was one of the two only African-American female volunteers in the midst of the war-torn Spanish Republican areas.[42] When Salaria came back from Spain she wrote the pamphlet \\"A Negro Nurse in Spain\\" and tried to raise funds for the beleaguered Spanish Republic.[43]\\r\\nThe Pittsburgh Courier[44]\\r\\nDespite a high enlistment rate in the U.S. Army, African Americans were not treated equally. At parades, church services, in transportation and canteens the races were kept separate. The Women's Army Corps (WAC) changed its enlistment policies in January 1941, allowing for African-American women to join the ranks of Army nurses to strengthen the war effort. Much like with male soldiers, Black women were given separate training, inferior living quarters, and rations. Black nurses were integrated into everyday life with their white colleagues and often felt the pain of discrimination and slander from the wounded soldiers they cared for and the leadership assigned to them.[45]\\r\\nElizabeth \\"Tex\\" Williams served in the Women's Army Corps as an African American military photographer from 1944 to 1970. According to scholars, she was one of the few successful women photographers in her time.[46]\\r\\nThe Navy did not follow suit in changing its policies to include women of color until January 25, 1945. The first African-American woman sworn into the Navy was Phyllis Mae Dailey, a nurse and Columbia University student from New York. She was the first of only four African-American women to serve in the navy during World War II.[47]\\r\\nMany soldiers of color served their country with distinction during World War II. There were 125,000 African Americans who were overseas in World War II. Famous segregated units, such as the Tuskegee Airmen and 761st Tank Battalion and the lesser-known but equally distinguished 452nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion,[48] proved their value in combat, leading to desegregation of all U.S. armed forces by order of President Harry S. Truman in July 1948 via Executive Order 9981.\\r\\nBenjamin O. Davis, Jr. served as commander of the Tuskegee Airmen during the war. He later went on to become the first African-American general in the United States Air Force. His father, Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., had been the first African-American brigadier general in the Army (1940).\\r\\nDoris Miller, a Navy mess attendant, was the first African-American recipient of the Navy Cross, awarded for his actions during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Miller had voluntarily manned an anti-aircraft gun and fired at the Japanese aircraft, despite having no prior training in the weapon's use.\\r\\nIn 1944, the Golden Thirteen became the Navy's first African-American commissioned officers. Samuel L. Gravely, Jr. became a commissioned officer the same year; he would later be the first African American to command a US warship, and the first to be an admiral.\\r\\nThe Port Chicago disaster on July 17, 1944, was an explosion of about 2,000 tons of ammunition as it was being loaded onto ships by black Navy sailors under pressure from their white officers to hurry. The explosion in Northern California killed 320 military and civilian workers, most of them black. It led a month later to the Port Chicago Mutiny, the only case of a full military trial for mutiny in the history of the U.S. Navy against 50 African-American sailors who refused to continue loading ammunition under the same dangerous conditions. The trial was observed by the then young lawyer Thurgood Marshall and ended in conviction of all of the defendants. The trial was immediately and later criticized for not abiding by the applicable laws on mutiny, and it became influential in the discussion of desegregation.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring World War II, most male African-American soldiers still served only as truck drivers and as stevedores (except for some separate tank battalions and Army Air Forces escort fighters).[49] African-American women in uniform answered the call of duty by tending the wounded as nurses, or working as riveters, mail clerks, file clerks, typists, stenographers, supply clerks, or motor pool drivers.[50] In the midst of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, General Eisenhower was severely short of replacement troops for existing all-white companies. Consequently, he made the decision to allow 2000 black servicemen volunteers to serve in segregated platoons under the command of white lieutenants to replenish these companies.[51] These platoons would serve with distinction and, according to an Army survey in the summer of 1945, 84% were ranked \\"very well\\" and 16% were ranked \\"fairly well\\". No black platoon received a ranking of \\"poor\\" by those white officers or white soldiers that fought with them. Unfortunately, these platoons were often subject to racist treatment by white military units in occupied Germany and were quickly sent back to their old segregated units after the end of hostilities in Germany. Despite their protests, these brave African-American soldiers ended the war in their old non-combat service units. Though largely forgotten after the war, the temporary experiment with black combat troops proved a success - a small, but important step toward permanent integration during the Korean War.[52][53] A total of 708 African Americans were killed in combat during World War II.[54]\\r\\nIn 1945, Frederick C. Branch became the first African-American United States Marine Corps officer. In 1965, Marcelite J. Harris became the first female African American United States Air Force officer.\\r\\nSome of the most notable African-American Army units that served in World War II:\\r\\nTwo segregated units were organized by the United States Marine Corps:\\r\\nOn January 13, 1997, President Bill Clinton, in a White House ceremony, awarded the nation's highest military honorthe Medal of Honorto seven African-American servicemen who had served in World War II.[65]\\r\\nThe only living recipient was First Lieutenant Vernon Baker.\\r\\nThe posthumous recipients were:\\r\\nAfrican-American troops faced discrimination in the form of the disproportionate issuance of blue discharges. The blue discharge (also called a \\"blue ticket\\") was a form of administrative discharge created in 1916 to replace two previous discharge classifications, the administrative discharge without honor and the \\"unclassified\\" discharge. It was neither honorable nor dishonorable.[66] Of the 48,603 blue discharges issued by the Army between December 1, 1941, and June 30, 1945, 10,806 were issued to African Americans. This accounts for 22.2% of all blue discharges, when African Americans made up 6.5% of the Army in that time frame.[67] Blue discharge recipients frequently faced difficulties obtaining employment[68] and were routinely denied the benefits of the G. I. Bill by the Veterans Administration (VA).[69] In October 1945, Black-interest newspaper The Pittsburgh Courier launched a crusade against the discharge and its abuses. Calling the discharge \\"a vicious instrument that should not be perpetrated against the American Soldier\\", the Courier rebuked the Army for \\"allowing prejudiced officers to use it as a means of punishing Negro soldiers who do not like specifically unbearable conditions\\". The Courier specifically noted the discrimination faced by homosexuals, another group disproportionately discharged with blue tickets, calling them \\"'unfortunates' of the Nation...being preyed upon by the blue discharge\\" and demanded to know \\"why the Army chooses to penalize these 'unfortunates' who seem most in need of Army benefits and the opportunity to become better citizens under the educational benefits of the GI Bill of Rights\\".[70] The Courier printed instructions on how to appeal a blue discharge and warned its readers not to quickly accept a blue ticket out of the service because of the negative effect it would likely have on their lives.[71]\\r\\nThe House Committee on Military Affairs held hearings in response to the press crusade, issuing a report in 1946 that sharply criticized its use and the VA for discriminating against blue discharge holders.[72] Congress discontinued the blue discharge in 1947,[73] but the VA continued its practice of denying G. I. Bill benefits to blue-tickets.[69]\\r\\nOn July 26, 1948, President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9981 integrating the military and mandating equality of treatment and opportunity. It also made it illegal, per military law, to make a racist remark. Desegregation of the military was not complete for several years, and all-black Army units persisted well into the Korean War. The last all-black unit wasn't disbanded until 1954.\\r\\nIn 1950, Lieutenant Leon Gilbert of the still-segregated 24th Infantry Regiment was court martialed and sentenced to death for refusing to obey the orders of a white officer while serving in the Korean War. Gilbert maintained that the orders would have meant certain death for himself and the men in his command. The case led to worldwide protests and increased attention to segregation and racism in the U.S. military. Gilbert's sentence was commuted to twenty and later seventeen years of imprisonment; he served five years and was released.\\r\\nThe integration commanded by Truman's 1948 Executive Order extended to schools and neighborhoods as well as military units. Fifteen years after the Executive Order, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara issued Department of Defense Directive 5120.36. \\"Every military commander\\", the Directive mandates, \\"has the responsibility to oppose discriminatory practices affecting his men and their dependents and to foster equal opportunity for them, not only in areas under his immediate control, but also in nearby communities where they may gather in off-duty hours.\\"[74] While the directive was issued in 1963, it was not until 1967 that the first non-military establishment was declared off-limits. In 1970 the requirement that commanding officers first obtain permission from the Secretary of Defense was lifted, and areas were allowed to be declared housing areas off limits to military personnel by their commanding officer.[75]\\r\\nSince the end of military segregation and the creation of an all-volunteer army, the American military saw the representation of African Americans in its ranks rise precipitously.[76]\\r\\nJesse L. Brown became the U.S. Navy's first black aviator in October 1948. He died when his plane was shot down during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in North Korea. He was unable to parachute from his crippled F4U Corsair and crash-landed successfully. His injuries and damage to his aircraft prevented him from leaving the plane. A white squadron mate, Thomas Hudner, crash-landed his F4U Corsair near Brown and attempted to extricate Brown but could not and Brown died of his injuries. Hudner was awarded the Medal of Honor for his efforts. The U.S. Navy honored Jesse Brown by naming a frigate after himthe USS Jesse L. Brown (FF-1089).[77]\\r\\nTwo enlisted men from the 24th Infantry Regiment (still a segregated unit), Cornelius H. Charlton and William Thompson, posthumously received the Medal of Honor for actions during the war.\\r\\nThe Vietnam War saw many great accomplishments by many African Americans, including twenty who received the Medal of Honor for their actions. African Americans during the conflict suffered disproportionately higher casualty rates during the early years, but after reforms were implemented in 1967ÿ68 the casualty rate dropped to slightly higher than their percentage of the total population.[78][79]\\r\\nIn 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented the Medal of Honor to U.S. Army Specialist Five Lawrence Joel, for a \\"very special kind of couragethe unarmed heroism of compassion and service to others.\\" Joel was the first living African American to receive the Medal of Honor since the MexicanÿAmerican War. He was a medic who in 1965 saved the lives of U.S. troops under ambush in Vietnam and defied direct orders to stay to the ground, walking through Viet Cong gunfire and tending to the troops despite being shot twice himself. The Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, is dedicated to his honor.[80]\\r\\nOn August 21, 1968, with the posthumous award of the Medal of Honor, U.S. Marine James Anderson, Jr. became the first African-American U.S. Marine recipient of the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions and sacrifice of life.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn December 10, 1968, U.S. Army Captain Riley Leroy Pitts became the first African-American commissioned officer to be awarded the Medal of Honor. His medal was presented posthumously to his wife, Eula Pitts, by President Lyndon B. Johnson.\\r\\nThree out of the 21 African-American Medal of Honor recipients who served in Vietnam were members of the 5th Special Forces Group otherwise known as The Green Berets. These men are as follows: Sergeant First Class Melvin Morris, SFC. Eugene Ashley, Jr., and SFC. William Maud Bryant.\\r\\nMelvin Morris received the Medal of Honor 44 years after the action in which he earned the Distinguished Service Cross. Sergeant Ashley's medal was posthumously awarded to his family at the White House by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew on December 2, 1969.\\r\\nIn 1989, President George H. W. Bush appointed Army General Colin Powell to the position of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, making Powell the highest-ranking officer in the United States military. Powell was the first, and is so far the only, African American to hold that position. The Chairman serves as the chief military adviser to the President and the Secretary of Defense. During his tenure Powell oversaw the 1989 United States invasion of Panama to oust General Manuel Noriega and the 1990 to 1991 Gulf War against Iraq.

Individuals may form multiple and simultaneous sexual or romantic bonds.[1]  This stands in contrast to monogamy, and yet may arise from the same psychology.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term has been criticized as implying that monogamy is the norm, and thus other ways of relating are deviant and therefore somehow unhealthy or immoral.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany terms for non-monogamous practices are flexible in definition, being based on criteria such as \\"relationship\\" or \\"love\\" that are themselves questionably defined.

It is deficient or defective in von Willebrand disease and is involved in a large number of other diseases, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, Heyde's syndrome, and possibly hemolytic-uremic syndrome.[5] Increased plasma levels in a large number of cardiovascular, neoplastic, and connective tissue diseases are presumed to arise from adverse changes to the endothelium, and may contribute to an increased risk of thrombosis.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nvWF is a large multimeric glycoprotein present in blood plasma and produced constitutively as ultra-large vWF in endothelium (in the Weibel-Palade bodies), megakaryocytes (ϫ-granules of platelets), and subendothelial connective tissue.[5]\\r\\nThe basic vWF monomer is a 2050-amino acid protein. Every monomer contains a number of specific domains with a specific function; elements of note are:[5]\\r\\nMonomers are subsequently N-glycosylated, arranged into dimers in the endoplasmic reticulum and into multimers in the Golgi apparatus by crosslinking of cysteine residues via disulfide bonds. With respect to the glycosylation, vWF is one of only a few proteins that carry ABO blood group system antigens.[5]\\r\\nMultimers of vWF can be extremely large, >20,000 kDa, and consist of over 80 subunits of 250 kDa each. Only the large multimers are functional. Some cleavage products that result from vWF production are also secreted but probably serve no function.[5]\\r\\nVon Willebrand factor's primary function is binding to other proteins, in particular factor VIII, and it is important in platelet adhesion to wound sites.[5] It is not an enzyme and, thus, has no catalytic activity.\\r\\nvWF binds to a number of cells and molecules. The most important ones are:[5]\\r\\nvWF plays a major role in blood coagulation. Therefore, vWF deficiency or dysfunction (von Willebrand disease) leads to a bleeding tendency, which is most apparent in tissues having high blood flow shear in narrow vessels. From studies it appears that vWF uncoils under these circumstances, decelerating passing platelets.[5] Recent research also suggests that von Willebrand factor is involved in the formation of blood vessels themselves, which would explain why some people with von Willebrand disease develop vascular malformations (predominantly in the digestive tract) that can bleed excessively.[8]\\r\\nThe biological breakdown (catabolism) of vWF is largely mediated by the enzyme ADAMTS13 (acronym of \\"a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif no. 13\\"). It is a metalloproteinase that cleaves vWF between tyrosine at position 842 and methionine at position 843 (or 1605ÿ1606 of the gene) in the A2 domain. This breaks down the multimers into smaller units, which are degraded by other peptidases.[9]\\r\\nHereditary or acquired defects of vWF lead to von Willebrand disease (vWD), a bleeding diathesis of the skin and mucous membranes, causing nosebleeds, menorrhagia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The point at which the mutation occurs determines the severity of the bleeding diathesis. There are three types (I, II and III), and type II is further divided in several subtypes. Treatment depends on the nature of the abnormality and the severity of the symptoms.[10] Most cases of vWD are hereditary, but abnormalities of vWF may be acquired; aortic valve stenosis, for instance, has been linked to vWD type IIA, causing gastrointestinal bleeding - an association known as Heyde's syndrome.[11]\\r\\nIn thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), ADAMTS13 either is deficient or has been inhibited by antibodies directed at the enzyme. This leads to decreased breakdown of the ultra-large multimers of vWF and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with deposition of fibrin and platelets in small vessels, and capillary necrosis. In TTP, the organ most obviously affected is the brain; in HUS, the kidney.[12]\\r\\nHigher levels of vWF are more common among people that have had ischemic stroke (from blood-clotting) for the first time.[13] Occurrence is not affected by ADAMTS13, and the only significant genetic factor is the person's blood group. High plasma vWF levels were found to be an independent predictor of major bleeding in anticoagulated atrial fibrillation patients.[14]\\r\\nvWF is named after Dr. Erik von Willebrand (1870ÿ1949), a Finnish doctor who in 1924 first described a hereditary bleeding disorder in families from the ?land islands, who had a tendency for cutaneous and mucosal bleeding, including menorrhagia. Although von Willebrand could not identify the definite cause, he distinguished von Willebrand disease (vWD) from hemophilia and other forms of bleeding diathesis.[15]\\r\\nIn the 1950s, vWD was shown to be caused by a plasma factor deficiency (instead of being caused by platelet disorders), and, in the 1970s, the vWF protein was purified.[5]\\r\\nVon Willebrand factor has been shown to interact with Collagen, type I, alpha 1.[16]\\r\\nRecently, It has been reported that the cooperation and interactions within the Von Willebrand factors enhances the adsorption probability in the primary haemostasis. Such cooperation is proven by calculating the adsorption probability of flowing vWF once it crosses another adsorbed one. Such cooperation is held within a wide range of shear rates.[17]","input":"What is the function of von willebrand factor?"},{"output":"Phoenician alphabet","context":"Coordinates: 340725N 353904E? / ?34.12361N 35.65111E? / 34.12361; 35.65111\\r\\nPhoenicia (UK: /f??n???/ or US: /f??ni???/;[2] from the Ancient Greek: ?ٻ, Phoink meaning either \\"purple country\\" or \\"land of palm trees\\") was a thalassocratic ancient Semitic civilization that originated in the Eastern Mediterranean and in the west of the Fertile Crescent. It included the coastline of what is now Lebanon, Israel, Gaza, Syria, and south-west Turkey, though some of its colonies later reached the Western Mediterranean (most notably Carthage) and even the Atlantic Ocean. The civilization spread across the Mediterranean between 1500 BC and 300 BC.\\r\\nPhoenicia is an Ancient Greek term used to refer to the major export of the region, cloth dyed Tyrian purple from the Murex mollusc, and referred to the major Canaanite port towns, and it does not correspond exactly to a cultural identity that would have been recognised by the Phoenicians themselves. Their civilization was organized in city-states, similar to those of Ancient Greece,[3] perhaps the most notable of which were Tyre, Sidon, Arwad, Berytus, Byblos and Carthage.[4] Each city-state was a politically independent unit, and it is uncertain to what extent the Phoenicians viewed themselves as a single nationality. In terms of archaeology, language, lifestyle, and religion there was little to set the Phoenicians apart as markedly different from other residents of the Levant.[citation needed]\\r\\nAround 1050 BC, a Phoenician alphabet was used for the writing of Phoenician.[5][6] It became one of the most widely used writing systems, spread by Phoenician merchants across the Mediterranean world, where it evolved and was assimilated by many other cultures.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Phoenicians, like Latin Poenؐ (adj. poenicus, later pnicus), comes from Greek ?ٚ? (Phonikes). The word ? pho?nix meant variably \\"Phoenician person\\", \\"Tyrian purple, crimson\\" or \\"date palm\\" and is attested with all three meanings already in Homer.[8] (The mythical bird phoenix also carries the same name, but this meaning is not attested until centuries later.) The word may be derived from ?? phoin܇s \\"blood red\\",[9] itself possibly related to ?? ph܇nos \\"murder\\". It is difficult to ascertain which meaning came first, but it is understandable how Greeks may have associated the crimson or purple color of dates and dye with the merchants who traded both products. Robert S. P. Beekes has suggested a pre-Greek origin of the ethnonym.[10] The oldest attested form of the word in Greek may be the Mycenaean po-ni-ki-jo, po-ni-ki, possibly borrowed from Egyptian fn?w (fenkhu)[11] \\"Asiatics, Semites\\", although this derivation is disputed.[12] The folk etymological association of ?ٻwith ? mirrors that in Akkadian, which tied kina?ni, kina??i \\"Canaan\\" to kina??u \\"red-dyed wool\\".[13][14] The land was natively known as kn?n (compare Eblaite ka-na-na-um, phn|ka-na-na) and its people as the kn?ny. In the Amarna tablets of the 14th century BC, people from the region called themselves Kenaani or Kinaani. Much later, in the 6th century BC, Hecataeus of Miletus writes that Phoenicia was formerly called ϫ khna, a name that Philo of Byblos later adopted into his mythology as his eponym for the Phoenicians: \\"Khna who was afterwards called Phoinix\\".[15] The ethnonym survived in North Africa until the 4th century AD (see Punic language).\\r\\nHerodotus's account (written c.?440?BCE) refers to the myths of Io and Europa.\\r\\nAccording to the Persians best informed in history, the Phoenicians began the quarrel. These people, who had formerly dwelt on the shores of the Erythraean Sea, having migrated to the Mediterranean and settled in the parts which they now inhabit, began at once, they say, to adventure on long voyages, freighting their vessels with the wares of Egypt and Assyria?...\\r\\nThe Greek historian Strabo believed that the Phoenicians originated from Bahrain.[16] Herodotus also believed that the homeland of the Phoenicians was Bahrain.[17][18] This theory was accepted by the 19th-century German classicist Arnold Heeren who said that: \\"In the Greek geographers, for instance, we read of two islands, named Tyrus or Tylos, and Aradus, which boasted that they were the mother country of the Phoenicians, and exhibited relics of Phoenician temples.\\"[19] The people of Tyre in South Lebanon in particular have long maintained Persian Gulf origins, and the similarity in the words \\"Tylos\\" and \\"Tyre\\" has been commented upon.[20] The Dilmun civilization thrived in Bahrain during the period 2200ÿ1600 BCE, as shown by excavations of settlements and Dilmun burial mounds. However, some claim there is little evidence of occupation at all in Bahrain during the time when such migration had supposedly taken place.[21]\\r\\nCanaanite culture apparently developed in situ from the earlier Ghassulian chalcolithic culture. Ghassulian itself developed from the Circum-Arabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex, which in turn developed from a fusion of their ancestral Natufian and Harifian cultures with Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) farming cultures, practicing the domestication of animals, during the 6200?BC climatic crisis which led to the Neolithic Revolution in the Levant.[22] Byblos is attested as an archaeological site from the Early Bronze Age. The Late Bronze Age state of Ugarit is considered quintessentially Canaanite archaeologically,[23] even though the Ugaritic language does not belong to the Canaanite languages proper.[24][5]\\r\\nThe Phoenician alphabet consists of 22 letters, all consonants.[7] Since around 1050 BC,[5] this script was used for the writing of Phoenician, a Northern Semitic language. It is believed to be one of the ancestors of modern alphabets.[26][27] By their maritime trade, the Phoenicians spread the use of the alphabet to Anatolia, North Africa, and Europe, where it was adopted by the Greeks who developed it into an alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants.[28][29]\\r\\nThe name \\"Phoenician\\" is by convention given to inscriptions beginning around 1050 BC, because Phoenician, Hebrew, and other Canaanite dialects were largely indistinguishable before that time.[5][6] The so-called Ahiram epitaph, engraved on the sarcophagus of king Ahiram from about 1000 BC shows essentially a fully developed Phoenician script.[30][25][31]\\r\\nThe Phoenicians were among the first state-level societies to make extensive use of alphabets: the family of Canaanite languages, spoken by Israelites, Phoenicians, Amorites, Ammonites, Moabites and Edomites, was the first historically attested group of languages to use an alphabet, derived from the Proto-Canaanite script, to record their writings. The Proto-Canaanite script uses around 30 symbols but was not widely used until the rise of new Semitic kingdoms in the 13th and 12th centuries BC.[32] The Proto-Canaanite script is derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs.[33]\\r\\nFernand Braudel remarked in The Perspective of the World that Phoenicia was an early example of a \\"world-economy\\" surrounded by empires. The high point of Phoenician culture and sea power is usually placed c. 1200ÿ800?BC. Archaeological evidence consistent with this understanding has been difficult to identify. A unique concentration in Phoenicia of silver hoards dated between 1200 and 800 BC, however, contains hacksilver with lead isotope ratios matching ores in Sardinia and Spain.[34] This metallic evidence agrees with the biblical memory of a western Mediterranean Tarshish that supplied Solomon with silver via Phoenicia, during the latter's heyday (see 'trade', below).[35]\\r\\nMany of the most important Phoenician settlements had been established long before this: Byblos, Tyre in South Lebanon, Sidon, Simyra, Arwad, and Berytus, the capital of Lebanon, all appear in the Amarna tablets.\\r\\nThe league of independent city-state ports, with others on the islands and along other coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, was ideally suited for trade between the Levant area, rich in natural resources, and the rest of the ancient world. Around 1200?BC, a series of poorly-understood events weakened and destroyed the adjacent Egyptian and Hittite empires. In the resulting power vacuum, a number of Phoenician cities rose as significant maritime powers.\\r\\nPhoenician societies rested on three power-bases: the king; temples and their priests; and councils of elders. Byblos first became the predominant center from where the Phoenicians dominated the Mediterranean and Erythraean (Red) Sea routes. It was here that the first inscription in the Phoenician alphabet was found, on the sarcophagus of Ahiram (c. 1200?BC).[citation needed]\\r\\nLater, Tyre in South Lebanon gained in power. One of its kings, the priest Ithobaal (887ÿ856?BC), ruled Phoenicia as far north as Beirut, and part of Cyprus. Carthage was founded in 814?BC under Pygmalion of Tyre (820ÿ774?BC).[citation needed] The collection of city-states constituting Phoenicia came to be characterized by outsiders and the Phoenicians as Sidonia or Tyria. Phoenicians and Canaanites alike were called Sidonians or Tyrians, as one Phoenician city came to prominence after another.\\r\\nPersian King Cyrus the Great conquered Phoenicia in 539?BC. The Persians then divided Phoenicia into four vassal kingdoms: Sidon, Tyre, Arwad, and Byblos. They prospered, furnishing fleets for Persian kings. Phoenician influence declined after this. In 350 or 345?BC, a rebellion in Sidon led by Tennes was crushed by Artaxerxes III. Its destruction was described by Diodorus Siculus.\\r\\nAlexander the Great took Tyre in 332?BC after the Siege of Tyre. Alexander was exceptionally harsh to Tyre, executing 2,000 of the leading citizens, but he maintained the king in power. He gained control of the other cities peacefully: the ruler of Aradus submitted; the king of Sidon was overthrown. The rise of Macedon gradually ousted the remnants of Phoenicia's former dominance over the Eastern Mediterranean trade routes. Phoenician culture disappeared entirely in the motherland. Carthage continued to flourish in North Africa. It oversaw the mining of iron and precious metals from Iberia, and used its considerable naval power and mercenary armies to protect commercial interests. Rome finally destroyed it in 146?BC, at the end of the Punic Wars.\\r\\nFollowing Alexander, the Phoenician homeland was controlled by a succession of Macedonian rulers: Laomedon (323?BC), Ptolemy I (320), Antigonus II (315), Demetrius (301), and Seleucus (296). Between 286 and 197?BC, Phoenicia (except for Aradus) fell to the Ptolemies of Egypt, who installed the high priests of Astarte as vassal rulers in Sidon (Eshmunazar I, Tabnit, Eshmunazar II).\\r\\nIn 197?BC, Phoenicia along with Syria reverted to the Seleucids. The region became increasingly Hellenized, although Tyre became autonomous in 126?BC, followed by Sidon in 111. Syria, including Phoenicia, was seized and ruled by king Tigranes the Great of Armenia from 82 until 69?BC, when he was defeated by Lucullus. In 65?BC, Pompey finally incorporated the territory as part of the Roman province of Syria. Phoenicia became a separate province ca. 200 AD.\\r\\nA study by Pierre Zalloua and others (2008) claimed that six subclades of haplogroup J2 (J-M172) J2 in particular, were \\"a Phoenician signature\\" amongst modern male populations tested in \\"the coastal Lebanese Phoenician Heartland and the broader area of the rest of the Levant (the \\"Phoenician Periphery\\")\\", followed by \\"Cyprus and South Turkey; then Crete; then Malta and East Sicily; then South Sardinia, Ibiza, and Southern Spain; and, finally, Coastal Tunisia and cities like Tingris in Morocco\\". (Samples from other areas with significant Phoenician settlements, in Libya and southern France could not be included.) This deliberately sequential sampling represented an attempt to develop a methodology that could link the documented historical expansion of a population, with a particular geographic genetic pattern or patterns. The researchers suggested that the proposed genetic signature stemmed from \\"a common source of related lineages rooted in Lebanon\\".[36]\\r\\nNone of the geographical communities tested, Zalloua pointed out subsequently (2013), carried significantly higher levels of the proposed \\"Phoenician signature\\" than the others. This suggested that genetic variation preceded religious variation and divisions and, by the time it became Phoenicia, \\"Lebanon already had well-differentiated communities with their own genetic peculiarities, but not significant differences, and religions came as layers of paint on top.[37] Another study found evidence for genetic persistence on the island of Ibiza.[38]\\r\\nIn 2016, a sixth-century BC skeleton of a young Carthaginian man, excavated from a Punic tomb in Byrsa Hill, was found to belong to the rare U5b2c1 maternal haplogroup. The lineage of this \\"Young Man of Byrsa\\" is believed to represent early gene flow from Iberia to the Maghreb.[39]\\r\\nThe Phoenicians were among the greatest traders of their time and owed much of their prosperity to trade. At first, they traded mainly with the Greeks, trading wood, slaves, glass and powdered Tyrian purple. Tyrian purple was a violet-purple dye used by the Greek elite to color garments. In fact, the word Phoenician derives from the ancient Greek word phonios meaning \\"purple\\". As trading and colonizing spread over the Mediterranean, Phoenicians and Greeks seemed to have split that sea in two: the Phoenicians sailed along and eventually dominated the southern shore, while the Greeks were active along the northern shores. The two cultures rarely clashed, mainly in the Sicilian Wars, and eventually settled into two spheres of influence, the Phoenician in the west and the Greek to the east.\\r\\nIn the centuries after 1200?BC, the Phoenicians were the major naval and trading power of the region. Phoenician trade was founded on the Tyrian purple dye, a violet-purple dye derived from the hypobranchial gland of the Murex sea-snail, once profusely available in coastal waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea but exploited to local extinction. James B. Pritchard's excavations at Sarepta in present-day Lebanon revealed crushed Murex shells and pottery containers stained with the dye that was being produced at the site. The Phoenicians established a second production center for the dye in Mogador, in present-day Morocco. Brilliant textiles were a part of Phoenician wealth, and Phoenician glass was another export ware.\\r\\nTo Egypt, where grapevines would not grow, the 8th-century Phoenicians sold wine: the wine trade with Egypt is vividly documented by the shipwrecks located in 1997 in the open sea 50 kilometres (30?mi) west of Ascalon.[40] Pottery kilns at Tyre in South Lebanon and Sarepta produced the large terracotta jars used for transporting wine. From Egypt, the Phoenicians bought Nubian gold. Additionally, great cedar logs were traded with lumber-poor Egypt for significant sums. Sometime between 1075 and 1060 BC an Egyptian envoy by the name of Wen-Amon visited Phoenicia and secured seven great cedar logs in exchange for a mixed cargo including \\"4 crocks and 1 kak-men of gold; 5 silver jugs; 10 garments of royal linen; 10 kherd of good linen from Upper Egypt; 500 rolls of finished papyrus; 500 cows' hides; 500 ropes; 20 bags of lentils and 30 baskets of fish.\\" Those logs were then moved by ship from Phoenicia to Egypt.[41]\\r\\nFrom elsewhere, they obtained other materials, perhaps the most important being silver from (at least) Sardinia and the Iberian Peninsula. Tin was required which when smelted with copper from Cyprus created the durable metal alloy bronze. The archaeologist Glenn Markoe suggests that tin \\"may have been acquired from Galicia by way of the Atlantic coast or southern Spain; alternatively, it may have come from northern Europe (Cornwall or Brittany) via the Rhone valley and coastal Massalia\\".[42] Strabo states that there was a highly lucrative Phoenician trade with Britain for tin via the Cassiterides whose location is unknown but may have been off the northwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula.[43] Professor Timothy Champion, discussing Diodorus Siculus's comments on the tin trade, states that \\"Diodorus never actually says that the Phoenicians sailed to Cornwall. In fact, he says quite the opposite: the production of Cornish tin was in the hands of the natives of Cornwall, and its transport to the Mediterranean was organised by local merchants, by sea and then over land through France, well outside Phoenician control.\\"[44]\\r\\nTarshish (Hebrew: ????????????) occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings, and one of the most recurring is that Tarshish is a place, probably a city or country, that is far from the Land of Palestine by sea where trade occurs with Palestine and Phoenicia. It was a place where Phoenicians reportedly obtained different metals, particularly silver, during the reign of Solomon. The Septuagint, the Vulgate and the Targum of Jonathan render Tarshish as Carthage, but other biblical commentators read it as Tartessos perhaps in ancient Hispania (Iberian Peninsula). William F. Albright (1941) and Frank M. Cross (1972)[45][46] suggested Tarshish might be or was Sardinia because of the discovery of the Nora Stone and Nora Fragment, the former of which mentions Tarshish in its Phoenician inscription. Christine M. Thompson (2003)[47] identified a concentration of hacksilver hoards dating between c.?1200 and 586 BC in Palestine(Cisjordan). This silver-dominant Cisjordan Corpus is unparalleled in the contemporary Mediterranean, and within it occurs a unique concentration in Phoenicia of silver hoards dated between 1200 and 800 BC. Hacksilber objects in these Phoenician hoards have lead isotope ratios that match ores in Sardinia and Spain.[35] This metallic evidence agrees with the biblical memory of a western Mediterranean Tarshish that supplied Solomon with silver via Phoenicia. Assyrian records indicate Tarshish was an island, and the poetic construction of Psalm 72 points to its identity as a large island in the west  the island of Sardinia.[35]\\r\\nThe Phoenicians established commercial outposts throughout the Mediterranean, the most strategically important being Carthage in North Africa, southeast of Sardinia on the peninsula of present day Tunisia. Ancient Gaelic mythologies attribute a Phoenician/Scythian influx to Ireland by a leader called Fenius Farsa. Others also sailed south along the coast of Africa. A Carthaginian expedition led by Hanno the Navigator explored and colonized the Atlantic coast of Africa as far as the Gulf of Guinea; and according to Herodotus, a Phoenician expedition sent down the Red Sea by pharaoh Necho II of Egypt (c.?600?BC) even circumnavigated Africa and returned through the Pillars of Hercules after three years. Using gold obtained by expansion of the African coastal trade following the Hanno expedition, Carthage minted gold staters in 350?BC bearing a pattern, in the reverse exergue of the coins, which Mark McMenamin has controversially argued could be interpreted as a map. According to McMenamin, the Mediterranean is represented as a rectangle in the centre, a triangle to the right represents India in the east, and an irregular shape on the left represents America to the west.[48][49]\\r\\nIn the 2nd millennium BC, the Phoenicians traded with the Somalis. Through the Somali city-states of Mosylon, Opone, Malao, Sarapion, Mundus and Tabae, trade flourished.\\r\\nThe Greeks had two names for Phoenician ships: hippoi and galloi. Galloi means tubs and hippoi means horses. These names are readily explained by depictions of Phoenician ships in the palaces of Assyrian kings from the 7th and 8th centuries, as the ships in these images are tub shaped (galloi) and have horse heads on the ends of them (hippoi). It is possible that these hippoi come from Phoenician connections with the Greek god Poseidon equated with the Semitic God \\"Yam\\".\\r\\nThe Tel Balawat gates (850?BC) are found in the palace of Shalmaneser III, an Assyrian king, near Nimrud. They are made of bronze, and they portray ships coming to honor Shalmaneser.[50][51] The Khorsabad bas-relief (7th century BC) shows the transportation of timber (most likely cedar) from Lebanon. It is found in the palace built specifically for Sargon II, another Assyrian king, at Khorsabad, now northern Iraq.[52]\\r\\nFrom the 10th century BC, the Phoenicians' expansive culture led them to establish cities and colonies throughout the Mediterranean. Canaanite deities like Baal and Astarte were being worshipped from Cyprus to Sardinia, Malta, Sicily, Spain, Portugal, and most notably at Carthage (Qart Hada?t) in modern Tunisia.\\r\\nModern Algeria\\r\\nCyprus\\r\\nModern Italy\\r\\nModern Libya\\r\\nThe islands of Malta\\r\\nModern Mauritania\\r\\nModern Portugal\\r\\nModern Spain\\r\\nModern Tunisia\\r\\nModern Turkey\\r\\nModern Morocco\\r\\nOther colonies\\r\\nThe Phoenician alphabet was one of the first (consonantal) alphabets with a strict and consistent form. It is assumed that it adopted its simplified linear characters from an as-yet unattested early pictorial Semitic alphabet developed some centuries earlier in the southern Levant.[62][63] It is likely that the precursor to the Phoenician alphabet was of Egyptian origin, since Middle Bronze Age alphabets from the southern Levant resemble Egyptian hieroglyphs or an early alphabetic writing system found at Wadi-el-Hol in central Egypt.[64][65] In addition to being preceded by proto-Canaanite, the Phoenician alphabet was also preceded by an alphabetic script of Mesopotamian origin called Ugaritic. The development of the Phoenician alphabet from the Proto-Canaanite coincided with the rise of the Iron Age in the 11th century BC.[66]\\r\\nThis alphabet has been termed an abjad  that is, a script that contains no vowels  from the first four letters aleph, beth, gimel, and daleth.\\r\\nThe oldest known representation of the Phoenician alphabet is inscribed on the sarcophagus of King Ahiram of Byblos, dating to the 11th century BC at the latest. Phoenician inscriptions are found in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Cyprus and other locations, as late as the early centuries of the Christian Era. The Phoenicians are credited with spreading the Phoenician alphabet throughout the Mediterranean world.[67] Phoenician traders disseminated this writing system along Aegean trade routes, to Crete and Greece. The Greeks adopted the majority of these letters but changed some of them to vowels which were significant in their language, giving rise to the first true alphabet.\\r\\nThe Phoenician language is classified in the Canaanite subgroup of Northwest Semitic. Its later descendant in North Africa is termed Punic. In Phoenician colonies around the western Mediterranean, beginning in the 9th century BC, Phoenician evolved into Punic. Punic Phoenician was still spoken in the 5th century AD: St. Augustine, for example, grew up in North Africa and was familiar with the language.\\r\\nPhoenician art lacks unique characteristics that might distinguish it from its contemporaries. This is due to its being highly influenced by foreign artistic cultures: primarily Egypt, Greece and Assyria. Phoenicians who were taught on the banks of the Nile and the Euphrates gained a wide artistic experience and finally came to create their own art, which was an amalgam of foreign models and perspectives.[68] In an article from The New York Times published on January 5, 1879, Phoenician art was described by the following:\\r\\nHe entered into other men's labors and made most of his heritage. The Sphinx of Egypt became Asiatic, and its new form was transplanted to Nineveh on the one side and to Greece on the other. The rosettes and other patterns of the Babylonian cylinders were introduced into the handiwork of Phoenicia, and so passed on to the West, while the hero of the ancient Chaldean epic became first the Tyrian Melkarth, and then the Herakles of Hellas.\\r\\nThe religious practices and beliefs of Phoenicia were cognate generally to their neighbours in Canaan, which in turn shared characteristics common throughout the ancient Semitic world.[69][70][71] \\"Canaanite religion was more of a public institution than of an individual experience.\\" Its rites were primarily for city-state purposes; payment of taxes by citizens was considered in the category of religious sacrifices.[72] Unfortunately, much of the Phoenician sacred writings known to the ancients have been lost.[73][74]\\r\\nLike their Hebrew cousins the Phoenicians were known for being very religious. While there remain favourable aspects regarding Canaanite religion,[75][76][77] several of its reported practices have been widely criticized, in particular, temple prostitution,[78] and child sacrifice.[79] \\"Tophets\\" built \\"to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire\\" are condemned by God in Jeremiah 7:30-32, and in 2nd Kings 23:10 (also 17:17). Notwithstanding these and other important differences, cultural religious similarities between the ancient Hebrews and the Phoenicians persisted.[75][80]\\r\\nCanaanite religious mythology does not appear as elaborated compared with existent literature of their cousin Semites in Mesopotamia. In Canaan the supreme god was called El, which means \\"god\\" in common Semitic.[81][82] The storm god was Baal, meaning \\"master\\".[83] Other gods were called by royal titles, as in Melqart meaning \\"king of the city\\",[84] or Adonis for \\"lord\\".[85] On the other hand, the Phoenicians, notorious for being secretive in business, might use these non-descript words as cover for the secluded name of the god,[86] known only to a select few initiated into the inmost circle, or not even used by them, much as their neighbors the ancient Hebrews used the word Adonai (Heb: \\"Lord\\") to place a cover over the name of their God.[87]\\r\\nThe Semitic pantheon was well-populated; which god became primary evidently depended on the exigencies of a particular city-state or tribal locale.[88][89] Due perhaps to the leading role of the city-state of Tyre, its reigning god Melqart was prominent throughout Phoenicia and overseas. Also of great general interest was Astarte (Heb: Ashtoreth), (Bab: Ishtar), a fertility goddess who also enjoyed regal and matronly aspects. The prominent deity Eshmun of Sidon developed from a chthonic nature for agriculture into a god of health and healing. Associated with the fertility and harvest myth widespread in the region, in this regard Eshmun was linked with Astarte; other like pairings included Ishtar and Tammuz in Babylon, and Isis and Osiris in Egypt.[90]\\r\\nReligious institutions of great antiquity in Tyre, called marzeh (MRZH, \\"place of reunion\\"), did much to foster social bonding and \\"kin\\" loyalty.[91] These institutions held banquets for their membership on festival days. Various marzeh societies developed into elite fraternities, becoming very influential in the commercial trade and governance of Tyre. As now understood, each marzeh originated in the congeniality inspired and then nurtured by a series of ritual meals, shared together as trusted \\"kin\\", all held in honor of the deified ancestors.[92] Later, at the Punic city-state of Carthage, the \\"citizen body was divided into groups which met at times for common feasts.\\" Such festival groups may also have composed the voting cohort for selecting members of the city-state's Assembly.[93][94]\\r\\nReligion in Carthage was based on inherited Phoenician ways of devotion. In fact, until its fall embassies from Carthage would regularly make the journey to Tyre to worship Melqart, bringing material offerings.[95][96] Transplanted to distant Carthage, these Phoenician ways persisted, but naturally acquired distinctive traits: perhaps influenced by a spiritual and cultural evolution, or synthesizing Berber tribal practices, or transforming under the stress of political and economic forces encountered by the city-state. Over time the original Phoenician exemplar developed distinctly, becoming the Punic religion at Carthage.[97] \\"The Carthaginians were notorious in antiquity for the intensity of their religious beliefs.\\"[98] \\"Besides their reputation as merchants, the Carthaginians were known in the ancient world for their superstition and intense religiosity. They imagined themselves living in a world inhabited by supernatural powers which were mostly malevolent. For protection they carried amulets of various origins and had them buried with them when they died.\\"[99]\\r\\nAt Carthage as at Tyre religion was integral to the city's life. A committee of ten elders selected by the civil authorities regulated worship and built the temples with public funds. Some priesthoods were hereditary to certain families. Punic inscriptions list a hierarchy of cohen (priest) and rab cohenim (lord priests). Each temple was under the supervision of its chief priest or priestess. To enter the Temple of Eshmun one had to abstain from sexual intercourse for three days, and from eating beans and pork.[100] Private citizens also nurtured their own destiny, as evidenced by the common use of theophoric personal names, e.g., Hasdrubal, \\"he who has Baal's help\\" and Hamilcar [Abdelmelqart], \\"pledged to the service of Melqart\\".[101]\\r\\nThe city's legendary founder, Elissa or Dido, was the widow of Acharbas the high priest of Tyre in service to its principal deity Melqart.[102] Dido was also attached to the fertility goddess Astarte. With her Dido brought not only ritual implements for the worship of Astarte, but also her priests and sacred prostitutes (taken from Cyprus).[103] The agricultural turned healing god Eshmun was worshipped at Carthage, as were other deities. Melqart became supplanted at the Punic city-state by the emergent god Baal Hammon, which perhaps means \\"lord of the altars of incense\\" (thought to be an epithet to cloak the god's real name).[97][104] Later, another newly arisen deity arose to eventually reign supreme at Carthage, a goddess of agriculture and generation who manifested a regal majesty, Tanit.[105]\\r\\nThe name Baal Hammon (BL HMN) has attracted scholarly interest. The more accepted etymology is to \\"heat\\" (Sem: HMN). Modern scholars at first associated Baal Hammon with the Egyptian god Ammon of Thebes, both the Punic and the Egyptian being gods of the sun. Both also had the ram as a symbol. The Egyptian Ammon was known to have spread by trade routes to Libyans in the vicinity of modern Tunisia, well before arrival of the Phoenicians. Yet Baal Hammon's derivation from Ammon no longer may considered the most likely, as Baal Hammon has since been traced also to Syrio-Phoenician origins, confirmed by recent finds at Tyre.[106] Baal Hammon is also presented as a god of agriculture: \\"Baal Hammon's power over the land and its fertility rendered him of great appeal to the inhabitants of Tunisia, a land of fertile wheat- and fruit-bearing plains.\\"[107][108]\\r\\n\\"In Semitic religion El, the father of the gods, had gradually been shorn of his power by his sons and relegated to a remote part of his heavenly home; in Carthage, on the other hand, he became, once more, the head of the pantheon, under the enigmatic title of Ba'al Hammon.\\"\\r\\nPrayers of individual Carthaginians were often addressed to Baal Hammon. Yet this deity was recipient of the very troubling practice of child sacrifice.[109][110][111] Diodorus (late 1st century BC) wrote that when Agathocles had attacked Carthage (in 310) several hundred children of leading families were sacrificed to regain the god's favour.[112] Modernly, the French novelist Gustave Flaubert's 1862 work Salammb? graphically featured this god as accepting such sacrifice.[113]\\r\\nThe goddess Tanit during the 5th and 4th centuries became queen goddess, supreme over the city-state of Carthage, thus outshining the former chief god and her associate, Baal Hammon.[115][116] Tanit was represented by \\"palm trees weighed down with dates, ripe pomegranates ready to burst, lotus or lilies coming into flower, fish, doves, frogs... .\\" She gave to mankind a flow of vital energies.[117][118] Tanit may be Berbero-Libyan in origin, or at least assimilated to a local deity.[119][120]\\r\\nAnother view, supported by recent finds, holds that Tanit originated in Phoenicia, being closely linked there to the goddess Astarte.[121][122] Tanit and Astarte: each one was both a funerary and a fertility goddess. Each was a sea goddess. As Tanit was associated with Ba'al Hammon the principal god in Punic Carthage, so Astarte was with El in Phoenicia. Yet Tanit was clearly distinguished from Astarte. Astarte's heavenly emblem was the planet Venus, Tanit's the crescent moon. Tanit was portrayed as chaste; at Carthage religious prostitution was apparently not practiced.[123][124] Yet temple prostitution played an important role in Astarte's cult at Phoenicia. Also, the Greeks and Romans did not compare Tanit to the Greek Aphrodite nor to the Roman Venus as they would Astarte. Rather the comparison of Tanit would be to Hera and to Juno, regal goddesses of marriage, or to the goddess Artemis of child-birth and the hunt.[125] Tertullian (c. 160 ÿ c.220), the Christian theologian and native of Carthage, wrote comparing Tanit to Ceres, the Roman mother goddess of agriculture.[126]\\r\\nTanit has also been identified with three different Canaanite goddesses (all being sisters/wives of El): the above 'Astarte; the virgin war goddess 'Anat; and the mother goddess 'Elat or Asherah.[127][128][129] Her being a goddess, or symbolizing a psychic archetype, accordingly it is difficult to assign a single nature to Tanit, or to clearly represent her to consciousness.[130]\\r\\nA problematic theory derived from sociology of religion proposes that as Carthage passed from being a Phoenician trading station into a wealthy and sovereign city-state, and from a monarchy anchored to Tyre into a native-born Libyphoenician oligarchy, Carthaginians began to turn away from deities associated with Phoenicia, and slowly to discover or synthesize a Punic deity, the goddess Tanit.[131] A parallel theory posits that when Carthage acquired as a source of wealth substantial agricultural lands in Africa, a local fertility goddess, Tanit, developed or evolved to eventually become supreme.[99] A basis for such theories may well be the religious reform movement that emerged and prevailed at Carthage during the years 397-360. The catalyst for such dramatic change in Punic religious practice was their recent defeat in war when led by their king Himilco (d. 396) against the Greeks of Sicily.[132]\\r\\nSuch transformation of religion would have been instigated by a faction of wealthy land owners at Carthage, including these reforms: overthrow of the monarchy; elevation of Tanit as queen goddess and decline of Baal Hammon; allowance of foreign cults of Greek origin into the city (Demeter and Kore); decline in child sacrifice, with most votive victims changed to small animals, and with the sacrifice not directed for state purposes but, when infrequently done, performed to solicit the deity for private, family favors. This bold historical interpretation understands the reformer's motivation as \\"the reaction of a wealthy and cultured upper class against the primitive and antiquated aspects of the Canaanite religion, and also a political move intended to break the power of a monarchy which ruled by divine authority.\\" The reform's popularity was precarious at first. Later, when the city was in danger of immanent attack in 310, there would be a marked regression to child sacrifice. Yet eventually the cosmopolitan religious reform and the popular worship of Tanit together contributed to \\"breaking through the wall of isolation which had surrounded Carthage.\\"[133][134][135]\\r\\n\\"When the Romans conquered Africa, Carthaginian religion was deeply entrenched even in Libyan areas, and it retained a great deal of its character under different forms.\\" Tanit became Juno Caelestis, \\"and Caelestis was supreme at Carthage itself until the triumph of Christianity, just as Tanit had been in pre-Roman times.\\" [119] Regarding Berber (Libyan) religious beliefs, it has also been said:\\r\\n\\"[Berber] belief in the powers of the spirits of the ancestors was not eclipsed by the introduction of new gods--Hammon, or Tanit--but existed in parallel with them. It is this same duality, or readiness to adopt new cultural forms while retaining the old on a more intimate level, which characterizes the [Roman era].\\"[136]\\r\\nSuch Berber ambivalence, the ability to entertain multiple mysteries concurrently, apparently characterized their religion during the Punic era also. After the passing of Punic power, the great Berber king Masinissa (r. 202ÿ148), who long fought and challenged Carthage, was widely venerated by later generations of Berbers as divine.[137]\\r\\nPhoenician culture had a huge effect upon the cultures of the Mediterranean basin in the early Iron Age, and had been affected by them in turn. For example, in Phoenicia, the tripartite division between Baal, Mot and Yam seems to have influenced the Greek division between Zeus, Hades and Poseidon.[138] The Tartessos region probably embraced the whole southern part of the Iberian Peninsula.[139] Strab. 3.2.11). In various Mediterranean ports during the classical period, Phoenician temples sacred to Melkart were recognized as sacred to Greek Hercules. Stories like the Rape of Europa, and the coming of Cadmus also draw upon Phoenician influence.\\r\\nThe recovery of the Mediterranean economy after the late Bronze Age collapse (c.?1200 BC) seems to have been largely due to the work of Phoenician traders and merchant princes, who re-established long distance trade between Egypt and Mesopotamia in the 10th century BC.\\r\\nThere are many countries and cities around the Mediterranean region that derive their names from the Phoenician Language. Below is a list with the respective meanings:\\r\\nTowards the end of the Bronze Age (around 1200?BC) there was trade between the Canaanites (early Phoenicians), Egypt, Cyprus, and Greece. In a shipwreck found off of the coast of Turkey (the Ulu Bulurun wreck), Canaanite storage pottery along with pottery from Cyprus and Greece was found. The Phoenicians were famous metalworkers, and by the end of the 8th century BC, Greek city-states were sending out envoys to the Levant (the eastern Mediterranean) for metal goods.[140]\\r\\nThe height of Phoenician trade was circa the 7th and 8th centuries BC. There is a dispersal of imports (ceramic, stone, and faience) from the Levant that traces a Phoenician commercial channel to the Greek mainland via the central Aegean.[140] Athens shows little evidence of this trade with few eastern imports, but other Greek coastal cities are rich with eastern imports that evidence this trade.[141]\\r\\nAl Mina is a specific example of the trade that took place between the Greeks and the Phoenicians.[142] It has been theorized that by the 8th century BC, Euboean traders established a commercial enterprise with the Levantine coast and were using Al Mina (in Syria) as a base for this enterprise. There is still some question about the veracity of these claims concerning Al Mina.[141] The Phoenicians even got their name from the Greeks due to their trade. Their most famous trading product was purple dye, the Greek word for which is phoenos.[143]\\r\\nThe Phoenician phonetic alphabet was adopted and modified by the Greeks probably in the 8th century BC (around the time of the hippoi depictions). This most likely did not come from a single instance but from a culmination of commercial exchange.[143] This means that before the 8th century, there was a relationship between the Greeks and the Phoenicians. Though there is no evidence to support the suggestion, it is probable that during this period there was also a passing of religious ideas.[citation needed] The legendary Phoenician hero Cadmus is credited with bringing the alphabet to Greece, but it is more plausible that it was brought by Phoenician emigrants to Crete,[144] whence it gradually diffused northwards.\\r\\nIn both Phoenician and Greek mythologies, Cadmus is a Phoenician prince, the son of Agenor, the king of Tyre in South Lebanon. Herodotus credits Cadmus for bringing the Phoenician alphabet to Greece[145] approximately sixteen hundred years before Herodotus' time, or around 2000 BC,[146] as he attested:\\r\\nThese Phoenicians who came with Cadmus and of whom the Gephyraeans were a part brought with them to Hellas, among many other kinds of learning, the alphabet, which had been unknown before this, I think, to the Greeks. As time went on the sound and the form of the letters were changed.\\r\\nDue to the number of deities similar to the \\"Lord of the Sea\\" in classical mythology, there have been many difficulties attributing one specific name to the sea deity or the \\"PoseidonÿNeptune\\" figure of Phoenician religion. This figure of \\"Poseidon-Neptune\\" is mentioned by authors and in various inscriptions as being very important to merchants and sailors,[147] but a singular name has yet to be found. There are, however, names for sea gods from individual city-states. Yamm is the god of the sea of Ugarit, an ancient city-state north to Phoenicia. Yamm and Baal, the storm god of Ugaritic myth and often associated with Zeus, have an epic battle for power over the universe. While Yamm is the god of the sea, he truly represents vast chaos.[148] Baal, on the other hand, is a representative for order. In Ugaritic myth, Baal overcomes Yamm's power. In some versions of this myth, Baal kills Yamm with a mace fashioned for him, and in others, the goddess Athtart saves Yamm and says that since defeated, he should stay in his own province. Yamm is the brother of the god of death, Mot.[149] Some scholars have identified Yamm with Poseidon, although he has also been identified with Pontus.[150]\\r\\nIn his Republic, Greek philosopher Plato contends that the love of money is a tendency of the soul found amongst Phoenicians and Egyptians, which distinguishes them from the Greeks who tend towards the love of knowledge.[151] In his Laws, he asserts that this love of money has led the Phoenicians and Egyptians to develop skills in cunning and trickery (ϫ?ϫ) rather than wisdom (?ϫ).[152]\\r\\nIn his Histories, Herodotus gives the Persian and Greek accounts of a series of kidnappings that led to the Trojan War. While docked at a trading port in Argos, the Phoenicians kidnapped a group of Greek women including King Idacus's daughter, Io. The Greeks then retaliated by kidnapping Europa, a Phoenician, and later Medea. The Greeks refused to compensate the Phoenicians for the additional abduction, a fact which Paris used a generation later to justify the abduction of Helen from Argos. The Greeks then retaliated by waging war against Troy. After Troy's fall the Persians considered the Greeks to be their enemy.[153]\\r\\nHiram (also spelled Huran), the king of Tyre, is associated with the building of Solomon's temple.\\r\\n1 Kings 5:1 says: \\"Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.\\" 2 Chronicles 2:14 says: \\"The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father [was] a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, silver, brass, iron, stone, timber, royal purple (from the Murex), blue, and in crimson, and fine linens; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him?...\\"\\r\\nThis is the architect of the Temple, Hiram Abiff of Masonic lore.\\r\\nLater, reforming prophets railed against the practice of drawing royal wives from among foreigners: Elijah execrated Jezebel, the princess from Tyre in South Lebanon who became a consort of King Ahab and introduced the worship of her god Baal.\\r\\nLong after Phoenician culture flourished, or Phoenicia existed as a political entity, Hellenized natives of the region where Canaanites still lived were referred to as \\"Syro-Phoenicians\\", as in the Gospel of Mark 7:26: \\"The woman was a Greek, a Syro-phoenician by birth\\".\\r\\nThe word Bible itself derives from Greek biblion, which means \\"book\\" and either derives from, or is the (perhaps ultimately Egyptian) origin of Byblos, the Greek name of the Phoenician city Gebal.[154]\\r\\nThe legacy of the Phoenicians are many and varied and include:\\r\\n\\"Thus the winged figure of Tanith, the Carthaginian goddess of heaven, standing beneath the vault of heaven and the zodiac, holds the sun and moon in her hands, and is [flanked] by pillars, the symbols of the Great Mother Goddess. But on the lower plane of the stele, we find the same goddess stylized with upraised arms, possibly as a tree assimilated to the Egyptian life symbol. Her head is the sun, an illusion to the tree birth of the sun, and she is accompanied by two doves, the typical bird of the Great Goddess.\\" The \\"Egyptian life symbol\\" refers to the ankh.\\r\\n\\"It seems probable, therefore, that Tanith was a pre-Phoenician goddess of fertility of the Hamites, ...that she was so popular that after the coming of the Phoenicians they too worshipped her to such a degree that she largely displaced their native goddess Astart.\\"Barton (1934), p.?305\\r\\n\\"In Ugaritic mythology, Anath is by far the most important female figure, the goddess of love and war, virginal yet wanton, amorous yet given to uncontrollable outbursts of rage and appalling acts of cruelty. She is the daughter of El, the god of heaven, and of his wife the Lady Asherah of the Sea. ... Her foremost lover was her brother Baal. ... She was easily provoked to violence and, once she began to fight, would go berserk, smiting and killing left and right.\\" (60-2), who adds that the Phoenician Philo of Byblos (64ÿ141) compared Anath to the Greek virgin war goddess Athena. Also, Patai at 63-6 identifies Anath with the biblical \\"Queen of Heaven\\". At 61 Patai, referring to Anath in her r?le as goddess of love, mentions the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, and remarks that both Astarte and Anath as \\"typical goddesses of love, both chaste and promiscuous... [were] perennially fruitful without ever losing their virginity.\\"\\r\\n\\"Asherah was the chief goddess of the Canaanite pantheon... at Ugarit... . ...Asherah figured prominently as the wife of El the chief god. Her full name was 'Lady Asherah of the Sea'--apparently her domain proper was the sea, just as that of her husband El was heaven. She was, however, also referred to simply as Elath or Goddess. She was the 'Progenitress of the Gods': all other gods... were her children... . Asherah was a motherly goddess... .\\" Patai (1990), pp.?36-7. In his chapter \\"The Goddess Asherah\\" (34-53), Patai discusses widespread Hebrew worship of Asherah until the 6th century B.C.E. Patai (52ÿ3) notes ancient inscriptions (one found near Hebron) evidencing an early Jewish association of Asherah with Yahweh, a view repugnant to later orthodox Judaism.\\r\\nIt is an \\"illusion that an archetype can be finally explained and disposed of. Even the best attempts at explanation are only more or less successful translations into another metaphorical language. ... The most we can do is dream the myth onwards and give it a modern dress. And whatever [our] explanation or interpretation does to it, we do to our souls as well, with corresponding results for our own well being. ... Hence the \\"explanation\\" should always be such that the functional significance of the archetype remains unimpaired, so that an adequate and meaningful connection between the conscious mind and the archetype is assured. ... It represents or personifies certain instinctive data of the dark, primitive psyche, the real but invisible roots of consciousness.\\" ... \\"The archetype... is a psychic organ present in all of us. ... There is no 'rational' substitute for the archetype any more than there is for the cerebellum or the kidneys.\\"","input":"What phoenician invention became the most influential in the western world?"},{"output":"Lake George, New York","context":"Howard Johnson's, or Howard Johnson by Wyndham[4], is an American chain of hotels, motels, and restaurants, located primarily throughout the United States and Canada. Founded by Howard Deering Johnson, it was the largest restaurant chain in the U.S. throughout the 1960s and 1970s, with more than 1,000 combined company-owned and franchised outlets.\\r\\nHoward Johnson hotels and motels are now part of Wyndham Worldwide. Howard Johnson's restaurants were franchised separately from the hotel brand beginning in 1986. The food and beverage rights to the restaurant are currently owned by Wyndham Worldwide. Just one Howard Johnson restaurant remains: in Lake George, New York.[5] The line of branded supermarket frozen foods, including ice cream, is no longer manufactured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1925, Howard Deering Johnson borrowed $2,000 to buy and operate a small corner pharmacy in Wollaston, a neighborhood in Quincy, Massachusetts. Johnson was surprised to find it easy to pay back the money lent to him, after discovering his recently installed soda fountain had become the busiest part of his drugstore. Eager to ensure that his store would remain successful, Johnson decided to come up with a new ice cream recipe. Some sources say the recipe was based on his mother's homemade ice creams and desserts,[6][7] while others say that it was from a local German immigrant,[8] who either sold or gave Johnson the ice cream recipe. Regardless, the new recipe made the ice cream more flavorful due to an increased content of butterfat. Eventually Johnson came up with 28 flavors of ice cream. Johnson is quoted as saying, \\"I thought I had every flavor in the world. That '28' (flavors of ice cream) became my trademark.\\"[9]\\r\\nThroughout the summers of the late 1920s, Johnson opened up concession stands on beachfront property along the coast of Massachusetts. The stands sold soft drinks, hot dogs, and ice cream. Each stand proved to be successful. With his success becoming more noticeable every year, Johnson convinced local bankers to lend him enough money to operate a sit-down restaurant. Negotiations were made and, toward the end of the decade, the first Howard Johnson's restaurant opened in Quincy. The first Howard Johnson's restaurant featured fried clams, baked beans, chicken pot pies, frankfurters, ice cream, and soft drinks.\\r\\nThe first Howard Johnson's restaurant and Howard Johnson's company received an incredible break in 1929, owing to an unusual set of circumstances: The mayor of nearby Boston, Malcolm Nichols, banned the planned production of Eugene O'Neill's play, Strange Interlude, in the city of Boston. Rather than fight the mayor, the Theatre Guild moved the production to Quincy. The five-hour play was presented in two parts with a dinner break. The first Howard Johnson's restaurant was near the theater; hundreds of influential Bostonians flocked to the restaurant. Through word of mouth, more Americans became familiar with the Howard Johnson's company.[10]\\r\\nJohnson wanted to expand his company, but the stock market crash of 1929 prevented him from doing so. After waiting a few years and maintaining his business, Johnson was able to persuade an acquaintance in 1932 to open a second Howard Johnson's restaurant in Orleans, Massachusetts. The second restaurant was franchised and not company-owned. This was one of America's first franchising agreements.\\r\\nBy the end of 1936, there were 39 more franchised restaurants, creating a total of 41 Howard Johnson's restaurants. By 1939, there were 107 Howard Johnson's restaurants along various American East Coast highways, generating revenues of $10.5 million. In less than 14 years, Johnson directed a franchise network of over 10,000 employees with 170 restaurants, many serving 1.5 million people a year.\\r\\nThe unique icons of orange roofs, cupolas, and weather vanes on Howard Johnson properties helped patrons identify the chain's restaurants and motels. The restaurant's trademark Simple Simon and the Pieman logo was created by artist John Alcott in the 1930s.[7]\\r\\nThere were 200 Howard Johnson's restaurants when America entered World War II.\\r\\nBy 1944, only 12 Howard Johnson's restaurants remained in business. The effects of war rationing had crippled the company. Johnson managed to maintain his business by serving commissary food to war workers and U.S. Army recruits. When the Pennsylvania Turnpike (1940), and later the Ohio Turnpike, New Jersey Turnpike and Connecticut Turnpike were built, Johnson bid for and won exclusive rights to serve drivers at service station turnoffs through the turnpike systems. [11]\\r\\nIn the process of recovering from these losses, in 1947 the Howard Johnson's company began construction of 200 new restaurants throughout the American Southeast and Midwest. By 1951, the sales of the Howard Johnson's company totaled $115 million.\\r\\nBy 1954, there were 400 Howard Johnson's restaurants in 32 states, about 10% of which were extremely profitable company-owned turnpike restaurants; the rest were franchises. This was one of the first nationwide restaurant chains.\\r\\nWhile many places sold \\"fried clams\\", they were whole, which was not universally accepted by the American dining public. Howard Johnson popularized Soffron Brothers Clam Company's fried clam strips: the \\"foot\\" of hard-shelled sea clams. They became popular to eat in this fashion throughout the country.[12][13]\\r\\nIn 1954, the company opened the first Howard Johnson's motor lodge in Savannah, Georgia. The company employed architects Rufus Nims and Karl Koch to oversee the design of the rooms and gate lodge. Nims had previously worked with the company, designing restaurants. The restaurant's trademark Simple Simon and the Pieman was now joined by a lamplighter character in the firm's marketing of its motels. According to cultural historians, the chain became synonymous with travel among American motorists and vacationers in part because of Johnson's ubiquitous outdoor advertising displays.[14]\\r\\nIn 1959, Howard Deering Johnson, who had founded and managed the company since 1925, turned control over to his son, then 26-year-old Howard Brennan Johnson. The elder Johnson observed his son's running of the company until his death in 1972 at the age of 75.\\r\\nHoward Johnson's Company went public in 1961; there were 605 restaurants, 265 company-owned and 340 franchised, as well as 88 franchised Howard Johnson's motor lodges in 32 states and the Bahamas.\\r\\nIn 1961, Johnson hired New York chefs Pierre Franey and Jacques Ppin to oversee food development at the company's main commissary in Brockton, Massachusetts. Franey and Ppin developed recipes for the company's signature dishes that could be flash frozen and delivered across the country, guaranteeing a consistent product.\\r\\nWhile the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision by the United States Supreme Court in 1954 struck down segregation in public schools, segregation and maintenance of whites-only public facilities continued in other domains, including the Howard Johnson chain. Segregation in Howard Johnson's restaurants even provoked an international crisis in 1957, when a Howard Johnson eatery in Dover, Delaware refused service to Komla Agbeli Gbedemah, the finance minister of Ghana, prompting a public apology from President Dwight D. Eisenhower.[15] The Congress of Racial Equality, or CORE, was instrumental in organizing protests and sit-ins at Howard Johnson locations in multiple states.[16]\\r\\nThe city of Durham, North Carolina, became especially notable as a focus for action against segregated restaurants and hotels, including Howard Johnson's. On 12 August 1962, attorney and civil rights activist Floyd McKissick initiated the first of multiple rallies and demonstrations against segregated establishments in Durham, including the Howard Johnson's restaurant on Chapel Hill Boulevard,[17] culminating in multiple protests on 18ÿ20 May 1963 resulting in mass arrests as well as an eventual rapprochement with the city government. Future senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, while a student at the University of Chicago in 1962, helped organize a picket of a Howard Johnson's location in Cicero, Illinois, during his time as a student activist for CORE.[18]\\r\\nIn the 1930s, H.D. Johnson bought the Wayland Red Coach Grill and subsequently used it as the model for a new concept, a more upscale steakhouse restaurant chain called Red Coach Grills. [19] While they maintained some success, they were not profitable enough and eventually the last 15 Red Coach Grills were sold in 1983 to a company executive who closed them. [20] In 1969, Johnson once again tried a new restaurant concept, Ground Round. It proved to be successful. Though it was not a Howard Johnson's restaurant, the Ground Round chain of restaurants were company-owned and -franchised, thus increasing the Howard Johnson's company profit.\\r\\nBy 1975, the Howard Johnson's company had more than 1,000 restaurants and more than 500 motor lodges in 42 states and Canada. The company reached its peak that year, but the late 1970s would mark the beginning of the end for the Howard Johnson's company. Because of the oil embargo of 1974, the Howard Johnson's restaurants and motor lodges, which maintained 85% of revenues from travelers, lost profit when Americans couldn't afford to drive long trips or take frequent vacations. Also, the company model of serving pre-made food with high quality ingredients in traditional dining rooms was costly when compared to the innovations introduced by fast food outlets like McDonald's, which designed its products and restaurants to appeal to families with younger children.\\r\\nThe company also suffered from two infamous incidents at a property in the New Orleans Central Business District within 18 months of one another. The first was a July 1971 fire, set by two irate guests who had been kicked out of the hotel, which killed six people.[21] The second, in January 1973, was a harrowing day-long siege. Former Black Panther Mark Essex used the hotel's roof as a sniper's perch, killing three police officers, the hotel's general manager and assistant general manager, and a couple from Virginia, who were on a belated honeymoon. He also wounded policemen, firemen and civilians. Then, in Jericho, New York, on November 8, 1974, singer-actress Connie Francis was raped at the Jericho Turnpike Howard Johnson's Lodge. She sued the motel chain for their lapse in security and won a judgment of $2.5 million, one of the largest such judgments in history at that time, leading to a reform in hotel security. Her rapist was never found.\\r\\nH. B. Johnson attempted to streamline company operations and cut costs, such as serving cheaper food and having fewer employees. This strategy was unsuccessful, because patrons compared this new era of Howard Johnson's restaurants and motor lodges unfavorably to the services they had previously come to know. In a further effort to make the company more successful and profitable, Johnson created other concepts, such as HoJos Campgrounds and 3 Penny Inns for lodging, as well as Deli Baker Ice Cream Maker, and Chatt's for restaurants. All of these concepts failed, furthering the company's demise.\\r\\nIn the late 1990s, the Howard Johnson's Candy Factory and Executive Offices in Wollaston were purchased and renovated by the Eastern Nazarene College to form the Adams Executive Center.[22]\\r\\nIn 1979, Johnson accepted an acquisition bid of more than $630 million from Imperial Group PLC of London, England. Imperial obtained 1,040 restaurants (75% company owned/25% franchised) and 520 motor lodges (75% franchised/25% company owned). In 1981 Imperial recruited G. Michael Hostage, then CEO of Continental Baking Company and formerly executive vice president of Marriott Corporation, to replace Johnson as CEO. After four years, however, and despite evident progress in a turnaround, Imperial reversed course and decided to sell the company instead. Having declined to entertain Hostage's proposal to lead a leveraged buyout, Imperial employed Goldman Sachs who, with Hostage's assistance, sold the company to Marriott in 1986. In a contemporaneous transaction, Marriott sold the motor lodge business and the Howard Johnson trademark to Prime Motor Inns, a New Jersey company.\\r\\nMarriott was interested in the company-owned restaurants not as a going concern, but for its real estate. Marriott already owned Big Boy Restaurants and Roy Rogers Restaurants; in 1982, it acquired Host International, which was had operated a number of highway rest stops. Many of the established Howard Johnson sites were in prime highway locations which could be profitably converted to Big Boy or various fast food banners. As Marriott quickly demolished the company owned restaurants or converted them to the Bob's Big Boy restaurant chain,[23][24] the number of Howard Johnson's restaurants remaining circa 1985 was sharply reduced; only the franchised restaurants remained untouched.\\r\\nMarriott left all company-owned and franchised motor lodges untouched as the deal called for them to be sold a year later (in 1986) to Prime Motors Inns, an existing franchisee with 63 motels.[23]\\r\\nPrime Motors Inns continued to preserve the lodges, just as Marriott had, until weak hotel and real estate markets caused it to sell off its assets and cease operations in 1990.[25] Those involved with the company owned and franchised motor lodges banded together and formed the Howard Johnson Acquisition Corporation. They successfully obtained all the rights to operate and maintain the company owned and franchised lodges. With these rights maintained, they changed their name to \\"Howard Johnson International Incorporated,\\" which became a subsidiary of \\"Hospitality Franchise Systems Incorporated,\\" which eventually merged with other companies to form Cendant. In 2006, Cendant split itself into Wyndham Worldwide and three other companies.\\r\\nWyndham operated the Howard Johnson brand under many \\"tiers\\" based on price, level of amenities, and services offered. Under Cendant/Wyndham, the chain became a parking place for franchise conversions, which were existing independent motels which had been renovated and added to the chain in order to provide them with access to a nationally recognised name and central reservation infrastructure. As these properties were not originally constructed as Howard Johnson sites, they lacked the distinctive architecture and some had no restaurant at all.\\r\\nHoward Johnson Express Inns, Howard Johnson Inns, Howard Johnson Hotels, and Howard Johnson Plaza Hotels range from limited-service motels to full-service properties with on-site concierges and business centers. Howard Johnson began offering a \\"Rise 'N' Dine\\" continental breakfast at some economy limited service locations.[27] The chain plans to abolish the multiple price tiers by 2015.\\r\\nWhile the Howard Johnson's company-owned and franchised motor lodges have stood the test of time since being sold by the Howard Johnson's Company in 1979, the restaurants have not. Because Marriott eliminated all the company-owned restaurants, the owners of the franchised restaurants feared elimination and banded together in 1986 and created \\"Franchise Associates Incorporated\\" or (FAI). In 1986, Marriott gave FAI the rights to operate and maintain Howard Johnson's restaurants. When Cendant acquired the Howard Johnson's motor lodges, they offered to work together with FAI to ensure the expansion of the restaurant chain.\\r\\nAs early as 1987, FAI chairman George Carter acknowledged that \\"We have the concept, but it desperately needs to be modernized, internally and externally. Howard Johnson was allowed to become tired and stale. We must get rid of that plastic image... Anything can be salvageable if a great deal of time and money and effort is put in it. And Howard Johnson needs all those same things.\\"[28] Attempts were made to revamp 25% of the menu and create new signage, but these efforts proved insufficient as the long-neglected chain continued to lose ground to mass-market fast food operations.\\r\\nWhile the Howard Johnson's restaurant chain was preserved, FAI did not have enough money to expand to new locations or revamp the brand. With the exception of one Howard Johnson's ice cream parlor in Puerto Rico, FAI never opened a new restaurant or expanded the chain. An existing restaurant in Canton, Massachusetts was remodeled as a prototype for a new era of Howard Johnson's restaurants, but the concept failed, and after less than a decade of operation, the prototype restaurant closed in 2000.\\r\\nBy 2005, there were fewer than eight surviving restaurants. A combination of no vision, no reinvestment of capital, aging restaurants, a stale menu, lack of marketing or new ideas, and competition from other chains had taken their toll; restaurants were closing their doors.[29] FAI ceased operations in 2005, the same year that the Springfield, Vermont, location and the last New York City restaurant in the chain closed.\\r\\nCendant acquired the rights to operate and maintain the remaining Howard Johnson's restaurants. In 2006, Cendant sold them to La Mancha Group LLC,[30] which had proposed an aggressive expansion of the restaurant chain that never materialised. After the Waterbury, Connecticut restaurant became The Brass House Restaurant in April 2007,[31] only three locations remained. Cendant split into four smaller companies in 2006; its hotel group became Wyndham Worldwide while other pieces were spun off separately to become Avis Budget Group, Realogy, Travelport and Affinion Group.\\r\\nA line of Howard Johnson-branded frozen foods disappeared from grocery stores after Fairfield Farms Kitchens shut down its Brockton, Massachusetts plant in 2006[32] and America's Kitchen of Atlanta, Georgia shut down in May 2008.\\r\\nIn spring 2012, one of the last three original Howard Johnson's restaurants closed, in Lake George, and was listed for sale.[33] Television personality, chef and author Rachael Ray once worked at that site while living in Lake George as a teenager.[34] By 2013 only two original restaurants remained open, but the Bangor (hotel and restaurant) no longer had the distinctive orange roof. While the highest tier in the hotel franchise (HoJo Hotel Plaza) does include a restaurant, there is no requirement that these replicate menus, format or branding of the former Howard Johnson restaurant chain.[35]\\r\\nWith La Mancha Group LLC no longer active, Wyndham Hotel Group now owned the rights to the HoJo's food business as well as the Howard Johnson hotel chain.[36] In 2013, Wyndham proposed a Howard Johnson Brand Reinvigoration which would bring select flavors of ice cream back to the hotels, adopt a new logo, phase out the multiple branding tiers and give the properties a facelift and redesign as a lower-midscale chain starting in 2015.[37]\\r\\nIn August 2014, the Lake George restaurant regained the Howard Johnson's name when the lease was transferred from its original owners, DeSantis Enterprises, to John Larock.[38] The restaurant reopened January 10, 2015, briefly bringing the number of locations back up to three. On March 31, 2015, the Lake Placid, N.Y., Howard Johnson's closed, leaving only two locations remaining. Then in September 2016, the Bangor restaurant closed, leaving the Lake George restaurant the very last location remaining out of the original 1,000-plus.[39][40][41]\\r\\nThe Lake George Howard Johnson's restaurant sign proclaims: \\"Last One Standing\\", however in January 2017 its parcel of land went up for sale, questioning its future.[42][43]More so when on October 12, 2017, the restaurant closed for a prolonged period after its owner was arrested, charged and jailed for sexual abuse of several of his female employees.[44][45] In early 2018 the restaurant reopened, however with no posted operating hours and on a very sporadic schedule, leaving some assuming it's closed.\\r\\nThe film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) was \\"one of the very first to carry 'product placements' for companies\\" such as Howard Johnson's, whose logos appear aboard the space station.[46] The chain's lamplighter was also updated to the \\"Earthlight Room\\" on the space station, a Howard Johnson's lounge for passengers taking the moon shuttle. In the scene where the Russian scientists share a drink with Dr. Floyd, it is shown that the restaurant chain servicing the space station is Howard Johnson's.[47] The chain featured a 2001 tie-in in its children's menu.[48]\\r\\nA substantial portion of the Mad Men season 5 episode, \\"Far Away Places\\", involves Don and Megan Draper's trip to the Howard Johnson's Restaurant and Motor Lodge in Plattsburgh, New York. However, exteriors were actually shot in Baldwin Park, California.[citation needed] In response, Howard Johnson's launched a promotion referencing the appearance, to include a letter addressed to the character of Don Draper in the style of letterhead used in that era.[49]\\r\\nIn the film Blazing Saddles, a joke is made of recreating the town of Rock Ridge \\"right down to the orange roof on Howard Johnson's outhouse\\" and signage boasting \\"1 flavor.\\" The character named Howard Johnson was played by John Hillerman.[50]","input":"Where is there a howard johnson's restaurant?"},{"output":"the late Devonian era","context":"The aquatic to terrestrial transition of vertebrate organisms occurred in the late Devonian era and was an important step in the evolutionary history of modern land vertebrates. The transition allowed animals to escape competitive pressure from the water and explore niche opportunities on land. Fossils from this period have allowed scientists to identify some of the species that existed during this transition, such as Tiktaalik[1] and Acanthostega.[2] Many of these species were also the first to develop adaptations suited to terrestrial over aquatic life, such as neck mobility and hindlimb locomotion.\\r\\nThe late Devonian vertebrate transition was not the only terrestrial invasion in evolutionary history. The vertebrate transition was preceded by the plant and invertebrate terrestrial invasion. These invasions allowed for the appropriate niche development that would ultimately facilitate the vertebrate invasion. Furthermore, the late Devonian event is only significant in that it was the first land invasion by vertebrate organisms, and that it resulted in an explosion of vertebrate biodiversity due to the many different niches that these species were able to exploit. However, aquatic species have continued to develop adaptations suited to terrestrial life (and vice versa) from the late Devonian to the Holocene.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vertebrate species that were important to the initial water to land transition can be qualified as being one of five groups: Sarcopterygian fishes, prototetrapods, aquatic tetrapods, true tetrapods, and terrestrial tetrapods. Many morphological changes occurred throughout this transition. Mechanical support structures changed from fins to limbs, the method of locomotion changed from swimming to walking, respiratory structures changed from gills to lungs, feeding mechanisms changed from suction feeding to biting, and mode of reproduction changed from larval development to metamorphosis.[4]\\r\\nLungfish appeared approximately 400 million years ago. It is a species that endured rapid evolution during the Devonian era, which became known as the dipnoan renaissance. The Acanthostega species, known as the fish with legs, is considered a tetrapod by structural findings but is postulated to have perhaps never left the aquatic environment. Its legs are not well-suited to support its weight. The bones of its forearm, the radius and ulna, are very thin at the wrist and also unable to support it on land. It also lacks a sacrum and strong ligaments at the hip, which would be integral to supporting the animal against gravity. In this sense, the species is considered a tetrapod but not one that has adapted well enough to walk on land. Furthermore, its gill bars have a supportive brace characterized for use as an underwater ear because it can pick up noise vibrations through the water. Tetrapods that adapted to terrestrial living adapted these gill bones to pick up sounds through air, and they later became the middle ear bones seen in mammalian tetrapods. Ichthyostega, on the other hand, is considered to be a fully terrestrial tetrapod that perhaps depended on water for its aquatic young. Comparisons between the skeletal features of Acanthostega and Ichthyostega reveal that they had different habits. Acanthostega is likely exclusive to an aquatic environment, while Ichthyostega is progressed in the aquatic to terrestrial transition by living dominantly on the shores.[2]\\r\\nAn evolutionary timeline of the late Devonian vertebrate terrestrial invasion demonstrates the changes that took place. A group of fish from the Givetian stage began developing limbs, and eventually evolved into aquatic tetrapods in the Famennian stage. Pederpes, Westlothiana, Protogyrinus, and Crassigyrinus descended from these species into the carboniferous period and were the first land vertebrates.[4]\\r\\nA particularly important transitional species is one known as Tiktaalik. It has a fin, but interestingly the fin has bones within it that are similar to mammalian tetrapods. It has an upper arm bone, a lower arm bone, forearm bones, a wrist, and fingerlike projections. Essentially, it is a fin that can support the animal. Similarly, it also has a neck that allows independent head movement from the body. Its ribs are also able to support the body in gravity. Its skeletal features exhibit its ability as a fish that can live in shallow water and also venture onto land.[1]\\r\\nIt took many millions of years for vertebrates to transition out of water onto land. During this time, both the competitive pressures that would push species out of the water and the niche occupation incentives that would pull species onto land were slowly building. The culmination of these driving factors are what ultimately facilitated the vertebrate transition.\\r\\nScientists believe that a long period of time where biotic and abiotic factors in the aquatic environment were unfavourable to a subset of aquatic organisms is what initiated their transition to shallower waters. Some of these push factors are environmental hypoxia, unfavourable aquatic temperatures, and increased salinity. Other constantly present factors such as predation, competition, waterborne diseases and parasites also contributed to the transition.[4]\\r\\nA theory put forth by Joseph Barrell possibly helps explain what may have initiated these push factors to become relevant in the late Devonian. The extensive oxidized sediments that were present in Europe and North America during the late Devonian are evidence of severe droughts during this time. These droughts would cause small ponds and lakes to dry out, forcing certain aquatic organisms to move on land to find other bodies of water. Natural selection on these organisms eventually led to the evolution of the first terrestrial vertebrates.[2]\\r\\nThe pull factors were secondary to the push factors, and only became significant once the pressures to leave the aquatic environment became significant. These were largely the niches and opportunities that were available for exploitation in the terrestrial environment, and include higher environmental oxygen partial pressures, favourable temperatures, and the lack of competitors and predators on land. The plants and invertebrates that had preceded the vertebrate invasion also provided opportunities in the form of abundant prey and lack of predators.[4]\\r\\nThere were many challenges that the first land vertebrates faced. These challenges allowed for rapid natural selection and niche domination, resulting in an adaptive radiation that produced many different vertebrate land species in a relatively short period of time.\\r\\nDepending on the water depth at which a species lives, the visual perception of many aquatic species is better suited to darker environments than those on land. Similarly, hearing in aquatic organisms is better optimized for sounds underwater, where the speed and amplitude of sound is greater than in air.[3]\\r\\nHomeostasis was almost definitely a challenge for land invading vertebrates. Gas exchange and water balance are highly different in water and in air. Homeostasis mechanisms suitable for a terrestrial environment may have been necessary to develop before these organisms invaded land.[3]\\r\\nThe primary anatomical barrier is the development of lungs for proper gas exchange, however other anatomical barriers also exist. The stressors of the musculoskeletal system are different in air than they are in water, and the muscles and bones must be strong enough to withstand the increased effects of gravity on land.[3]\\r\\nMany behaviours, such as reproduction, are specifically optimized to a wet environment. Navigation and locomotion are also highly different in aquatic environments compared to terrestrial environments.[3]\\r\\nThe ancestral species of tetrapods that lived entirely in water had tall and narrow skulls with eyes facing sideways and forwards to maximize visibility for predators and prey in the aquatic environment. As the ancestors of early tetrapods started inhabiting shallower waters, these species had flatter skulls with eyes at the tops of their heads, which made it possible to spot food above them. Once the tetrapods transitioned onto land, the lineages evolved to have tall and narrow skulls with eyes facing sideways and forwards again. This allowed them to navigate through the terrestrial environment and look for predators and prey.[5]\\r\\nFish do not have necks, so the head is directly connected to the shoulders. In contrast, land animals use necks to move their heads so they can look down to see the food on the ground. The greater the mobility of the neck, the more visibility the land animal has. As lineages moved from completely aquatic environments to shallower waters and land, they gradually evolved vertebral columns that increased neck mobility. The first neck vertebra that evolved permitted the animals to have flexion and extension of the head so that they can see up and down. The second neck vertebra evolved to allow rotation of the neck for moving the head left and right. As tetrapod species continued to evolve on land, adaptations included seven or more vertebrae, allowing increasing neck mobility.[5]\\r\\nThe sacrum connects the pelvis and hindlimbs and is useful for motion on land. The aquatic ancestors of tetrapods did not have a sacrum, so it was speculated to have evolved for locomotive function exclusive to terrestrial environments. However, the Acanthostega species is one of the earliest lineages to have a sacrum, even though it is a fully aquatic species. Once species moved onto land, the trait was adapted for terrestrial locomotion support, which is evidenced by additional vertebrae fusing similarly to permit additional support. This is an example of exaptation, where a trait performs a function that did not arise through natural selection for its current use.[5]\\r\\nAs the lineages evolved to adapt to terrestrial environments, many lost traits that were better suited for the aquatic environment. Many lost their gills, which were only useful for obtaining oxygen in water. Their tail fins became smaller. They lost the lateral line system, a network of canals along the skull and jaw that are sensitive to vibration, which does not work outside of an aquatic environment.[5]\\r\\nFor successful land invasion, the species had several pre-adaptations like air-breathing and limb-based locomotion. Aspects such as reproduction and swallowing, however, have bound these species to the aquatic environment. These pre-adaptations have allowed vertebrates to venture onto land hundreds of times, but were not able to accomplish the same degree of prolific radiation into diverse terrestrial species.[3] To understand the potential of future invasions, studies must evaluate the models of evolutionary steps taken in past invasions. The commonalities to current and future invasions may then be elucidated to predict the effects of environmental changes.","input":"When did amphibians begin to colonize land as the first terrestrial vertebrates?"},{"output":"Manila","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a list of current and former national capital cities in the Philippines, which includes during the time of the Spanish colonization, the First Philippine Republic, the Commonwealth of the Philippines, the Second Republic of the Philippines (Japanese-Sponsored Republic), the Third Republic of the Philippines, the Fourth Republic of the Philippines and the current Fifth Republic of the Philippines.[1]\\r\\nThe current capital city, Manila, was established by presidential order on June 24, 1976.\\r\\nOn April 7, 1521 Ferdinand Magellan landed in Cebu. He was welcomed by Rajah Humabon, who, together with his wife and about 800 natives, were baptized by the Spaniards on April 14, 1521 and are considered to be the first Filipino Catholics. Magellan, however, failed to successfully claim the Philippines for the crown of Spain, having been slain in neighboring Mactan Island .\\r\\nA Spanish expedition ordered by the conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legazpi demanded the conquest of Manila. His second on command, Martn de Goiti departed from Cebu and arrived in Manila. The Muslim Tagalogs welcomed the foreigners, but Goiti had other plans. The Spanish force of 300 soldiers marched through Manila and a battle was fought with the heavily armed Spaniards quickly defeating and crushing the native settlements to the ground. Legazpi and his men followed the next year and made a peace pact with the three rajahs and organized a city council consisting of two mayors, 12 councilors, and a secretary.\\r\\nA walled city known as Intramuros, at the southern banks of Pasig River was built to protect the Spanish colonizers. On June 10, 1574, King Philip II of Spain gave Manila the title of Insigne y Siempre Leal Ciudad (\\"Distinguished and Ever Loyal City\\"). In 1595, Manila was proclaimed as the capital of the Philippine Islands and became a center of the trans-Pacific silver trade for more than three centuries.\\r\\nWhen the British capture Manila from Spain, they transfer the capital to Bacolor, Pampanga, however the capital move back to Manila after the two colonizers sign the 1763 Treaty of Paris.\\r\\nWhen Philippine Revolution exploited in 1896, The town of Malolos in the northern province of Bulacan became the headquarters of the revolutionary movement yet several other towns became capitals, at a succeeding rate to avoid capture from the Americans during the PhilippineÿAmerican War. The status of the national capital moved back to Manila after capture of President Emilio Aguinaldo on 1901.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Americans came they decided that Intramuros was not big enough, nor appropriate for their new colony. They called in the famous architect and planner, Daniel Burnham, to design the new capital. This he did in grand fashion using Washington D.C. as a model. The national civic center was placed outside the old walls in the open field called Bagumbayan. Burnham planned a large capitol building surrounded by supporting government offices in a formal setting that was close to a mirror image of Washingtons. The National Mall is now our Luneta, or Rizal Park. Only the Agriculture and Finance Buildings were built of the original civic group. The National Library was also built in the 1920s but turned into the Legislative Building in lieu of the Capitol that could not get built because of budgetary cuts.\\r\\nBurnham proposed a parkway along Manila bay extending from the Luneta southward all the way to Cavite. This was to be a 250 wide boulevard ÿ with roadways, tramways, bridle paths, rich plantations, and broad sidewalks and should be made available to all classes of people. Burnham further recommended ÿ shaded drives along the Pasig all the way to Ft. McKinley, which we now know as Fort Bonifacio, and beyond as part of the park and parkway system. Burnham ended his report by the following words:\\r\\nBy 1928 a major revision of the plan was undertaken. A committee led by Manuel Ma?osa, Sr. and Juan Arellano produced a Zoning Plan for Manila based on the original Burnham Plan. This was printed and distributed free to the public for feedback. The final drawings and documents were recommended for approval in 1933 and eventually became the basis for Manila's first zoning ordinances.\\r\\nBurnhams Manila plan was prepared for a city with a maximum population of 800,000 people. The population of the city of Manila was only 285,000 in 1918, but it grew at 5.6 percent per year to more than 600,000 in 1939. At that rate, Manila would have been filled to capacity.\\r\\nBut then in the 1930s just as the Commonwealth government had finally built the Burnham Plan's seaside drive ÿ named Dewey Boulevard and now known to us as Roxas Boulevard ÿ and finally finished the Post Office Building, the Finance and Agriculture Buildings, it decided to scrap the Burnham Plan and replace it with a new metropolis elsewhere. One of the main reasons given was that the proposed National Capitol to be built in the vicinity of the present-day Rizal Park was too susceptible to naval bombardment.\\r\\nDuring the time of the Commonwealth, Manila still served as the nation's capital. During these times too that Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon dreamed of a city that could become the future capital of the country, replacing Manila. In the summer of 1939 President Quezon contacted William Parsons and asked him to choose a new site for and then to design a new Philippine capital. Parsons arrived in June 1939 and eventually chose Diliman as the new capital site. He also managed to produce a master plan for the new University of the Philippines. Unfortunately he died in December of that year. Harry Frost, Parsons former partner took over and joined Juan Arellano and A. D. Williams in the Planning Commission. A fourth member of the team, landscape architect Louis P. Croft joined them as advisor on planning and park design. They were commissioned to produce a master plan for Quezon City; this was approved in 1941.\\r\\nThe elliptical circle was the focal point of a grand quadrangle defined by the geographically named avenues and reached by a grand boulevard connecting it to the very center of old Manila via Quezon Bridge. The circle was to house the new legislative complex, a magnificent group of buildings with the halls of Senate and the House. On either side of North and East Avenues were to be the executive and judiciary complexes of the national government. All of these complexes were set in landscaped sites and surrounded by public parks and open spaces. The new National Capital City complex was thus defined with the three branches of government connected and framed by the Diliman Qaudrangle. eventually. The elliptical circle was turned to a memorial to Quezon. The 400 hectares of the Diliman quadrangle was allocated by the commission as the city's central park. This central park was to contain the national botanic garden, the national zoo, athletic grounds, a grand stadium and even a golf course. The park was to be the main component of a comprehensive citywide park and parkway system. This system would have included another 80-hectare park in the north, various parks and greenbelts along creeks and rivers, numerous playgrounds and athletic fields. Finally, there was to be a major greenbelt all along the Marikina and San Mateo valley ÿ to contain urban sprawl, preserve the agricultural land and protect the citys watershed areas. None of the intended parks and parkway system was ever built.\\r\\nDuring the Japanese-sponsored Second Philippine Republic and throughout World War II Manila still served as the nation's capital, However Baguio serve as the temporary capital of government in exile and the site where General Tomoyuki Yamashita and Vice Admiral Okochi surrendered.\\r\\nQuezon died in exile during the war years. After the war, Quezon City was put back on track as capital of an independent republic. In 1945, President Sergio Osme?a, who had taken over when Quezon died, organized the Quezon Memorial Committee (QMC) to raise funds for a memorial.\\r\\nIn 1946 newly elected President Manuel Roxas created a Capital Site Committee to look at other possible sites. The old capitol site was not deemed defensible enough from military attack nor the area large enough to accommodate a projected population of several million people. Sixteen other sites were evaluated. The committee was formed to look at 16 other options to Novaliches. These included, among others: Tagaytay, Cebu, Davao, San Pablo, Baguio, Los Ba?os, Montalban, Antipolo, and Fort McKinley. The committee even considered moving the capital to Boracay Island but the raised elevation of Novaliches was finally chosen. The original Diliman area was thus enlarged to include the Novaliches watershed to the North all the way to Wack Wack in the south. In essence, the Frost Plan was revived under the National Planning Commission first headed by Croft then later by Harvard-trained Anselmo Alquinto. The plan was revised in 1947, 1949 and finally in 1956.\\r\\nThe civic center under these revisions was to be moved northeast from the elliptical circle to a 158 hectare area called Constitution Hill. The three branches of government and support offices were laid in a formal layout reminiscent of the UP plan. In the middle was to be a 20 hectare Plaza of the Republic. The whole complex was to be connected to Manila by an East-West parkway called Republic Avenue.

President Marcos also considered an alternative site for the national capital.

Technology can refer to methods ranging from as simple as language and stone tools to the complex genetic engineering and information technology that has emerged since the 1980s.\\r\\nNew knowledge has enabled people to create new things, and conversely, many scientific endeavors are made possible by technologies which assist humans in travelling to places they could not previously reach, and by scientific instruments by which we study nature in more detail than our natural senses allow.\\r\\nSince much of technology is applied science, technical history is connected to the history of science. Since technology uses resources, technical history is tightly connected to economic history. From those resources, technology produces other resources, including technological artifacts used in everyday life.\\r\\nTechnological change affects, and is affected by, a society's cultural traditions. It is a force for economic growth and a means to develop and project economic, political and military power.\\r\\nMany sociologists and anthropologists have created social theories dealing with social and cultural evolution. Some, like Lewis H. Morgan, Leslie White, and Gerhard Lenski have declared technological progress to be the primary factor driving the development of human civilization. Morgan's concept of three major stages of social evolution (savagery, barbarism, and civilization) can be divided by technological milestones, such as fire. White argued the measure by which to judge the evolution of culture was energy.[1]\\r\\nFor White, \\"the primary function of culture\\" is to \\"harness and control energy.\\" White differentiates between five stages of human development: In the first, people use energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use energy of domesticated animals. In the third, they use the energy of plants (agricultural revolution). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of natural resources: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness nuclear energy. White introduced a formula P=E*T, where E is a measure of energy consumed, and T is the measure of efficiency of technical factors utilizing the energy. In his own words, \\"culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased\\". Nikolai Kardashev extrapolated his theory, creating the Kardashev scale, which categorizes the energy use of advanced civilizations.\\r\\nLenski's approach focuses on information. The more information and knowledge (especially allowing the shaping of natural environment) a given society has, the more advanced it is. He identifies four stages of human development, based on advances in the history of communication. In the first stage, information is passed by genes. In the second, when humans gain sentience, they can learn and pass information through by experience. In the third, the humans start using signs and develop logic. In the fourth, they can create symbols, develop language and writing. Advancements in communications technology translates into advancements in the economic system and political system, distribution of wealth, social inequality and other spheres of social life. He also differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication and economy:\\r\\nIn economics productivity is a measure of technological progress. Productivity increases when fewer inputs (labor, energy, materials or land) are used in the production of a unit of output. Another indicator of technological progress is the development of new products and services, which is necessary to offset unemployment that would otherwise result as labor inputs are reduced. In developed countries productivity growth has been slowing since the late 1970s; however, productivity growth was higher in some economic sectors, such as manufacturing.[2] For example, in employment in manufacturing in the United States declined from over 30% in the 1940s to just over 10% 70 years later. Similar changes occurred in other developed countries. This stage is referred to as post-industrial.\\r\\nIn the late 1970s sociologists and anthropologists like Alvin Toffler (author of Future Shock), Daniel Bell and John Naisbitt have approached the theories of post-industrial societies, arguing that the current era of industrial society is coming to an end, and services and information are becoming more important than industry and goods. Some extreme visions of the post-industrial society, especially in fiction, are strikingly similar to the visions of near and post-Singularity societies.\\r\\nThe following is a summary of the history of technology by time period and geography:\\r\\nDuring most of the Paleolithic - the bulk of the Stone Age - all humans had a lifestyle which involved limited tools and few permanent settlements. The first major technologies were tied to survival, hunting, and food preparation. Stone tools and weapons, fire, and clothing were technological developments of major importance during this period.\\r\\nHuman ancestors have been using stone and other tools since long before the emergence of Homo sapiens approximately 200,000 years ago.[3] The earliest methods of stone tool making, known as the Oldowan \\"industry\\", date back to at least 2.3 million years ago,[4] with the earliest direct evidence of tool usage found in Ethiopia within the Great Rift Valley, dating back to 2.5 million years ago.[5] This era of stone tool use is called the Paleolithic, or \\"Old stone age\\", and spans all of human history up to the development of agriculture approximately 12,000 years ago.\\r\\nTo make a stone tool, a \\"core\\" of hard stone with specific flaking properties (such as flint) was struck with a hammerstone. This flaking produced sharp edges which could be used as tools, primarily in the form of choppers or scrapers.[6] These tools greatly aided the early humans in their hunter-gatherer lifestyle to perform a variety of tasks including butchering carcasses (and breaking bones to get at the marrow); chopping wood; cracking open nuts; skinning an animal for its hide; and even forming other tools out of softer materials such as bone and wood.[7]\\r\\nThe earliest stone tools were crude, being little more than a fractured rock. In the Acheulian era, beginning approximately 1.65 million years ago, methods of working these stone into specific shapes, such as hand axes emerged. This early Stone Age is described as the Lower Paleolithic.\\r\\nThe Middle Paleolithic, approximately 300,000 years ago, saw the introduction of the prepared-core technique, where multiple blades could be rapidly formed from a single core stone.[6] The Upper Paleolithic, beginning approximately 40,000 years ago, saw the introduction of pressure flaking, where a wood, bone, or antler punch could be used to shape a stone very finely.[8]\\r\\nThe end of the last Ice Age about 10,000 years ago is taken as the end point of the Upper Paleolithic and the beginning of the Epipaleolithic / Mesolithic. The Mesolithic technology included the use of microliths as composite stone tools, along with wood, bone, and antler tools. In some parts of Europe, the microlithic technology was abandoned in favour of a macrolithic technology.[9]\\r\\nThe later Stone Age, during which the rudiments of agricultural technology were developed, is called the Neolithic period. During this period, polished stone tools were made from a variety of hard rocks such as flint, jade, jadeite and greenstone, largely by working exposures as quarries, but later the valuable rocks were pursued by tunnelling underground, the first steps in mining technology. The polished axes were used for forest clearance and the establishment of crop farming, and were so effective as to remain in use when bronze and iron appeared. These stone axes were used alongside a continued use of stone tools such as a range of projectiles, knives, and scrapers, as well as tools made organic materials such as wood, bone, and antler.[10]\\r\\nStone Age cultures developed music, and engaged in organized warfare. Stone Age humans developed ocean-worthy outrigger canoe technology, leading to migration across the Malay archipelago, across the Indian Ocean to Madagascar and also across the Pacific Ocean, which required knowledge of the ocean currents, weather patterns, sailing, and celestial navigation.\\r\\nAlthough Paleolithic cultures left no written records, the shift from nomadic life to settlement and agriculture can be inferred from a range of archaeological evidence. Such evidence includes ancient tools,[11] cave paintings, and other prehistoric art, such as the Venus of Willendorf. Human remains also provide direct evidence, both through the examination of bones, and the study of mummies. Scientists and historians have been able to form significant inferences about the lifestyle and culture of various prehistoric peoples, and especially their technology.\\r\\nThe Stone Age developed into the Bronze Age after the Neolithic Revolution. The Neolithic Revolution involved radical changes in agricultural technology which included development of agriculture, animal domestication, and the adoption of permanent settlements. These combined factors made possible the development of metal smelting, with copper and later bronze, an alloy of tin and copper, being the materials of choice, although polished stone tools continued to be used for a considerable time owing to their abundance compared with the less common metals (especially tin).\\r\\nThis technological trend apparently began in the Fertile Crescent, and spread outward over time. These developments were not, and still are not, universal. The three-age system does not accurately describe the technology history of groups outside of Eurasia, and does not apply at all in the case of some isolated populations, such as the Spinifex People, the Sentinelese, and various Amazonian tribes, which still make use of Stone Age technology, and have not developed agricultural or metal technology.\\r\\nThe Iron age involved the adoption of iron smelting technology. It generally replaced bronze, and made it possible to produce tools which were stronger, lighter and cheaper to make than bronze equivalents. In many Eurasian cultures, the Iron Age was the last major step before the development of written language, though again this was not universally the case. It was not possible to mass manufacture steel because high furnace temperatures were needed, but steel could be produced by forging bloomery iron to reduce the carbon content in a controllable way. Iron ores were much more widespread than either copper or tin. In Europe, large hill forts were built either as a refuge in time of war, or sometimes as permanent settlements. In some cases, existing forts from the Bronze Age were expanded and enlarged. The pace of land clearance using the more effective iron axes increased, providing more farmland to support the growing population.\\r\\nIt was the growth of the ancient civilizations which produced the greatest advances in technology and engineering, advances which stimulated other societies to adopt new ways of living and governance.\\r\\nThe Egyptians invented and used many simple machines, such as the ramp to aid construction processes. Egyptian society made significant advances during dynastic periods in areas such as astronomy, mathematics and medicine. They also made paper and monuments. The Egyptians made significant advances in shipbuilding. Astronomy was used by Egyptian leaders to govern people.\\r\\nThe Indus Valley Civilization, situated in a resource-rich area, is notable for its early application of city planning and sanitation technologies. Indus Valley construction and architecture, called 'Vaastu Shastra', suggests a thorough understanding of materials engineering, hydrology, and sanitation.\\r\\nThe peoples of Mesopotamia (Sumerians, Akkadians, Assyrians, and Babylonians) have been credited with the invention of the wheel, but this is no longer certain. They lived in cities from c. 4000?BC,[12] and developed a sophisticated architecture in mud-brick and stone,[13] including the use of the true arch. The walls of Babylon were so massive they were quoted as a Wonder of the World. They developed extensive water systems; canals for transport and irrigation in the alluvial south, and catchment systems stretching for tens of kilometres in the hilly north. Their palaces had sophisticated drainage systems.[14]\\r\\nWriting was invented in Mesopotamia, using cuneiform script. Many records on clay tablets and stone inscriptions have survived. These civilizations were early adopters of bronze technologies which they used for tools, weapons and monumental statuary. By 1200?BC they could cast objects 5 m long in a single piece. The Assyrian King Sennacherib (704-681?BC) claims to have invented automatic sluices and to have been the first to use water screws, of up to 30 tons weight, which were cast using two-part clay moulds rather than by the 'lost wax' process.[14] The Jerwan Aqueduct (c. 688?BC) is made with stone arches and lined with waterproof concrete.[15]\\r\\nThe Babylonian astronomical diaries spanned 800 years. They enabled meticulous astronomers to plot the motions of the planets and to predict eclipses.[16]\\r\\nThe Chinese made many first-known discoveries and developments. Major technological contributions from China include early seismological detectors, matches, paper, sliding calipers, the double-action piston pump, cast iron, the iron plough, the multi-tube seed drill, the wheelbarrow, the suspension bridge, the parachute, natural gas as fuel, the compass, the raised-relief map, the propeller, the crossbow, the South Pointing Chariot and gunpowder.\\r\\nOther Chinese discoveries and inventions from the Medieval period, include: block printing, movable type printing, phosphorescent paint, endless power chain drive and the clock escapement mechanism. The solid-fuel rocket was invented in China about 1150, nearly 200 years after the invention of gunpowder (which acted as the rocket's fuel). Decades before the West's age of exploration, the Chinese emperors of the Ming Dynasty also sent large fleets for maritime voyages, some reaching Africa.\\r\\nGreek and Hellenistic engineers were responsible for myriad inventions and improvements to existing technology. The Hellenistic period in particular saw a sharp increase in technological advancement, fostered by a climate of openness to new ideas, the blossoming of a mechanistic philosophy, and the establishment of the Library of Alexandria and its close association with the adjacent museion. In contrast to the typically anonymous inventors of earlier ages, ingenious minds such as Archimedes, Philo of Byzantium, Heron, Ctesibius, and Archytas remain known by name to posterity.\\r\\nAncient Greek innovations were particularly pronounced in mechanical technology, including the ground-breaking invention of the watermill which constituted the first human-devised motive force not to rely on muscle power (besides the sail). Apart from their pioneering use of waterpower, Greek inventors were also the first to experiment with wind power (see Heron's windwheel) and even created the earliest steam engine (the aeolipile), opening up entirely new possibilities in harnessing natural forces whose full potential would not be exploited until the Industrial Revolution. The newly devised right-angled gear and screw would become particularly important to the operation of mechanical devices. That is when the age of mechanical devices started.\\r\\nAncient agriculture, as in any period prior to the modern age the primary mode of production and subsistence, and its irrigation methods, were considerably advanced by the invention and widespread application of a number of previously unknown water-lifting devices, such as the vertical water-wheel, the compartmented wheel, the water turbine, Archimedes' screw, the bucket-chain and pot-garland, the force pump, the suction pump, the double-action piston pump and quite possibly the chain pump.[17]\\r\\nIn music, the water organ, invented by Ctesibius and subsequently improved, constituted the earliest instance of a keyboard instrument. In time-keeping, the introduction of the inflow clepsydra and its mechanization by the dial and pointer, the application of a feedback system and the escapement mechanism far superseded the earlier outflow clepsydra.\\r\\nThe famous Antikythera mechanism, a kind of analogous computer working with a differential gear, and the astrolabe both show great refinement in astronomical science.\\r\\nGreek engineers were also the first to devise automata such as vending machines, suspended ink pots, automatic washstands and doors, primarily as toys, which however featured many new useful mechanisms such as the cam and gimbals.\\r\\nIn other fields, ancient Greek inventions include the catapult and the gastraphetes crossbow in warfare, hollow bronze-casting in metallurgy, the dioptra for surveying, in infrastructure the lighthouse, central heating, the tunnel excavated from both ends by scientific calculations, the ship trackway, the dry dock and plumbing. In horizontal vertical and transport great progress resulted from the invention of the crane, the winch, the wheelbarrow and the odometer.\\r\\nFurther newly created techniques and items were spiral staircases, the chain drive, sliding calipers and showers.\\r\\nThe Romans developed an intensive and sophisticated agriculture, expanded upon existing iron working technology, created laws providing for individual ownership, advanced stone masonry technology, advanced road-building (exceeded only in the 19th century), military engineering, civil engineering, spinning and weaving and several different machines like the Gallic reaper that helped to increase productivity in many sectors of the Roman economy. Roman engineers were the first to build monumental arches, amphitheatres, aqueducts, public baths, true arch bridges, harbours, reservoirs and dams, vaults and domes on a very large scale across their Empire. Notable Roman inventions include the book (Codex), glass blowing and concrete. Because Rome was located on a volcanic peninsula, with sand which contained suitable crystalline grains, the concrete which the Romans formulated was especially durable. Some of their buildings have lasted 2000 years, to the present day.\\r\\nThe engineering skills of the Inca and the Mayans were great, even by today's standards. An example is the use of pieces weighing upwards of one ton in their stonework placed together so that not even a blade can fit in-between the cracks. The villages used irrigation canals and drainage systems, making agriculture very efficient. While some claim that the Incas were the first inventors of hydroponics, their agricultural technology was still soil based, if advanced. Though the Maya civilization had no metallurgy or wheel technology, they developed complex writing and astrological systems, and created sculptural works in stone and flint. Like the Inca, the Maya also had command of fairly advanced agricultural and construction technology. Throughout this time period, much of this construction was made only by women, as men of the Maya civilization believed that females were responsible for the creation of new things. The main contribution of the Aztec rule was a system of communications between the conquered cities. In Mesoamerica, without draft animals for transport (nor, as a result, wheeled vehicles), the roads were designed for travel on foot, just like the Inca and Mayan civilizations\\r\\nAs earlier empires had done, the Muslim caliphates united in trade large areas that had previously traded little. The conquered sometimes paid lower taxes than in their earlier independence, and ideas spread even more easily than goods. Peace was more frequent than it had been. These conditions fostered improvements in agriculture and other technology as well as in sciences which largely adapted from earlier Greek, Roman and Persian empires, with improvements.\\r\\nEuropean technology in the Middle Ages may be best described as a symbiosis of traditio et innovatio. While medieval technology has been long depicted as a step backwards in the evolution of Western technology, sometimes willfully so by modern authors intent on denouncing the church as antagonistic to scientific progress (see e.g. Myth of the Flat Earth), a generation of medievalists around the American historian of science Lynn White stressed from the 1940s onwards the innovative character of many medieval techniques. Genuine medieval contributions include for example mechanical clocks, spectacles and vertical windmills. Medieval ingenuity was also displayed in the invention of seemingly inconspicuous items like the watermark or the functional button. In navigation, the foundation to the subsequent age of exploration was laid by the introduction of pintle-and-gudgeon rudders, lateen sails, the dry compass, the horseshoe and the astrolabe.\\r\\nSignificant advances were also made in military technology with the development of plate armour, steel crossbows, counterweight trebuchets and cannon. The Middle Ages are perhaps best known for their architectural heritage: While the invention of the rib vault and pointed arch gave rise to the high rising Gothic style, the ubiquitous medieval fortifications gave the era the almost proverbial title of the 'age of castles'.\\r\\nPapermaking, a 2nd-century Chinese technology, was carried to the Middle East when a group of Chinese papermakers were captured in the 8th century.[18] Papermaking technology was spread to Europe by the Umayyad conquest of Hispania.[19] A paper mill was established in Sicily in the 12th century. In Europe the fiber to make pulp for making paper was obtained from linen and cotton rags. Lynn White credited the spinning wheel with increasing the supply of rags, which led to cheap paper, which was a factor in the development of printing.[20]\\r\\nDome of Florence Cathedral\\r\\nDesign for a flying machine (c.1488) by da Vinci\\r\\nThe era is marked by such profound technical advancements like linear perceptivity, double shell domes or Bastion fortresses. Note books of the Renaissance artist-engineers such as Taccola and Leonardo da Vinci give a deep insight into the mechanical technology then known and applied. Architects and engineers were inspired by the structures of Ancient Rome, and men like Brunelleschi created the large dome of Florence Cathedral as a result. He was awarded one of the first patents ever issued in order to protect an ingenious crane he designed to raise the large masonry stones to the top of the structure. Military technology developed rapidly with the widespread use of the cross-bow and ever more powerful artillery, as the city-states of Italy were usually in conflict with one another. Powerful families like the Medici were strong patrons of the arts and sciences. Renaissance science spawned the Scientific Revolution; science and technology began a cycle of mutual advancement.\\r\\nThe invention of the movable cast metal type printing press, whose pressing mechanism was adapted from an olive screw press, (c. 1441) lead to a tremendous increase in the number of books and the number of titles published.\\r\\nAn improved sailing ship, the (nau or carrack), enabled the Age of Exploration with the European colonization of the Americas, epitomized by Francis Bacon's New Atlantis. Pioneers like Vasco da Gama, Cabral, Magellan and Christopher Columbus explored the world in search of new trade routes for their goods and contacts with Africa, India and China to shorten the journey compared with traditional routes overland. They produced new maps and charts which enabled following mariners to explore further with greater confidence. Navigation was generally difficult, however, owing to the problem of longitude and the absence of accurate chronometers. European powers rediscovered the idea of the civil code, lost since the time of the Ancient Greeks.\\r\\nA Watt steam engine\\r\\nThe Iron Bridge\\r\\nThe British Industrial Revolution is characterized by developments in the areas of textile manufacturing, mining, metallurgy and transport driven by the development of the steam engine. Above all else, the revolution was driven by cheap energy in the form of coal, produced in ever-increasing amounts from the abundant resources of Britain. Coal converted to coke gave the blast furnace and cast iron in much larger amounts than before, and a range of structures could be created, such as The Iron Bridge. Cheap coal meant that industry was no longer constrained by water resources driving the mills, although it continued as a valuable source of power. The steam engine helped drain the mines, so more coal reserves could be accessed, and the output of coal increased. The development of the high-pressure steam engine made locomotives possible, and a transport revolution followed.[21]\\r\\nThe 19th century saw astonishing developments in transportation, construction, manufacturing and communication technologies originating in Europe. The steam engine which had existed since the early 18th century, was practically applied to both steamboat and railway transportation. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first purpose built railway line, opened in 1830, the Rocket locomotive of Robert Stephenson being one of its first working locomotives used. Telegraphy also developed into a practical technology in the 19th century to help run the railways safely.\\r\\nOther technologies were explored for the first time, including the incandescent light bulb. The invention of the incandescent light bulb had a profound effect on the workplace because factories could now have second and third shift workers. Manufacture of ships' pulley blocks by all-metal machines at the Portsmouth Block Mills instigated the age of mass production. Machine tools used by engineers to manufacture parts began in the first decade of the century, notably by Richard Roberts and Joseph Whitworth. The development of interchangeable parts through what is now called the American system of manufacturing began in the firearms industry at the U.S Federal arsenals in the early 19th century, and became widely used by the end of the century.\\r\\nShoe production was mechanized and sewing machines introduced around the middle of the 19th century. Mass production of sewing machines and agricultural machinery such as reapers occurred in the mid to late 19th century. Bicycles were mass-produced beginning in the 1880s.\\r\\nSteam-powered factories became widespread, although the conversion from water power to steam occurred in England before in the U.S.\\r\\nSteamships were eventually completely iron-clad, and played a role in the opening of Japan and China to trade with the West. The Second Industrial Revolution at the end of the 19th century saw rapid development of chemical, electrical, petroleum, and steel technologies connected with highly structured technology research.\\r\\nThe period from the last third of the 19th century until WW1 is sometimes referred to as the Second Industrial Revolution.\\r\\n20th century technology developed rapidly. Broad teaching and implementation of the scientific method, and increased research spending contributed to the advancement of modern science and technology. New technology improved communication and transport, thus spreading technical understanding.\\r\\nMass production brought automobiles and other high-tech goods to masses of consumers. Military research and development sped advances including electronic computing and jet engines. Radio and telephony improved greatly and spread to larger populations of users, though near-universal access would not be possible until mobile phones became affordable to developing world residents in the late 2000s and early 2010s.\\r\\nEnergy and engine technology improvements included nuclear power, developed after the Manhattan project which heralded the new Atomic Age. Rocket development led to long range missiles and the first space age that lasted from the 1950s with the launch of Sputnik to the mid-1980s.\\r\\nElectrification spread rapidly in the 20th century. At the beginning of the century electric power was for the most part only available to wealthy people in a few major cities such as New York, London, Paris, and Newcastle upon Tyne, but by the time the World Wide Web was invented in 1990 an estimated 62 percent of homes worldwide had electric power, including about a third of households in[22] the rural developing world.\\r\\nBirth control also became widespread during the 20th century. Electron microscopes were very powerful by the late 1970s and genetic theory and knowledge were expanding, leading to developments in genetic engineering.\\r\\nThe first \\"test tube baby\\" Louise Brown was born in 1978, which led to the first successful gestational surrogacy pregnancy in 1985 and the first pregnancy by ICSI in 1991, which is the implanting of a single sperm into an egg. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis was first performed in late 1989 and led to successful births in July 1990. These procedures have become relatively common.\\r\\nThe massive data analysis resources necessary for running transatlantic research programs such as the Human Genome Project and the Large Electron-Positron Collider led to a necessity for distributed communications, causing Internet protocols to be more widely adopted by researchers and also creating a justification for Tim Berners-Lee to create the World Wide Web.\\r\\nVaccination spread rapidly to the developing world from the 1980s onward due to many successful humanitarian initiatives, greatly reducing childhood mortality in many poor countries with limited medical resources.\\r\\nThe US National Academy of Engineering, by expert vote, established the following ranking of the most important technological developments of the 20th century:[23]\\r\\nIn the early 21st century research is ongoing into quantum computers, gene therapy (introduced 1990), 3D printing (introduced 1981), nanotechnology (introduced 1985), bioengineering/biotechnology, nuclear technology, advanced materials (e.g., graphene), the scramjet and drones (along with railguns and high-energy laser beams for military uses), superconductivity, the memristor, and green technologies such as alternative fuels (e.g., fuel cells, self-driving electric and plug-in hybrid cars), augmented reality devices and wearable electronics, artificial intelligence, and more efficient and powerful LEDs, solar cells, integrated circuits, wireless power devices, engines, and batteries.\\r\\nPerhaps the greatest research tool built in the 21st century is the Large Hadron Collider, the largest single machine ever built. The understanding of particle physics is expected to expand with better instruments including larger particle accelerators such as the LHC[24] and better neutrino detectors. Dark matter is sought via underground detectors and observatories like LIGO have started to detect gravitational waves.\\r\\nGenetic engineering technology continues to improve, and the importance of epigenetics on development and inheritance has also become increasingly recognized.[25]\\r\\nNew spaceflight technology and spacecraft are also being developed, like the Orion and Dragon. New, more capable space telescopes are being designed. The International Space Station was completed in the 2000s, and NASA and ESA plan a manned mission to Mars in the 2030s. The Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) is an electro-magnetic thruster for spacecraft propulsion and is expected to be tested in 2015.\\r\\n2004 saw the first manned commercial spaceflight when Mike Melvill crossed the boundary of space on June 21, 2004.","input":"When was the first piece of technology invented?"},{"output":"by foraging","context":"A hunter-gatherer is a human living in a society in which most or all food is obtained by foraging (collecting wild plants and pursuing wild animals), in contrast to agricultural societies, which rely mainly on domesticated species.\\r\\nHunting and gathering was humanity's first and most successful adaptation, occupying at least 90 percent of human history.[1] Following the invention of agriculture, hunter-gatherers who did not change have been displaced or conquered by farming or pastoralist groups in most parts of the world.\\r\\nOnly a few contemporary societies are classified as hunter-gatherers, and many supplement their foraging activity with horticulture or keeping animals.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1970s, Lewis Binford suggested that early humans were obtaining food via scavenging, not hunting.[4] Early humans in the Lower Paleolithic lived in forests and woodlands, which allowed them to collect seafood, eggs, nuts, and fruits besides scavenging. Rather than killing large animals for meat, according to this view, they used carcasses of such animals that had either been killed by predators or that had died of natural causes.[5] Archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers survived in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover.[6]\\r\\nAccording to the endurance running hypothesis, long-distance running as in persistence hunting, a method still practiced by some hunter-gatherer groups in modern times, was likely the driving evolutionary force leading to the evolution of certain human characteristics. This hypothesis does not necessarily contradict the scavenging hypothesis: both subsistence strategies could have been in use ÿ sequentially, alternating or even simultaneously.\\r\\nHunting and gathering was presumably the subsistence strategy employed by human societies beginning some 1.8 million years ago, by Homo erectus, and from its appearance some 0.2 million years ago by Homo sapiens. It remained the only mode of subsistence until the end of the Mesolithic period some 10,000 years ago, and after this was replaced only gradually with the spread of the Neolithic Revolution.\\r\\nStarting at the transition between the Middle to Upper Paleolithic period, some 80,000 to 70,000 years ago, some hunter-gatherers bands began to specialize, concentrating on hunting a smaller selection of (often larger) game and gathering a smaller selection of food. This specialization of work also involved creating specialized tools such as; fishing nets, hooks, and bone harpoons.[7] The transition into the subsequent Neolithic period is chiefly defined by the unprecedented development of nascent agricultural practices. Agriculture originated and spread in several different areas including the Middle East, Asia, Mesoamerica, and the Andes beginning as early as 12,000 years ago.\\r\\nForest gardening was also being used as a food production system in various parts of the world over this period. Forest gardens originated in prehistoric times along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of monsoon regions.[citation needed] In the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment, useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved, whilst undesirable species were eliminated. Eventually superior introduced species were selected and incorporated into the gardens.[8]\\r\\nMany groups continued their hunter-gatherer ways of life, although their numbers have continually declined, partly as a result of pressure from growing agricultural and pastoral communities. Many of them reside in the developing world, either in arid regions or tropical forests. Areas that were formerly available to hunter-gatherers wereand continue to beencroached upon by the settlements of agriculturalists. In the resulting competition for land use, hunter-gatherer societies either adopted these practices or moved to other areas. In addition, Jared Diamond has blamed a decline in the availability of wild foods, particularly animal resources. In North and South America, for example, most large mammal species had gone extinct by the end of the Pleistoceneaccording to Diamond, because of overexploitation by humans,[9] one of several explanations offered for the Quaternary extinction event there.\\r\\nAs the number and size of agricultural societies increased, they expanded into lands traditionally used by hunter-gatherers. This process of agriculture-driven expansion led to the development of the first forms of government in agricultural centers, such as the Fertile Crescent, Ancient India, Ancient China, Olmec, Sub-Saharan Africa and Norte Chico.\\r\\nAs a result of the now near-universal human reliance upon agriculture, the few contemporary hunter-gatherer cultures usually live in areas unsuitable for agricultural use.\\r\\nArchaeologists can use evidence such as stone tool use to track hunter-gatherer activities, including mobility.[10]\\r\\nMost hunter-gatherers are nomadic or semi-nomadic and live in temporary settlements. Mobile communities typically construct shelters using impermanent building materials, or they may use natural rock shelters, where they are available.\\r\\nSome hunter-gatherer cultures, such as the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, lived in particularly rich environments that allowed them to be sedentary or semi-sedentary.\\r\\nHunter-gatherers tend to have an egalitarian social ethos, although settled hunter-gatherers (for example, those inhabiting the Northwest Coast of North America) are an exception to this rule. Nearly all African hunter-gatherers are egalitarian, with women roughly as influential and powerful as men.[11] Karl Marx defined this socio-economic system as primitive communism.[12]\\r\\nThe egalitarianism typical of human hunters and gatherers is never total, but is striking when viewed in an evolutionary context. One of humanity's two closest primate relatives, chimpanzees, are anything but egalitarian, forming themselves into hierarchies that are often dominated by an alpha male. So great is the contrast with human hunter-gatherers that it is widely argued by palaeoanthropologists that resistance to being dominated was a key factor driving the evolutionary emergence of human consciousness, language, kinship and social organization.[13][14][15]\\r\\nAnthropologists maintain that hunter/gatherers don't have permanent leaders; instead, the person taking the initiative at any one time depends on the task being performed.[16][17][18] In addition to social and economic equality in hunter-gatherer societies, there is often, though not always, sexual parity as well.[16] Hunter-gatherers are often grouped together based on kinship and band (or tribe) membership.[19] Postmarital residence among hunter-gatherers tends to be matrilocal, at least initially.[20] Young mothers can enjoy childcare support from their own mothers, who continue living nearby in the same camp.[21] The systems of kinship and descent among human hunter-gatherers were relatively flexible, although there is evidence that early human kinship in general tended to be matrilineal.[22]\\r\\nOne common arrangement is the sexual division of labour, with women doing most of the gathering, while men concentrate on big game hunting. In all hunter-gatherer societies, women appreciate the meat brought back to camp by men. An illustrative account is Megan Biesele's study of the southern African Ju/'hoan, 'Women Like Meat'.[23] Recent archaeological research suggests that the sexual division of labor was the fundamental organisational innovation that gave Homo sapiens the edge over the Neanderthals, allowing our ancestors to migrate from Africa and spread across the globe.[24]\\r\\nTo this day, most hunter-gatherers have a symbolically structured sexual division of labour.[25] However, it is true that in a small minority of cases, women hunt the same kind of quarry as men, sometimes doing so alongside men. The best-known example are the Aeta people of the Philippines. According to one study, \\"About 85% of Philippine Aeta women hunt, and they hunt the same quarry as men. Aeta women hunt in groups and with dogs, and have a 31% success rate as opposed to 17% for men. Their rates are even better when they combine forces with men: mixed hunting groups have a full 41% success rate among the Aeta.\\"[17][failed verification] Among the Ju'/hoansi people of Namibia, women help men track down quarry.[26] Women in the Australian Martu also primarily hunt small animals like lizards to feed their children and maintain relations with other women.[27]\\r\\nAt the 1966 \\"Man the Hunter\\" conference, anthropologists Richard Borshay Lee and Irven DeVore suggested that egalitarianism was one of several central characteristics of nomadic hunting and gathering societies because mobility requires minimization of material possessions throughout a population. Therefore, no surplus of resources can be accumulated by any single member. Other characteristics Lee and DeVore proposed were flux in territorial boundaries as well as in demographic composition.\\r\\nAt the same conference, Marshall Sahlins presented a paper entitled, \\"Notes on the Original Affluent Society\\", in which he challenged the popular view of hunter-gatherers lives as \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\\", as Thomas Hobbes had put it in 1651. According to Sahlins, ethnographic data indicated that hunter-gatherers worked far fewer hours and enjoyed more leisure than typical members of industrial society, and they still ate well. Their \\"affluence\\" came from the idea that they were satisfied with very little in the material sense.[28] Later, in 1996, Ross Sackett performed two distinct meta-analyses to empirically test Sahlin's view. The first of these studies looked at 102 time-allocation studies, and the second one analyzed 207 energy-expenditure studies. Sackett found that adults in foraging and horticultural societies work, on average, about 6.5 hours a day, where as people in agricultural and industrial societies work on average 8.8 hours a day.[29]\\r\\nResearchers Gurven and Kaplan have estimated that around 57% of hunter-gatherers reach the age of 15. Of those that reach 15 years of age, 64% continue to live to or past the age of 45. This places the life expectancy between 21 and 37 years.[30] They further estimate that 70% of deaths are due to diseases of some kind, 20% of deaths come from violence or accidents and 10% are due to degenerative diseases.\\r\\nMutual exchange and sharing of resources (i.e., meat gained from hunting) are important in the economic systems of hunter-gatherer societies.[19] Therefore, these societies can be described as based on a \\"gift economy.\\"\\r\\nHunter-gatherer societies manifest significant variability, depending on climate zone/life zone, available technology, and societal structure. Archaeologists examine hunter-gatherer tool kits to measure variability across different groups. Collard et al. (2005) found temperature to be the only statistically significant factor to impact hunter-gatherer tool kits.[31] Using temperature as a proxy for risk, Collard et al.'s results suggest that environments with extreme temperatures pose a threat to hunter-gatherer systems significant enough to warrant increased variability of tools. These results support Torrence's (1989) theory that risk of failure is indeed the most important factor in determining the structure of hunter-gatherer toolkits.[32]\\r\\nOne way to divide hunter-gatherer groups is by their return systems. James Woodburn uses the categories \\"immediate return\\" hunter-gatherers for egalitarian and \\"delayed return\\" for nonegalitarian. Immediate return foragers consume their food within a day or two after they procure it. Delayed return foragers store the surplus food (Kelly,[33] 31).\\r\\nHunting-gathering was the common human mode of subsistence throughout the Paleolithic, but the observation of current-day hunters and gatherers does not necessarily reflect Paleolithic societies; the hunter-gatherer cultures examined today have had much contact with modern civilization and do not represent \\"pristine\\" conditions found in uncontacted peoples.[34]\\r\\nThe transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture is not necessarily a one way process. It has been argued that hunting and gathering represents an adaptive strategy, which may still be exploited, if necessary, when environmental change causes extreme food stress for agriculturalists.[35] In fact, it is sometimes difficult to draw a clear line between agricultural and hunter-gatherer societies, especially since the widespread adoption of agriculture and resulting cultural diffusion that has occurred in the last 10,000 years.[36] This anthropological view has remained unchanged since the 1960s.[clarification needed][citation needed]\\r\\nNowadays, some scholars speak about the existence within cultural evolution of the so-called mixed-economies or dual economies which imply a combination of food procurement (gathering and hunting) and food production or when foragers have trade relations with farmers.[37]\\r\\nIn the early 1980s, a small but vocal segment of anthropologists and archaeologists attempted to demonstrate that contemporary groups usually identified as hunter-gatherers do not, in most cases, have a continuous history of hunting and gathering, and that in many cases their ancestors were agriculturalists or pastoralists[citation needed] who were pushed into marginal areas as a result of migrations, economic exploitation, or violent conflict (see, for example, the Kalahari Debate). The result of their effort has been the general acknowledgement that there has been complex interaction between hunter-gatherers and non-hunter-gatherers for millennia.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome of the theorists who advocate this \\"revisionist\\" critique imply that, because the \\"pure hunter-gatherer\\" disappeared not long after colonial (or even agricultural) contact began, nothing meaningful can be learned about prehistoric hunter-gatherers from studies of modern ones (Kelly,[38] 24-29; see Wilmsen[39])\\r\\nLee and Guenther have rejected most of the arguments put forward by Wilmsen.[40][41][42] Doron Shultziner and others have argued that we can learn a lot about the life-styles of prehistoric hunter-gatherers from studies of contemporary hunter-gatherersespecially their impressive levels of egalitarianism.[43]\\r\\nMany hunter-gatherers consciously manipulate the landscape through cutting or burning undesirable plants while encouraging desirable ones, some even going to the extent of slash-and-burn to create habitat for game animals. These activities are on an entirely different scale to those associated with agriculture, but they are nevertheless domestication on some level. Today, almost all hunter-gatherers depend to some extent upon domesticated food sources either produced part-time or traded for products acquired in the wild.\\r\\nSome agriculturalists also regularly hunt and gather (e.g., farming during the frost-free season and hunting during the winter). Still others in developed countries go hunting, primarily for leisure. In the Brazilian rainforest, those groups that recently did, or even continue to, rely on hunting and gathering techniques seem to have adopted this lifestyle, abandoning most agriculture, as a way to escape colonial control and as a result of the introduction of European diseases reducing their populations to levels where agriculture became difficult.[citation needed][dubious ÿ discuss]\\r\\nThere are nevertheless a number of contemporary hunter-gatherer peoples who, after contact with other societies, continue their ways of life with very little external influence or with modifications that perpetuate the viability of hunting and gathering in the 21st century.[2] One such group is the Pila Nguru (Spinifex people) of Western Australia, whose habitat in the Great Victoria Desert has proved unsuitable for European agriculture (and even pastoralism).[citation needed] Another are the Sentinelese of the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean, who live on North Sentinel Island and to date have maintained their independent existence, repelling attempts to engage with and contact them.[citation needed] The Savanna Pum of Venezuela also live in an area that is inhospitable to large scale economic exploitation and maintain their subsistence based on hunting and gathering, as well as incorporating a small amount of manioc horticulture that supplements, but is not replacing, reliance on foraged foods.[45]\\r\\nEvidence suggests big-game hunter gatherers crossed the Bering Strait from Asia (Eurasia) into North America over a land bridge (Beringia), that existed between 47,000ÿ14,000 years ago.[46] Around 18,500ÿ15,500 years ago, these hunter-gatherers are believed to have followed herds of now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna along ice-free corridors that stretched between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets.[47] Another route proposed is that, either on foot or using primitive boats, they migrated down the Pacific coast to South America.[48][49]\\r\\nHunter-gatherers would eventually flourish all over the Americas, primarily based in the Great Plains of the United States and Canada, with offshoots as far east as the Gasp Peninsula on the Atlantic coast, and as far south as Chile, Monte Verde.[citation needed] American hunter-gatherers were spread over a wide geographical area, thus there were regional variations in lifestyles. However, all the individual groups shared a common style of stone tool production, making knapping styles and progress identifiable. This early Paleo-Indian period lithic reduction tool adaptations have been found across the Americas, utilized by highly mobile bands consisting of approximately 25 to 50 members of an extended family.[50]\\r\\nThe Archaic period in the Americas saw a changing environment featuring a warmer more arid climate and the disappearance of the last megafauna.[51] The majority of population groups at this time were still highly mobile hunter-gatherers; but now individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally, thus with the passage of time there is a pattern of increasing regional generalization like, the Southwest, Arctic, Poverty, Dalton and Plano traditions. These regional adaptations would become the norm, with reliance less on hunting and gathering, with a more mixed economy of small game, fish, seasonally wild vegetables and harvested plant foods.[52][53]\\r\\n Media related to Hunter-gatherers at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What did hunter gatherers do to sustain themselves?"},{"output":"July 4, 1946","context":"Neolithic age\\r\\n\\r\\nIron age\\r\\n\\r\\nEvents/Artifacts\\r\\n\\r\\n(by geography from North to South)\\r\\n\\r\\nLegendary\\r\\n\\r\\nEvents/Artifacts\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican colonial period\\r\\n\\r\\nThis article covers the history of the Philippines from the recognition of independence in 1946 to the end of the presidency of Diosdado Macapagal, which covered much of the Third Republic of the Philippines which ended on January 17, 1973 with the ratification of the 1973 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 5, 1946, representatives of the United States of America and of the Republic of the Philippines signed a Treaty of General Relations between the two governments. The treaty provided for the recognition of the independence of the Republic of the Philippines as of July 4, 1946, and the relinquishment of American sovereignty over the Philippine Islands.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. retained dozens of military bases, including a few major ones. In addition, independence was qualified by legislation passed by the U.S. Congress. For example, the Bell Trade Act provided a mechanism whereby U.S. import quotas might be established on Philippine articles which \\"are coming, or are likely to come, into substantial competition with like articles the product of the United States\\". It further required U.S. citizens and corporations be granted equal access to Philippine minerals, forests, and other natural resources.[2] In hearings before the Senate Committee on Finance, Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs William Clayton described the law as \\"clearly inconsistent with the basic foreign economic policy of this country\\" and \\"clearly inconsistent with our promise to grant the Philippines genuine independence.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Philippine government had little choice but to accept these terms for independence.[citation needed] The U.S. Congress was threatening to withhold post-World War II rebuilding funds unless the Bell Act was ratified. The Philippine Congress obliged on July 2, 1946.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter independence, the US continued to direct the country through Central Intelligence Agency operatives like Edward Lansdale. As Raymond Bonner and other historians note, Lansdale controlled the career of President Ramon Magsaysay, going so far as to physically beat him when the Philippine leader attempted to reject a speech the CIA had written for him. American agents also drugged sitting President Elpidio Quirino and contemplated assassinating Senator Claro Recto. [4].[5] Prominent Filipino historian Roland G. Simbulan has called the CIA \\"US imperialism's clandestine apparatus in the Philippines.\\"  [6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Philippines currently celebrates its Independence Day on June 12, the anniversary of Emilio Aguinaldo's declaration of independence from Spain in 1898. The declaration was not recognised by the United States which, after defeating the Spanish in the Battle of Manila Bay in May that year, acquired the Philippine Islands via the Treaty of Paris that ended the SpanishÿAmerican War.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1946 to 1961, the Philippines observed Independence Day on July 4. On May 12, 1962, President Macapagal issued Presidential Proclamation No. 28 proclaiming June 12, 1962 as a special public holiday throughout the Philippines.[7][8] In 1964, Republic Act No. 4166 changed the date of Independence Day from July 4 to June 12 and renamed the July 4 holiday as Philippine Republic Day.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Congress of the Philippines was convened in 1945, the legislators elected in 1941 chose Manuel Roxas as Senate President. In the Philippine national elections of 1946, Roxas ran for president as the nominee of the liberal wing of the Nacionalista Party. He had the staunch support of General MacArthur. His opponent was Sergio Osme?a, who refused to campaign, saying that the Filipino people knew his reputation. In the April 23, 1946 election, Roxas won 54 percent of the vote, and the Liberal Party won a majority in the legislature. When the Philippines gained independence from the United States on July 4, 1946, Roxas became the first president of the new republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Roxas was successful in getting rehabilitation funds from the United States after independence, he was forced to concede military bases (23 of which were leased for 99 years), trade restrictions for the Philippine citizens, and special privileges for U.S. property owners and investors. His administration was marred by graft and corruption; moreover, the abuses of the provincial military police contributed to the rise of the left-wing Hukbalahap (Huk) movement in the countryside. His heavy-handed attempts to crush the Huks led to widespread peasant disaffection.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Roxas' term of office administration of the Turtle Islands and Mangsee Islands was transferred by the United Kingdom to the Republic of the Philippines. By an international treaty concluded in 1930 between the United States (in respect of its then overseas territory, the Philippine Archipelago) and the United Kingdom (in respect of its then protectorate, the State of North Borneo) the two powers agreed the international boundaries between those respective territories.[10] In that treaty the United Kingdom also accepted that the Turtle Islands as well as the Mangsee Islands were part of the Philippines Archipelago and therefore under US sovereignty. However, by a supplemental international treaty concluded at the same time, the two powers agreed that those islands, although part of the Philippines Archipelago, would remain under the administration of the State of North Borneo's British North Borneo Company.[11] The supplemental treaty provided that the British North Borneo Company would continue to administer those islands unless and until the United States government gave notice to the United Kingdom calling for administration of the islands to be transferred to the U.S. The U.S. never gave such a notice. On the 4th of July, 1946, the Republic of the Philippines was born. It became the successor to the U.S. under the treaties of 1930. On the 15th of July, 1946, the United Kingdom annexed the State of North Borneo and, in the view of the United Kingdom, became the sovereign power with respect to what had been the State of North Borneo.[12] On 19 September 1946, the Republic of the Philippines notified the United Kingdom that it wished to take over the administration of the Turtle Islands and the Mangesse Islands. Pursuant to a supplemental international agreement, the transfer of administration became effective on 16 October 1947.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoxas did not stay long in office because of a heart attack as he was speaking at Clark Air Base on April 15, 1948. He was succeeded by his vice president Elpidio Quirino.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nQuirino assumed the presidency on April 17, 1948, taking his oath of office two days after the death of Manuel Roxas. In 1949 the wartime president, Jose P. Laurel of the Nacionalista Party, ran against Quirino in what has been described as a particularly corrupt and venal exercise in democracy. Although historians in general accept that Laurel was elected, he refused to challenge Quirino's declared victory with force.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Quirino was a widower, his surviving daughter Vicky would serve as the official hostess and perform the functions traditionally ascribed to the First Lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuirino's administration faced a serious threat in the form of the communist Hukbalahap movement. Though the Huks originally had been an anti-Japanese guerrilla army in Luzon, communists steadily gained control over the leadership, and when Quirino's negotiation with Huk commander Luis Taruc broke down in 1948, Taruc openly declared himself a Communist and called for the overthrow of the government.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis six years as president were marked by notable postwar reconstruction, general economic gains, and increased economic aid from the United States. Basic social problems, however, particularly in the rural areas, remained unsolved, and his administration was tainted by widespread graft and corruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1950, the administration of president Quirino was beginning the Korean War and over 7,450 Filipino soldiers were sent to Korea under\\r\\nthe designation of the Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea or PEFTOK.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough ill, Quirino ran for re-election in 1953, but he was overwhelmingly defeated by Ramon Magsaysay.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Election of 1953, Magsaysay was elected president over the incumbent Elpidio Quirino, with the scarcely concealed help of American officials and funds.[16] He was sworn into office wearing the Barong Tagalog, a first by a Philippine president.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs president, he was a close friend and supporter of the United States and a vocal spokesman against communism during the Cold War. He led the foundation of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization also known as the Manila Pact of 1954, that aimed to defeat communist-Marxist movements in South East Asia, South Asia and the Southwestern Pacific.\\r\\nDuring his term, he made Malaca?an Palace literally a \\"house of the people\\", opening its gates to the public.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne example of his integrity followed a demonstration flight aboard a new plane belonging to the Philippines Air Force (PAF). President Magsaysay asked what the operating costs per hour were for that type of aircraft, then wrote a personal check to the PAF, covering the cost of his flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 16, 1957 Magsaysay left Manila for Cebu City where he spoke at three educational institutions. That same night, at about 1 a.m., he boarded the presidential plane \\"Mt. Pinatubo\\", a C-47, heading back to Manila. In the early morning hours of March 17, his plane was reported missing. It was late in the afternoon that day that newspapers reported that the airplane had crashed on Mt. Manunggal in Cebu and that 25 of the 26 passengers and crew aboard were killed. Only newspaperman Nstor Mata survived. Vice President Carlos P. Garca, who was on an official visit to Australia at the time, assumed the presidency to serve out the last eight months of Magsaysay's term.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn estimated 2 million people attended Magsaysay's burial on March 22, 1957.[17][18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nGarcia assumed the presidency after Ram܇n Magsaysay died in a plane crash on March 17, 1957, and was elected later the same year, in the Election 1957, to a full term.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his administration, he acted on the BohlenÿSerrano Agreement which shortened the lease of the US Bases from 99 years to 25 years and made it renewable after every five years.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was well known when he exercised the Filipino First Policy during his term in office. This policy heavily favored Filipino businessmen over foreign investors. He was also responsible for changes in retail trade which greatly affected the Chinese businessmen in the country. He also made a program focused on thriftiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of his second term, he ran for reÿelection in the Election 1961 in November 1961, but was defeated by Diosdado Macapagal, who served as Vice-President under him, but belonged to the opposing Liberal Party - in the Philippines the President and the Vice-President are elected separately.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1961 presidential election, Macapagal ran against Garcia and defeated the incumbent president by a 55% to 45% margin. Seeking to stimulate economic development, Macapagal took the advice of supporters and allowed the Philippine peso to float on the free currency exchange market. His reform efforts were blocked by the Nacionalistas, who dominated the House of Representatives and the Senate at that time. Nonetheless, his presidency achieved growth and prosperity for the nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the most significant achievements of Macapagal as president were the abolition of tenancy and accompanying land reform program in the Agricultural Land Reform Code of 1963. He also changed the date of celebration of Philippine independence from July 4 to June 12, the latter date having been the day when in 1898, Emilio Aguinaldo declared independence from Spain). Later, Macapagal told author Stanley Karnow that the reason for the change was that American Embassy celebrations were visited more than the Filipino reception on the July 4 American independence day.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nMacapagal was defeated for re-election in 1965 by Senate President Ferdinand Marcos, a former Liberal Party ally who defected to the Nacionalista party to challenge the incumbent President.","input":"When did the philippines become an independent country?"},{"output":"American Psychiatric Association","context":"The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is the 2013 update to the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) classification and diagnostic tool. In the United States the DSM serves as a universal authority for psychiatric diagnoses. Treatment recommendations, as well as payment by health care providers, are often determined by DSM classifications, so the appearance of a new version has significant practical importance.\\r\\nThe DSM-5 was published on May 18, 2013, superseding the DSM-IV-TR, which was published in 2000. The development of the new edition began with a conference in 1999, and proceeded with the formation of a Task Force in 2007, which developed and field-tested a variety of new classifications. In most respects DSM-5 is not greatly changed from DSM-IV-TR. Notable changes include dropping Asperger syndrome as a distinct classification; loss of subtype classifications for variant forms of schizophrenia; dropping the \\"bereavement exclusion\\" for depressive disorders; a revised treatment and naming of gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria, and removing the A2 criterion for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) because its requirement for specific emotional reactions to trauma did not apply to combat veterans and first responders with PTSD. In addition, the DSM-5 is the first \\"living document\\" version of a DSM.[1]\\r\\nVarious authorities criticized the fifth edition both before and after it was formally published. Critics assert, for example, that many DSM-5 revisions or additions lack empirical support; inter-rater reliability is low for many disorders; several sections contain poorly written, confusing, or contradictory information; and the psychiatric drug industry unduly influenced the manual's content. Many of the members of work groups for the DSM-5 had conflicting interests, including ties to pharmaceutical companies.[2] Various scientists have argued that the DSM-5 forces clinicians to make distinctions that are not supported by solid evidence, distinctions that have major treatment implications, including drug prescriptions and the availability of health insurance coverage. General criticism of the DSM-5 ultimately resulted in a petition, signed by many mental health organizations, which called for outside review of DSM-5.[3]\\r\\nThis part of the article summarizes changes from DSM-IV to DSM-5. DSM-5 is divided into three Sections, using Roman numerals to designate each Section. The same organizational structure is used in this overview, e.g., Section I (immediately below) summarizes relevant changes discussed in DSM-5, Section I.\\r\\nNote that if a specific disorder (or set of disorders) cannot be seen, e.g., enuresis and other elimination disorders, mentioned in Section II: diagnostic criteria and codes (below), it means that the diagnostic criteria for those disorders did not change significantly from DSM-IV to DSM-5.\\r\\nSection I describes DSM-5 chapter organization, its change from the multiaxial system, and Section III's dimensional assessments.[4] The DSM-5 deleted the chapter that includes \\"disorders usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adolescence\\" opting to list them in other chapters.[4] A note under Anxiety Disorders says that the \\"sequential order\\" of at least some DSM-5 chapters has significance that reflects the relationships between diagnoses.[4]\\r\\nThis introductory section describes the process of DSM revision, including field trials, public and professional review, and expert review. It states its goal is to harmonize with the ICD systems and share organizational structures as much as is feasible. Concern about the categorical system of diagnosis is expressed, but the conclusion is the reality that alternative definitions for most disorders is scientifically premature.\\r\\nThe new version replaces the NOS (Not Otherwise Specified) categories with two options: other specified disorder and unspecified disorder to increase the utility to the clinician. The first allows the clinician to specify the reason that the criteria for a specific disorder are not met; the second allows the clinician the option to forgo specification.\\r\\nDSM-5 has discarded the multiaxial system of diagnosis (formerly Axis I, Axis II, Axis III), listing all disorders in Section II. It has replaced Axis IV with significant psychosocial and contextual features and dropped Axis V (Global Assessment of Functioning, known as GAF). The World Health Organization's (WHO) Disability Assessment Schedule is added to Section III (Emerging measures and models) under Assessment Measures, as a suggested, but not required, method to assess functioning.[5]\\r\\nSome of these disorders were formerly part of the chapter on early diagnosis, oppositional defiant disorder; conduct disorder; and disruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified became other specified and unspecified disruptive disorder, impulse-control disorder, and conduct disorders.[4] Intermittent explosive disorder, pyromania, and kleptomania moved to this chapter from the DSM-IV chapter \\"Impulse-Control Disorders Not Otherwise Specified\\".[4]\\r\\nDSM-5 substance dependencies include:\\r\\nThere are no more polysubstance diagnoses in DSM-5; the substance(s) must be specified.[26]\\r\\nAn alternative hybrid dimensional-categorical model for personality disorders is included to stimulate further research on this modified classification system.[32]\\r\\nThese conditions and criteria are set forth to encourage future research and are not meant for clinical use.\\r\\nIn 1999, a DSMÿ5 Research Planning Conference; sponsored jointly by APA and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), was held to set the research priorities. Research Planning Work Groups produced \\"white papers\\" on the research needed to inform and shape the DSM-5[34] and the resulting work and recommendations were reported in an APA monograph[35] and peer-reviewed literature.[36] There were six workgroups, each focusing on a broad topic: Nomenclature, Neuroscience and Genetics, Developmental Issues and Diagnosis, Personality and Relational Disorders, Mental Disorders and Disability, and Cross-Cultural Issues. Three additional white papers were also due by 2004 concerning gender issues, diagnostic issues in the geriatric population, and mental disorders in infants and young children.[37] The white papers have been followed by a series of conferences to produce recommendations relating to specific disorders and issues, with attendance limited to 25 invited researchers.[37]\\r\\nOn July 23, 2007, the APA announced the task force that would oversee the development of DSM-5. The DSM-5 Task Force consisted of 27 members, including a chair and vice chair, who collectively represent research scientists from psychiatry and other disciplines, clinical care providers, and consumer and family advocates. Scientists working on the revision of the DSM had a broad range of experience and interests. The APA Board of Trustees required that all task force nominees disclose any competing interests or potentially conflicting relationships with entities that have an interest in psychiatric diagnoses and treatments as a precondition to appointment to the task force. The APA made all task force members' disclosures available during the announcement of the task force. Several individuals were ruled ineligible for task force appointments due to their competing interests.[38]\\r\\nThe DSM-5 field trials included test-retest reliability which involved different clinicians doing independent evaluations of the same patienta common approach to the study of diagnostic reliability.[39]\\r\\nAbout 68% of DSM-V task-force members and 56% of panel members reported having ties to the pharmaceutical industry, such as holding stock in pharmaceutical companies, serving as consultants to industry, or serving on company boards.[40]\\r\\nBeginning with the fifth edition, it is intended that diagnostic guidelines revisions will be added incrementally.[41] The DSM-5 is identified with Arabic rather than Roman numerals, marking a change in how future updates will be created. Incremental updates will be identified with decimals (DSM-5.1, DSM-5.2, etc.), until a new edition is written.[42] The change reflects the intent of the APA to respond more quickly when a preponderance of research supports a specific change in the manual. The research base of mental disorders is evolving at different rates for different disorders.[41]\\r\\nRobert Spitzer, the head of the DSM-III task force, publicly criticized the APA for mandating that DSM-5 task force members sign a nondisclosure agreement, effectively conducting the whole process in secret: \\"When I first heard about this agreement, I just went bonkers. Transparency is necessary if the document is to have credibility, and, in time, you're going to have people complaining all over the place that they didn't have the opportunity to challenge anything.\\"[43] Allen Frances, chair of the DSM-IV task force, expressed a similar concern.[44]\\r\\nAlthough the APA has since instituted a disclosure policy for DSM-5 task force members, many still believe the association has not gone far enough in its efforts to be transparent and to protect against industry influence.[45] In a 2009 Point/Counterpoint article, Lisa Cosgrove, PhD and Harold J. Bursztajn, MD noted that \\"the fact that 70% of the task force members have reported direct industry tiesan increase of almost 14% over the percentage of DSM-IV task force members who had industry tiesshows that disclosure policies alone, especially those that rely on an honor system, are not enough and that more specific safeguards are needed\\".[46]\\r\\nDavid Kupfer, chair of the DSM-5 task force, and Darrel A. Regier, MD, MPH, vice chair of the task force, whose industry ties are disclosed with those of the task force,[47] countered that \\"collaborative relationships among government, academia, and industry are vital to the current and future development of pharmacological treatments for mental disorders\\". They asserted that the development of DSM-5 is the \\"most inclusive and transparent developmental process in the 60-year history of DSM\\". The developments to this new version can be viewed on the APA website.[48] Public input was requested for the first time in the history of the manual.[citation needed] During periods of public comment, members of the public could sign up at the DSM-5 website[49] and provide feedback on the various proposed changes.[50]\\r\\nIn June 2009, Allen Frances issued strongly worded criticisms of the processes leading to DSM-5 and the risk of \\"serious, subtle, (...) ubiquitous\\" and \\"dangerous\\" unintended consequences such as new \\"false 'epidemics'\\". He writes that \\"the work on DSM-V has displayed the most unhappy combination of soaring ambition and weak methodology\\" and is concerned about the task force's \\"inexplicably closed and secretive process\\".[51] His and Spitzer's concerns about the contract that the APA drew up for consultants to sign, agreeing not to discuss drafts of the fifth edition beyond the task force and committees, have also been aired and debated.[52]\\r\\nThe appointment, in May 2008, of two of the taskforce members, Kenneth Zucker and Ray Blanchard, led to an internet petition to remove them.[53] According to MSNBC, \\"The petition accuses Zucker of having engaged in 'junk science' and promoting 'hurtful theories' during his career, especially advocating the idea that children who are unambiguously male or female anatomically, but seem confused about their gender identity, can be treated by encouraging gender expression in line with their anatomy.\\"[54] According to The Gay City News, \\"Dr. Ray Blanchard, a psychiatry professor at the University of Toronto, is deemed offensive for his theories that some types of transsexuality are paraphilias, or sexual urges. In this model, transsexuality is not an essential aspect of the individual, but a misdirected sexual impulse.\\"[55] Blanchard responded, \\"Naturally, it's very disappointing to me there seems to be so much misinformation about me on the Internet. [They didn't distort] my views, they completely reversed my views.\\"[55] Zucker \\"rejects the junk-science charge, saying there 'has to be an empirical basis to modify anything' in the DSM. As for hurting people, 'in my own career, my primary motivation in working with children, adolescents and families is to help them with the distress and suffering they are experiencing, whatever the reasons they are having these struggles. I want to help people feel better about themselves, not hurt them.'\\"[54]\\r\\nIn 2011, psychologist Brent Robbins co-authored a national letter for the Society for Humanistic Psychology that brought thousands into the public debate about the DSM. Approximately 13,000 individuals and mental health professionals signed a petition in support of the letter. Thirteen other American Psychological Association divisions endorsed the petition.[56] In a November 2011 article about the debate in the San Francisco Chronicle, Robbins notes that under the new guidelines, certain responses to grief could be labeled as pathological disorders, instead of being recognized as being normal human experiences.[57] In 2012, a footnote was added to the draft text which explains the distinction between grief and depression.[58]\\r\\nThe DSM-5 has been criticized for purportedly saying nothing about the biological underpinnings of mental disorders.[59] A book-long appraisal of the DSM-5, with contributions from philosophers, historians and anthropologists, was published in 2015.[60]\\r\\nThe financial association of DSM-5 panel members with industry continues to be a concern for financial conflict of interest.[61] Of the DSM-5 task force members, 69% report having ties to the pharmaceutical industry, an increase from the 57% of DSM-IV task force members.[61]\\r\\nA 2015 essay from an Australian university criticized the DSM-5 for having poor cultural diversity, stating that recent work done in cognitive sciences and cognitive anthropology is still only accepting western psychology as the norm.[62]\\r\\nIn 2003, the Treatment and Research Advancements National Association for Personality Disorders (TARA-APD) campaigned to change the name and designation of borderline personality disorder in DSM-5.[63] The paper How Advocacy is Bringing BPD into the Light[64] reported that \\"the name BPD is confusing, imparts no relevant or descriptive information, and reinforces existing stigma.\\" Instead, it proposed the name \\"emotional regulation disorder\\" or \\"emotional dysregulation disorder.\\" There was also discussion about changing borderline personality disorder, an Axis II diagnosis (personality disorders and mental retardation), to an Axis I diagnosis (clinical disorders).[65]\\r\\nThe TARA-APD recommendations do not appear to have affected the American Psychiatric Association, the publisher of the DSM. As noted above, the DSM-5 does not employ a multi-axial diagnostic scheme, therefore the distinction between Axis I and II disorders no longer exists in the DSM nosology. The name, the diagnostic criteria for, and description of, borderline personality disorder remain largely unchanged from DSM-IV-TR.[66]\\r\\nThe British Psychological Society stated in its June 2011 response to DSM-5 draft versions, that it had \\"more concerns than plaudits\\".[67] It criticized proposed diagnoses as \\"clearly based largely on social norms, with 'symptoms' that all rely on subjective judgements... not value-free, but rather reflect[ing] current normative social expectations\\", noting doubts over the reliability, validity, and value of existing criteria, that personality disorders were not normed on the general population, and that \\"not otherwise specified\\" categories covered a \\"huge\\" 30% of all personality disorders.\\r\\nIt also expressed a major concern that \\"clients and the general public are negatively affected by the continued and continuous medicalisation of their natural and normal responses to their experiences... which demand helping responses, but which do not reflect illnesses so much as normal individual variation\\".\\r\\nThe Society suggested as its primary specific recommendation, a change from using \\"diagnostic frameworks\\" to a description based on an individual's specific experienced problems, and that mental disorders are better explored as part of a spectrum shared with normality:\\r\\nWhile some people find a name or a diagnostic label helpful, our contention is that this helpfulness results from a knowledge that their problems are recognised (in both senses of the word) understood, validated, explained (and explicable) and have some relief. Clients often, unfortunately, find that diagnosis offers only a spurious promise of such benefits. Since ÿ for example ÿ two people with a diagnosis of 'schizophrenia' or 'personality disorder' may possess no two symptoms in common, it is difficult to see what communicative benefit is served by using these diagnoses. We believe that a description of a person's real problems would suffice. Moncrieff and others have shown that diagnostic labels are less useful than a description of a person's problems for predicting treatment response, so again diagnoses seem positively unhelpful compared to the alternatives. - British Psychological Society June 2011 response\\r\\nNational Institute of Mental Health director Thomas R. Insel, MD,[68] wrote in an April 29, 2013 blog post about the DSM-5:[69]\\r\\nInsel also discussed an NIMH effort to develop a new classification system, Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), currently for research purposes only.[70] Insel's post sparked a flurry of reaction, some of which might be termed sensationalistic, with headlines such as \\"Goodbye to the DSM-V\\",[71] \\"Federal institute for mental health abandons controversial 'bible' of psychiatry\\",[72] \\"National Institute of Mental Health abandoning the DSM\\",[73] and \\"Psychiatry divided as mental health 'bible' denounced\\".[74] Other responses provided a more nuanced analysis of the NIMH Director's post.[75]\\r\\nIn May 2013, Insel, on behalf of NIMH, issued a joint statement with Jeffrey A. Lieberman, MD, president of the American Psychiatric Association,[76] that emphasized that DSM-5 \\"... represents the best information currently available for clinical diagnosis of mental disorders. Patients, families, and insurers can be confident that effective treatments are available and that the DSM is the key resource for delivering the best available care. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has not changed its position on DSM-5.\\" Insel and Lieberman say that DSM-5 and RDoC \\"represent complementary, not competing, frameworks\\" for characterizing diseases and disorders.[76] However, epistemologists of psychiatry tend to see the RDoC project as a putative revolutionary system that in the long run will try to replace the DSM, its expected early effect being a liberalization of the research criteria, with an increasing number of research centers adopting the RDoC definitions.[77]","input":"Who is the author of the dsm 5?"},{"output":"its annual Ratha yatra, or chariot festival, in which the three principal deities are pulled on huge and elaborately decorated temple cars","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Shree Jagannath Temple (Odia: ???? ??????? ??????) of Puri is an important Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Jagannath, a form of lord Vishnu, located on the eastern coast of India, at Puri in the state of Odisha. The temple is an important pilgrimage destination and one of the four great 'Char Dham' pilgrimage sites, found at India's four cardinal points. The present temple was rebuilt from the 10th century onwards, on the site of an earlier temple, and begun by King Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva, first of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Puri temple is famous for its annual Ratha yatra, or chariot festival, in which the three principal deities are pulled on huge and elaborately decorated temple cars.  These gave their name to the English term Juggernaut.  Unlike the stone and metal icons found in most Hindu temples, the image of Jagannath is made of wood and is ceremoniously replaced every twelve or nineteen years by an exact replica.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temple is sacred to all Hindus and especially in those of the Vaishnava traditions. Many great saints, such as Ramananda & Ramanuja were closely associated with the temple. Ramanuja established the Emar Mutt near the temple and the Govardhan Mutt, which is the seat of one of the four Shankaracharyas.\\r\\nIt is also showing particular significance to the followers of the Gaudiya Vaishnavism, whose founder Chaitanya Mahaprabhu,  an incarnation of Lord Krishna, appeared about 500 years ago, in the mood of a devotee to taste the sublime emotions of ecstasy by chanting the holy name of Krishna. Stalwart scholars of Puri Jagannath Kshetra like Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya (a priest and great Sanskrit scholar) and other scholars and common men followed his teachings. Even Kings and Ministers of his period became his disciples. Especially, King Prataparudra became his great admirer and ardent follower. Thus all cultures and religions infused into one in Puri following his teachings considering everybody equal sans all caste and creeds. \\r\\nIt is also a legendary fact, that in the last day of his earthly movements, his body vanished inside Lord Jagannath deity. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe God Mahaprabhu (LORD VISHNU)   Jagannath, Badathakura Balabhadra and the Devi  Subhadra constitute the main trinity of deities worshiped at the temple. The temple iconography depicts these three Gods sitting on the bejewelled platform or the Ratnabedi in the inner sanctum. The Sudarshan Chakra, deities of Madanmohan, Sridevi and Vishwadhatri are also placed on the Ratnavedi.[4]\\r\\nThe temple icons of Jagannath, Balabhadra, Subhadra and Sudarshan Chakra are made from sacred Neem logs known as Daru. Depending on the season the deities are adorned in different garbs and jewels. Worship of these deities pre-date the temple structure and may have originated in an ancient tribal shrine.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter demise of Adi Shankaracharya in late 8th century CE, his \\"Revival of Sanatan religion\\" movement, fell into wrong hands of numerous local war lords. Their only motto to destroy all established Jain temples and Buddha Vihars to loot the valuables preserved in them. \\r\\nThese mercenaries destroyed Danta Puri Vihar, a huge Buddha vihar, which preserved a valuable relic, a tooth of Lord Buddha in it. The destroyer goons were afraid to destroy it. Hence, a temporary make shift temple was built in place of Danta Puri Vihar and two deities of local tribes, were brought from nearby forest (in present Angul district forests) and placed inside temple. One of the deity was called Neel Madhav, which was black in colour. The chest portion of this deity was cut open and the holy relic was placed inside and closed like a chaste. This was called as Jivan Vastu. This process is still followed every 12 years, at the time of 'Nabo Kolebaro'. Later on, a temple was constructed by Kalinga king Indradyummna and rechristened as Lord Jagannath Puri Temple. Lord Jagannath was declared as incarnation of Lord Vishnu. One more deity was added and  rechristened as Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra, the brother and sister of Lord Jagannath. Incidentally, this temple was also destroyed by Kalapahad aka Rajiv Lochan Ray. And later on, the present magnificent temple was built thereby, by King Anantavarman Chodaganga of Eastern Ganga dynasty, in between late 11th century and early 12th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Jagannath word was not found in Vedas or in Vedantas or earlier Hindu scriptures. Hence, worshipping of Lord Jagannath was a non-vedic ritual.\\r\\nJagannath worship in the temple continued until 1558, when Odisha was attacked by the an Afghan general. Subsequently, when Ramachandra Deb established an independent kingdom at Khurda in Orissa, the temple was consecrated and the deities reinstalled.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis temple was initially a Jain temple. Pandit Nilakantha Das suggested that Jagannath was a deity of Jain origin because of the appending of Nath to many Jain Tirthankars.[7] He felt Jagannath meant the 'World personified' in the Jain context and was derived from Jinanath. Evidence of the Jain terminology such as of Kaivalya, which means moksha or salvation, is found in the Jagannath tradition.[8] Similarly, the twenty two steps leading to the temple, called the Baisi Pahacha, have been proposed as symbolic reverence for the first 22 of the 24 Tirthankaras of Jainism.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to legend, the construction of the first Jagannath temple was commissioned by King Indradyumna, son of Bharat and Sunanda, and a Malava king, mentioned in the Mahabharata and the Puranas.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legendary account as found in the Skanda-Purana, Brahma Purana and other Puranas and later Oriya works state that Lord Jagannath was originally worshipped as Lord Neela Madhaba by a Savar king (tribal chief) named Viswavasu. Having heard about the deity, King Indradyumna sent a Brahmin priest, Vidyapati to locate the deity, who was worshipped secretly in a dense forest by Viswavasu. Vidyapati tried his best but could not locate the place. But at last he managed to marry Viswavasu's daughter Lalita. At repeated request of Vidyapti, Viswavasu took his son-in-law blind folded to a cave where Lord Neela Madhaba was worshipped.\\r\\n\\r\\nVidyapati was very intelligent. He dropped mustard seeds on the ground on the way. The seeds germinated after a few days, which enabled him to find out the cave later on. On hearing from him, King Indradyumna proceeded immediately to Odra desha (Odisha) on a pilgrimage to see and worship the Deity. But the deity had disappeared. The king was disappointed. The Deity was hidden in sand. The king was determined not to return without having a darshan of the deity and observed fast unto death at Mount Neela, Then a celestial voice cried 'thou shalt see him.'  Afterward, the king performed a horse sacrifice and built a magnificent temple for Vishnu. Sri Narasimha Murti brought by Narada was installed in the temple. During sleep, the king had a vision of Lord Jagannath. Also an astral voice directed him to receive the fragrant tree on the seashore and make idols out of it. Accordingly, the king got the image of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra, Subhadra and Chakra Sudarshan made out of the wood of the divine tree and installed them in the temple.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndradyumna's prayer to Lord Brahma\\r\\n\\r\\nKing Indradyumna put up for Jagannath the tallest monument of the world. It was 1,000 cubits high. He invited Lord Brahma, the cosmic creator, consecrate the temple and the images.[11]\\r\\nBrahma came all the way from Heaven for this purpose. Seeing the temple he was immensely pleased with him. Brahma asked Indradyumna as to in what way can he (Brahma) fulfill the king's desire, since was very much pleased with him for his having put the most beautiful Temple for Lord Vishnu. With folded hands, Indradyumna said, \\"My Lord if you are really pleased with me, kindly bless me with one thing, and it is that I should be issueless and that I should be the last member of my family.\\" In case anybody left alive after him, he would only take pride as the owner of the temple and would not work for the society.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe traditional story concerning the origins of the Lord Jagannath temple is that here the original image of Jagannath (a deity form of Vishnu) at the end of Treta yuga manifested near a banyan tree, near seashore in the form of an Indranila mani or the Blue Jewel.  It was so dazzling that it could grant instant moksha, so the God Dharma or Yama wanted to hide it in the earth, and was successful. In Dvapara Yuga King Indradyumna of Malwa wanted to find that mysterious image and to do so he performed harsh penances to obtain his goal. Vishnu then instructed him to go to the Puri seashore and find a floating log to make an image from its trunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King found the log of wood. He did a yajna from which God Yajna Nrisimha appeared and instructed that Narayana should be made as fourfold expansion, i.e. Paramatma as Vasudeva, his Vyuha as Samkarshana, Yogamaya as Subhadra, and his Vibhava asSudarsana. Vishwakarma appeared in the form of an artisan and prepared images of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra from the tree.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this log, radiant with light was seen floating in the sea, Narada told the king to make three idols out of it and place them in a pavilion. Indradyumna got Visvakarma, the architect of Gods, to build a magnificent temple to house the idols and Vishnu himself appeared in the guise of a carpenter to make the idols on condition that he was to be left undisturbed until he finished the work.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut just after two weeks, the Queen became very anxious. She took the carpenter to be dead as no sound came from the temple. Therefore, she requested the king to open the door. Thus, they went to see Vishnu at work at which the latter abandoned his work leaving the idols unfinished. The idol was devoid of any hands. But a divine voice told Indradyumana to install them in the temple. It has also been widely believed that in spite of the idol being without hands, it can watch over the world and be its lord. Thus the idiom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temple annals, the Madala Panji records that the Jagannath temple at Puri has been invaded and plundered eighteen times.[13] The invasion by Raktabahu has been considered the first invasion on the temple by the Madalapanji. In 1692, Mughal emperor Aurangzeb ordered the demolition of the temple, but the local Mughal officials who came to carry out the job were somehow bribed out of it. The temple was merely closed. It was re-opened after Aurangzebs death in 1707.\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-Hindus are totally barred from entry. Even Hindus from other countries are not allowed to enter, if they look different from average Indians. There is a Temple Management Committee, but nearly seven thousand Servitors (Pandas), mostly illiterate and superstitious, rule the roost.   \\r\\nTemple has 4 entrances in all directions. Temple security is selective regarding who is allowed entry. Practicing Hindus of non-Indian descent are excluded from the premises.[14] Visitors not allowed entry  may view the precincts from the roof of the nearby Raghunandan Library and pay their respects to the image of God Jagannath known as Patitapavana at the main entrance to the temple.[15] There is some evidence that this came into force following a series of invasions by foreigners into the temple and surrounding area. Buddhist, and Jain groups are allowed into the temple compound if they are able to prove their Indian ancestry.[16] The temple has slowly started allowing Hindus of non-Indian origin into the area, after an incident in which 3 Balinese Hindus were denied entry, even though Bali is 90% Hindu.[17] Recently hon'ble Supreme Court in its order on 5th July 2018 said that it cannot be disputed the aspect of List III of seventh schedule of Constitution of India, hence State and Central Govt. must intervene to remove the practice. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe temple remains open from 5 am to 12 midnight. Unlike many other temples devotees can go behind the idols (go round the idols). All devotees are allowed to go right up to the deities during the Sahana Mela without paying any fees. The Sahana mela or the public darshan is usually following the abakasha puja between around 7 to 8 am in the morning.[18] Special darshan or Parimanik darshan is when devotees on paying 50 Rupees are allowed right up to the deities. Parimanik darshan happens after the dhupa pujas at around 10 am, 1 pm and 8 pm . At all other times devotees can view the deities from some distance for free. The rathyatra occurs every year some time in the month of July. 2 or 6 weeks before Rathyatra (depending upon the year) there is a ritual of Lord undergoing \\"Bhukaar\\" (sick) hence the idols are not on \\"Darshan\\". Devotees to make a note of this before they plan to visit the lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting from Lord Jagannath himself, history has it that he was a tribal deity, adorned by the Sabar people, as a symbol of Narayan. Another legend claims him to be Nilamadhava, an image of Narayana made of blue stone and worshipped by the aboriginals. He was brought to Nilagiri (blue mountain) or Nilachala and installed there as Shri Jagannath in company with Balabhadra and Subhadra. The images made of wood are also claimed to have their distant linkage with the aboriginal system of worshipping wooden poles. To cap it all the Daitapatis, who have a fair share of responsibilities to perform rituals of the Temple, are claimed to be descendants of the aboriginals or hill tribes of Odisha. So we may safely claim that the beginning of the cultural history of Shrikshetra is found in the fusion of Hindu and Tribal Cultures. This has been accepted as a facet of our proud heritage. The three deities came to be claimed as the symbols of Samyak Darshan, Samyak Jnana and Samyak Charita usually regarded as Triratha (of the Jain cult), an assimilation of which leads to Moksha (salvation) or the ultimate bliss...\\r\\n\\r\\nJagannath is worshipped as Vishnu or Narayana or Krishna and Lord Balabhadra as Shesha. Simultaneously, the deities are regarded as the bhairava with Vimala (the devi or the consort of Shiva) installed in the campus of the temple. So ultimately we find a fusion of Saivism, Shaktism and Vaishnavism of the Hindu religion with Jainism and  up to an extent Buddhism in the culture of Jagannath and the cultural tradition so reverently held together in Shrikshetra.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the renowned acharyas including Madhvacharya have been known to visit this kshetra. Adi Shankara established his Govardhana matha here.  There is also evidence that Guru Nanak, Kabir, Tulsidas, Ramanujacharya, and Nimbarkacharya  had visited this place. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu of Gaudiya Vaishnavism stayed here for 24 years, establishing that the love of God can be spread by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra. Srimad Vallabhacharya visited Jagannath Puri and performed a 7-day recitation of Srimad Bhagvat. His sitting place is still famous as \\"baithakji.\\" It confirms his visit to Puri.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nA famous incident took place when Vallabhachrya visited. There was a discourse being held between the Brahmins and 4 questions were asked. Who is the highest of Gods, What is the highest of mantras, What is the highest scripture and What is the highest service. The discourse went on for many days with many schools of thought. Finally Shri Vallabh said to ask Lord Jagannath to confirm Shri Vallabh's answers. A pen and paper were left in the inner sanctum. After some time, the doors were opened and 4 answers were written. 1) The Son of Devaki (Krishna) is the God of Gods 2) His name is the highest of mantras 3) His song is the highest scripture (Bhagavat Geeta) 4) Service to Him is the Highest service. The king was shocked and declared Shri Vallabh the winner of the discourse. Some of the pandits who participated became jealous of Shri Vallabh and wanted to test Him. The next day was Ekadashi, a fasting day where one must fast from grains. The pandits gave Shri Vallabh rice Prasad of Shri Jagannathji (The temple is famous for this). If Shri Vallabh ate it, He would break His vow of fasting but if He did not take it, He would disrespect Lord Jagannath. Shri Vallabh accepted the prasad in his hand and spent the rest of the day and night explaining slokas of the greatness of Prasad and ate the rice the next morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temple is one of the holiest Hindu Char Dham (four divine sites) sites comprising  Rameswaram, Badrinath, Puri and Dwarka.[20] Though the origins are not clearly known, the Advaita school of Hinduism propagated by Sankaracharya, who created Hindu monastic institutions across India, attributes the origin of Char Dham to the seer.[21]  The four monasteries lie across the four corners of India and their attendant temples are Badrinath Temple at Badrinath in the North, Jagannath Temple at Puri in the East, Dwarakadheesh Temple at Dwarka in the West and Ramanathaswamy Temple at Rameswaram in the South.  Though ideologically the temples are divided between the sects of Hinduism, namely Saivism and Vaishnavism, the Char Dham pilgrimage is an all Hindu affair.[22] There are four abodes in Himalayas called Chota Char Dham (Chota meaning small): Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri - all of these lie at the foot hills of Himalayas [23] The name Chota was added during the mid of 20th century to differentiate the original Char Dhams.[citation needed] The journey across the four cardinal points in India is considered sacred by Hindus who aspire to visit these temples once in their lifetime.[24] Traditionally the trip starts at the eastern end from Puri, proceeding in clockwise direction in a manner typically followed for circumambulation in Hindu temples.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe huge temple complex covers an area of over 400,000 square feet (37,000?m2), and is surrounded by a high fortified wall.\\r\\nThis 20 feet (6.1?m) high wall is known as Meghanada Pacheri.[25] Another wall known as kurma bedha surrounds the main temple.[26]\\r\\nIt contains at least 120 temples and shrines. With its sculptural richness and fluidity of the Oriya style of temple architecture, it is one of the most magnificent monuments of India.[27]\\r\\nThe temple has four distinct sectional structures, namely -\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main temple is a curvilinear temple and crowning the top is the 'srichakra' (an eight spoked wheel) of Vishnu. Also known as the \\"Nilachakra\\", it is made out of Ashtadhatu and is considered sacrosanct.[29]\\r\\nAmong the existing temples in Orissa, the temple of Shri Jagannath is the highest. The temple tower was built on a raised platform of stone and, rising to 214 feet (65?m) above the inner sanctum where the deities reside, dominates the surrounding landscape. The pyramidal roofs of the surrounding temples and adjoining halls, or mandapas, rise in steps toward the tower like a ridge of mountain peaks.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nila Chakra (Blue Discus) is the discus mounted on the top shikhar of the Jagannath Temple. As per custom, everyday a different flag is waved on the Nila Chakra. The flag hoisted on the Nila Cakra is called the Patita Pavana (Purifier of the Fallen) and is equivalent to the image of the deities placed in the sanctum sanctorum.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nila Chakra is a disc with eight Navagunjaras carved on the outer circumference, with all facing towards the flagpost above. It is made of alloy of eight metals (Asta-dhatu) and is 3.5 Metres (11 feet and 8?inches) high with a circumference of about 11 metres (36?feet).[32] During the year 2010, the Nila Chakra was repaired and restored by the Archaeological Survey of India.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nila Chakra is distinct from the Sudarshana chakra which has been placed with the deities in the inner sanctorum.\\r\\n\\r\\nNila Chakra is the most revered iconic symbol in the Jagannath cult. The Nila Chakra is the only physical object whose markings are used as sacrament and considered sacred in Jagannath worship. It symbolizes protection by Shri Jagannath.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Singahdwara, which in Sanskrit means The Lion Gate, is one of the four gates to the temple and forms the Main entrance. The Singhadwara is so named because two huge statues of crouching lions exist on either side of the entrance. The gate faces east opening on to the Bada Danda or the Grand Road.[33] The Baisi Pahacha or the flight of twenty two steps leads into the temple complex. An idol of Jagannath known as Patitapavana, which in Sanskrit, means the \\"Saviour of the downtrodden and the fallen\\" is painted on the right side of the entrance. In ancient times when untouchables were not allowed inside the temple, they could pray to Patita Pavana. The statues of the two guards to the temple Jaya and Vijaya stand on either side of the doorway.[34] Just before the commencement of the Rath Yatra the idols of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra are taken out of the temple through this gate. On their return from the Gundicha Temple they have to ceremonially placate Goddess Mahalakshmi, whose statue is carved atop the door, for neglecting to take her with them on the Yatra. Only then the Goddess allows them permission to enter the temple. A magnificent sixteen-sided monolithic pillar known as the Arun stambha stands in front of the main gate. This pillar has an idol of Arun, the charioteer of the Sun God Surya, on its top. One significant thing about Arun stambha is that prior it was located in the Konark Sun temple,[35][36] later, the Maratha guru Brahmachari Gosain brought this pillar from Konark.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from the Singhadwara, which is the main entrance to the temple, there are three other entrances facing north, south and west. They are named after the sculptures of animals guarding them. The other entrances are the Hathidwara or the Elephant Gate, the Vyaghradwara or the Tiger Gate and the Ashwadwara or the Horse Gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are numerous smaller temples and shrines within the Temple complex where active worship is regularly conducted. The Vimala Temple (Bimala Temple) is considered one of the most important of the Shaktipeeths marks the spot where the Goddess Sati's navel fell. It is located near Rohini Kund in the temple complex. Until food offered to Jagannath is offered to Goddess Vimala it is not considered Mahaprasad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temple of Mahalakshmi has an important role in rituals of the main temple. It is said that preparation of naivedya as offering for Jagannath is supervised by Mahalakshmi. The Kanchi Ganesh Temple is dedicated to Uchchhishta Ganapati. Tradition says the King of Kanchipuram (Kanchi) in ancient times gifted the idol, when Gajapati Purushottama Deva married Padmavati, the kanchi princess. There are other shrines namely Muktimandap, Surya, Saraswati, Bhuvaneshwari, Narasimha, Rama, Hanuman and Eshaneshwara.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many Mandapas or Pillared halls on raised platforms within the temple complex meant for religious congregations. The most prominent is the Mukti Mandapa the congregation hall of  the holy seat of selected learned Brahmins.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nHere important decisions regarding conduct of daily worship and festivals are taken. The Dola Mandapa is noteworthy for a beautifully carved stone Torana or arch which is used for constructing a swing for the annual Dol Yatra festival. During the festival the idol of Dologobinda is placed on the swing. The Snana Bedi is a rectangular stone platform where idols of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra are placed for ceremonial bathing during the annual Snana Yatra.\\r\\n\\r\\nDaily offerings are made to the Lord six times a day. These include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mahaprasad of Lord Jagannath are distributed amongst the devotees near the Ratnavedi inside the frame of Phokaria, which is being drawn by the Puja pandas using Muruj, except for the Gopal Ballav Bhog and Bhog Mandap Bhoga which are distributed in the Anabsar Pindi & Bhoga Mandap respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temple's kitchen is considered as the largest kitchen in the world.[27]\\r\\n[40]\\r\\n[41]\\r\\n[42]\\r\\nTradition maintains that all food cooked in the temple kitchens are supervised by the Goddess Mahalakshmi, the empress of Srimandir herself. It is said that if the food prepared has any fault in it, a shadow dog appears near the temple kitchen. The temple cooks, or Mahasuaras, take this as a sign of displeasure of Mahalakshmi with the food, which is, then, promptly buried and a new batch cooked.[43]\\r\\nAll food is cooked following rules as prescribed by Hindu religious texts, the food cooked is pure vegetarian without using onions and garlic.[44] Cooking is done only in earthen pots with water drawn from two special wells near the kitchen called Ganga and Yamuna. There are a total of 56 varieties of naivedhyas offered to the deities, near Ratnabedi as well as in Bhoga Mandap on five particular Muhurta. The most awaited Prasad is Kotho Bhoga or Abadha, offered at mid-day at around 1 pm, depending upon temple rituals. The food after being offered to Jagannath is distributed in reasonable portions as Mahaprasad, which is considered to be divine by the devotees in the Ananda Bazar (an open market, located to the North-east of the Singhadwara inside the Temple complex).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are elaborate daily worship services. There are many festivals each year attended by millions of people. The most important festival is the Rath Yatra or the Chariot festival in June. This spectacular festival includes a procession of three huge chariots bearing the idols of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra through the Bada Danda meaning the Grand Avenue of Puri till their final destination the Gundicha Temple.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly European observers told tales of devotees being crushed under the wheels of these chariots, whether by accident or even as a form of meritorious suicide akin to suttee.  These reports gave rise to the loan word juggernaut suggesting an immense, unstoppable, threatening entity or process operated by fanatics.\\r\\nMany festivals like Dol Yatra in spring and Jhulan Yatra in monsoon are celebrated by temple every year. Pavitrotsava and Damanaka utsava are celebrated as per panchanga or panjika.There are special ceremonies in the month of Kartika and Pausha.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe annual shodasha dinatmaka or 16 day puja beginning 8 days prior to Mahalaya of Ashwin month for Goddess Vimala and ending on Vijayadashami, is of great importance, in which both the utsava murty of lord Madanmohan and Vimala take part.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Akshaya Tritiya every year the Chandan Yatra festival marks the commencement of the construction of the Chariots of the Rath Yatra.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Purnima of the month of Jyestha the Gods are ceremonially bathed and decorated every year on the occasion of Snana Yatra.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiterally means vacation. Every year, the main idols of Jagannath, Balabhadra, Subhadra & Sudarshan after the holy Snana Yatra on the jyestha purnima, go to a secret altar named Anavasara Ghar where they remain for the next dark fortnight (Krishna paksha). Hence devotees are not allowed to view them. Instead of this devotees go to nearby place Brahmagiri to see their beloved lord in the form of four handed form Alarnath a form of Vishnu.[47]\\r\\nThen people get the first glimpse of lord on the day before Rath Yatra, which is called Navayouvana. It is said that the Gods fall in fever after taking a huge bath and they are treated by the special servants named, Daitapatis for 15 days. During this period cooked food is not offered to the deities.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jagannath triad are usually worshiped in the sanctum of the temple at Puri, but once during the month of Asadha (Rainy Season of Orissa, usually falling in month of June or July), they are brought out onto the Bada Danda (main street of Puri) and travel (3?km) to the Shri Gundicha Temple, in huge chariots (ratha), allowing the public to have dar?ana (Holy view). This festival is known as Rath Yatra, meaning the journey (yatra) of the chariots (ratha). The Rathas are huge wheeled wooden structures, which are built anew every year and are pulled by the devotees. The chariot for Jagannath is approximately 45 feet high and 35 feet square and takes about 2 months to construct.[49] The artists and painters of Puri decorate the cars and paint flower petals and other designs on the wheels, the wood-carved charioteer and horses, and the inverted lotuses on the wall behind the throne.[50] The huge chariots of Jagannath pulled during Rath Yatra is the etymological origin of the English word Juggernaut.[51] The Ratha-Yatra is also termed as the Shri Gundicha yatra.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most significant ritual associated with the Ratha-Yatra is the chhera pahara. During the festival, the Gajapati King wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots in the Chera Pahara (sweeping with water) ritual. The Gajapati King cleanses the road before the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder with utmost devotion.  As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in the Kalingan kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannath. This ritual signified that under the lordship of Jagannath, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign Gajapati King and the most humble devotee.[52]\\r\\nChera pahara is held on two days, on the first day of the Ratha Yatra, when the deities are taken to garden house at Mausi Maa Temple and again on the last day of the festival, when the deities are ceremoniously brought back to the Shri Mandir.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs per another ritual, when the deities are taken out from the Shri Mandir to the Chariots in Pahandi vijay.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Ratha Yatra, the three deities are taken from the Jagannath Temple in the chariots to the Gundicha Temple, where they stay for nine days. Thereafter, the deities again ride the chariots back to Shri Mandir in bahuda yatra. On the way back, the three chariots halt at the Mausi Maa Temple and the deities are offered Poda Pitha, a kind of baked cake which are generally consumed by the Odisha people only.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe observance of the Rath Yatra of Jagannath dates back to the period of the Puranas. Vivid descriptions of this festival are found in Brahma Purana, Padma Purana, and Skanda Purana. Kapila Samhita also refers to Rath Yatra. In Moghul period also, King Ramsingh of Jaipur, Rajasthan has been described as organizing the Rath Yatra in the 18th Century. In Orissa, Kings of Mayurbhanj and Parlakhemundi were organizing the Rath Yatra, though the most grand festival in terms of scale and popularity takes place at Puri.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, Starza[53] notes that the ruling Ganga dynasty instituted the Rath Yatra at the completion of the great temple around 1150 AD. This festival was one of those Hindu festivals that was reported to the Western world very early. Friar Odoric of Pordenone visited India in 1316-1318, some 20 years after Marco Polo had dictated the account of his travels while in a Genoese prison.[54] In his own account of 1321, Odoric reported how the people put the \\"idols\\" on chariots, and the King and Queen and all the people drew them from the \\"church\\" with song and music.[55] [56]\\r\\n\\r\\nCelebrated on  Asadha Trayodashi.[57]\\r\\nNiladri Bije is the concluding day of Ratha yatra. On this day deities return to the ratna bedi.[58]\\r\\n[59]\\r\\nLord Jagannath offers Rasgulla to Goddess Laxmi to enter into the temple.[60][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nCelebrated for 16 days from Ashwina Krushna dwitiya to Vijayadashami.[62]\\r\\nAs per tradition, the idol of Madhaba, along with the idol of Goddess Durga (known as Durgamadhaba), is taken on a tour of the temple premises. The tour within the temple is observed for the first eight days. For the next eight days, the idols are taken outside the temple on a palanquin to the nearby Narayani temple situated in the Dolamandapa lane. After their worship, they are brought back to the temple.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most grandiloquent events associated with the Lord Jagannath, Nabakalabera takes place when one lunar month of Ashadha is followed by another lunar month of Aashadha. This can take place in 8, 12 or even 18 years. Literally meaning the \\"New Body\\" (Nava = New, Kalevar = Body), the festival is witnessed by as millions of people and the budget for this event exceeds $500,000. The event involves installation of new images in the temple and burial of the old ones in the temple premises at Koili Vaikuntha. The idols that are currently being worshipped in the temple premises were installed in the year 1996.Next ceremony will be held on 2015.[64] More than 3 million devotees are expected to visit the temple during the Nabakalevara of 2015[65] making it one of the most visited festivals in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Jagannath is the Purushottama as per the scripture, Skanda Purana. In order to teach human beings how to lead a life full of virtue, he has taken the form of Saguna Brahman or Darubrahman. He is the best brother to his siblings, Lord Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra. He is the best husband to Goddess Mahalaxmi (Sri and Bhu forms). The most noteworthy aspect is still in the month of Margashirsha, on three consecutive days during amavasya he does Shraddha to his parents (Kashyapa-Aditi, Dasharatha-Kaushalya, Vasudeva-Devaki, Nanda-Yashoda), along with the king Indradyumna and queen Gundicha. As a master he enjoys every comfort daily and in various festivals. He grants all wishes to his subjects, and those who surrender before him he takes the utmost care of.\\r\\n\\r\\nPuri is one of the fascinating littoral districts of Odisha. The Cultural heritage of Puri with its long recorded history has its beginnings in the third century BC. The monuments, religious sanctity, and way of life of the people with their rich tradition is the cultural heart of Odisha. Indeed, Puri is considered the cultural capital of Odisha. The culture here flourished with its manifold activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe District has the happy conglomerate of different religions, sects and faith. In the course of history, Hindu, Buddhist, Jaina, Muslim, Christian, and Sikh are found here in the District.\\r\\n\\r\\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu, an incarnation of Lord Krishna, appeared 500 years ago, in the mood of a devotee to taste the sublime emotions of ecstasy by chanting the holy name of Krishna. Stalwart scholars of Puri like Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya (a priest & great Sanskrit pandit) and others followed His teachings. Even kings and ministers of His period became His disciples. Especially King Prataparudra became His great admirer and ardent follower. Thus all cultures and religion became one in Puri after his teachings were given to all with no consideration  of caste and creed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter independence, the State Government, with a view to getting better administrative system,  passed \\" The Puri Shri Jagannath Temple (Administration) Act, 1952.[66] It contained provisions to prepare the Record of Rights and duties of Sevayats and such other persons connected with the system of worship and management of the temple. Subsequently Shri Jagannath Temple Act, 1955 \\" was enacted to reorganize the management system of the affair of the temple and its properties.\\r\\n\\r\\nGajapati Maharaj Shri Dibyasingha Deb is the \\"adhyasevak\\" (chief servitor) of the temple.[67][68] He took the role in 1970 at the age of 17, after the death of his father, Birakishore Deb, then the Maharaja of Puri.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe security at the 12th century Jagannath Temple has increased ahead of Ratha Yatra, the homecoming festival of the deities of Jagannath temple.\\r\\nIn the wake of terror alert on 27 June 2012, the security forces were increased to ensure smooth functioning of the crowded Ratha Yatra and Suna Besha.[70]","input":"What is the speciality of puri jagannath temple?"},{"output":"Turbine Fuel, Low Volatility, JP-7, commonly known as JP-7, was referred to as Jet Propellant 7","context":"Turbine Fuel, Low Volatility, JP-7, commonly known as JP-7, was referred to as Jet Propellant 7, to MIL-DTL-38219[2] is a specific jet fuel that was developed for the United States Air Force (USAF), for use in its supersonic military aircraft that required a jet fuel with a high flash point, and high thermal stability. JP-7 is the fuel that was developed, which was required by the Pratt & Whitney J58 (JT11D-20) turbojet engines, which was used primarily in the now retired Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.[1] During flight, the SR-71 could attain speeds in excess of Mach 3+, which was the most efficient cruising speed for the J58 engines. However, very high skin temperatures are generated at this speed due to friction with the air. A new jet fuel was needed that was not affected by the heat, so JP-7 jet fuel was developed for this purpose.\\r\\nThe Boeing X-51 Waverider also uses JP-7 fuel to run the Pratt & Whitney SJY61 scramjet engine, with fuel capacity of some 270 pounds (120?kg).[3] As with the SR-71, the X-51A design super-cools this fuel (cooled by extended subsonic flight in the stratosphere; prior to acceleration to supersonic speeds); then, when in supersonic flight, the fuel is heated by its circulation through heat exchangers which transfer to it the heat load of the interior spaces of the airframe. The fuel is then pumped through rotating mechanical parts of the engines and auxiliary mechanical equipment, providing both lubrication and cooling. Finally, at a temperature of nearly 550?F (290?C), it is pumped into the fuel nozzles of the engines.[4]\\r\\nJP-7 is a compound mixture composed primarily of hydrocarbons; including alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkylbenzenes, indanes/tetralins, and naphthalenes; with addition of fluorocarbons to increase its lubricant properties, an oxidizing agent to make it burn more efficiently, and a cesium-containing compound known as A-50, which is to aid in disguising the radar and infrared signatures of the exhaust plume. The SR-71 Blackbirds used approximately 36,000ÿ44,000 pounds (16,000ÿ20,000?kg) of fuel per hour of flight.[citation needed]\\r\\nJP-7 is unusual, in that it is not a conventional distillate fuel, but is created from special blending stocks in order to have very low (<3%) concentration of highly volatile components like benzene or toluene, and almost no sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen impurities. It has a low vapor pressure, and high thermal oxidation stability. The fuel must operate across a wide range of temperatures: from near freezing at high altitude, to the high temperatures of the airframe and engine parts that are being cooled by it at high speed. Its volatility must be low enough to make it flash-resistant at these high temperatures.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe very low volatility, and relative unwillingness of JP-7 to be ignited, required triethylborane (TEB) to be injected into the engine in order to initiate combustion, and allow afterburner operation in flight. The SR-71 had a limited capacity for TEB, and therefore had a limited number of available 'shots' of TEB (usually 16) for re-starts, and those had to be managed carefully on long-duration flights with multiple stages of relatively low-altitude air refueling and normal high-altitude cruise flight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShell Oil developed JP-7 in 1955. Company vice president Jimmy Doolittle arranged for Shell to develop the fuel for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and United States Air Force's (USAF) secret Lockheed U-2 spy plane, which needed a low-volatility fuel that would not evaporate at high altitude. Manufacturing several hundred thousand gallons of the new fuel required the petroleum byproducts Shell normally used to make its Flit insecticide, causing a nationwide shortage of that product that year.[5]","input":"What kind of fuel does the sr-71 use?"},{"output":"passport cards","context":"","input":"What can be used as proof of identity?"},{"output":"adopted on December 15, 1791","context":"","input":"When was the second amendment of the constitution?"},{"output":"18 May 1974","context":"Smiling Buddha[a] (MEA designation: Pokhran-I) was the assigned code name of India's first successful nuclear bomb test on 18 May 1974.[1] The bomb was detonated on the army base, Pokhran Test Range (PTR), in Rajasthan by the Indian Army under the supervision of several key Indian generals.[2]\\r\\nPokhran-I was also the first confirmed nuclear weapons test by a nation outside the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.[3] Officially, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) claimed this test was a \\"peaceful nuclear explosion\\", but it was an accelerated nuclear programme.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia started its own nuclear programme in 1944 when Homi J. Bhabha founded the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.[4] Physicist Raja Ramanna played an essential role in nuclear weapons technology research; he expanded and supervised scientific research on nuclear weapons and was the first directing officer of the small team of scientists that supervised and carried out the test.[4]\\r\\nAfter Indian independence from the British Empire, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru authorised the development of a nuclear programme headed by Homi Bhabha. The Atomic Energy Act of 1948 focused on peaceful development.[4] India was heavily involved in the development of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but ultimately opted not to sign it.[5]\\r\\nWe must develop this atomic energy quite apart from war ÿ indeed I think we must develop it for the purpose of using it for peaceful purposes. ... Of course, if we are compelled as a nation to use it for other purposes, possibly no pious sentiments of any of us will stop the nation from using it that way.\\r\\nIn 1954, Bhabha steered the nuclear programme in the direction of weapons design and production. Two important infrastructure projects were commissioned. The first established Trombay Atomic Energy Establishment at Mumbai (Bombay). The other created a governmental secretariat, Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), of which Bhabha was the first secretary. From 1954 to 1959, the nuclear programme grew swiftly. By 1958, the DAE had one-third of the defence budget for research purposes.[4] In 1954, India reached a verbal understanding with Canada and the United States under the Atoms for Peace programme; Canada and the United States ultimately agreed to provide and establish the CIRUS research reactor also at Trombay. The acquisition of CIRUS was a watershed event in nuclear proliferation with the understanding between India and the United States that the reactor would be used for peaceful purposes only.[4] CIRUS was an ideal facility to develop a plutonium device, and therefore Nehru refused to accept nuclear fuel from Canada and started the programme to develop an indigenous nuclear fuel cycle.[4]\\r\\nIn July 1958, Nehru authorised \\"Project Phoenix\\" to build a reprocessing plant with a capacity of 20 tons of fuel a year ÿ a size to match the production capacity of CIRUS[clarification needed].[4] The plant used the PUREX process and was designed by the American firm Vitro International.[4] Construction of the plutonium plant began at Trombay on 27 March 1961, and it was commissioned in mid-1964.[4]\\r\\nThe nuclear programme continued to mature, and by 1960, Nehru made the critical decision to move the programme into production.[4] At about the same time, Nehru held discussions with the American firm Westinghouse Electric to construct India's first nuclear power plant in Tarapur, Maharashtra.[4] Kenneth Nichols, a US Army engineer, recalls from a meeting[6] with Nehru, \\"it was that time when Nehru turned to Bhabha and asked Bhabha for the timeline of the development of a nuclear weapon\\". Bhabha estimated he would need about a year to accomplish the task.[4]\\r\\nBy 1962, the nuclear programme was still developing, but at a slow rate. Nehru was distracted by the Sino-Indian War, during which India lost territory to China.[4] Nehru turned to the Soviet Union for help, but the Soviet Union was preoccupied with the Cuban Missile Crisis.[4] The Soviet Politburo turned down Nehru's request for arms and continued backing the Chinese.[4] India concluded that the Soviet Union was an unreliable ally, and this conclusion strengthened India's determination to create a nuclear deterrent.[4] Design work began in 1965 under Bhabha and proceeded under Raja Ramanna who took over the programme after the former's death.[4]\\r\\nBhabha was now aggressively lobbying for nuclear weapons and made several speeches on Indian radio.[7] In 1964, Bhabha told the Indian public via Indian radio that \\"such nuclear weapons are remarkably cheap\\" and supported his arguments by referring to the economical cost of American nuclear testing programme (Plowshare).[7] Bhabha stated to the politicians that a 10 kt device would cost around $350,000, and $600,000 for a 2 mt.[7] From this, he estimated that \\"a stockpile\\" of around 50 atomic bombs would cost under $21 million and a stockpile of 50 two-megaton hydrogen bombs would cost around $31.5 million.\\"[7] Bhabha did not realise, however, that the U.S. Plowshare cost-figures were produced by a vast industrial complex costing tens of billions of dollars, which had already manufactured nuclear weapons numbering in the tens of thousands.[7] The delivery systems for nuclear weapons typically cost several times as much as the weapons themselves.[7]\\r\\nThe nuclear programme was partially slowed down when Lal Bahadur Shastri became the prime minister.[8] In 1965, Shastri faced another war with Pakistan. Shastri appointed physicist Vikram Sarabhai as the head of the nuclear programme but because of his Gandhian beliefs Sarabhai directed the programme toward peaceful purposes rather than military development.[8]\\r\\nIn 1967, Indira Gandhi became the prime minister and work on the nuclear programme resumed with renewed vigour.[4] Homi Sethna, a chemical engineer, played a significant role in the development of weapon-grade plutonium while Ramanna designed and manufactured the whole nuclear device.[8] The first nuclear bomb project did not employ more than 75 scientists because of its sensitivity.[8] The nuclear weapons programme was now directed towards the production of plutonium rather than uranium.[9]\\r\\nIn 1968ÿ69, P. K. Iyengar visited the Soviet Union with three colleagues and toured the nuclear research facilities at Dubna, Russia.[9] During his visit, Iyengar was impressed by the plutonium-fueled pulsed fast reactor.[9] Upon his return to India, Iyengar set about developing plutonium reactors approved by the Indian political leadership in January 1969.[9] The secret plutonium plant was known as Purnima,[10] and construction began in March 1969. The plant's leadership included Iyengar, Ramanna, Homi Sethna, and Sarabhai. Sarabhai's presence indicates that, with or without formal approval, the work on nuclear weapons at Trombay had been commenced.[9]\\r\\nIndia continued to harbour ambivalent feelings about nuclear weapons, and accorded low priority to their production until the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. In December 1971, Richard Nixon sent a carrier battle group led by the USS?Enterprise?(CVN-65) into the Bay of Bengal in an attempt to intimidate India. The Soviet Union responded by sending a submarine armed with nuclear missiles from Vladivostok to trail the US task force. The Soviet response demonstrated the deterrent value and significance of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile submarines to Indira Gandhi.[11] India gained the military and political initiative over Pakistan after acceding to the treaty that divided Pakistan into two different political entities.[9]\\r\\nOn 7 September 1972, near the peak of her post-war popularity, Indira Gandhi authorised the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) to manufacture a nuclear device and prepare it for a test.[5] Although the Indian Army was not fully involved in the nuclear testing, the army's highest command was kept fully informed of the test preparations.[9] The preparations were carried out under the watchful eyes of the Indian political leadership, with civilian scientists assisting the Indian Army.[2]\\r\\nThe device was formally called the \\"Peaceful Nuclear Explosive\\", but it was usually referred to as the Smiling Buddha.[2] The device was detonated on 18 May 1974, Buddha Jayanti (a festival day in India marking the birth of Gautama Buddha).[12] Indira Gandhi maintained tight control of all aspects of the preparations of the Smiling Buddha test, which was conducted in extreme secrecy; besides Gandhi, only advisers Parmeshwar Haksar and Durga Dhar were kept informed.[2] Scholar Raj Chengappa asserts the Indian Defence Minister Jagjivan Ram was not provided with any knowledge of this test and came to learn of it only after it was conducted.[13] Swaran Singh, the Minister of External Affairs, was given 48 hours advance notice.[14] The Indira Gandhi administration employed no more than 75 civilian scientists while General G. G. Bewoor, Indian army chief, and the commander of Indian Western Command were the only military commanders kept informed.[2]\\r\\nThe head of this entire nuclear bomb project was the director of the BARC, Raja Ramanna. In later years, his role in the nuclear programme would be more deeply integrated as he remained head of the nuclear programme most of his life. The designer and creator of the bomb was P. K. Iyengar, who was the second in command of this project. Iyengar's work was further assisted by the chief metallurgist, R. Chidambaram, and by Nagapattinam Sambasiva Venkatesan of the Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory, who developed and manufactured the high explosive implosion system. The explosive materials and the detonation system were developed by Waman Dattatreya Patwardhan of the High Energy Materials Research Laboratory.\\r\\nThe overall project was supervised by chemical engineer Homi Sethna, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission of India. Chidambaram, who would later coordinate work on the Pokhran-II tests, began work on the equation of state of plutonium in late 1967 or early 1968. To preserve secrecy, the project employed no more than 75 scientists and engineers from 1967ÿ74.[5][15] Abdul Kalam also arrived at the test site as the representative of the DRDO.\\r\\nThe device was of the implosion-type design and had a close resemblance to the American nuclear bomb called the Fat Man.[2] The implosion system was assembled at the Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL) of the DRDO in Chandigarh.[2] The detonation system was developed at the High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL) of the DRDO in Pune, Maharashtra State.[2] The 6?kg of plutonium came from the CIRUS reactor at BARC.[2] The neutron initiator was of the poloniumÿberyllium type and code-named Flower. The complete nuclear bomb was engineered and finally assembled by Indian engineers at Trombay before transportation to the test site.[2]\\r\\nThe fully assembled device had a hexagonal cross section, 1.25 metres in diameter, and weighed 1400?kg.[2] The device was mounted on a hexagonal metal tripod, and was transported to the shaft on rails which the army kept covered with sand.[2] The device was detonated when Dastidar pushed the firing button at 8.05 a.m.; it was in a shaft 107 m under the army Pokhran test range in the Thar Desert (or Great Indian Desert), Rajasthan.[2]\\r\\nThe nuclear yield of this test still remains controversial, with unclear data provided by Indian sources, although Indian politicians have given the country's press a range from 2?kt to 20?kt.[2] The official yield was initially set at 12?kt; post-Operation Shakti claims have raised it to 13?kt.[2] Independent seismic data from outside and analysis of the crater features indicate a lower figure.[2] Analysts usually estimate the yield at 4 to 6?kt, using conventional seismic magnitude-to-yield conversion formulas. In recent years, both Homi Sethna and P. K. Iyengar have conceded the official yield to be an exaggeration.[2]\\r\\nIyengar has variously stated that the yield was 8ÿ10?kt, that the device was designed to yield 10?kt, and that the yield was 8?kt \\"exactly as predicted\\". Although seismic scaling laws lead to an estimated yield range between 3.2 kt and 21 kt,[16] an analysis of hard rock cratering effects suggests a narrow range of around 8?kt for the yield,[2] which is within the uncertainties of the seismic yield estimate.[16]\\r\\nIndian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had already gained much popularity and publicity after her successful military campaign against Pakistan in the 1971 war.[17] The test caused an immediate revival of Indira Gandhi's popularity, which had flagged considerably from its high after the 1971 war. The overall popularity and image of the Congress Party was enhanced and the Congress Party was well received in the Indian Parliament.[17] In 1975, Homi Sethna, a chemical engineer and the chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission (AECI), Raja Ramanna of BARC, and Basanti Nagchaudhuri of DRDO, all were honoured with the Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian award.[17] Five other project members received the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian award.[17] India consistently maintained that this was a peaceful nuclear bomb test and that it had no intentions of militarising its nuclear programme. However, according to independent monitors, this test was part of an accelerated Indian nuclear programme.[1] In 1997 Raja Ramanna, speaking to the Press Trust of India, maintained:\\r\\nThe Pokhran test was a bomb, I can tell you now.... An explosion is an explosion, a gun is a gun, whether you shoot at someone or shoot at the ground.... I just want to make clear that the test was not all that peaceful.\\r\\nWhile India continued to state that the test was for peaceful purposes, it encountered opposition from many quarters. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) was formed in reaction to the Indian tests to check international nuclear proliferation.[18] The NSG decided in 1992 to require full-scope IAEA safeguards for any new nuclear export deals,[19] which effectively ruled out nuclear exports to India, but in 2008 it waived this restriction on nuclear trade with India as part of the Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement.[20]\\r\\nPakistan did not view the test as a \\"peaceful nuclear explosion\\", and cancelled talks scheduled for 10 June on normalisation of relations.[5] Pakistan's Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto vowed in June 1974 that he would never succumb to \\"nuclear blackmail\\" or accept \\"Indian hegemony or domination over the subcontinent\\".[21] The chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, Munir Ahmed Khan, said that the test would force Pakistan to test its own nuclear bomb.[22] Pakistan's leading nuclear physicist, Pervez Hoodbhoy, stated in 2011 that he believed the test \\"pushed [Pakistan] further into the nuclear arena\\".[23]\\r\\nThe plutonium used in the test was created in the CIRUS reactor supplied by Canada and using heavy water supplied by the United States. Both countries reacted negatively, especially in light of then ongoing negotiations on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the economic aid both countries had provided to India.[5][24] Canada concluded that the test violated a 1971 understanding between the two states, and froze nuclear energy assistance for the two heavy water reactors then under construction.[5] The United States concluded that the test did not violate any agreement and proceeded with a June 1974 shipment of enriched uranium for the Tarapur reactor.[5]\\r\\nFrance sent a congratulatory telegram to India but later withdrew it.[25]\\r\\nDespite many proposals, India did not carry out further nuclear tests until 1998. After the 1998 general elections, Operation Shakti (also known as Pokhran-II) was carried out at the Pokhran test site, using devices designed and built over the preceding two decades.[5][26]","input":"When did india test its first nuclear bomb?"},{"output":"February 26, 1986","context":"Dragon Ball (Japanese: ´ʾλ, Hepburn: Doragon Bru) is a Japanese media franchise created by Akira Toriyama in 1984.

The series follows the adventures of the protagonist, Son Goku, from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts and explores the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several friends and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls.\\r\\nThe Dragon Ball manga has been adapted into two anime series produced by Toei Animation: Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. Additionally, the studio has developed 19 animated feature films and three television specials, as well as two anime sequel series titled Dragon Ball GT (1996ÿ1997) and Dragon Ball Super (2015ÿ2018). From 2009 to 2015, a revised, faster-paced version of Dragon Ball Z aired in Japan under the title Dragon Ball Kai, in which most of the original version's footage not featured in the manga is removed. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes films, both animated and live-action, collectible trading card games, numerous action figures, along with several collections of soundtracks and a large number of video games. As of January 2012, the franchise generated $5?billion in merchandise,[1] making Dragon Ball one of the most merchandisable anime based media franchises of all time.\\r\\nSince its release, Dragon Ball has become one of the most successful manga and anime series of all time. The manga's 42 volumes have sold over 156 million copies in Japan and more than 240 million copies worldwide, making it the second best-selling manga series in history. Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humor of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest manga series ever made, with many manga artists citing Dragon Ball as a source of inspiration for their own now popular works. The anime, particularly Dragon Ball Z, is also highly popular in various countries and was arguably one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAkira Toriyama loosely modeled Dragon Ball on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West;[2][3] but also redeveloped it from his 1983 one-shot manga Dragon Boy.[3] He has said that the fighting was influenced from movies by famous martial arts actor Jackie Chan,[4][5] as he wanted to create a story with the basic theme of Journey to the West, but with \\"a little kung fu.\\"[6] Since it was serialized in a shnen magazine, he added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give it a game-like activity of gathering something, without thinking of what the characters would wish for.[6] With Goku being Sun Wukong, Bulma as Tang Sanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie and Yamcha being Sha Wujing, he originally thought it would last about a year or end once the Dragon Balls were collected.[5][7] Toriyama stated that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand, he specifically aimed Dragon Ball at readers older than those of his previous serial Dr. Slump.[8] He also wanted to break from the Western influences common in Dr. Slump, deliberately going for Chinese scenery, referencing Chinese buildings and photographs of China his wife had bought.[9] The island where the Tenkaichi Budkai (BH, lit. \\"Strongest Under the Heavens Martial Arts Tournament\\") is held is modeled after Bali, which he, his wife and assistant visited in mid-1985, and for the area around Bobbidi's spaceship he consulted photos of Africa.[9]\\r\\nDuring the early chapters of the manga Toriyama's editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, commented that Goku looked rather plain, so to combat this he added several characters like Kame-Sen'nin and Kuririn, and created the Tenkaichi Budkai martial arts tournament to focus the storyline on fighting. It was when the first Tenkaichi Budkai began that Dragon Ball truly became popular, having recalled the races and tournaments in Dr. Slump.[5] Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory. He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline was inspired by the video game Spartan X, in which enemies tended to appear very fast. He then created Piccolo Daimao as a truly evil villain, and as a result called that arc the most interesting to draw.[5]\\r\\nOnce Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans (??, Saiya-jin); and Goku himself was retconned from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.[10] Freeza, who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the \\"worst kind of people.\\"[5] Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the Ginyu Force to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the Super Saiyan (] ()??, Sp Saiya-jin) transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.[11] He added time travel next during the Cell arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.[5] After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.[5]\\r\\nGoing against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of Dragon Ball's most powerful characters with small statures, including the protagonist, Goku.[12] Toriyama later explained that he had Goku grow up as a means to make drawing fight scenes easier, even though his first editor Kazuhiko Torishima was initially against it because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically.[13] When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid difficulties in drawing residents and destroyed buildings.[9] Toriyama said that he did not plan the details of the story, resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series, including changing the colors of the characters mid-story and few characters having screentone because he found it difficult to use.[4][6][7][14] Since the completion of Dragon Ball, Toriyama has continued to add to its story, mostly background information on its universe, through guidebooks published by Shueisha.\\r\\nDuring the second half of the series, Toriyama has said that he had become more interested in coming up with the story than actually drawing it, and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines.[4] In 2013, he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art.[13] He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an \\"unconventional and contradictory\\" story.[12] In 2013, commenting on Dragon Ball's global success, Toriyama said, \\"Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy.\\", \\"The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. I dare say I don't care even if [my works] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers.\\"[15]\\r\\nWritten and illustrated by Akira Toriyama, Dragon Ball was serialized in the manga anthology Weekly Shnen Jump from December 3, 1984 to June 5, 1995,[16][17] when Toriyama grew exhausted and felt he needed a break from drawing. The 519 individual chapters were published into 42 tankbon volumes by Shueisha from September 10, 1985 through August 4, 1995.[18][19][20] Between December 4, 2002 and April 2, 2004, the chapters were re-released in a collection of 34 kanzenban volumes, which included a slightly rewritten ending, new covers, and color artwork from its Weekly Shnen Jump run.[21][22] The February 2013 issue of V Jump, which was released in December 2012, announced that parts of the manga will be fully colored and re-released in 2013.[23] Twenty volumes, beginning from chapter 195 and grouped by story arcs, were released between February 4, 2013 and July 4, 2014.[24][25] Twelve volumes covering the first 194 chapters were published between January 4 and March 4, 2016.[26][27] A sshhen edition that aims to recreate the manga as it was originally serialized in Weekly Shnen Jump with color pages, promotional text, and next chapter previews, was published in eighteen volumes between May 13, 2016 and January 13, 2017.[28][29]\\r\\nAnother manga penned by ishi, the three-chapter Dragon Ball: Episode of Bardock that revolves around Bardock, Goku's father, was published in the monthly magazine V Jump from August and October 2011.[30]\\r\\nThe final chapter of Toriyama's 2013 manga series Jaco the Galactic Patrolman revealed that it is set before Dragon Ball, with several characters making appearances.[31] Jaco's collected volumes contain a bonus Dragon Ball chapter depicting Goku's mother.[32]\\r\\nIn December 2016, a spin-off manga titled Dragon Ball Side Story: The Case of Being Reincarnated as Yamcha began in Shueisha's Shnen Jump+ digital magazine. Written and illustrated by Dragon Garow Lee, it is about a high school boy who after an accident wakes up in the body of Yamcha in the Dragon Ball manga.[33]\\r\\nToriyama also created a short series, Neko Majin (1999ÿ2005), that became a self-parody of Dragon Ball.[34] In 2006, a crossover between Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Ken-mae Hashutsujo (or Kochikame) and Dragon Ball by Toriyama and Kochikame author Osamu Akimoto appeared in the Super Kochikame (]?w, Ch Kochikame) manga.[35] That same year, Toriyama teamed up with Eiichiro Oda to create a crossover chapter of Dragon Ball and One Piece titled Cross Epoch.[36]\\r\\nToei Animation produced an anime television series based on the first 194 manga chapters, also titled Dragon Ball. The series premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on February 26, 1986 and ran until April 12, 1989, lasting 153 episodes.[3]\\r\\nInstead of continuing the anime as Dragon Ball, Toei Animation decided to carry on with their adaptation under a new name and asked Akira Toriyama to come up with the title. Dragon Ball Z (´ʾλZ(δ), Doragon Bru Zetto, commonly abbreviated as DBZ) picks up five years after the first series left off and adapts the final 325 chapters of the manga. It premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on April 26, 1989, taking over its predecessor's time slot, and ran for 291 episodes until its conclusion on January 31, 1996.[3] Two television specials based on the Z series were aired on Fuji TV in Japan. The first, The One True Final Battle ~The Z Warrior Who Challenged Freeza -- Son Goku's Father~, renamed Bardock ÿ The Father of Goku by Funimation, was shown on October 17, 1990. The second special, The Hopeless Resistance!! Gohan and Trunks -- The Two Remaining Super Warriors, renamed The History of Trunks by Funimation, is based on a special chapter of the original manga and aired on March 24, 1993.\\r\\nDragon Ball GT (´ʾλGT(Κū), Doragon Bru Jؐ Tؐ, G(rand) T(ouring)[37]) premiered on Fuji TV on February 2, 1996 and ran until November 19, 1997 for 64 episodes.[3] Unlike the first two anime series, it is not based on Akira Toriyama's original Dragon Ball manga,[38] being created by Toei Animation as a sequel to the series or as Toriyama called it, a \\"grand side story of the original Dragon Ball.\\"[37] Toriyama designed the main cast, the spaceship used in the show, the design of three planets, and came up with the title and logo. In addition to this, Toriyama also oversaw production of the series, just as he had for the Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z anime. The television special episode, Goku Side Story! The Four Star Ball is a Badge of Courage, renamed A Hero's Legacy by Funimation, aired on March 26, 1997, serving as an epilogue to the series.\\r\\nIn February 2009, Dragon Ball Z celebrated its 20th anniversary, with Toei Animation announcing that it would broadcast a re-edited and remastered version under the name Dragon Ball Kai (´ʾλ, Doragon Bru Kai, lit. \\"Dragon Ball Revised\\"). The footage would be re-edited to follow the manga more closely, eliminating scenes and episodes which were not featured in the original manga, resulting in a more faithful adaptation, as well as in a faster-moving, and more focused story.[39] The episodes were remastered for HDTV, with rerecording of the vocal tracks by most of the original cast, and featuring updated opening and ending sequences. On April 5, 2009, the series premiered in Japan airing in Fuji TV.[40][41] Dragon Ball Z Kai reduced the episode count to 159 episodes (167 episodes internationally), from the original footage of 291 episodes. Damaged frames were removed, resulting in some minor shots being remade from scratch in order to fix cropping, and others to address continuity issues.[42] The majority of the international versions, including Funimation Entertainment's English dub, are titled Dragon Ball Z Kai.[43][44]\\r\\nOn April 28, 2015, Toei Animation announced Dragon Ball Super (´ʾλ], Doragon Bru Sp), the first all-new Dragon Ball television series to be released in 18 years. It debuted on July 5 and runs as a weekly series at 9:00 am on Fuji TV on Sundays until its series finale on March 25, 2018 after 131 episodes.[45] Masako Nozawa reprises her roles as Goku, Gohan, and Goten. Most of the original cast reprise their roles as well.[46][47] Kouichi Yamadera and Masakazu Morita also reprise their roles, as Beerus and Whis, respectively.[47]\\r\\nThe story of the anime is set four years after the defeat of Majin Boo, when the Earth has become peaceful once again. Akira Toriyama is credited as the original creator, as well for \\"original story & character design concepts.\\"[48] It is also being adapted into a parallel manga.[49]\\r\\nThe short film Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!! was created for the Jump Super Anime Tour,[50] which celebrated Weekly Shnen Jump's 40th anniversary, and debuted on November 24, 2008. A short animated adaptation of Naho ishi's Bardock spinoff manga, Dragon Ball: Episode of Bardock, was shown on December 17ÿ18, 2011 at the Jump Festa 2012 event.[51]\\r\\nA two-episode original video animation (OVA) titled Dragon Ball Z Side Story: Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans was created in 1993 as strategy guides for the Famicom video game of the same name.[52] A remake titled Dragon Ball: Plan to Eradicate the Super Saiyans was created as a bonus feature for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2, which was released on November 11, 2010.[53]\\r\\nA two-part hour-long crossover special between Dragon Ball Z, One Piece and Toriko, referred to as Dream 9 Toriko & One Piece & Dragon Ball Z Super Collaboration Special!! aired on April 7, 2013.[54]\\r\\nNineteen animated theatrical films based on the Dragon Ball series have been released in Japan. The most recent, the eighteenth and ninetenth films, Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods (2013) and Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' (2015), were produced as full-length feature films and were given stand-alone theatrical releases in Japan (as well as limited theatrical releases in the U.S.); those two have a greater sense of continuity with the series than the older films, especially since their storyline was directly been adapted into the first-two story arcs of the Dragon Ball Super anime. Due to being the first movies to have original creator Akira Toriyama deeply involved in their production.[55][56] The 1996's film, The Path to Power, with a running time of 80 minutes also follows the manga's plot, by reimagining the first arc of the series into a feature film.\\r\\nAll films preceeding those were usually below feature length (around 45ÿ60 minutes each), making them only slightly longer than an episode of the TV series, this is due to them being originally shown as back-to-back presentations alongside other Toei film productions. Such films are also mostly alternate side-stories that do not correlate with the continuity of the series. The first three films, along the previously mentioned and longer Path to Power, are based on the original Dragon Ball anime series. The remaining films include fifteen based on Dragon Ball Z. The first five films were shown at the Toei Manga Festival (?|ϻԻ, Tei Manga Matsuri), while the sixth through seventeenth films were shown at the Toei Anime Fair (?|ʧ߁Gʧ, Toei Anime Fea).\\r\\nAn American live-action film titled Dragonball Evolution was produced by 20th Century Fox, after it acquired the feature film rights to the Dragon Ball franchise in March 2002, previous to the film, two unofficial live-action films have been produced decades prior.[57][58] The film was directed by James Wong and produced by Stephen Chow, it was released in the United States on April 10, 2009.[58][59] The film was meant to lead into sequels,[60][61] which were cancelled, after the film released and became universally heralded as one of the worst adaptations of all time, being considered by the fans as being unfaithful to the source material.[62] Franchise creator Akira Toriyama also criticized the film adding he was completely left out of the creative process, despite having himself offered to help, going as far as saying: \\"the result was a movie, I couldn't even call Dragon Ball\\".[63] Years after its release, the writer of the film, Ben Ramsey, released a public apology in which he admitted to have written the film \\"chasing for a payday\\" instead of \\"as a fan of the franchise\\".[64][65]\\r\\n\\"Dragon Ball Z: The Real 4D\\" debuted at Universal Studios Japan in the summer of 2016. It features a battle between Goku and Freeza. Unlike most Dragon Ball animation, the attraction is animated with CGI. A second attraction titled \\"Dragon Ball Z: Super Tenkaichi Budokai\\" debuted at Universal Studios Japan in the summer of 2017, which featured a battle between the heroes and Broly.\\r\\nThe Dragon Ball franchise has spawned multiple video games across various genres and platforms. Earlier games of the series included a system of card battling and were released for the Famicom following the storyline of the series.[66] Starting with the Super Famicom and Mega Drive, most of the games were from the fighting genre or RPG (Role Playing Game), such as the Super Butoden series.[67] The first Dragon Ball game to be released in the United States was Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout for the PlayStation in 1997.[68] For the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable games the characters were redone in 3D cel-shaded graphics. These games included the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai series and the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series.[69][70] Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit was the first game of the franchise developed for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[71] Dragon Ball Xenoverse was the first game of the franchise developed for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.[72][73] A massively multiplayer online role-playing game called Dragon Ball Online was available in Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan until the servers were shut down in 2013.[74] A few years later fans started recreating the game. Today, \\"Dragon Ball Online Global\\" is a new, European version of Dragon Ball Online and it is being developed, while open beta server is running.[75]\\r\\nMyriad soundtracks were released in the anime, movies and the games. The music for the first two anime Dragon Ball and Z and its films was composed by Shunsuke Kikuchi, while the music from GT was composed by Akihito Tokunaga and the music from Kai was composed by Kenji Yamamoto and Norihito Sumitomo. For the first anime, the soundtracks released were Dragon Ball: Music Collection in 1985 and Dragon Ball: Complete Song Collection in 1991, although they were reissued in 2007 and 2003, respectively.[76] For the second anime, the soundtrack series released were Dragon Ball Z Hit Song Collection Series. It was produced and released by Columbia Records of Japan from July 21, 1989 to March 20, 1996 the show's entire lifespan. On September 20, 2006 Columbia re-released the Hit Song Collection on their Animex 1300 series.[77][78] Other CDs released are compilations, video games and films soundtracks as well as music from the English versions.[79]\\r\\nThere have been numerous companion books to the Dragon Ball franchise. Chief among these are the Daizenshuu (??) series, comprising seven hardback main volumes and three supplemental softcover volumes, covering the manga and the first two anime series and their theatrical films. The first of these, Dragon Ball: The Complete Illustrations (Daizenshuu volume 1), first published in Japan in 1995, is the only one that was released in English, being printed in 2008 by Viz Media.[80] It contains all 264 colored illustrations Akira Toriyama drew for the Weekly Shnen Jump magazines' covers, bonus giveaways and specials, and all the covers for the 42 tankbon. It also includes an interview with Toriyama on his work process. The remainder have never been released in English, and all are now out of print in Japan. From February 4 to May 9, 2013, condensed versions of the Daizenshuu with some updated information were released as the four-volume Chzensh (]??) series.[23] For Dragon Ball GT, the Dragon Ball GT Perfect Files were released in May and December 1997 by Shueisha's Jump Comics Selection imprint. They include series information, illustration galleries, behind-the-scenes information, and more. They were out of print for many years, but were re-released in April 2006 (accompanying the Japanese DVD release of Dragon Ball GT) and this edition is still in print.[81][82]\\r\\nCoinciding with the 34-volume kanzenban re-release of the manga, and the release of the entire series on DVD for the first time in Japan, four new guidebooks were released in 2003 and 2004. Dragon Ball Landmark and Dragon Ball Forever cover the manga, using volume numbers for story points that reference the kanzenban release,[83][84] while Dragon Ball: Tenkaichi Densetsu (´ʾλ B?wh) and Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku Densetsu (´ʾλZ ?OiZ?wh) cover the Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z anime, respectively.[85][86] Much of the material in these books is reused from the earlier Daizenshuu volumes, but they include new textual material including substantial interviews with the creator, cast and production staff of the series. Son Goku Densetsu in particular showcases previously-unpublished design sketches of Goku's father Bardock, drawn by character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru prior to creator Akira Toriyama's revisions that resulted in the final version.\\r\\nFollowing the release of Dragon Ball Kai in Japan, four new guidebooks were released: the two-volume Dragon Ball: Super Exciting Guide (´ʾλ ]ƽ̚ū벼) in 2009, covering the manga,[87][88] and two-volume Dragon Ball: Extreme Battle Collection (´ʾλx?Oj) in 2010, covering the anime series.[89][90] Despite the TV series airing during this time being Kai, the Extreme Battle Collection books reference the earlier Z series in content and episode numbers. These books also include new question-and-answer sessions with Akira Toriyama, revealing a few new details about the world and characters of the series. 2010 also saw the release of a new artbook, Dragon Ball: Anime Illustrations Guide - The Golden Warrior (´ʾλ ʧ߁G̷µĦ ߼?ؿV?); a sort of anime-counterpart to the manga-oriented Complete Illustrations, it showcases anime-original illustrations and includes interviews with the three principal character designers for the anime. Each of the Japanese \\"Dragon Box\\" DVD releases of the series and movies, which were released from 2003 to 2006, as well as the Blu-ray boxed sets of Dragon Ball Kai, released 2009 to 2011, come with a Dragon Book guide that contains details about the content therein. Each also contains a new interview with a member of the cast or staff of the series. These books have been reproduced textually for Funimation's release of the Dragon Ball Z Dragon Box sets from 2009 to 2011.\\r\\nCollectible cards based on the Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, and Dragon Ball GT series have been released by Bandai. These cards feature various scenes from the manga and anime stills, plus exclusive artwork from all three series. Bandai released the first set in the United States in July 2008.[91]\\r\\nDragon Ball is one of the most popular manga series of all time, and it continues to enjoy high readership today. By 2000, more than 126 million copies of its tankbon volumes had been sold in Japan alone.[94] By 2016, this number had grown to pass 156 million in Japan and 240 million worldwide, making it the second best-selling Weekly Shnen Jump manga of all time.[95][96] Dragon Ball is credited as one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s.[97][98] For the 10th anniversary of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006, Japanese fans voted Dragon Ball the third greatest manga of all time.[99]\\r\\nIn a survey conducted by Oricon in 2007 among 1,000 people, Son Goku, the main character of the franchise, ranked first place as the \\"Strongest Manga Character of All Time.\\"[100] Goku's journey and his ever-growing strength resulted in the character winning \\"the admiration of young boys everywhere\\".[2] Manga artists, such as One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda and Naruto creator Masashi Kishimoto, have stated that Goku inspired their series' main protagonists as well as series structure.[101][102]\\r\\nManga critic Jason Thompson stated in 2011 that \\"Dragon Ball is by far the most influential shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every Shonen Jump artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways.\\"[103] He says the series \\"turns from a gag/adventure manga to an nearly-pure fighting manga\\",[103] and its basic formula of \\"lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, a few jokes\\" became the model for other shnen series, such as Naruto.[104] Thompson also called Toriyama's art influential and cited it as a reason for the series' popularity.[103] James S. Yadao, author of The Rough Guide to Manga, claims that the first several chapters of Dragon Ball \\"play out much like Saiyuki with Dr. Slump-like humour built in\\" and that Dr. Slump, Toriyama's previous manga, has a clear early influence on the series.[105] He feels the series \\"established its unique identity\\" after the first occasion when Goku's group disbands and he trains under Kame-sen'nin, when the story develops \\"a far more action-packed, sinister tone\\" with \\"wilder\\" battles with aerial and spiritual elements and an increased death count, while humor still makes an occasional appearance.[105] Yadao claims that an art shift occurs when the characters \\"lose the rounded, innocent look that he established in Dr. Slump and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity.\\"[106]\\r\\nAnimerica felt the series had \\"worldwide appeal\\", using dramatic pacing and over-the-top martial arts action to \\"maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on the audience's attention spans\\".[107] In Little Boy: The Art of Japan's Exploding Subculture, Takashi Murakami commented that Dragon Ball's \\"never-ending cyclical narrative moves forward plausibly, seamlessly, and with great finesse.\\"[94] Ridwan Khan from Animefringe.com commented that the manga had a \\"chubby\\" art style, but as the series continued the characters got more refined, leaner, and more muscular. Khan prefers the manga over the slow pacing of the anime counterparts.[108] Allen Divers of Anime News Network praised the story and humor of the manga as being very good at conveying all of the characters' personalities. Divers also called Viz's translation one of the best of all the English editions of the series due to its faithfulness to the original Japanese.[109] D. Aviva Rothschild of Rationalmagic.com remarked the first manga volume as \\"a superior humor title\\". They praised Goku's innocence and Bulma's insistence as one of the funniest parts of the series.[110]\\r\\nThe content of the manga has been controversial in the United States. In November 1999, Toys \\"R\\" Us removed Viz's Dragon Ball from their stores nationwide when a Dallas parent complained the series had \\"borderline soft porn\\" after he bought them for his four-year-old son.[111] Commenting on the issue, Susan J. Napier explained it as a difference in culture.[111] After the ban, Viz reluctantly began to censor the series to keep wide distribution.[112] However, in 2001, after releasing three volumes censored, Viz announced Dragon Ball would be uncensored and reprinted due to fan reactions.[112] In October 2009, Wicomico County Public Schools in Maryland banned the Dragon Ball manga from their school district because it \\"depicts nudity, sexual contact between children and sexual innuendo among adults and children.\\"[111]\\r\\nThe anime adaptations have also been very well-received and are better known in the Western world than the manga, with Anime News Network saying, \\"Few anime series have mainstreamed it the way Dragon Ball Z has. To a certain generation of television consumers its characters are as well known as any in the animated realm, and for many it was the first step into the wilderness of anime fandom.\\"[113] In 2000, satellite TV channel Animax together with Brutus, a men's lifestyle magazine, and Tsutaya, Japan's largest video rental chain, conducted a poll among 200,000 fans on the top anime series, with Dragon Ball coming in fourth.[114] TV Asahi conducted two polls in 2005 on the Top 100 Anime, Dragon Ball came in second in the nationwide survey conducted with multiple age-groups and in third in the online poll.[115][116] On several occasions the Dragon Ball anime has topped Japan's DVD sales.[117][118]\\r\\nCarl Kimlinger of Anime News Network summed up Dragon Ball as \\"an action-packed tale told with rare humor and something even rarera genuine sense of adventure.\\"[119] Both Kimlinger and colleague Theron Martin noted Funimation's reputation for drastic alterations of the script, but praised the dub.[119][120] However, some critics and most fans of the Japanese version have been more critical with Funimation's English dub and script of Dragon Ball Z over the years. Jeffrey Harris IGN criticized the voices including how Freeza's appearance combined with the feminine English voice left fans confused about Freeza's gender.[121] Carlos Ross of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews considered the series' characters to be different from stereotypical stock characters and noted that they undergo much more development.[122] Despite praising Dragon Ball Z for its cast of characters, they criticized it for having long and repetitive fights.[123]\\r\\nDragon Ball Z is well-known, and often criticized, for its long, repetitive, dragged-out fights that span several episodes, with Martin commenting \\"DBZ practically turned drawing out fights into an art form.\\"[124] However, Jason Thompson of io9 explained that this comes from the fact that the anime was being created alongside the manga.[125] Dragon Ball Z was listed as the 78th best animated show in IGN's Top 100 Animated Series,[126] and was also listed as the 50th greatest cartoon in Wizard magazine's Top 100 Greatest Cartoons list.[127]\\r\\nHarris commented that Dragon Ball GT \\"is downright repellent\\", mentioning that the material and characters had lost their novelty and fun. He also criticized the GT character designs of Trunks and Vegeta as being goofy.[121] Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network also gave negative comments about GT, mentioning that the fights from the series were \\"a very simple childish exercise\\" and that many other anime were superior. The plot of Dragon Ball GT has also been criticized for giving a formula that was already used in its predecessors.[128]\\r\\nThe first episode of Dragon Ball Z Kai earned a viewer ratings percentage of 11.3, ahead of One Piece and behind Crayon Shin-chan.[129] Although following episodes had lower ratings, Kai was among the top 10 anime in viewer ratings every week in Japan for most of its run.[130][131]\\r\\nAn unofficial live-action Mandarin Chinese film adaptation of the series, Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins, was released in Taiwan in 1989.[3] In December 1990, the unofficial live-action Korean film Dragon Ball: Ssawora Son Goku, Igyeora Son Goku was released.","input":"When did the first episode of dragon ball air?"},{"output":"24th overall pick","context":"","input":"When was aaron rodgers picked in the draft?"},{"output":"K.

L. James. After accepting entrepreneur CEO Christian Grey's proposal in Fifty Shades Darker, Anastasia Steele must adjust not only to married life but to her new husband's wealthy lifestyle and controlling nature. The paperback edition was first published in April 2012.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnastasia 'Ana' Steele and Christian Grey return to Seattle after a long honeymoon. Christian is upset to find that Ana has kept her maiden name, Steele, at work. After some resistance, Ana relents and changes her name at work to Grey after realizing how important it is to Christian. As a belated wedding gift, Christian gives Seattle Independent Publishing to Ana, who plans to rename it Grey Publishing.\\r\\nWhile Christian is on a business trip in New York, Anastasia goes out for a drink with longtime friend, Kate Kavanagh, doing so against Christian's wishes. Returning home, she finds that her former boss, Jack Hyde, who was fired for attempting to sexually assault Ana, has been apprehended by the security staff. Duct tape is found in his pocket and in his van there are tranquilizers and a ransom noteall indications that he intended to kidnap her. Jack is arrested. Angry with Ana for defying him, Christian cuts short his New York business trip and returns to Seattle. Furious that Ana reneged on her promise to have Kate over rather than go out, an upset Christian sulks while Ana sleeps. Eventually, the two argue and Ana berates him for being overly controlling and possessive. She demands more freedom and access to her friends. Christian finally relents after realizing how much Ana's friends mean to her and that Ana did the right thing by staying with Kate rather than at home. Soon after, Christian surprises her with a trip to Aspen, with Kate, Elliot, Mia, and Kate's brother, Ethan. While there, Elliot proposes to Kate, and she accepts.\\r\\nAna's step-father, Ray, is in a medically-induced coma after a car accident. When he awakens a few days later, Ana and Christian arrange to move him to Seattle to recover. It is also Ana's birthday weekend, and Christian surprises her with all her family and friends at a dinner. He gives her a charm bracelet with the charms representing all their \\"firsts\\" including an ice cream cone to represent their \\"vanilla\\" relationship. Christian also gifts her with an Audi R8. Soon after, Ana learns she is pregnant. Christian angrily accuses her of getting pregnant on purpose and leaves. He returns early the next morning drunk, claiming Ana will choose the baby - whom he believes to be a boy - over him. Ana says it could be a girl, though Christian refuses to accept that due to his sexist and chauvinistic nature. Ana becomes furious when she discovers a text message on Christian's phone from Elena Lincoln, the woman who seduced him when he was fifteen and introduced him to the BDSM lifestyle. The message indicates they met for a drink.\\r\\nThe next two mornings, Anastasia and Christian barely speak to each other: Christian is angry over the unplanned pregnancy; Anastasia is upset about his late-night encounter with Elena, though Christian insists their relationship is long-since over. When Christian is away on a business for a few days, Ana receives a call from Jack Hyde. He has kidnapped Mia Grey and demands $5 million in two hours. He warns Ana not to tell anyone or he will kill Mia.\\r\\nAnastasia feigns illness and returns home to escape her bodyguard, Sawyer. She takes a gun and goes to the bank. While collecting the money, the suspicious bank manager calls Christian. who believes Ana is leaving him. To protect Mia's life, Ana lies to Christian, saying she is leaving him to raise the baby alone. Hyde instructs Ana to leave her phone but she tricks him by taking the bank manager's phone instead and dropping it in the trash. She leaves via the back entrance to a waiting car, shocked that Hyde's accomplice is Elizabeth Morgan, her co-worker. When handing over the money, Hyde tries to kill Ana out of vengeance for losing his job, causing Elizabeth to feel guilty for being involved. Angered by his behavior and his hurting Ana, she and Hyde argue. On the ground and bruised, Ana shoots Hyde in the leg. When Ana starts to black out she hears Christian calling her name.\\r\\nAna wakes three days later in the hospital with Christian at her side. Though he is angry at Ana's recklessness and still anxious about fatherhood, he realizes how important their baby is to her, and they reconcile. Ana returns home the next day. Christian learns from his private investigator, Welch, that he and Hyde had the same foster family. He tells Ana about how he met and was seduced by Elena. By introducing him to the world of BDSM, Elena helped Christian learn to take control of his life. If she had not intervened, he would still be plagued with horrible memories of his mother and would never have been able to control his life. Ana feels guilty for her behavior when he explains that he had been looking for his psychiatrist, Dr. Flynn, because he needed help. When he could not contact Flynn, Christian wound up at Elena's salon and they then had a drink at the bar. Although she made a pass at him, Elena realized that Christian loved Ana and finally agrees to leave on good terms.\\r\\nThe next day, a furious Christian discovers that Elena's ex-husband, Eric Lincoln, has bailed Jack from jail out of spite for her affair with Christian. Christian tells Ana that after learning about the affair, Eric severely beat Elena and divorced her. Despite Christian's urging, Elena refused to press charges against Eric out of guilt. Christian retaliated by buying out Eric Lincoln's logging company to sell it off. It is also learned Elizabeth confessed to police that she was blackmailed by Hyde to be his accomplice. (However, her ultimate fate remains a mystery.)\\r\\nTwo years later, Ana and Christian have a son named Theodore Raymond Grey, nicknamed Teddy, and Ana is six months pregnant with their second child, a daughter whom they decide to name Phoebe. Elliot and Kate have married and have a two-month-old daughter named Ava. At the end, after having BDSM sex, Ana and Christian are getting ready to celebrate Teddy's second birthday with their family and friends.\\r\\nFifty Shades Freed entered The New York Times Best Seller list at number three.[2] In the UK the novel sold over two million copies.[3]\\r\\nSam Taylor-Johnson, the director of the film adaptation of the first installment of the book series, Fifty Shades of Grey, confirmed on 6 February 2015 that both Fifty Shades Freed and the second book in the trilogy, Fifty Shades Darker, will also be adapted for film.[4] The film was released on 9 February 2018.[5] In November 2015, Universal Studios announced that both films will be shot back-to-back with principal photography scheduled to commence in early 2016.[6]","input":"What is the new 50 shades book called?"},{"output":"Gnash, a blue saber-toothed cat","context":"Gold, navy, white[1][2]\\r\\nThe Nashville Predators are a professional ice hockey team based in Nashville, Tennessee. They are members of the Central Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Predators' television broadcasting rights are held by Fox Sports Tennessee, whereas radio broadcasting rights are held by WPRT-FM. The Predators have played their home games at Bridgestone Arena since 1998.\\r\\nThe club was founded in 1998 when the NHL granted an expansion franchise to Craig Leipold. After five seasons, the Predators qualified for their first Stanley Cup playoffs during the 2003ÿ04 season. In 2008, ownership of the club was transferred from Leipold to a locally based ownership group. The Predators advanced to their first Stanley Cup Finals in 2017, but were defeated by the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games. In the following season, the Predators won their first Presidents' Trophy and Central Division title.\\r\\nThe Predators are presently affiliated with one minor league team, the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 1995, rumors began to circulate that the New Jersey Devils would be relocating to the planned Nashville Arena.[4] Nashville offered a $20?million relocation bonus to any team that would relocate, and the Devils attempted to terminate their lease with the NJSEA before ultimately restructuring it to stay in New Jersey.[5][6]\\r\\nAfter the attempt to get the Devils, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stated Nashville would probably be considered in upcoming expansion.[7] The arena was opened in 1996, and after an attempt to bring the National Basketball Association's Sacramento Kings did not materialize, the city instead went after a hockey team.[8]\\r\\nIn January 1997, a group led by Wisconsin businessman Craig Leipold made a formal presentation before the NHL requesting an expansion franchise.[9] When Bettman and league officials visited Nashville to tour the arena, thousands gathered on the arena plaza to greet them. In June, the league granted conditional franchises to Nashville, Columbus, Ohio, Atlanta and MinneapolisÿSaint Paul.\\r\\nThe Nashville team would be scheduled to begin play in 1998 if they met the NHL requirement of selling 12,000 season tickets before March 31, 1998.[10] Of the four cities, Nashville was the only one with a completed arena and therefore began play first. One month later, Leipold named former Washington Capitals general manager David Poile as the franchise's first general manager.[11] Portland Pirates' head coach Barry Trotz was named the franchise's first head coach on August 6.[12]\\r\\nOn September 25, 1997, Leipold and team president Jack Diller held a press conference where they unveiled the franchise's new logo, a saber-toothed cat (Smilodon floridanus).[12] The logo was a reference to a partial Smilodon skeleton found beneath downtown Nashville in 1971 during construction of the First American National Bank building, now the UBS Tower.[13][14]\\r\\nOnce the logo was unveiled, the franchise held a vote among fans to choose a name. Three candidates were culled from 75: \\"Ice Tigers,\\" \\"Fury\\" and \\"Attack.\\" Leipold added his own submission to the vote, \\"Predators.\\" On November 13, Leipold revealed at a press conference that his submission had won out and that the new franchise would be known as the \\"Nashville Predators.\\"[12]\\r\\nWhen awarded a franchise, the city of Nashville paid 31.50% of the $80?million fee to join the league. The city has engaged an affiliate of the team to operate the arena, and that agreement protects the city against annual arena operating losses over approximately $3.8?million.[15] The $15?million payroll of the team was the lowest of the NHL.[8]\\r\\nThe Predators began play during the 1998ÿ99 season, taking to the ice for the first time on October 10, 1998, where they lost 1ÿ0 at home to the Florida Panthers. It was the only sold out game of the Predators' first five bouts in Nashville.[8] Three nights later, on October 13, they defeated the Carolina Hurricanes 3ÿ2 for their first win. Forward Andrew Brunette scored the first goal. The Predators, in their first year of existence, finished second-to-last in the Western Conference with a 28ÿ47ÿ7 record. In the 1999ÿ2000 season, the Predators finished with a similar record to the previous season, and finished last in the Western Conference behind the Calgary Flames. However, during a game versus the New York Islanders on February 20, 2000, the Predators scored four goals in 3 minutes and 38 seconds.\\r\\nTo begin the 2000ÿ01 season, the Predators played two games in Japan against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Each team won a game in front of the largest crowds ever to see a hockey game in Japan. Backed by the goaltending duo of Mike Dunham and Tomas Vokoun, Nashville finished the season in tenth place in the Western Conference, ten points out of a playoff spot with a total of 80 total points. During the 2001ÿ02 season, the Predators recorded their 100th victory on December 6, 2001. With that win, Nashville became the second-fastest expansion team of the 1990s to reach the 100-win plateau. In the 2002ÿ03 season, head coach Barry Trotz broke the record for most games coached by the original coach of an expansion team (392 games).\\r\\nThe club had failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs for their first five years as a franchise. However, in the 2003ÿ04 season, the Predators finished eighth in the Western Conference, qualifying for their first post-season berth. The Predators were eliminated by the Detroit Red Wings in six games in the first round of the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs. The following 2004ÿ05 season was wiped out by a labor dispute between NHL owners and players.\\r\\nIn the 2005ÿ06 season, the Predators set an NHL record by winning their first four games by one goal each (although two of those were shootout victories, which would have been tie games in previous seasons). They also became only the fourth NHL franchise to start the season 8ÿ0; the last time a team did so was the Toronto Maple Leafs, who set the mark with a 10ÿ0 start in the 1993ÿ94 season. The Predators set the franchise mark for wins in a season with a 2ÿ0 shutout of the Phoenix Coyotes on March 16, 2006. In that match, Chris Mason became the ninth goaltender to score a goal. By the end of the season, the Predators had accumulated 106 pointstheir first 100-point seasonand clinched home ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs for the first time in team history. They finished the season with an NHL-best 32ÿ8ÿ1 record at home. However, the Predators would be eliminated by the San Jose Sharks in five games in the first round of the 2006 playoffs.\\r\\nDuring the off-season, the Predators acquired veteran center Jason Arnott from free agency on July 2, 2006. In the following season, Arnott and David Legwand led the team in goals with 27 each. Late in the season, the Predators traded two former first round draft picks, Scottie Upshall and Ryan Parent, plus their first and third-round pick in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, to the Philadelphia Flyers for five-time NHL All-Star Peter Forsberg. The Predators finished the season ranked fourth in the Western Conference with a franchise record 110 points, finishing third overall behind the Buffalo Sabres and the Red Wings. They were defeated by the Sharks in the first round of the 2007 playoffs for the second year in a row, losing the series 4ÿ1.\\r\\nThe roster saw a depletion in talent during the off-season. With multiple potential buyers, and rumors of the franchise moving hounding the team until almost mid-season, the Predators were not expected to be successful during the 2007ÿ08 season. Chris Mason, former backup goaltender to Tomas Vokoun (who was traded to the Florida Panthers) had a shaky season and shared net-minding duties with Dan Ellis. Ellis, who was signed from the Dallas Stars before the season began, had a 233:39 long shutout streak (fifth longest in league history) nearing the end of the season that helped Nashville attain the eighth playoff spot with 91 points. The Predators met the Presidents' Trophy-winning (and eventual Stanley Cup winners) Red Wings in the first round of the playoffs and were defeated 4ÿ2, their fourth-straight first-round knockout.\\r\\nThe first off-season of settling in under new ownership was a quiet one for the Predators with little personnel movement. As such, the Predators began the 2008ÿ09 season with little expectation. Following a strong push after the All-Star break and no movement at the trade deadline, the team found themselves still battling for a playoff spot into the last week of the season. Buoyed by the return of Steve Sullivan after almost two seasons recovering from a back injury, the Predators finished with 88 points, settling for tenth place in the Western Conference, missing the playoffs for the first time in five seasons.\\r\\nThe Predators made few major additions to their roster in the 2009 off-season, signing former San Jose Sharks forward Marcel Goc (who was extended for another year by the club in mid-season) and former Montreal Canadiens defenseman Francis Bouillon. The 2009ÿ10 season also saw the much-anticipated debut of top prospect Colin Wilson. However, due to a groin injury suffered in training camp, Wilson spent the first week-and-a-half of the season on the sidelines, and was sent to the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL) in November. He returned to the club in February and scored 11 points in his next 15 games and finished the season with 15 points in 35 games. 2010 also saw a breakout year for the last pick in the 2005 Draft, Patric Hornqvist, as the 23-year-old Swede scored 30 in the 2009ÿ10 season, becoming the fourth Predator to do so (the others being Steve Sullivan, Paul Kariya and Jason Arnott). The Predators qualified for the 2010 playoffs, facing the Chicago Blackhawks in the first round. The Predators earned their first postseason road win on April 16, 2010 when they beat the Blackhawks 4ÿ1 at the United Center, although they lost the overall series in six games.\\r\\nOn July 9, 2010, the Predators announced that defenseman Shea Weber would become the club's fifth captain. In the following years' playoffs, the Predators advanced to the second round of the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. They defeated the Anaheim Ducks in the first round, winning the fourth game of the series at Bridgestone Arena on April 24, 2011. Two days prior, Predators' goaltender Pekka Rinne was nominated as a Vezina Trophy finalist for his performance during the 2010ÿ11 season.[16] The Predators played against the number-one ranked team in the NHL in the second round, the Vancouver Canucks. The Predators lost the series 4ÿ2.\\r\\nOn June 22, 2011, the Predators unveiled their modified logo set for the 2011ÿ12 season. With the color scheme simplified to blue, gold and white and eliminating orange, silver and steel, the Predators cleaned up their primary logo and wordmark. A new alternate logo incorporating elements from a guitar pick and the Tennessee state flag was also introduced.[17]\\r\\nIn the beginning of the 2011ÿ12 season, on November 3, 2011, the Predators signed goaltender Pekka Rinne to a seven-year, $49?million deal. It was the largest contract awarded in Predators' history, as well as making Rinne the highest paid goaltender in the NHL that year. On February 27, 2012, during the NHL's trade deadline, the Predators acquired Andrei Kostitsyn and Paul Gaustad from the Montreal Canadiens and the Buffalo Sabres, respectively. The Predators surrendered draft picks to bolster their team for the 2012 playoffs. The season also saw the return of Russian forward Alexander Radulov to the Predators after a four-year hiatus to play in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). For the second year in a row, and the second time in the team's history, the Predators won a first-round series in the Stanley Cup playoffs, defeating the Red Wings in a best-of-seven series 4ÿ1.[18] However, for the second year in a row, the Predators were ousted in the Western Conference second round, this time to the Phoenix Coyotes.\\r\\nThe following 2012ÿ13 season as a result of the 2012ÿ13 NHL lockout. The Predators failed to qualify for the playoffs in the shortened season, the first time they failed to do so since the 2008-09 season. After the season, the Predators signed Weber through a front-loaded $110?million, 14-year offer sheet, $68?million of it as a signing bonus, from the Philadelphia Flyers on July 19. The offer sheet was the richest in NHL history in terms of total money, money per season, and length, surpassing the previous offer sheet record set by Thomas Vanek.\\r\\nThe following season saw the departure of center David Legwand, the first player ever drafted by the Predators, the club's all-time leading scorer, and was co-leading scorer for the season at the time. Agreeing to waive his \\"no-trade clause\\", he was traded on March 5, 2014, to his hometown team, the Detroit Red Wings, in exchange for prospect forward Calle Jarnkrok, forward Patrick Eaves and a third-round pick in the upcoming 2014 NHL Entry Draft.[19] After missing the playoffs for a second season in a row, the Predators opted not to renew the contract of Barry Trotz as its head coach after 15 years, although he was offered an unnamed position within the organization. On May 6, 2014, the Predators announced Peter Laviolette as their new head coach.\\r\\nIn Peter Laviolette's first season as the Predators' head coach, the Predators finished second in the Central Division. Despite having home advantage in the first round of the 2015 playoffs, they lost the first round in six games to the Chicago Blackhawks, who went on to win the Stanley Cup. For the following 2015ÿ16 season, the Predators finished as the Western Conference's first wild-card, earning 96 points. When they advanced to the second-round after beating the Anaheim Ducks in Game 7, it was the franchise's first seven-game series and seven-game series win. They were eliminated in seven games by the San Jose Sharks, who went on to win the conference.\\r\\nIn the 2016 off-season, on June 29, 2016, the Predators traded Weber to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for defenseman P. K. Subban. The trade surprised many hockey fans because the details to this trade were kept strictly confidential until the deal was already made. On September 7, 2016, the Predators announced Mike Fisher would replace Weber as the sixth captain of the club.\\r\\nIn the 2016ÿ17 season, the Predators finished fourth in the Central Division with 94 points, which earned them the second wild card spot in the Western Conference. The 2016ÿ17 season marked the first time the Predators sold out all 41 regular season home games. Their eighth-place finish in the conference gave them a first-round Stanley Cup playoff matchup against the Chicago Blackhawks, who finished first in the conference during the regular season.\\r\\nThe Predators swept the Blackhawks in four games. This was the first time that an eighth seed swept a playoff series against the top seed in the conference in NHL history as well as the first time that there had been a sweep by an eighth seed against a top seed in a best-of-seven playoff series in the history of North American major league professional sports.[20] In the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, the Predators defeated the St. Louis Blues in six games, marking the first time the team advanced to the Western Conference Finals. On May 16, the Predators became the first team in 20 years (since the Detroit Red Wings in 1997) to achieve ten-straight wins at home in the postseason.[21] On May 22, 2017 the Predators defeated the Anaheim Ducks 6ÿ3 and won the series four games to two, winning the Western Conference, and advancing to the club's first Stanley Cup Finals.[22] In the Finals, the Predators went down 2ÿ0 against the Penguins, although the Predators battled back and evened the series at two, winning Games 3 and 4 at home. Returning to Pittsburgh, the Predators lost 6ÿ0 before being eliminated at home 2ÿ0 in game 6 of the Finals.\\r\\nOn April 5, 2018, the Predators clinched their first division title in team history while also claiming their first Presidents' Trophy.[23] They defeated the Colorado Avalanche in the first round of the playoffs in six games, and then lost to the Winnipeg Jets in seven games in the second round.\\r\\nThe Nashville Predators have played their home games at Bridgestone Arena since their inaugural season in 1998. Opened in 1996, Bridgestone Arena is a multi-purpose venue in downtown Nashville. The Predators' practice facility is located at Centennial Sportsplex, a multi-use athletic complex located next to Centennial Park. Both facilities are owned by the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County.\\r\\nFans of the Nashville Predators have modified the octopus-throwing tradition of Detroit Red Wings fans to show their support: on occasion, a fan will throw a catfish onto the ice. The Tennessean newspaper of Nashville cites the first instance of this as being on October 30, 2003.[24] On May 16, 2017, during Game 3 of the Western Conference Final at Bridgestone Arena, country music singer, songwriter, and record producer Keith Urban, who had performed the National Anthem prior to the game, was seen on the Jumbotron hoisting a massive catfish that Tennessee Titans left tackle, Taylor Lewan had with him at the game.[25] Lewan, along with fellow Titans offensive linemen Jack Conklin, Quinton Spain, Ben Jones, and Josh Klein, and Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota, served as the hype men prior to the game, another Predators playoff tradition prior to home games, which included them waving gold Predators towels, Mariota encouraging the crowd to get louder, Lewan hoisting the catfish, and the offensive linemen chugging beer.[26][27]\\r\\nSection 303 is where a section of fans at the Bridgestone Arena sit, stand, and cheer, colloquially known as The Cellblock. The group refers to themselves as \\"the loudest section of the loudest arena in the NHL.\\"[28] The fan-based organization has been recognized by the Predators' front office. A large banner was produced by the front office for posting on the wall behind the section.\\r\\nOn April 3, 2008, with the Predators clinging to a 3ÿ2 lead with 4:30 in their final home game of the regular season, a sellout crowd at what was then known as the Sommet Center, gave the team a standing ovation through the entirety of the final TV timeout. The Predators went on to win the game against the St. Louis Blues and advanced to the playoffs that year, where the \\"standing O\\" during the final TV timeout has since become a fan tradition.\\r\\nThe mascot of the Predators is Gnash, a blue saber-toothed cat. Introduced in 1998, Gnash's trademark includes stunts, such as very fast rappels, zip lines, and a pendulum swing that takes him under the scoreboard and just inches off the ice. To go along with the saber-toothed cat mascot, Predators fans proudly use their Fang Fingers during each power play of the game. There are foam saber-fang gloves that can be purchased, but most fans simply curl their index and middle fingers on each hand into fang shapes and brandish them in an up-and-down motion. Fang Fingers are done to the horror sounds from the Alfred Hitchcock movie, Psycho.[29]\\r\\nFans are also known for a variety of chants taunting players of the opposing team, particularly the goalie. For example, after each Predators goal, fans call the opposing goalie's name, accompanied by shouts of \\"It's all your fault\\" and other epithets. These cheers are sometimes said to originate from tradition at college football games,[30] but some of these derive from traditions held by fans of pre-NHL hockey clubs Nashville Dixie Flyers, Nashville South Stars, Nashville Nighthawks, and Nashville Knights.[31] Nashville's fanbase is said by many to be among the loudest in the National Hockey League, with sound levels reaching over 120?dB during the playoffs. This has contributed to the team also being called \\"Smashville\\".[32]\\r\\nFor the 2011ÿ12 season, the Nashville Predators changed their jersey design and color scheme. The home jerseys are a bright gold with navy and white highlights, while the away jerseys are white with gold and navy highlights. Furthermore, the Predators changed their logo, making it purely white, gold and navy. The jerseys have a guitar pick on the shoulder with the Tennessee state tri-star inside it, lines meant to be guitar lines on the numbers, and piano keys along the neck line inside the jersey as a nod to Nashville's internationally-known music heritage. From the 2016ÿ17 season gold helmets became a permanent part of the home uniform.[33]\\r\\nThe franchise was initially owned by a group led by Craig Leipold. On May 23, 2007, Leipold was reported to have reached a tentative agreement to sell the team to Research in Motion chairman and co-CEO Jim Balsillie.[34] At the time, Leipold indicated that the team would play the 2007ÿ08 season in Nashville but that the future of the team after that was not clear.[35]\\r\\nOn June 23, information was leaked by several sources indicating that Leipold no longer wanted to sell the Predators to Balsillie.[36] Subsequently, a campaign to land the team in Kansas City, Missouri, received a boost in late June 2007.[37] The Canadian National Post, citing anonymous sources, reported that Leipold planned to sell the team to San Jose venture capitalist William \\"Boots\\" Del Biaggio III, who wanted to relocate the club to Kansas City's new Sprint Center for the 2008ÿ09 season.[37] Del Biaggio, who had a contract with Anschutz Entertainment Group to own an NHL club that would play home games in Sprint Center, had made an offer reported to be for about $190?million for the Predators. Del Biaggio had entered an agreement two years earlier, in 2005, to purchase the Pittsburgh Penguins, but the club backed out of the deal after it won the NHL draft lottery and took Sidney Crosby with the first overall pick.[37]\\r\\nOn July 19, 2007, a group of local business owners known as Our Team Nashville held a rally at the Sommet Center to encourage fans to buy season tickets in order to help the Predators meet the attendance figures needed to keep the team in Nashville. They drew approximately 7,500 fans and sold the equivalent of 726 full season tickets during the rally.[38] The rally was heavily supported by George Plaster, then a sportscaster on WGFX 104.5 \\"The Zone\\" sports radio in Nashville. On August 1, 2007, the group released a letter of intent from Craig Leipold.[39] After negotiations with the City of Nashville, the local group headed by David Freeman reached an agreement with Nashville Mayor Karl Dean, and the NHL Board of Governors approved the sale on November 29, 2007. The $172?million acquisition of the Nashville Predators included repayment of existing debt of approximately $61?million and $2.2?million in fees and expenses. The sale of the Predators to the Tennessee-based group included Del Biaggio, who had been trying to move the team to Kansas City. The locally based buyers held 73% of the team, while Del Biaggio and a minority partner acquired about 27% of the club.\\r\\nIn June 2008, Del Biaggio ran into legal trouble over a multitude of unpaid loans, culminating in his filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[40] Furthermore, it was alleged that Del Biaggio acquired the loans he used to buy his stake in the team through fraudulent means, prompting an FBI investigation and criminal charges.[41] The charges culminated in a 97-month prison sentence for Del Biaggio. Under United States bankruptcy law, a trustee was appointed to sell Del Biaggio's assets, including his stake in the Predators, to pay off his creditors.[42] In November 2011, it was announced that Calgary businessman W. Brett Wilson had purchased a 5% interest in the Nashville Predators.[43]\\r\\nOn March 1, 2010, during the 2009ÿ10 season, the Predator's front office saw Freeman stepped down as chairman of the Nashville Predators in favor of Thomas Cigarran.[44] Cigarran announced on September 2 that the local ownership group had completed the purchase of the Del Biaggio stake.[45]\\r\\nOn June 23, 2016, Freeman filed a $250?million lawsuit against the Nashville Predators and Cigarran. His claim was that his ownership stake has been improperly diluted by Cigarran failing to notify him of capital calls, and that he had not received loan guaranty fees that the ownership group had agreed to pay him.[46] The lawsuit stated that Freeman initially owned a 48% share, while the holding company for the Nashville Predators stated that Freeman controlled less than 1% of ownership in the team at the time of the suit.[47] This dilution was exacerbated by the existence of two classes of investments in the Predators: the common units owned by Freeman were subject to capital calls; the Series A units originally owned by Del Biaggio and his minority partner were not subject to capital calls.[48]\\r\\nThe dispute was sent to court-ordered arbitration on July 29, 2016, under the supervision of NHL commissioner Gary Bettman.[49] As of January 25, 2018, arbitration was continuing in the unresolved dispute.[50] The outcome may remain undislosed, as the arbitration is private.[51]\\r\\nThis is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Predators.

Arising from the medieval practice of granting respected citizens freedom from serfdom, the tradition still lives on in countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand ÿ although today the title of \\"freeman\\" confers no special privileges. The Freedom of the City can also be granted by municipal authorities to military units which have earned the city's trust; in this context, it is sometimes called the Freedom of Entry. This allows them the freedom to parade through the city, and is an affirmation of the bond between the regiment and the citizenry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe honour was sometimes accompanied by a \\"freedom box\\", a small gold box inscribed to record the occasion; these are not usual today. In some countries, such as the United States, esteemed residents and visitors may instead be presented with the Key to the City, a similarly symbolic honour. Other US cities award Honorary Citizenship, with just a certificate.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreedom of the City is an ancient honour granted to martial organisations, allowing them the privilege to march into the city \\"with drums beating, colours flying, and bayonets fixed\\".[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis honour dates back to ancient Rome which regarded the \\"pomerium\\", the boundary of the city, as sacred. Promagistrates and generals were forbidden from entering it, and resigned their imperium immediately upon crossing it. An exception was made for victory celebrations (called triumphs), during which the victorious general would be permitted to enter for one day only. Under the Republic, soldiers also lost their status when entering, becoming citizens: thus soldiers at their general's triumph wore civilian dress. Weapons were also banned inside the pomerium for religious and traditional reasons. (The assassination of Julius Caesar occurred outside this boundary.)\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar laws were passed by other European cities throughout the Medieval era, to protect public security and civic rights, even against their own king's troops. As a result, soldiers would be forced to camp outside the walls of the city during the winter months. The Freedom of the City was an honour granted only to troops which had earned the trust of the local populace, either through some valiant action or simply by being a familiar presence.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, martial freedom of the city is an entirely ceremonial honour, usually bestowed upon a unit with historic ties to the area, as a token of appreciation for their long and dedicated service. The awarding of the Freedom is often accompanied by a celebratory parade through the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nA slightly more common freedom of the city is connected to the medieval concept of \\"free status\\", when city and town charters drew a distinction between freemen and vassals of a feudal lord. As such, freemen actually pre-date 'boroughs'. Early freedom of the boroughs ceremonies had great importance in affirming that the recipient enjoyed privileges such as the right to trade and own property, and protection within the town.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn modern society, the award of honorary freedom of the city or borough tends to be entirely ceremonial, given by the local government in many towns and cities on those who have served in some exceptional capacity, or upon any whom the city wishes to bestow an honour.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore parliamentary reform in 1832, freedom of the city or town conferred the right to vote in the 'parliamentary boroughs' for the MPs. Until the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 the freemen were the exclusive electorate for some of the boroughs. These two acts together curtailed the power of the freemen and extended the franchise to all 'householders' (defined as local rate payers; in fact therefore property owners). The private property belonging to the freemen collectively was retained. The freemen of York, Oxford and Newcastle upon Tyne still own considerable areas within their towns, although the income is effectively given to support charitable objects. The Local Government Act 1972 specifically preserved freemen's rights.[2] The Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 removed any restrictions entitling only men to be freemen.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the grant of honorary freedom in the United Kingdom is governed by the Local Government Act 1972 (as amended by the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009). The 1972 Act enabled the councils of cities, royal boroughs, boroughs, and parishes (or, in Wales, communities) with the status of a royal town to confer the status of honorary freeman on \\"persons of distinction and persons who have, in the opinion of the council, rendered eminent services\\" to the local area.[4] The 2009 Act extends the ability to grant the status of honorary freeman to any county, city, district, borough, town, parish or community council (so removing the requirement for the town to have 'royal' status, and also enabling county councils to confer the honour).[5] A special meeting of the council can grant the honour by passing a resolution with a two-thirds majority at a specially convened meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact qualifications for borough freedom differ between each city or town, but generally fall into two categories, 'patrimony' (inheritance) and 'servitude' (apprenticeship). For example, in Chester, only the children or grandchildren of freemen may apply for admission. In York, this extends to great- and great-great-grandchildren, and apprenticeship to a freeman of the city will also allow admission.[6] In Great Grimsby, the widow of a freeman passes his rights to her second husband, who retains the privilege after either divorce from or death of the widow. The borough freedom is strongest in York, Chester, Newcastle upon Tyne and Coventry; in Coventry, freedom is qualified by having served an apprenticeship. Durham and Northampton have extended their admission criteria to those who have served an apprenticeship without being 'bound' (trained) by a freeman directly. Freemen of Newcastle upon Tyne are bestowed the right to graze cattle on the town moor.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn England, the most established borough freedom is that conferred by the Freedom of the City of London, first recorded in 1237. This is closely tied to the role and status of the livery companies. From 1835, the freedom \\"without the intervention of a Livery Company\\" has been bestowed by a general resolution of Common Council, by \\"redemption\\" (purchase), at one time for an onerous sum, but now for a donation to the Freemen's School.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew freemen are enrolled in a ceremony in Guildhall, when they receive a guide to conducting their lives in an honourable fashion and an impressive sealed certificate. Freemen's children get admission preference at the City of London Freemen's School. There are a number of rights traditionally but apocryphally associated with freementhe right to drive sheep and cattle over London Bridge; to a silken rope, if hanged; to carry a naked sword in public; or that if the City of London Police finds a freeman drunk and incapable, they will bundle him or her into a taxi and send them home rather than throw them into a cell. While sheep have occasionally been driven over London Bridge on special occasions, the rest of these \\"privileges\\" are now effectively symbolic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe right to herd sheep and cattle across London's four bridges technically no longer applies, as there are no livestock markets in the city.[9] Nevertheless, this right has been exercised, or the city has granted permission, periodically in modern times:\\r\\n\\r\\nYork has a long history of freemen dating back to the Anglo-Saxon period, with records dating back to 1272.[16]  Freemen may claim their rights through patronage (as far back as their great-great-grandparent, there are records of women being admitted in York in medieval times, a right forgotten for a time until the late 1970s when the Gild carried out research and rediscovered it) or apprenticeship. Once 'sworn in', freemen can join the Gild (Archaic spelling used) of Freemen who continue to take an interest in the affairs of the city.  New admissions are made every year (usually October) following an admission ceremony with the Lord Mayor at the Guildhall.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Ireland, borough freedom of the city is generally given to noted foreign and national dignitaries and the list rarely exceeds a few dozen. As in the United Kingdom, the title generally comes with various ancient privileges ÿ for instance, freemen of Dublin are allowed the right to vote in certain elections, bring goods for sale in the city without customs and the right to pasture sheep on common ground such as College Green and St. Stephen's Green.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some countries, such as the United States, an ornamental key ÿ the \\"Key to the City\\" ÿ is presented to esteemed visitors, residents, or others whom the city wishes to honour. This practice is a variation on the Freedom of the City tradition, and has a similar symbolic meaning; evoking medieval walled cities, the gates of which would be guarded during the day and locked at night, the key symbolises the freedom of the recipient to enter and leave the city at will, as a trusted friend of city residents.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some cities in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, the key to the city is given to the so-called \\"prince carnival?(nl)\\" who leads the carnivals which take place the week prior to Septuagesima. The tradition is that the mayor steps down for this period and power is transferred to the prince carnival, who then returns the key at the end of Shrove Tuesday/Mardi Gras. Today, the handing over of the key is mostly symbolic and marks the start and end of the carnival.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Calgary, Alberta, Canada, instead of a key, esteemed visitors receive a white cowboy hat and usually recite one of two oaths (one formal, the other more silly) to become honorary Calgarians.[18]","input":"What is a freedom of the city award?"},{"output":"Sunaina","context":"Main Tera Hero (translation: I'm Your Hero) is a 2014 Indian romantic action comedy film, directed by David Dhawan and produced by Shobha Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor for Balaji Motion Pictures.This film was tribute to Govinda. The film stars Nargis Fakhri, Varun Dhawan and Ileana D'Cruz in the lead roles.[3][4] Principal photography for the movie began on 30 May 2013, filming started on 5 July 2013 and was completed by 15 October. The film released on 4 April 2014 to mixed reviews from critics, though managed to earn the verdict of semi-hit at the box office.[5][6] It is a remake of the 2011 Telugu film Kandireega starring Ram Pothineni and Hansika Motwani .[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross a college in Ooty, Sreenath Prasad aka 'Seenu' (Varun Dhawan) fails his final exam by two marks. Eager to get a degree, he kidnaps the professor's daughter during her wedding and demands his professor to give him two more marks in exchange for his daughter. Seenu accidentally lets go of her however while letting his parents in to his house, and his plan fails.\\r\\nAlthough Seenu's father offers him a job at his auto stand, Seen plans to get a degree at Tift College in Bengaluru. He leaves Ooty on a train headed for Bengaluru. On the train, he beats up a gang harming a group of teenage girls. When Seenu arrives in Bengaluru, a friend of his who lives there reluctantly allows him to stay in his house.\\r\\nOnce Seenu arrives in Tift College, he prays to Krishna (Salman Khan) to concentrate on nothing but studies. However once he finishes, he sees a girl named Sunaina (Ileana D'Cruz) and gets attracted to her. He tries to get her attention, but she ignores him constantly. She tells him that she has been forced into marrying a corrupt policeman named Angad Negi (Arunoday Singh) since he tricked her father into shooting Angad's sidekick and friend Peter's (Rajpal Yadav)arm. Angad's men chase Seenu until he beats up two of them and scares away the rest. Seenu goes to Angad to make a truce with him and leave Sunaina, but Angad (believing he cannot do it) gives Seenu a chance to try to woo Sunaina for up to three days. Seenu publicly tells Sunaina he loves her and tells her not to be afraid of Angad and his goons. She gains courage, scares off Angad's men, and falls in love with Seenu. Angad finds Seenu, finds out what happened, and attempts to shoot Seenu, but instead accidentally shoots Peter. The media quickly finds out and Angad gets suspended as a police officer.\\r\\nAll seems well until Sunaina is kidnapped and taken away in a helicopter. Seenu learns from Angad that Sunaina will be taken to the mansion of Vikrant Singhal (Anupham Kher), one of Asia's most notorious gangsters. Vikrant's daughter, Ayesha (Nargis Fakhri), was on the Ooty to Bangalore train Seenu was in and was attracted by his impressive fighting skills. She told her father about the experience as well as her interest in marrying him. Angad and Peter told Vikrant's men that in order to get Seenu, they would have to take Sunaina to lure him to their place, forcing Seenu to marry Ayesha.\\r\\nIn the second half of the film, Seenu goes to Vikrant's residence in Bangkok, Thailand. He tricks Vikrant and his friend and associate Balli (Saurabh Shukla) into thinking that he wants to marry Ayesha. However, he requests that he is given ten days to get to know Ayesha before the wedding day, which Vikrant initially refuses until Ayesha tells her father to \\"do as Seenu says\\". Ayesha lets Sunaina wear any of her clothes because she has an \\"extra piece\\" for all of her clothing. Ayesha and Seenu spend the day together; later, Seenu tells Ayesha that she does not love him. When Angad and Peter come later, she then falls in love with Angad through a sheer coincidence.\\r\\nSeenu and Sunaina use Ayesha's love for Angad as a way of solving their problem. Sunaina wears identical clothes to Ayesha; in result, Angad confuses Sunaina for Ayesha, making Ayesha believe that Angad loves her. The plan later fails, though, when Angad realizes this and tricks Ayesha once again into marrying Seenu. Angad is tricked by Seenu and Sunaina into kissing Ayesha, but Vikrant sees this and points his gun at Angad to shoot him, but Ayesha steps in between and stops him saying that she loves Angad. Seeing this, Angad realizes that Ayeshas love for him is true and that Ayesha is the right girl for him, not Sunaina and decides to marry Ayesha. Vikrant realizes his daughter loves Angad and reluctantly tells Seenu that Ayesha will marry Angad. Seenu pretends to be agonized but celebrates later. Ayesha marries Angad, and Vikrant convinces Sunaina (who is also pretending to hate Seenu) to marry Seenu, by saying that he took 10 days to hatch a plan to bring Ayesha and Angad together, not to get to know Ayesha (not realizing that this is true!)

Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72,[2] and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir Titus.[3] Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81ÿ96).[4] These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name (Flavius).\\r\\nThe Colosseum could hold, it is estimated, between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators,[5][6] having an average audience of some 65,000;[7][8] it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles (for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities), animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.\\r\\nAlthough partially ruined because of damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome. It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit \\"Way of the Cross\\" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum.[9]\\r\\nThe Colosseum is also depicted on the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin.\\r\\nThe Colosseum's original Latin name was Amphitheatrum Flavium, often anglicized as Flavian Amphitheatre. The building was constructed by emperors of the Flavian dynasty, following the reign of Nero.[10] This name is still used in modern English, but generally the structure is better known as the Colosseum. In antiquity, Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name Amphitheatrum Caesareum (with Caesareum an adjective pertaining to the title Caesar), but this name may have been strictly poetic[11][12] as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum; Vespasian and Titus, builders of the Colosseum, also constructed an amphitheater of the same name in Puteoli (modern Pozzuoli).[13]\\r\\nThe name Colosseum has long been believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero nearby[4] (the statue of Nero was named after the Colossus of Rhodes).[citation needed] This statue was later remodeled by Nero's successors into the likeness of Helios (Sol) or Apollo, the sun god, by adding the appropriate solar crown. Nero's head was also replaced several times with the heads of succeeding emperors. Despite its pagan links, the statue remained standing well into the medieval era and was credited with magical powers. It came to be seen as an iconic symbol of the permanence of Rome.\\r\\nIn the 8th century, a famous epigram attributed to the Venerable Bede celebrated the symbolic significance of the statue in a prophecy that is variously quoted: Quamdiu stat Colis?us, stat et Roma; quando cadet colis?us, cadet et Roma; quando cadet Roma, cadet et mundus (\\"as long as the Colossus stands, so shall Rome; when the Colossus falls, Rome shall fall; when Rome falls, so falls the world\\").[14] This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus (as in, for instance, Byron's poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage). However, at the time that the Pseudo-Bede wrote, the masculine noun coliseus was applied to the statue rather than to what was still known as the Flavian amphitheatre.\\r\\nThe Colossus did eventually fall, possibly being pulled down to reuse its bronze. By the year 1000 the name \\"Colosseum\\" had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre. The statue itself was largely forgotten and only its base survives, situated between the Colosseum and the nearby Temple of Venus and Roma.[15]\\r\\nThe name further evolved to Coliseum during the Middle Ages. In Italy, the amphitheatre is still known as il Colosseo, and other Romance languages have come to use similar forms such as Coloseumul (Romanian), le Colise (French), el Coliseo (Spanish) and o Coliseu (Portuguese).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine Hills, through which a canalised stream ran. By the 2nd century BC the area was densely inhabited. It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64, following which Nero seized much of the area to add to his personal domain. He built the grandiose Domus Aurea on the site, in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions, gardens and porticoes. The existing Aqua Claudia aqueduct was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze Colossus of Nero was set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus Aurea.[15]\\r\\nAlthough the Colossus was preserved, much of the Domus Aurea was torn down. The lake was filled in and the land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre. Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were constructed nearby within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea. Vespasian's decision to build the Colosseum on the site of Nero's lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use. In contrast to many other amphitheatres, which were located on the outskirts of a city, the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre; in effect, placing it both symbolically and precisely at the heart of Rome.\\r\\nConstruction was funded by the opulent spoils taken from the Jewish Temple after the Great Jewish Revolt in 70 AD led to the Siege of Jerusalem. According to a reconstructed inscription found on the site, \\"the emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general's share of the booty.\\" Along with the spoils, estimated 100,000 Jewish prisoners were brought back to Rome after the war, and many contributed to the massive workforce needed for construction. The slaves undertook manual labor such as working in the quarries at Tivoli where the travertine was quarried, along with lifting and transporting the quarried stones 20 miles from Tivoli to Rome.[16] Along with this free source of unskilled labor, teams of professional Roman builders, engineers, artists, painters and decorators undertook the more specialized tasks necessary for building the Colosseum.\\r\\nConstruction of the Colosseum began under the rule of Vespasian[4] in around 70ÿ72 AD (73-75 AD according to some sources)[16] The Colosseum had been completed up to the third story by the time of Vespasian's death in 79. The top level was finished by his son, Titus, in 80,[4] and the inaugural games were held in A.D. 80 or 81.[16] Dio Cassius recounts that over 9,000 wild animals were killed during the inaugural games of the amphitheatre. Commemorative coinage was issued celebrating the inauguration.[17] The building was remodelled further under Vespasian's younger son, the newly designated Emperor Domitian, who constructed the hypogeum, a series of underground tunnels used to house animals and slaves. He also added a gallery to the top of the Colosseum to increase its seating capacity.[18]\\r\\nIn 217, the Colosseum was badly damaged by a major fire (caused by lightning, according to Dio Cassius[19]) which destroyed the wooden upper levels of the amphitheatre's interior. It was not fully repaired until about 240 and underwent further repairs in 250 or 252 and again in 320. Gladiatorial fights are last mentioned around 435. An inscription records the restoration of various parts of the Colosseum under Theodosius II and Valentinian III (reigned 425ÿ455), possibly to repair damage caused by a major earthquake in 443; more work followed in 484[20] and 508. The arena continued to be used for contests well into the 6th century. Animal hunts continued until at least 523, when Anicius Maximus celebrated his consulship with some venationes, criticised by King Theodoric the Great for their high cost.[15]\\r\\nThe Colosseum underwent several radical changes of use during the medieval period. By the late 6th century a small chapel had been built into the structure of the amphitheater, though this apparently did not confer any particular religious significance on the building as a whole. The arena was converted into a cemetery. The numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades under the seating were converted into housing and workshops, and are recorded as still being rented out as late as the 12th century. Around 1200 the Frangipani family took over the Colosseum and fortified it, apparently using it as a castle.\\r\\nSevere damage was inflicted on the Colosseum by the great earthquake in 1349, causing the outer south side, lying on a less stable alluvial terrain, to collapse. Much of the tumbled stone was reused to build palaces, churches, hospitals and other buildings elsewhere in Rome. A religious order moved into the northern third of the Colosseum in the mid-14th century [21] and continued to inhabit it until as late as the early 19th century. The interior of the amphitheater was extensively stripped of stone, which was reused elsewhere, or (in the case of the marble fa?ade) was burned to make quicklime.[15] The bronze clamps which held the stonework together were pried or hacked out of the walls, leaving numerous pockmarks which still scar the building today.\\r\\nDuring the 16th and 17th century, Church officials sought a productive role for the Colosseum. Pope Sixtus V (1585ÿ1590) planned to turn the building into a wool factory to provide employment for Rome's prostitutes, though this proposal fell through with his premature death.[22] In 1671 Cardinal Altieri authorized its use for bullfights; a public outcry caused the idea to be hastily abandoned.\\r\\nIn 1749, Pope Benedict XIV endorsed the view that the Colosseum was a sacred site where early Christians had been martyred. He forbade the use of the Colosseum as a quarry and consecrated the building to the Passion of Christ and installed Stations of the Cross, declaring it sanctified by the blood of the Christian martyrs who perished there (see Significance in Christianity). However, there is no historical evidence to support Benedict's claim, nor is there even any evidence that anyone before the 16th century suggested this might be the case; the Catholic Encyclopedia concludes that there are no historical grounds for the supposition, other than the reasonably plausible conjecture that some of the many martyrs may well have been.[23]\\r\\nLater popes initiated various stabilization and restoration projects, removing the extensive vegetation which had overgrown the structure and threatened to damage it further. The fa?ade was reinforced with triangular brick wedges in 1807 and 1827, and the interior was repaired in 1831, 1846 and in the 1930s. The arena substructure was partly excavated in 1810ÿ1814 and 1874 and was fully exposed under Benito Mussolini in the 1930s.[15]\\r\\nThe Colosseum is today one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions, receiving millions of visitors annually. The effects of pollution and general deterioration over time prompted a major restoration programme carried out between 1993 and 2000, at a cost of 40?billion Italian lire ($19.3m / ?20.6m at 2000 prices).\\r\\nIn recent years the Colosseum has become a symbol of the international campaign against capital punishment, which was abolished in Italy in 1948. Several antiÿdeath penalty demonstrations took place in front of the Colosseum in 2000. Since that time, as a gesture against the death penalty, the local authorities of Rome change the color of the Colosseum's night time illumination from white to gold whenever a person condemned to the death penalty anywhere in the world gets their sentence commuted or is released,[24] or if a jurisdiction abolishes the death penalty. Most recently, the Colosseum was illuminated in gold in November 2012 following the abolishment of capital punishment in the American state of Connecticut in April 2012.[25]\\r\\nBecause of the ruined state of the interior, it is impractical to use the Colosseum to host large events; only a few hundred spectators can be accommodated in temporary seating. However, much larger concerts have been held just outside, using the Colosseum as a backdrop. Performers who have played at the Colosseum in recent years have included Ray Charles (May 2002),[26] Paul McCartney (May 2003),[27] Elton John (September 2005),[28] and Billy Joel (July 2006).\\r\\nUnlike earlier Greek theatres that were built into hillsides, the Colosseum is an entirely free-standing structure. It derives its basic exterior and interior architecture from that of two Roman theatres back to back. It is elliptical in plan and is 189 meters (615?ft / 640 Roman feet) long, and 156 meters (510?ft / 528 Roman feet) wide, with a base area of 24,000 square metres (6 acres). The height of the outer wall is 48 meters (157?ft / 165 Roman feet). The perimeter originally measured 545 meters (1,788?ft / 1,835 Roman feet). The central arena is an oval 87?m (287?ft) long and 55?m (180?ft) wide, surrounded by a wall 5?m (15?ft) high, above which rose tiers of seating.\\r\\nThe outer wall is estimated to have required over 100,000 cubic metres (3,531,467 cubic feet) of travertine stone which were set without mortar; they were held together by 300 tons of iron clamps.[15] However, it has suffered extensive damage over the centuries, with large segments having collapsed following earthquakes. The north side of the perimeter wall is still standing; the distinctive triangular brick wedges at each end are modern additions, having been constructed in the early 19th century to shore up the wall. The remainder of the present-day exterior of the Colosseum is in fact the original interior wall.\\r\\nThe surviving part of the outer wall's monumental fa?ade comprises three stories of superimposed arcades surmounted by a podium on which stands a tall attic, both of which are pierced by windows interspersed at regular intervals. The arcades are framed by half-columns of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, while the attic is decorated with Corinthian pilasters.[29] Each of the arches in the second- and third-floor arcades framed statues, probably honoring divinities and other figures from Classical mythology.\\r\\nTwo hundred and forty mast corbels were positioned around the top of the attic. They originally supported a retractable awning, known as the velarium, that kept the sun and rain off spectators. This consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of ropes, with a hole in the center.[4] It covered two-thirds of the arena, and sloped down towards the center to catch the wind and provide a breeze for the audience. Sailors, specially enlisted from the Roman naval headquarters at Misenum and housed in the nearby Castra Misenatium, were used to work the velarium.[30]\\r\\nThe Colosseum's huge crowd capacity made it essential that the venue could be filled or evacuated quickly. Its architects adopted solutions very similar to those used in modern stadiums to deal with the same problem. The amphitheatre was ringed by eighty entrances at ground level, 76 of which were used by ordinary spectators.[4] Each entrance and exit was numbered, as was each staircase. The northern main entrance was reserved for the Roman Emperor and his aides, whilst the other three axial entrances were most likely used by the elite. All four axial entrances were richly decorated with painted stucco reliefs, of which fragments survive. Many of the original outer entrances have disappeared with the collapse of the perimeter wall, but entrances XXIII (23) to LIV (54) survive.[15]\\r\\nSpectators were given tickets in the form of numbered pottery shards, which directed them to the appropriate section and row. They accessed their seats via vomitoria (singular vomitorium), passageways that opened into a tier of seats from below or behind. These quickly dispersed people into their seats and, upon conclusion of the event or in an emergency evacuation, could permit their exit within only a few minutes. The name vomitoria derived from the Latin word for a rapid discharge, from which English derives the word vomit.\\r\\nAccording to the Codex-Calendar of 354, the Colosseum could accommodate 87,000 people, although modern estimates put the figure at around 50,000. They were seated in a tiered arrangement that reflected the rigidly stratified nature of Roman society. Special boxes were provided at the north and south ends respectively for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins, providing the best views of the arena. Flanking them at the same level was a broad platform or podium for the senatorial class, who were allowed to bring their own chairs. The names of some 5th century senators can still be seen carved into the stonework, presumably reserving areas for their use.\\r\\nThe tier above the senators, known as the maenianum primum, was occupied by the non-senatorial noble class or knights (equites). The next level up, the maenianum secundum, was originally reserved for ordinary Roman citizens (plebeians) and was divided into two sections. The lower part (the immum) was for wealthy citizens, while the upper part (the summum) was for poor citizens. Specific sectors were provided for other social groups: for instance, boys with their tutors, soldiers on leave, foreign dignitaries, scribes, heralds, priests and so on. Stone (and later marble) seating was provided for the citizens and nobles, who presumably would have brought their own cushions with them. Inscriptions identified the areas reserved for specific groups.\\r\\nAnother level, the maenianum secundum in legneis, was added at the very top of the building during the reign of Domitian. This comprised a gallery for the common poor, slaves and women. It would have been either standing room only, or would have had very steep wooden benches. Some groups were banned altogether from the Colosseum, notably gravediggers, actors and former gladiators.[15]\\r\\nEach tier was divided into sections (maeniana) by curved passages and low walls (praecinctiones or baltei), and were subdivided into cunei, or wedges, by the steps and aisles from the vomitoria. Each row (gradus) of seats was numbered, permitting each individual seat to be exactly designated by its gradus, cuneus, and number.[31]\\r\\nThe arena itself was 83?meters by 48?meters (272?ft by 157?ft / 280 by 163?Roman feet).[15] It comprised a wooden floor covered by sand (the Latin word for sand is harena or arena), covering an elaborate underground structure called the hypogeum (literally meaning \\"underground\\"). The hypogeum was not part of the original construction but was ordered to be built by Emperor Domitian. Little now remains of the original arena floor, but the hypogeum is still clearly visible. It consisted of a two-level subterranean network of tunnels and cages beneath the arena where gladiators and animals were held before contests began. Eighty vertical shafts provided instant access to the arena for caged animals and scenery pieces concealed underneath; larger hinged platforms, called hegmata, provided access for elephants and the like. It was restructured on numerous occasions; at least twelve different phases of construction can be seen.[15]\\r\\nThe hypogeum was connected by underground tunnels to a number of points outside the Colosseum. Animals and performers were brought through the tunnel from nearby stables, with the gladiators' barracks at the Ludus Magnus to the east also being connected by tunnels. Separate tunnels were provided for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins to permit them to enter and exit the Colosseum without needing to pass through the crowds.[15]\\r\\nSubstantial quantities of machinery also existed in the hypogeum. Elevators and pulleys raised and lowered scenery and props, as well as lifting caged animals to the surface for release. There is evidence for the existence of major hydraulic mechanisms[15] and according to ancient accounts, it was possible to flood the arena rapidly, presumably via a connection to a nearby aqueduct. However, the construction of the hypogeum at Domitian's behest put an end to the practise of flooding, and thus also to naval battles, early in the Colosseum's existence.\\r\\nThe Colosseum and its activities supported a substantial industry in the area. In addition to the amphitheatre itself, many other buildings nearby were linked to the games. Immediately to the east is the remains of the Ludus Magnus, a training school for gladiators. This was connected to the Colosseum by an underground passage, to allow easy access for the gladiators. The Ludus Magnus had its own miniature training arena, which was itself a popular attraction for Roman spectators. Other training schools were in the same area, including the Ludus Matutinus (Morning School), where fighters of animals were trained, plus the Dacian and Gallic Schools.\\r\\nAlso nearby were the Armamentarium, comprising an armory to store weapons; the Summum Choragium, where machinery was stored; the Sanitarium, which had facilities to treat wounded gladiators; and the Spoliarium, where bodies of dead gladiators were stripped of their armor and disposed of.\\r\\nAround the perimeter of the Colosseum, at a distance of 18?m (59?ft) from the perimeter, was a series of tall stone posts, with five remaining on the eastern side. Various explanations have been advanced for their presence; they may have been a religious boundary, or an outer boundary for ticket checks, or an anchor for the velarium or awning.[15]\\r\\nRight next to the Colosseum is also the Arch of Constantine.\\r\\nThe Colosseum was used to host gladiatorial shows as well as a variety of other events. The shows, called munera, were always given by private individuals rather than the state. They had a strong religious element but were also demonstrations of power and family prestige, and were immensely popular with the population. Another popular type of show was the animal hunt, or venatio. This utilized a great variety of wild beasts, mainly imported from Africa and the Middle East, and included creatures such as rhinoceros, hippopotamuses, elephants, giraffes, aurochs, wisents, Barbary lions, panthers, leopards, bears, Caspian tigers, crocodiles and ostriches. Battles and hunts were often staged amid elaborate sets with movable trees and buildings. Such events were occasionally on a huge scale; Trajan is said to have celebrated his victories in Dacia in 107 with contests involving 11,000 animals and 10,000 gladiators over the course of 123 days. During lunch intervals, executions ad bestias would be staged. Those condemned to death would be sent into the arena, naked and unarmed, to face the beasts of death which would literally tear them to pieces. Other performances would also take place by acrobats and magicians, typically during the intervals.\\r\\nDuring the early days of the Colosseum, ancient writers recorded that the building was used for naumachiae (more properly known as navalia proelia) or simulated sea battles. Accounts of the inaugural games held by Titus in AD 80 describe it being filled with water for a display of specially trained swimming horses and bulls. There is also an account of a re-enactment of a famous sea battle between the Corcyrean (Corfiot) Greeks and the Corinthians. This has been the subject of some debate among historians; although providing the water would not have been a problem, it is unclear how the arena could have been waterproofed, nor would there have been enough space in the arena for the warships to move around. It has been suggested that the reports either have the location wrong, or that the Colosseum originally featured a wide floodable channel down its central axis (which would later have been replaced by the hypogeum).[15]\\r\\nSylvae or recreations of natural scenes were also held in the arena. Painters, technicians and architects would construct a simulation of a forest with real trees and bushes planted in the arena's floor, and animals would then be introduced. Such scenes might be used simply to display a natural environment for the urban population, or could otherwise be used as the backdrop for hunts or dramas depicting episodes from mythology. They were also occasionally used for executions in which the hero of the story ÿ played by a condemned person ÿ was killed in one of various gruesome but mythologically authentic ways, such as being mauled by beasts or burned to death.\\r\\nThe Colosseum today is now a major tourist attraction in Rome with thousands of tourists each year paying to view the interior arena, though entrance for citizens of the European Union (EU) is partially subsidised, and entrance is free for EU citizens under eighteen or over sixty-five years of age.[32] There is now a museum dedicated to Eros located in the upper floor of the outer wall of the building. Part of the arena floor has been re-floored. Beneath the Colosseum, a network of subterranean passageways once used to transport wild animals and gladiators to the arena opened to the public in summer 2010.[33]\\r\\nThe Colosseum is also the site of Roman Catholic ceremonies in the 20th and 21st centuries. For instance, Pope Benedict XVI led the Stations of the Cross called the Scriptural Way of the Cross (which calls for more meditation) at the Colosseum[34][35] on Good Fridays.[9]\\r\\nIn 2011 Diego Della Valle, head of the shoe firm Tod's, entered into an agreement with local officials to sponsor a ?25?million restoration of the Colosseum. Work was planned to begin at the end of 2011, taking up to two and a half years.[36] Due to the controversial nature of using a publicÿprivate partnership to fund the restoration, work was delayed and began in 2013. As of 2014[update] the restoration is estimated to be complete by 2016. The restoration is the first full cleaning and repair in the Colosseum's history.[37] The first stage is to clean and restore the Colosseum's arcaded fa?ade and replace the metal enclosures that block the ground-level arches. The project plans to create a services center and to restore the galleries and underground spaces inside the Colosseum, including recreating the wooden floor that once covered the underground spaces.[38]\\r\\nColosseum 2013\\r\\nColosseum 2013\\r\\nColosseum 2012\\r\\nColosseum 2013\\r\\nColosseum 2013\\r\\nColosseum 2013\\r\\nColosseum 2013\\r\\nColosseum 2014\\r\\nThe Colosseum is generally regarded by Christians as a site of the martyrdom of large numbers of believers during the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire, as evidenced by Church history and tradition.[39][40][41] On the other hand, other scholars believe that the majority of martyrdoms may have occurred at other venues within the city of Rome, rather than at the Colosseum, citing a lack of still-intact physical evidence or historical records.[42][43] These scholars assert that \\"some Christians were executed as common criminals in the Colosseumtheir crime being refusal to reverence the Roman gods\\", but most Christian martyrs of the early Church were executed for their faith at the Circus Maximus.[44][45] According to Iren?us (died about 202), Ignatius of Antioch was fed to the lions in Rome around 107 A.D and although Irenaeus says nothing about this happening at the Colosseum, tradition ascribes it to that place.[46][47][48][49]\\r\\nIn the Middle Ages, the Colosseum was not regarded as a monument, and was used as what some modern sources label a \\"quarry,\\"[50] which is to say that stones from the Colosseum were taken for the building of other sacred sites.[51] This fact is used to support the idea that, at a time when sites associated with martyrs were highly venerated the Colosseum was not being treated as a sacred site.[52] It was not included in the itineraries compiled for the use of pilgrims nor in works such as the 12th century Mirabilia Urbis Romae (\\"Marvels of the City of Rome\\"), which claims the Circus Flaminius ÿ but not the Colosseum ÿ as the site of martyrdoms.[53] Part of the structure was inhabited by a Christian religious order, but it is not known whether this was for any particular religious reason.\\r\\nPope Pius V (1566ÿ1572) is said to have recommended that pilgrims gather sand from the arena of the Colosseum to serve as a relic, on the grounds that it was impregnated with the blood of martyrs, although some of his contemporaries did not share his conviction.[54] A century later Fioravante Martinelli listed the Colosseum at the head of a list of places sacred to the martyrs in his 1653 book Roma ex ethnica sacra. Martinelli's book evidently had an effect on public opinion; in response to Cardinal Altieri's proposal some years later to turn the Colosseum into a bullring, Carlo Tomassi published a pamphlet in protest against what he regarded as an act of desecration. The ensuing controversy persuaded Pope Clement X to close the Colosseum's external arcades and declare it a sanctuary.[55]\\r\\nAt the insistence of St. Leonard of Port Maurice, Pope Benedict XIV (1740ÿ1758) forbade the quarrying of the Colosseum and erected Stations of the Cross around the arena, which remained until February 1874.[56] Benedict Joseph Labre spent the later years of his life within the walls of the Colosseum, living on alms, before he died in 1783.[56] Several 19th century popes funded repair and restoration work on the Colosseum, and it still retains its Christian connection today. A Christian cross stands in the Colosseum, with a plaque, stating:\\r\\nThe amphitheater, one consecrated to triumphs, entertainments, and the impious worship of pagan gods, is now dedicated to the sufferings of the martyrs purified from impious superstitions.[46]\\r\\nOther Christian crosses stand in several points around the arena and every Good Friday the Pope leads a Via Crucis procession to the amphitheater.\\r\\nThe Colosseum has a wide and well-documented history of flora ever since Domenico Panaroli made the first catalogue of its plants in 1643. Since then, 684 species have been identified there. The peak was in 1855 (420 species). Attempts were made in 1871 to eradicate the vegetation, because of concerns over the damage that was being caused to the masonry, but much of it has returned.[15] 242 species have been counted today and of the species first identified by Panaroli, 200 remain.\\r\\nThe variation of plants can be explained by the change of climate in Rome through the centuries. Additionally, bird migration, flower blooming, and the growth of Rome that caused the Colosseum to become embedded within the modern city centre rather than on the outskirts of the ancient city, as well as deliberate transport of species, are also contributing causes.

The American invasion, designated Operation Detachment, had the goal of capturing the entire island, including the three Japanese-controlled airfields (including the South Field and the Central Field), to provide a staging area for attacks on the Japanese main islands.[4] This five-week battle comprised some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the Pacific War of World War II.\\r\\nAfter the heavy losses incurred in the battle, the strategic value of the island became controversial. It was useless to the U.S. Army as a staging base and useless to the U.S. Navy as a fleet base.[6] However, Navy Seabees rebuilt the landing strips, which were used as emergency landing strips for USAAF B-29s.[7]\\r\\nThe IJA positions on the island were heavily fortified, with a dense network of bunkers, hidden artillery positions, and 18?km (11?mi) of underground tunnels.[8][9] The American ground forces were supported by extensive naval artillery, and had complete air supremacy provided by U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aviators throughout the entire battle.[10]\\r\\nJapanese combat deaths numbered three times the number of American deaths although, uniquely among Pacific War Marine battles, American total casualties (dead and wounded) exceeded those of the Japanese.[11] Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima at the beginning of the battle, only 216 were taken prisoner, some of whom were captured because they had been knocked unconscious or otherwise disabled.[1] The majority of the remainder were killed in action, although it has been estimated that as many as 3,000 continued to resist within the various cave systems for many days afterwards, eventually succumbing to their injuries or surrendering weeks later.[1][12]\\r\\nDespite the bloody fighting and severe casualties on both sides, the American victory was assured from the start. Overwhelming American superiority in numbers and arms as well as complete air supremacycoupled with the impossibility of Japanese retreat or reinforcement, along with sparse food and suppliespermitted no plausible circumstance in which the Americans could have lost the battle.[13]\\r\\nOn February 18, 1945, the 133rd Naval Construction Battalion (NCB) joined the Fifth Marine Amphibious Corps and the Fourth Marine Division for the amphibious assault on Iwo Jima. The entire force landed on Iwo Jima on D-Day with the first assault wave led by the Fourth Marine Division. The 133rd NCHB suffered severe casualties during the fight for Iwo Jima, where it distinguished itself in both front-line combat and construction. The 133rd NCHC had 370 casualties, more than 40 percent of the 875 men that landed, the highest casualties as part of a single battle in Seabee history.[14]\\r\\nJoe Rosenthal's Associated Press photograph of the raising of the U.S. flag on top of the 169?m (554?ft) Mount Suribachi by six U.S. Marines became an iconic image of the battle and the American war effort in the Pacific.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the American capture of the Marshall Islands, and the devastating air attacks against the Japanese fortress island of Truk Atoll in the Carolines in January 1944, the Japanese military leaders reevaluated their situation. All indications pointed to an American drive toward the Mariana Islands and the Carolines. To counter such an offensive, the IJA and the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) established an inner line of defenses extending generally northward from the Carolines to the Marianas, and thence to Japan via the Volcano Islands, and westward from the Marianas via the Carolines and the Palau Islands to the Philippines.\\r\\nIn March 1944, the Japanese 31st Army, commanded by General Hideyoshi Obata, was activated to garrison this inner line. (Note that a Japanese army was about the size of an American, British Army, or Canadian Army corps. The Japanese Army had many armies, but the U.S. Army only had ten at its peak, with the 4th Army, the 6th Army, the 8th Army, and the 10th Army being in the Pacific Theater. Also, the 10th Army only fought on Okinawa in the spring of 1945.)\\r\\nThe commander of the Japanese garrison on Chichi Jima was placed nominally in command of Army and Navy units in the Volcano Islands.[4] After the American conquest of the Marianas, daily bomber raids from the Marianas hit the mainland as part of Operation Scavenger. Iwo Jima served as an early warning station that radioed reports of incoming bombers back to mainland Japan. This allowed Japanese air defenses to prepare for the arrival of American bombers.[4]\\r\\nAfter the U.S. seized bases in the Marshall Islands in the battles of Kwajalein and Eniwetok in February 1944, Japanese Army and Navy reinforcements were sent to Iwo Jima: 500 men from the naval base at Yokosuka and 500 from Chichi Jima reached Iwo Jima during March and April 1944. At the same time, with reinforcements arriving from Chichi Jima and the home islands, the Army garrison on Iwo Jima reached a strength of more than 5,000 men.[4] The loss of the Marianas during the summer of 1944 greatly increased the importance of the Volcano Islands for the Japanese, who were aware that the loss of these islands would facilitate American air raids against the Home Islands, disrupting war manufacturing and severely damaging civilian morale.[4]\\r\\nFinal Japanese plans for the defense of the Volcano Islands were overshadowed by several factors:\\r\\nIn a postwar study, Japanese staff officers described the strategy that was used in the defense of Iwo Jima in the following terms:\\r\\nIn the light of the above situation, seeing that it was impossible to conduct our air, sea, and ground/ operations on Iwo Island [Jima] toward ultimate victory, it was decided that to gain time necessary for the preparation of the Homeland defense, our forces should rely solely upon the established defensive equipment in that area, checking the enemy by delaying tactics. Even the suicidal attacks by small groups of our Army and Navy airplanes, the surprise attacks by our submarines, and the actions of parachute units, although effective, could be regarded only as a strategical ruse on our part. It was a most depressing thought that we had no available means left for the exploitation of the strategical opportunities which might from time to time occur in the course of these operations.[16]\\r\\nAt the end of the Battle of Leyte in the Philippines, the Allies were left with a two-month lull in their offensive operations before the planned invasion of Okinawa. Iwo Jima was strategically important: it provided an air base for Japanese fighter planes to intercept long-range B-29 Superfortress bombers, and it provided a haven for Japanese naval units in dire need of any support available. In addition, it was used by the Japanese to stage air attacks on the Mariana Islands from November 1944 through January 1945. The capture of Iwo Jima would eliminate these problems and provide a staging area for Operation Downfall ÿ the eventual invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. The distance of B-29 raids could (hypothetically) be cut in half, and a base would be available for P-51 Mustang fighters to escort and protect the bombers.[4]\\r\\nAmerican intelligence sources were confident that Iwo Jima would fall in one week. In light of the optimistic intelligence reports, the decision was made to invade Iwo Jima and the operation was given the code name Operation Detachment.[4] American forces were unaware that the Japanese were preparing a complex and deep defense, radically departing from their usual strategy of a beach defense. So successful was the Japanese preparation that it was discovered after the battle that the hundreds of tons of Allied bombs and thousands of rounds of heavy naval gunfire had left the Japanese defenders almost undamaged and ready to inflict losses on the U.S. Marines.\\r\\nBy June 1944, Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi was assigned to command the defense of Iwo Jima. Kuribayashi knew that Japan could not win the battle, but he hoped to inflict massive casualties on the American forces, so that the United States and its Australian and British allies would reconsider carrying out the invasion of Japan Home Islands.\\r\\nWhile drawing inspiration from the defense in the Battle of Peleliu, Kuribayashi designed a defense that broke with Japanese military doctrine. Rather than establishing his defenses on the beach to face the landings directly, he created strong, mutually supporting defenses in depth using static and heavy weapons such as heavy machine guns and artillery. Takeichi Nishi's armored tanks were to be used as camouflaged artillery positions. Because the tunnel linking the mountain to the main forces was never completed, Kuribayashi organized the southern area of the island in and around Mount Suribachi as a semi-independent sector, with his main defensive zone built up in the north. The expected American naval and air bombardment further prompted the creation of an extensive system of tunnels that connected the prepared positions, so that a pillbox that had been cleared could be reoccupied. This network of bunkers and pillboxes favored the defense. For instance, The Nanpo Bunker (Southern Area Islands Naval Air HQ), which was located east of Airfield Number 2, had enough food, water and ammo for the Japanese to hold out for three months. The bunker was 90 feet deep and had tunnels running in various directions. Approximately 500 55-gallon drums filled with water, kerosene, and fuel oil for generators were located inside the complex. Gasoline powered generators allowed for radios and lighting to be operated underground.[17]\\r\\nBy February 19, 1945, the day the Americans invaded, 11 miles of a planned 17 miles of tunnel network had been dug. Besides the Nanpo Bunker, there were numerous command centers and barracks that were 75 feet deep. Tunnels allowed for troop movement to go undetected to various defense positions.[18]\\r\\nHundreds of hidden artillery and mortar positions along with land mines were placed all over the island. Among the Japanese weapons were 320 mm spigot mortars and a variety of explosive rockets.[19]\\r\\nNonetheless, the Japanese supply was inadequate. Troops were supplied 60% of the standard issue of ammunition sufficient for one engagement by one division, and food and forage for four months.[20]\\r\\nNumerous Japanese snipers and camouflaged machine gun positions were also set up. Kuribayashi specially engineered the defenses so that every part of Iwo Jima was subject to Japanese defensive fire. He also received a handful of kamikaze pilots to use against the enemy fleet. Three hundred and eighteen American sailors were killed by kamikaze attacks during the battle. However, against his wishes, Kuribayashi's superiors on Honshu ordered him to erect some beach defenses. These were the only parts of the defenses that were destroyed during the pre-landing bombardment.\\r\\nStarting on 15 June 1944, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army Air Forces began naval bombardments and air raids against Iwo Jima, which would become the longest and most intense in the Pacific theater.[21] These would contain a combination of naval artillery shellings and aerial bombings that went on for nine months. On 17 February, the destroyer escort USS?Blessman sent Underwater Demolition Team 15 (UDT-15) toward Blue Beach for reconnaissance. The Japanese infantry fired on them, killing one American diver. On the evening of 18 February, the Blessman was hit by a bomb from a Japanese aircraft, killing 40 sailors, including 15 members of her UDT.\\r\\nUnaware of Kuribayashi's tunnel defense system, many of the Americans assumed the majority of the Japanese garrison were killed by the constant bombing raids.\\r\\n\\"Well, this will be easy. The Japanese will surrender Iwo Jima without a fight.\\" ÿ Chester W. Nimitz[22]\\r\\nMaj. Gen. Harry Schmidt, commander of the Marine landing force, requested a 10-day heavy shelling of the island immediately preceding the mid-February amphibious assault. However, Rear Adm. William H. P. Blandy, commander of the Amphibious Support Force (Task Force 52), did not believe such a bombardment would allow him time to replenish his ships' ammunition before the landings; he thus refused Schmidt's request. Schmidt then asked for nine days of shelling; Blandy again refused and agreed to a three-day bombardment. This decision left much hard feeling among the Marines. After the war, Lieut. Gen. Holland M. \\"Howlin' Mad\\" Smith, commander Expeditionary Troops (Task Force 56, which consisted of Schmidt's Fifth Amphibious Corps), bitterly complained that the lack of naval gunfire had cost Marine lives during the entire Allied island campaign.[23]\\r\\nEach heavy warship was given an area on which to fire that, combined with all the ships, covered the entire island. Each warship fired for approximately six hours before stopping for a certain amount of time. Poor weather on D minus 3 led to uncertain results for that day's bombardment. On D minus 2, the time and care that the Japanese had taken in preparing their artillery positions became clear. When heavy cruiser USS?Pensacola got within range of shore batteries, the ship was quickly hit 6 times and suffered 17 crew deaths. Later, 12 small craft attempting to land an underwater demolition team were all struck by Japanese rounds and quickly retired. While aiding these vessels, the destroyer USS?Leutze was also hit and suffered 7 crew deaths. On D minus 1, Adm. Blandy's gunners were once again hampered by rain and clouds. Gen. Schmidt summed up his feelings by saying, \\"We only got about 13 hours worth of fire support during the 34 hours of available daylight.\\"[24]\\r\\nThe limited bombardment had questionable impact on the enemy due to the Japanese being heavily dug-in and fortified. However, many bunkers and caves were destroyed during the bombing giving it some limited success. The Japanese had been preparing for this battle since March 1944, which gave them a significant head start.[25] By the time of the landing, about 450 American ships were located off Iwo Jima. The entire battle involved about 60,000 U.S. Marines and several thousand U.S. Navy Seabees.[26]\\r\\nLt. (jg) Rufus G.

Mitscher's Task Force 58, a huge carrier force, arrived off Iwo Jima. Also in this flotilla was Adm. Raymond A. Spruance, overall commander for the invasion, in his flagship, the heavy cruiser USS?Indianapolis. \\"Howlin' Mad\\" Smith was once again deeply frustrated that Mitscher's powerful carrier group had been bombing the Japanese home islands instead of softening up the defenses of Iwo Jima. Mitscher's fliers did contribute to the additional surface-ship bombardment that accompanied the formation of the amphibious craft.[29]\\r\\nUnlike the days of the pre-landing bombardment, D-Day dawned clear and bright.[29] At 08:59, one minute ahead of schedule, the first wave of Marines landed on the beaches of the southeastern coast of Iwo Jima. Major Howard Connor, 5th Marine Division signal officer, had six Navajo code talkers working around the clock during the first two days of the battle. These six sent and received over 800 messages, all without error. Connor later stated, \\"Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.\\"[30]\\r\\nUnfortunately for the landing force, the planners at Pearl Harbor had completely misjudged the situation that would face Gen. Schmidt's Marines. The beaches had been described as \\"excellent\\" and the thrust inland was expected to be \\"easy.\\" In reality, after crossing the beach, the Marines were faced with 15-foot-high slopes of soft black volcanic ash.[31] This ash allowed for neither a secure footing nor the construction of foxholes to protect the Marines from hostile fire. However, the ash did help to absorb some of the fragments from Japanese artillery.[32]\\r\\nMarines were trained to move rapidly forward; here they could only plod. The weight and amount of equipment was a terrific hindrance and various items were rapidly discarded. First to go was the gas mask?...[31]\\r\\nThe lack of a vigorous response led the Navy to conclude that their bombardment had suppressed the Japanese defenses and in good order the Marines began deployment to the Iwo Jima beach.[31] Gen. Kuribayashi was far from beaten, however. In the deathly silence, landed US Marines began to slowly inch their way forward inland, oblivious to the danger. After allowing the Americans to pile up men and machinery on the beach for just over an hour, Kuribayashi unleashed the undiminished force of his countermeasures. Shortly after 10:00, everything from machine guns and mortars to heavy artillery began to rain down on the crowded beach, which was quickly transformed into a nightmarish bloodbath.[33]\\r\\nAt first it came as a ragged rattle of machine-gun bullets, growing gradually lower and fiercer until at last all the pent-up fury of a hundred hurricanes seemed to be breaking upon the heads of the Americans. Shells screeched and crashed, every hummock spat automatic fire and the very soft soil underfoot erupted underfoot with hundreds of exploding land mines?... Marines walking erect crumpled and fell. Concussion lifted them and slammed them down, or tore them apart?...[34]\\r\\nTime-Life correspondent Robert Sherrod described it simply as \\"a nightmare in hell.\\"[35]\\r\\nThe Japanese heavy artillery in Mount Suribachi opened their reinforced steel doors to fire, and then closed them immediately to prevent counterfire from the Marines and naval gunners. This made it difficult for American units to destroy a Japanese artillery piece.[32] To make matters worse for the Americans, the bunkers were connected to the elaborate tunnel system so that bunkers that were cleared with flamethrowers and grenades were reoccupied shortly afterwards by Japanese troops moving through the tunnels. This tactic caused many casualties among the Marines, as they walked past the reoccupied bunkers without expecting to suddenly take fresh fire from them.[32]\\r\\nIn response to the heavy resistance on the beach, the Army's 147th Infantry Regiment was ordered to climb from landing craft with grappling hooks to scale a high ridge about 3/4 mile from Mount Suribachi. The mission was to fire on the enemy opposing the Marine landings on the beaches below.[36] They were soon pinned down by heavy Japanese fire, and engaged in non-stop fighting for 31 days before they could be relieved.\\r\\nAmtracs, unable to do more than uselessly churn the black ash, made no progress up the slopes; their Marine passengers had to dismount and slog forward on foot.[37] Men of the Naval Construction Battalions (CBs or Seabees), braving enemy fire, eventually were able to bulldoze passages up the slopes. This allowed the Marines and equipment to finally make some progress inland and get off the jam-packed beaches. \\"Even so, in virtually every shell hole there lay at least one dead Marine?...\\"[38]\\r\\nBy 1130 hours, some Marines had managed to reach the southern tip of Airfield No. 1, whose possession had been one of the (highly unrealistic) original American objectives for the first day. The Marines endured a fanatical 100-man charge by the Japanese, but were able to keep their toehold on Airfield No. 1 as night fell.[38] It was in this sector that Sgt. Darrell S. Cole of the 23rd Marines was killed after single-handedly knocking out several pillboxes and a bunker, thereby earning the Medal of Honor.\\r\\nIn the left-most sector, the Americans did manage to achieve one of their objectives for the battle that day. Led by six-foot, four-inch Col. Harry B. \\"Harry the Horse\\" Liversedge the 28th Marine Regiment drove across the island at its narrowest width (approx. one-half mile), thereby isolating the Japanese dug in on Mount Suribachi.\\r\\nGySgt. \\"Manila\\" John Basilone (a Medal of Honor recipient for his actions on Guadalcanal), fighting in the 27th Marines just to the right of Liversedge's 28th Regiment, was killed leading his machine-gun section. Cpl. Tony Stein, a former toolmaker, had transformed a wing gun from a wrecked fighter plane into what he called his \\"stinger.\\" With this unusual weapon, he methodically killed the occupants of multiple pillboxes, allowing demolition personnel following him to destroy the position.[39] For these actions, he was (posthumously) awarded the Medal of Honor.\\r\\nThe right-most landing area was dominated by Japanese positions at the Quarry. The 25th Marine Regiment undertook a two-pronged attack to silence these guns. Their experience can be summarized by the ordeal of 2nd Lt. Benjamin Roselle, part of a ground team directing naval gunfire:\\r\\nWithin a minute a mortar shell exploded among the group?... his left foot and ankle hung from his leg, held on by a ribbon of flesh?... Within minutes a second round landed near him and fragments tore into his other leg. For nearly an hour he wondered where the next shell would land. He was soon to find out as a shell burst almost on top of him, wounding him for the third time in the shoulder. Almost at once another explosion bounced him several feet into the air and hot shards ripped into both thighs?... as he lifted his arm to look at this watch a mortar shell exploded only feet away and blasted the watch from his wrist and tore a large jagged hole in his forearm: \\"I was beginning to know what it must be like to be crucified,\\" he was later to say.[40]\\r\\nThe 25th Marines' 3rd Battalion had landed approximately 900 men in the morning. Japanese resistance at the Quarry was so fierce that by nightfall only 150 were left in fighting condition, an astounding 83.3% casualty rate.[41]\\r\\nBy the evening, 30,000 Marines had landed. About 40,000 more would follow.[32] Aboard the command ship Eldorado, \\"Howlin' Mad\\" Smith saw the lengthy casualty reports and heard of the slow progress of the ground forces. To the war correspondents covering the operation he confessed, \\"I don't know who he is, but the Japanese general running this show is one smart bastard.\\"[42]\\r\\nD-Day Medals of Honor: Sgt. Darrell S. Cole, USMCR (posth.); Cpl. Tony Stein, USMCR (posth.)\\r\\nIn the days after the landings, the Marines expected the usual Japanese banzai charge during the night. This had been the standard Japanese final defense strategy in previous battles against enemy ground forces in the Pacific, such as during the Battle of Saipan. In those attacks, for which the Marines were prepared, the majority of the Japanese attackers had been killed and the Japanese strength greatly reduced. However, General Kuribayashi had strictly forbidden these \\"human wave\\" attacks by the Japanese infantrymen because he considered them to be futile.[32]\\r\\nThe fighting on the beachhead at Iwo Jima was very fierce. The advance of the Marines was stalled by numerous defensive positions augmented by artillery pieces. There, the Marines were ambushed by Japanese troops who occasionally sprang out of tunnels. At night, the Japanese left their defenses under cover of darkness to attack American foxholes, but U.S. Navy ships fired star shells to deny them the cover of darkness. On Iwo Jima (and other Japanese held islands), Japanese soldiers who knew English were used to harass and or deceive Marines in order to kill them if they could; they would yell \\"corpsman\\" pretending to be a wounded Marine, in order to lure in U.S. Navy medical corpsmen attached to Marine infantry companies.[32]\\r\\nThe Marines learned that firearms were relatively ineffective against the Japanese defenders and effectively used flamethrowers and grenades to flush out Japanese troops in the tunnels. One of the technological innovations of the battle, the eight Sherman M4A3R3 medium tanks equipped with a flamethrower (\\"Ronson\\" or \\"Zippo\\" tanks), proved very effective at clearing Japanese positions. The Shermans were difficult to disable, such that defenders were often compelled to assault them in the open, where they would fall victim to the superior numbers of Marines.[32]\\r\\nClose air support was initially provided by fighters from escort carriers off the coast. This shifted over to the 15th Fighter Group, flying P-51 Mustangs, after they arrived on the island on 6 March. Similarly, illumination rounds (flares) which were used to light up the battlefield at night were initially provided by ships, shifting over later to landing force artillery. Navajo code talkers were part of the American ground communications, along with walkie-talkies and SCR-610 backpack radio sets.[32]\\r\\nAfter running out of water, food and most supplies, the Japanese troops became desperate toward the end of the battle. Kuribayashi, who had argued against banzai attacks at the start of the battle, realized that defeat was imminent.\\r\\nMarines began to face increasing numbers of nighttime attacks; these were only repelled by a combination of machine-gun defensive positions and artillery support. At times, the Marines engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to repel the Japanese attacks.[32] With the landing area secure, more troops and heavy equipment came ashore, and the invasion proceeded north to capture the airfields and the remainder of the island. Most Japanese soldiers fought to the death.[32]\\r\\n\\"Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima\\" is a black and white photograph taken by Joe Rosenthal depicting six Marines from E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, raising a U.S. flag atop Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945,[15] in the second of two flag-raisings on the site that day. The photograph was extremely popular, being reprinted in thousands of publications. Later, it became the only photograph to win the Pulitzer Prize for Photography in the same year as its publication, and ultimately came to be regarded as one of the most significant and recognizable images of the war, and possibly the most reproduced photograph of all time.[15] In 1954, the flag raising picture was later used by Felix de Weldon to sculpt the Marine Corps War Memorial (Iwo Jima Memorial), located adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery.[15]\\r\\nThree of the six Marines depicted in the picture, Sergeant Michael Strank, Corporal Harlon Block, and Private First Class Franklin Sousley, were killed in action days after the flag-raising. Two of the three surviving flag-raisers, Private First Class Rene Gagnon and Private First Class Ira Hayes, together with Navy corpsman John Bradley, became celebrities upon their participation in a war bond selling tour after the battle. Two subsequent Marine Corps investigations into the identities of the six men in the photograph determined in 1946 and 1947 that Henry Hansen was misidentified as being Block (both Marines died 6 days after the photo), and in May and June 2016 that Bradley was not in the photograph and Pfc. Harold Schultz was.[43]\\r\\nBy the morning of 23 February, Mount Suribachi was effectively cut off above ground from the rest of the island. The Marines knew that the Japanese defenders had an extensive network of below-ground defenses, and that in spite of its isolation above ground, the volcano was still connected to Japanese defenders via the tunnel network. They expected a fierce fight for the summit. Two small patrols from two rifle companies from 2/28 Marines were sent up the volcano to reconnoiter routes on the mountain's north face. Popular accounts (embroidered by the press in the aftermath of the release of the photo) had the Marines fighting all the way up to the summit. Although the Marine riflemen expected an ambush, one patrol encountered only small groups of Japanese defenders on top of Suribachi. The majority of the Japanese troops stayed in the tunnel network, only occasionally attacking in small groups, and were generally all killed. The recon patrols made it to the summit and scrambled down again, reporting any contact to the 2/28 Marines commander, Colonel Chandler Johnson.[32] Johnson then called for a reinforced platoon size patrol from E Company to climb Suribachi and seize and occupy the crest. The patrol commander, 1st Lt. Harold Schrier, was handed the battalion's American flag to be raised on top to signal Suribachi's capture, if they reached the summit. Johnson and the Marines anticipated heavy fighting, but the patrol encountered only a small amount of small arms fire on the way up the mountain. Once the top was secured by Schrier and his men, a length of Japanese water pipe was found there among the wreckage, and the American flag was attached on the pipe and then raised and planted on top of Mount Suribachi which became the first foreign flag to fly on Japanese soil.[44] Photographs of this \\"first flag raising\\" scene, taken by Marine photographer Louis R. Lowery, were not released until late 1947.\\r\\nAs the flag went up, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal had just landed on the beach at the foot of Mount Suribachi and decided that he wanted the flag as a souvenir. Colonel Johnson, the battalion's commander, believed that the flag belonged to the 2nd Battalion 28th Marines, who had captured that section of the island. Johnson sent Pfc. Rene Gagnon, a messenger for E Company, to take a second larger flag up the volcano to replace the first flag. It was as the replacement flag attached to another heavy pipe went up that Rosenthal took Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima.\\r\\nThe flag flew on Mount Suribachi until it was taken down on March 14, when an American flag was officially raised at Kitano Point at the northern end of the island by orders of the commander of all the troops on Iwo Jima, Lt. Gen. Holland Smith, who witnessed the event with Maj. Gen. Graves B. Erskine, the commander of the Third Marine Division, and troops of the division.\\r\\nDespite Japan's loss of Mount Suribachi on the south end of the island, the Japanese still held strong positions on the north end. The rocky terrain vastly favored defense, even more so than Mount Suribachi, which was much easier to hit with naval artillery fire. Coupled with this, the fortifications constructed by Kuribayashi were more impressive than at the southern end of the island.[45] Remaining under the command of Kuribayashi was the equivalent of eight infantry battalions, a tank regiment, and two artillery and three heavy mortar battalions. There were also about 5,000 gunners and naval infantry. The most arduous task left to the Marines was the overtaking of the Motoyama Plateau with its distinctive Hill 382 and Turkey knob and the area in between referred to as the Amphitheater. This formed the basis of what came to be known as the \\"meatgrinder\\". While this was being achieved on the right flank, the left was clearing out Hill 362 with just as much difficulty. The overall objective at this point was to take control of Airfield No. 2 in the center of the island. However, every \\"penetration seemed to become a disaster\\" as \\"units were raked from the flanks, chewed up, and sometimes wiped out. Tanks were destroyed by interlocking fire or were hoisted into the air on the spouting fireballs of buried mines\\".[46] As a result, the fighting bogged down, with American casualties piling up. Even capturing these points was not a solution to the problem since a previously secured position could be attacked from the rear by the use of the tunnels and hidden pillboxes. As such, it was said that \\"they could take these heights at will, and then regret it\\".[47]\\r\\nThe Marines nevertheless found ways to prevail under the circumstances. It was observed that during bombardments, the Japanese would hide their guns and themselves in the caves only to reappear when the troops would advance and lay devastating fire on them. The Japanese had over time learned basic American strategy, which was to lay heavy bombardment before an infantry attack. Consequently, General Erskine ordered the 9th Marine Regiment to attack under the cover of darkness with no preliminary barrage. This came to be a resounding success with many Japanese soldiers killed while still asleep. This was a key moment in the capture of Hill 362.[48] It held such importance that the Japanese organized a counterattack the following night. Although Kuribayashi had forbidden the suicide charges familiar with other battles in the Pacific, the commander of the area decided on a banzai charge with the optimistic goal of recapturing Mount Suribachi. On the evening of 8 March, Captain Samaji Inouye and his 1,000 men charged the American lines, inflicting 347 casualties (90 deaths). The Marines counted 784 dead Japanese soldiers the next day.[45] The same day, elements of the 3rd Marine Division reached the northern coast of the island, splitting Kuribayashi's defenses in two.[49] There was also a kamikaze air attack (the only one of the battle) on the ships anchored at sea on 21 February, which resulted in the sinking of the escort carrier USS?Bismarck Sea, severe damage to USS?Saratoga, and slight damage to the escort carrier USS?Lunga Point, an LST, and a transport.[48]\\r\\nAlthough the island was declared secure at 18:00 on 16 March (25 days after the landings), the 5th Marine Division still faced Kuribayashi's stronghold in a gorge 640?m (700?yd) long at the northwestern end of the island. On 21 March, the Marines destroyed the command post in the gorge with four tons of explosives and on 24 March, Marines sealed the remaining caves at the northern tip of the island.[50] However, on the night of 25 March, a 300-man Japanese force launched a final counterattack in the vicinity of Airfield No. 2. Army pilots, Seabees, and Marines of the 5th Pioneer Battalion and 28th Marines fought the Japanese force for up to 90 minutes, suffering heavy casualties (53 killed, 120 wounded).[citation needed] Two Marines from the 36th Depot Company, an all-African-American unit, received the Bronze Star. First Lieutenant Harry Martin of the 5th Pioneer Battalion was the last Marine to be awarded the Medal of Honor during the battle.[51][52] Although still a matter of speculation because of conflicting accounts from surviving Japanese veterans, it has been said that Kuribayashi led this final assault,[4] which unlike the loud banzai charge of previous battles, was characterized as a silent attack. If ever proven true, Kuribayashi would have been the highest ranking Japanese officer to have personally led an attack during World War II. Additionally, this would also be Kuribayashi's final act, a departure from the normal practice of the commanding Japanese officers committing seppuku behind the lines while the rest perished in the banzai charge, as happened during the battles of Saipan and Okinawa. The island was officially declared secure at 09:00 on 26 March.\\r\\nOnce the island was officially declared secure, the Army's 147th Infantry Regiment was ostensibly there to act as a garrison force, but they soon found themselves locked in a bitter struggle against thousands of stalwart defenders engaging in a last-ditch guerilla campaign to harass the Americans.[53] Using well-supplied caves and tunnel systems, the Japanese resisted American advances. For three months, the 147th slogged across the island, using flamethrowers, grenades, and satchel charges to dig out the enemy, killing some 1,602 Japanese soldiers in small unit actions.\\r\\nThe United States M2 flamethrower was heavily used in the Pacific. It features two tanks containing fuel and compressed gas respectively, which are combined and ignited to produce a stream of flaming liquid out of the tip.[54] These flamethrowers were used to kill Japanese holed into pillboxes, buildings and caves. A battalion would assign one flamethrower per platoon with one reserve flamethrower in each group. Flamethrower operators were usually in more danger than regular troops as the short range of their weapon required close combat, and the visibility of the flames on the battlefield made them a prominent target for snipers. Still they were essential to breaking the enemy and one battalion commander called the flamethrower the \\"best single weapon of the operation.\\"[55]\\r\\nMarines later experimented putting flamethrowers on tanks which were also deployed during battle. Their effectiveness was more limited due to Iwo Jima's rough terrain. A flamethrower tank would have a range of approximately 100?yd (90?m), carry 300 gallons of fuel and have a firing time of 150 seconds.[55]\\r\\nOf between 20,530 and 21,060 Japanese defenders entrenched on the island, from 17,845 to 18,375 died either from fighting or by ritual suicide. Only 216 were captured during the course of battle.[citation needed] After Iwo Jima, it was estimated there were no more than 300 Japanese left alive in the island's warren of caves and tunnels. In fact, there were close to 3,000. The Japanese bushido code of honor, coupled with effective propaganda which portrayed American G.I.s as ruthless animals, prevented surrender for many Japanese soldiers.[citation needed] Those who could not bring themselves to commit suicide hid in the caves during the day and came out at night to prowl for provisions. Some did eventually surrender and were surprised that the Americans often received them with compassion, offering water, cigarettes, alcohol, or coffee.[citation needed] The last of these holdouts on the island, two of Lieutenant Toshihiko Ohno's men, Yamakage Kufuku and Matsudo Linsoki, lasted four years without being caught and finally surrendered on 6 January 1949.[56][57]\\r\\nThough ultimately victorious, the American victory at Iwo Jima had come at a terrible price. According to the official Navy Department Library website, \\"The 36-day (Iwo Jima) assault resulted in more than 26,000 American casualties, including 6,800 dead.\\"[58] By comparison, the much larger scale 82-day Battle of Okinawa lasting from early April until mid-June 1945 (involving five U.S. Army and two Marine Corps divisions) resulted in of over 62,000 U.S. casualties, of whom over 12,000 were killed or missing. Iwo Jima was also the only U.S. Marine battle where the American casualties exceeded the Japanese,[11] although Japanese combat deaths numbered three times as many American deaths. Two US Marines were captured during the battle, neither of whom survived their captivity. USS Bismarck Sea was also lost, the last U.S. aircraft carrier sunk in World War II.[4] Because all civilians had been evacuated, there were no civilian casualties at Iwo Jima, unlike at Saipan and Okinawa.[59]\\r\\nIn hindsight, given the number of casualties, the necessity and long-term significance of the island's capture to the outcome of the war became a contentious issue and remains disputed.[60] The Marines, who suffered the actual casualties, were not consulted in the planning of the operation.[61] As early as April 1945, retired Chief of Naval Operations William V. Pratt stated in Newsweek magazine that considering the \\"expenditure of manpower to acquire a small, God-forsaken island, useless to the Army as a staging base and useless to the Navy as a fleet base?... [one] wonders if the same sort of airbase could not have been reached by acquiring other strategic localities at lower cost.\\"[6]\\r\\nThe lessons learned on Iwo Jima served as guidelines for the following Battle of Okinawa and the planned invasion of the Japanese homeland. For example, \\"because of the casualties taken at Iwo Jima on the first day, it was decided to make the preparatory bombardment the heaviest yet delivered on to a Pacific island\\".[62] Also, in the planning for a potential attack on the Japanese home islands, it was taken into account that around a third of the troops committed to Iwo Jima and again at Okinawa had been killed or wounded.[63]\\r\\nThe justification for Iwo Jima's strategic importance to the United States' war effort has been that it provided a landing and refueling site for long-range fighter escorts. These escorts proved both impractical and unnecessary, and only ten such missions were ever flown from Iwo Jima.[64]\\r\\nJapanese fighter aircraft based on Iwo Jima sometimes attacked AAF planes, which were vulnerable on their way to Japan because they were heavily laden with bombs and fuel. However, although some Japanese interceptors were based on Iwo Jima, their impact on the American bombing effort was marginal; in the three months before the invasion only 11 B-29s were lost as a result.[65] The Superfortresses found it unnecessary to make any major detour around the island.[66]\\r\\nThe Japanese on Iwo Jima had radar[67] and were thus able to notify their comrades at home of incoming B-29 Superfortresses flying from the Mariana Islands. However, the capture of Iwo Jima did not affect the Japanese early-warning radar system, which continued to receive information on incoming B-29s from the island of Rota (which was never invaded).[68]\\r\\nAs early as 4 March 1945, while fighting was still taking place, the B-29 Dinah Might of the USAAF 9th Bomb Group reported it was low on fuel near the island and requested an emergency landing. Despite enemy fire, the airplane landed on the Allied-controlled section of the island (South Field), without incident, and was serviced, refueled and departed.\\r\\nIn all, 2,251 B-29 landings on Iwo Jima were recorded during the war.[69] Moskin records that 1,191 fighter escorts and 3,081 strike sorties were flown from Iwo Jima against Japan.[70]\\r\\nSome downed B-29 crewmen were saved by air-sea rescue aircraft and vessels operating from the island, but Iwo Jima was only one of many islands that could have been used for such a purpose. As for the importance of the island as a landing and refueling site for bombers, Marine Captain Robert Burrell, then a history instructor at the United States Naval Academy, suggested that only a small proportion of the 2,251 landings were for genuine emergencies, the great majority possibly being for minor technical checkups, training, or refueling. According to Burrell,\\r\\nThis justification became prominent only after the Marines seized the island and incurred high casualties. The tragic cost of Operation Detachment pressured veterans, journalists, and commanders to fixate on the most visible rationalization for the battle. The sight of the enormous, costly, and technologically sophisticated B-29 landing on the island's small airfield most clearly linked Iwo Jima to the strategic bombing campaign. As the myths about the flag raisings on Mount Suribachi reached legendary proportions, so did the emergency landing theory in order to justify the need to raise that flag.[71]\\r\\nIn publishing The Ghosts of Iwo Jima, Texas A&M University Press said that the very losses formed the basis for a \\"reverence for the Marine Corps\\" that not only embodied the \\"American national spirit\\" but ensured the \\"institutional survival\\" of the Marine Corps.[72]\\r\\nThe Medal of Honor is the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government. It is bestowed on a member of the United States armed forces who distinguishes himself by \\"...?conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States?...\\" Because of its nature, the medal is commonly awarded posthumously; since its creation during the American Civil War it has been presented only 3,464 times.\\r\\nThe Medal of Honor was awarded to 27 U.S. Marines and U.S. sailors (14 posthumously), during the battle of Iwo Jima. 22 medals were presented to Marines (12 posthumously) and 5 were presented to sailors, 4 of whom were hospital corpsmen (2 posthumously) attached to Marine infantry units; 22 Medals of Honor was 28% of the 82 awarded to Marines in World War II.[73]\\r\\nHershel W. Williams (Marine Corps) is the only living Medal of Honor recipient from the Battle of Iwo Jima. Williams (age 94 in 2018) is one of four living Medal of Honor recipients of World War II; three soldiers and one Marine.\\r\\nThe Marine Corps War Memorial (Iwo Jima Memorial) was dedicated on 10 November 1954.\\r\\nThe United States Navy has commissioned two ships with the name USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2) (1961ÿ1993) and USS Iwo Jima (LHD-7) (2001ÿpresent).\\r\\nOn 19 February 1985, the 40th anniversary of the landings on Iwo Jima, an event called the \\"Reunion of Honor\\" was held (the event has been held annually since 2002).[74] The veterans of both sides who fought in the battle of Iwo Jima attended the event. The place was the invasion beach where U.S. forces landed. A memorial on which inscriptions were engraved by both sides was built at the center of the meeting place. Japanese attended at the mountain side, where the Japanese inscription was carved, and Americans attended at the shore side, where the English inscription was carved.[75] After unveiling and offering of flowers were made, the representatives of both countries approached the memorial; upon meeting, they shook hands. The combined Japan-U.S. memorial service of the 50th anniversary of the battle was held in front of the monument in February 1995.[76] Further memorial services have been held on later anniversaries.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe importance of the battle to Marines today is demonstrated in pilgrimages made to the island, and specifically the summit of Suribachi.[77] Marines will often leave dog tags, rank insignia, or other tokens at the monuments in homage.[78] Iwo Jima Day is observed annually on 19 February in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts[79] with a ceremony at the State House.\\r\\nThe Japanese government continues to search for and retrieve the remains of Japanese military personnel who were killed during the battle.[80]\\r\\nThe U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia\\r\\nThe memorial on top of Suribachi\\r\\nThe 60th anniversary Reunion at the Japanese part of the memorial\\r\\nCoordinates: 2447N 14119E? / ?24.783N 141.317E? / 24.783; 141.317","input":"When did the battle of iwo jima happen?"},{"output":"geologically active","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nTriton is the largest natural satellite of the planet Neptune, and the first Neptunian moon to be discovered. The discovery was made on October 10, 1846, by English astronomer William Lassell. It is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit, an orbit in the direction opposite to its planet's rotation.[2][11] At 2,710 kilometres (1,680?mi)[5] in diameter, it is the seventh-largest moon in the Solar System. Because of its retrograde orbit and composition similar to Pluto's, Triton is thought to have been a dwarf planet captured from the Kuiper belt.[12] It has a surface of mostly frozen nitrogen, a mostly water-ice crust,[13] an icy mantle and a substantial core of rock and metal. The core makes up two-thirds of its total mass. The mean density is 2.061?g/cm3,[5] reflecting a composition of approximately 15ÿ35% water ice.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nTriton is one of the few moons in the Solar System known to be geologically active (the others being Jupiter's Io and Europa, and Saturn's Enceladus and Titan). As a consequence, its surface is relatively young, with few obvious impact craters. Intricate cryovolcanic and tectonic terrains suggest a complex geological history. Part of its surface has geysers erupting sublimated nitrogen gas, contributing to a tenuous nitrogen atmosphere less than 1/70,000 the pressure of Earth's atmosphere at sea level.[6] It is the second-largest planetary moon in relation to its primary, after Earth's moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nTriton was discovered by British astronomer William Lassell on October 10, 1846,[14] just 17?days after the discovery of Neptune. He discovered Triton with his self-built, 61?cm telescope.\\r\\n\\r\\nA brewer by trade, Lassell began making mirrors for his amateur telescope in 1820. When John Herschel received news of Neptune's discovery, he wrote to Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell did so and discovered Triton eight days later.[15][14] Lassell also claimed to have discovered rings. Although Neptune was later confirmed to have rings, they are so faint and dark that it is doubtful that he actually saw them.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nTriton is named after the Greek sea god Triton (?), the son of Poseidon (the Greek god comparable to the Roman Neptune). The name was first proposed by Camille Flammarion in his 1880 book Astronomie Populaire,[17] and was officially adopted many decades later.[18] Until the discovery of the second moon Nereid in 1949, Triton was commonly referred to as \\"the satellite of Neptune\\". Lassell did not name his own discovery; he later successfully suggested the name Hyperion, previously chosen by John Herschel, for the eighth moon of Saturn when he discovered it.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nTriton is unique among all large moons in the Solar System for its retrograde orbit around its planet (i.e. it orbits in a direction opposite to the planet's rotation). Most of the outer irregular moons of Jupiter and Saturn also have retrograde orbits, as do some of Uranus's outer moons. However, these moons are all much more distant from their primaries, and are small in comparison; the largest of them (Phoebe)[g] has only 8% of the diameter (and 0.03% of the mass) of Triton.\\r\\n\\r\\nTriton's orbit is associated with two tilts, the inclination of Neptune's spin to Neptune's orbit, 30, and the inclination of Triton's orbit to Neptune's spin, 157 (an inclination over 90 indicates retrograde motion). Triton's orbit precesses forward relative to Neptune's spin with a period of about 678 Earth years (4.1 Neptunian years),[3][4] making its Neptune-orbit-relative inclination vary between 127 and 180 and in the past, to 173. That inclination is currently 130; Triton's orbit is now near its maximum departure from coplanarity with Neptune's.\\r\\n\\r\\nTriton's rotation is tidally locked to be synchronous with its orbit around Neptune: it keeps one face oriented toward the planet at all times. Its equator is almost exactly aligned with its orbital plane.[20] At the present time, Triton's rotational axis is about 40 from Neptune's orbital plane, and hence at some point during Neptune's year each pole points fairly close to the Sun, almost like the poles of Uranus. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions take turns facing the Sun, resulting in seasonal changes as one pole, then the other, moves into the sunlight. Such changes were observed in 2010.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nTriton's revolution around Neptune has become a nearly perfect circle with an eccentricity of almost zero. Viscoelastic damping from tides alone is not thought to be capable of circularizing Triton's orbit in the time since the origin of the system, and gas drag from a prograde debris disc is likely to have played a substantial role.[3][4] Tidal interactions also cause Triton's orbit, which is already closer to Neptune than the Moon's is to Earth, to gradually decay further; predictions are that 3.6?billion years from now, Triton will pass within Neptune's Roche limit.[22] This will result in either a collision with Neptune's atmosphere or the breakup of Triton, forming a new ring system similar to that found around Saturn.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoons in retrograde orbits cannot form in the same region of the solar nebula as the planets they orbit, so Triton must have been captured from elsewhere. It might therefore have originated in the Kuiper belt,[12] a ring of small icy objects extending from just inside the orbit of Neptune to about 50?AU from the Sun. Thought to be the point of origin for the majority of short-period comets observed from Earth, the belt is also home to several large, planet-like bodies including Pluto, which is now recognized as the largest in a population of Kuiper belt objects (the plutinos) locked in orbital step with Neptune. Triton is only slightly larger than Pluto and nearly identical in composition, which has led to the hypothesis that the two share a common origin.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposed capture of Triton may explain several features of the Neptunian system, including the extremely eccentric orbit of Neptune's moon Nereid and the scarcity of moons as compared to the other giant planets. Triton's initially eccentric orbit would have intersected orbits of irregular moons and disrupted those of smaller regular moons, dispersing them through gravitational interactions.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nTriton's eccentric post-capture orbit would have also resulted in tidal heating of its interior, which could have kept Triton fluid for a billion years; this inference is supported by evidence of differentiation in Triton's interior. This source of internal heat disappeared following tidal locking and circularization of the orbit.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo types of mechanisms have been proposed for Triton's capture. To be gravitationally captured by a planet, a passing body must lose sufficient energy to be slowed down to a speed less than that required to escape. An early theory of how Triton may have been slowed was by collision with another object, either one that happened to be passing by Neptune (which is unlikely), or a moon or proto-moon in orbit around Neptune (which is more likely).[6] A more recent hypothesis suggests that, before its capture, Triton was part of a binary system. When this binary encountered Neptune, it interacted in such a way that the binary dissociated, with one portion of the binary expelled, and the other, Triton, becoming bound to Neptune. This event is more likely for more massive companions.[12] Similar mechanisms have been proposed for the capture of Mars's moons.[25] This hypothesis is supported by several lines of evidence, including binaries being very common among the large Kuiper belt objects.[26][27] The event was brief but gentle, saving Triton from collisional disruption. Events like this may have been common during the formation of Neptune, or later when it migrated outward.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, simulations in 2017 showed that after Triton's capture and before its orbital eccentricity decreased it probably did collide with at least one other moon, and caused collisions between other moons.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nTriton is the seventh-largest moon and sixteenth-largest object in the Solar System, and is modestly larger than the dwarf planets Pluto and Eris. It comprises more than 99.5% of all the mass known to orbit Neptune, including the planet's rings and thirteen other known moons,[h] and is also more massive than all known moons in the Solar System smaller than itself combined.[i] Also, with a diameter 5.5% that of Neptune, it is the largest moon of a gas giant relative to its planet in terms of diameter, although Titan is bigger relative to Saturn in terms of mass. It has a radius, density (2.061 g/cm3), temperature and chemical composition similar to those of Pluto.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nTriton's surface is covered with a transparent layer of annealed frozen nitrogen. Only 40% of Triton's surface has been observed and studied, but it is possible that it is entirely covered in such a thin sheet of nitrogen ice. Like Pluto's, Triton's crust consists of 55% nitrogen ice with other ices mixed in. Water ice comprises 15ÿ35% and frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice) the remaining 10ÿ20%. Trace ices include 0.1% methane and 0.05% carbon monoxide.[6] There could also be ammonia ice on the surface, as there are indications of ammonia dihydrate in the lithosphere.[31] Triton's mean density implies that it probably consists of about 30ÿ45% water ice (including relatively small amounts of volatile ices), with the remainder being rocky material.[6] Triton's surface area is 23?million?km2, which is 4.5% of Earth, or 15.5% of Earth's land area. Triton has a considerably and unusually high albedo, reflecting 60ÿ95% of the sunlight that reaches it, and it has changed slightly since the first observations. By comparison, the Moon reflects only 11%.[32] Triton's reddish colour is thought to be the result of methane ice, which is converted to tholins under exposure to ultraviolet radiation.[6][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause Triton's surface indicates a long history of melting, models of its interior posit that Triton is differentiated, like Earth, into a solid core, a mantle and a crust. Water, the most abundant volatile in the Solar System, comprises Triton's mantle, enveloping a core of rock and metal. There is enough rock in Triton's interior for radioactive decay to power convection in the mantle to this day. The heat may even be sufficient to maintain a global subsurface ocean similar to what is hypothesized to exist beneath the surface of Europa.[6][34][35]  The black material ejected is suspected to contain organic compounds,[35] and if liquid water is present in Triton, it has been speculated that this could make it habitable for some form of life.[36][37][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nTriton has a tenuous nitrogen atmosphere, with trace amounts of carbon monoxide and small amounts of methane near its surface.[9][38][39] Like Pluto's atmosphere, the atmosphere of Triton is thought to have resulted from evaporation of nitrogen from its surface.[23] Its surface temperature is at least 7001356000000000000?35.6?K (7001355499999999999??237.6?C) because Triton's nitrogen ice is in the warmer, hexagonal crystalline state, and the phase transition between hexagonal and cubic nitrogen ice occurs at that temperature.[40] An upper limit in the low 40s (K) can be set from vapor pressure equilibrium with nitrogen gas in Triton's atmosphere.[41] This is colder than Pluto's average equilibrium temperature of 7001440000000000000?44?K (7001441499999999999??229?C). Triton's surface atmospheric pressure is only about 1.4ÿ7000190000000000000?1.9?Pa (0.014ÿ7000190000000000000?0.019?mbar).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nTurbulence at Triton's surface creates a troposphere (a \\"weather region\\") rising to an altitude of 8?km. Streaks on Triton's surface left by geyser plumes suggest that the troposphere is driven by seasonal winds capable of moving material of over a micrometre in size.[42] Unlike other atmospheres, Triton's lacks a stratosphere, and instead has a thermosphere from altitudes of 8 to 950?km, and an exosphere above that.[6] The temperature of Triton's upper atmosphere, at 7001950000000000000?95I5?K, is higher than that at its surface, due to heat absorbed from solar radiation and Neptune's magnetosphere.[9][43] A haze permeates most of Triton's troposphere, thought to be composed largely of hydrocarbons and nitriles created by the action of sunlight on methane. Triton's atmosphere also has clouds of condensed nitrogen that lie between 1 and 3?km from its surface.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997, observations from Earth were made of Triton's limb as it passed in front of stars. These observations indicated the presence of a denser atmosphere than was deduced from Voyager 2 data.[44] Other observations have shown an increase in temperature by 5% from 1989 to 1998.[45] These observations indicate Triton is approaching an unusually warm summer season that happens only once every few hundred years. Theories for this warming include a change of frost patterns on Triton's surface and a change in ice albedo, which would allow more heat to be absorbed.[46] Another theory argues the changes in temperature are a result of deposition of dark, red material from geological processes. Because Triton's Bond albedo is among the highest within the Solar System, it is sensitive to small variations in spectral albedo.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll detailed knowledge of the surface of Triton was acquired from a distance of 40,000?km by the Voyager 2 spacecraft during a single encounter in 1989.[48]  The 40% of Triton's surface imaged by Voyager 2 revealed blocky outcrops, ridges, troughs, furrows, hollows, plateaus, icy plains and few craters. Triton is relatively flat; its observed topography never varies beyond a kilometer.[6] There are relatively few impact craters on Triton. Recent analysis of crater density and distribution has suggested that in geological terms, Triton's surface is extremely young, with regions varying from an estimated 50?million years old to just an estimated 6?million years old.[49] 55% of Triton's surface is covered with frozen nitrogen, with water ice comprising 15ÿ35% and dry ice (aka. frozen carbon dioxide) forming the remaining 10ÿ20%.[50] The surface shows deposits of tholins, organic compounds that may be precursor chemicals to the origin of life.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nTriton is geologically active; its surface is young and has relatively few impact craters.  Although Triton's crust is made of various ices, its subsurface processes are similar to those that produce volcanoes and rift valleys on Earth, but with water and ammonia as opposed to liquid rock.[6] Triton's entire surface is cut by complex valleys and ridges, probably the result of tectonics and icy volcanism. The vast majority of surface features on Triton are endogenicthe result of internal geological processes rather than external processes such as impacts. Most are volcanic and extrusive in nature, rather than tectonic.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Voyager 2 probe observed in 1989 a handful of geyser-like eruptions of nitrogen gas and entrained dust from beneath the surface of Triton in plumes up to 8?km high.[30][52] Triton is thus, along with Earth, Io, and Enceladus, one of the few bodies in the Solar System on which active eruptions of some sort have been observed.[53] The best-observed examples are named Hili and Mahilani (after a Zulu water sprite and a Tongan sea spirit, respectively).[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the geysers observed were located between 50 and 57S, the part of Triton's surface close to the subsolar point. This indicates that solar heating, although very weak at Triton's great distance from the Sun, plays a crucial role. It is thought that the surface of Triton probably consists of a translucent layer of frozen nitrogen overlying a darker substrate, which creates a kind of \\"solid greenhouse effect\\". Solar radiation passes through the thin surface ice sheet, slowly heating and vaporizing subsurface nitrogen until enough gas pressure accumulates for it to erupt through the crust.[6][42] A temperature increase of just 4?K above the ambient surface temperature of 37?K could drive eruptions to the heights observed.[52] Although commonly termed \\"cryovolcanic\\", this nitrogen plume activity is distinct from Triton's larger scale cryovolcanic eruptions, as well as volcanic processes on other worlds, which are powered by the internal heat of the body in question. Analogous CO2 geysers on Mars are thought to erupt from its south polar cap each spring.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach eruption of a Triton geyser may last up to a year, driven by the sublimation of about 100?million cubic metres (3.5G10^9?cu?ft) of nitrogen ice over this interval; dust entrained may be deposited up to 150?km downwind in visible streaks, and perhaps much farther in more diffuse deposits.[52] Voyager 2's images of Triton's southern hemisphere show many such streaks of dark material.[56] Between 1977 and the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, Triton shifted from a reddish colour, similar to Pluto, to a far paler hue, suggesting that lighter nitrogen frosts had covered older reddish material.[6] The eruption of volatiles from Triton's equator and their deposition at the poles may redistribute enough mass over the course of 10,000 years to cause polar wander.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nTriton's south polar region is covered by a highly reflective cap of frozen nitrogen and methane sprinkled by impact craters and openings of geysers. Little is known about the north pole because it was on the night side during the Voyager 2 encounter, but it is thought that Triton must also have a north polar ice cap.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe high plains found on Triton's eastern hemisphere, such as Cipango Planum, cover over and blot out older features, and are therefore almost certainly the result of icy lava washing over the previous landscape. The plains are dotted with pits, such as Leviathan Patera, which are probably the vents from which this lava emerged. The composition of the lava is unknown, although a mixture of ammonia and water is suspected.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour roughly circular \\"walled plains\\" have been identified on Triton. They are the flattest regions so far discovered, with a variance in altitude of less than 200?m. They are thought to have formed from eruption of icy lava.[6] The plains near Triton's eastern limb are dotted with black spots, the maculae. Some maculae are simple dark spots with diffuse boundaries, and others comprise a dark central patch surrounded by a white halo with sharp boundaries.  The maculae typically have diameters of about 100?km and widths of the halos of between 20 and 30?km.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are extensive ridges and valleys in complex patterns across Triton's surface, probably the result of freezeÿthaw cycles.[58] Many also appear to be tectonic in nature and may result from extension or strike-slip faulting.[59] There are long double ridges of ice with central troughs bearing a strong resemblance to Europan lineae (although they have a larger scale[13]), and which may have a similar origin,[6] possibly shear heating from strike-slip motion along faults caused by diurnal tidal stresses experienced before Triton's orbit was fully circularized.[13] These faults with parallel ridges expelled from the interior cross complex terrain with valleys in the equatorial region. The ridges and furrows, or sulci, such as Yasu Sulci, Ho Sulci, and Lo Sulci,[60] are thought to be of intermediate age in Triton's geological history, and in many cases to have formed concurrently. They tend to be clustered in groups or \\"packets\\".[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nTriton's western hemisphere consists of a strange series of fissures and depressions known as \\"cantaloupe terrain\\" because of its resemblance to the skin of a cantaloupe melon. Although it has few craters, it is thought that this is the oldest terrain on Triton.[61] It probably covers much of Triton's western half.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nCantaloupe terrain, which is mostly dirty water ice, is only known to exist on Triton. It contains depressions 30ÿ40?km in diameter.[61] The depressions (cavi) are probably not impact craters because they are all of similar size and have smooth curves. The leading hypothesis for their formation is diapirism, the rising of \\"lumps\\" of less dense material through a stratum of denser material.[6][62] Alternative hypotheses include formation by collapses, or by flooding caused by cryovolcanism.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to constant erasure and modification by ongoing geological activity, impact craters on Triton's surface are relatively rare. A census of Triton's craters imaged by Voyager 2 found only 179 that were incontestably of impact origin, compared with 835 observed for Uranus's moon Miranda, which has only three percent of Triton's surface area.[63]  The largest crater observed on Triton thought to have been created by an impact is a 27?km-diameter feature called Mazomba.[63][64] Although larger craters have been observed, they are generally thought to be volcanic in nature.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe few impact craters on Triton are almost all concentrated in the leading hemispherethat facing the direction of the orbital motionwith the majority concentrated around the equator between 30 and 70 longitude,[63] resulting from material swept up from orbit around Neptune.[49] Because it orbits with one side permanently facing the planet, astronomers expect that Triton should have fewer impacts on its trailing hemisphere, due to impacts on the leading hemisphere being more frequent and more violent.[63] Voyager 2 imaged only 40% of Triton's surface, so this remains uncertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe orbital properties of Triton were already determined with high accuracy in the 19th century. It was found to have a retrograde orbit, at a very high angle of inclination to the plane of Neptune's orbit. The first detailed observations of Triton were not made until 1930. Little was known about the satellite until Voyager 2 flew by in 1989.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the flyby of Voyager 2, astronomers suspected that Triton might have liquid nitrogen seas and a nitrogen/methane atmosphere with a density as much as 30% that of Earth. Like the famous overestimates of the atmospheric density of Mars, this proved incorrect. As with Mars, a denser atmosphere is postulated for its early history.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first attempt to measure the diameter of Triton was made by Gerard Kuiper in 1954. He obtained a value of 3,800?km. Subsequent measurement attempts arrived at values ranging from 2,500 to 6,000?km, or from slightly smaller than the Moon (3474.2?km) to nearly half the diameter of Earth.[66] Data from the approach of Voyager 2 to Neptune on August 25, 1989, led to a more accurate estimate of Triton's diameter (2,706?km).[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s, various observations from Earth were made of the limb of Triton using the occultation of nearby stars, which indicated the presence of an atmosphere and an exotic surface. Observations in late 1997 suggests that Triton is heating up and the atmosphere has become significantly denser than when Voyager 2 flew past in 1989.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew concepts for missions to the Neptune system to be conducted in the 2010s have been brought forward by NASA scientists on numerous occasions over the last decades. All of them identified Triton as being a prime target and a separate Triton lander comparable to the Huygens probe for Titan was frequently included in those plans. No efforts aimed at Neptune and Triton went beyond the proposal phase and NASA's funding on missions to the outer Solar System is currently focused on the Jupiter and Saturn systems.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nA proposed lander mission to Triton, called Triton Hopper, would mine nitrogen ice from the surface of Triton and process it to be used as small rocket propellant and fly or 'hop' across the surface.[69][70]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 October 2017 Triton occulted the star UCAC4 410-143659.[71]","input":"How are saturn's moon titan and neptune's triton similar?"},{"output":"James Hargreaves","context":"The spinning jenny is a multi-spindle spinning frame, and was one of the key developments in the industrialization of weaving during the early Industrial Revolution. It was invented in 1764 by James Hargreaves in Stanhill, Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire in England. The device reduced the amount of work needed to produce cloth, with a worker able to work eight or more spools at once. This grew to 120 as technology advanced. The yarn produced by the jenny was not very strong until Richard Arkwright invented the water-powered 'water frame', which produced yarn harder and stronger than that of the initial spinning jenny. It started the factory system.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spinning jenny was invented by James Hargreaves. He was born in Oswaldtwistle, near Blackburn, around 1720. Blackburn was a town with a population of about 5,000, known for the production of \\"Blackburn greys,\\" cloths of linen warp and cotton weft initially imported from India. They were usually sent to London to be printed.\\r\\nAt the time, cotton production could not keep up with demand of the textile industry, and Hargreaves spent some time considering how to improve the process. The flying shuttle (John Kay 1733) had increased yarn demand by the weavers by doubling their productivity,[2] and now the spinning jenny could supply that demand by increasing the spinners' productivity even more. The machine produced coarse thread.\\r\\nThe idea was developed by Hargreaves as a metal frame with eight wooden spindles at one end. A set of eight rovings was attached to a beam on that frame. The rovings when extended passed through two horizontal bars of wood that could be clasped together. These bars could be drawn along the top of the frame by the spinner's left hand thus extending the thread. The spinner used his right hand to rapidly turn a wheel which caused all the spindles to revolve, and the thread to be spun. When the bars were returned, the thread wound onto the spindle. A pressing wire (faller) was used to guide the threads onto the right place on the spindle.[3]\\r\\nIn the 17th century, England was famous for its woollen and worsted cloth. That industry was centred in the east and south in towns such as Norwich which jealously protected their product. Cotton processing was tiny: in 1701 only 1,985,868 pounds (900,775?kg) of cotton-wool was imported into England, and by 1730 this had fallen to 1,545,472 pounds (701,014?kg). This was due to commercial legislation (Calico Acts) to protect the woollen industry.[4] Cheap calico prints, imported by the East India Company from \\"Hindustan\\", became popular. In 1700 an Act of Parliament was passed to prevent the importation of dyed or printed calicoes from India, China or Persia. This caused grey cloth (calico that hadn't been finished - dyed or printed) to be imported instead, and these were printed in southern England with popular patterns. Lancashire businessmen produced grey cloth with linen warp and cotton weft, which they sent to London to be finished.[4] Cotton-wool imports recovered and by 1720 were almost back to 1701 levels. Again the woollen manufacturers claimed this was taking jobs from workers in Coventry.[5] Another law was passed, to fine anyone caught wearing printed or stained calico; muslins, neckcloths and fustians were exempted. It was this exemption that the Lancashire manufacturers exploited.\\r\\nThe use of coloured cotton weft, with linen warp was permitted in the 1736 Manchester Act. There now was an artificial demand for woven cloth. In 1764, 3,870,392 pounds (1,755,580?kg) of cotton-wool was imported.[6]\\r\\nIn England, before canals, and before the turnpikes, the only way to transport goods such as calicos, broadcloth or cotton-wool was by packhorse. Strings of packhorses travelled along a network of bridle paths. A merchant would be away from home most of the year, carrying his takings in cash in his saddlebag. Later a series of chapmen would work for the merchant, taking wares to wholesalers and clients in other towns, with them would go sample books.[7]\\r\\nBefore 1720, the handloom weaver spent part of each day visiting neighbours buying any weft they had. Carding and spinning could be the only income for that household, or part of it. The family might farm a few acres and card, spin and weave wool and cotton.[8] It took three carders to provide the roving for one spinner, and up to three spinners to provide the yarn for one weaver. The process was continuous, and done by both sexes, from the youngest to the oldest. The weaver would go once a week to the market with his wares and offer them for sale.\\r\\nA change came about 1740 when fustian masters gave out raw cotton and warps to the weavers and returned to collect the finished cloth (L Putting-out system). The weaver organised the carding, spinning and weaving to the master's specification.[9] The master then dyed or printed the grey cloth, and took it to shopkeepers. Ten years later this had changed and the fustian masters were middle men, who collected the grey cloth and took it to market in Manchester where it was sold to merchants who organised the finishing.\\r\\nTo handweave a 12-pound (5.4?kg) piece of eighteenpenny weft took 14 days and paid 36 shillings in all. Of this nine shillings was paid for spinning, and nine for carding.[8] So by 1750, a rudimentary manufacturing system feeding into a marketing system emerged.\\r\\nIn 1738 John Kay started to improve the loom. He improved the reed, and invented the raceboard, the shuttleboxes and the picker which together allowed one weaver to double his output. This invention is commonly called the fly-shuttle. It met with violent opposition and he fled from Lancashire to Leeds.[10] Though the workers thought this was a threat to their jobs, it was adopted and the pressure was on to speed up carding and spinning.\\r\\nThe shortage of spinning capacity to feed the more efficient looms provided the motivation to develop more productive spinning techniques such as the spinning jenny, and triggered the start of the Industrial Revolution.\\r\\nHargreaves kept the machine secret for some time, but produced a number for his own growing industry. The price of yarn fell, angering the large spinning community in Blackburn. Eventually they broke into his house and smashed his machines, forcing him to flee to Nottingham in 1768. This was a centre for the hosiery industry, and knitted silks, cottons and wool. There he set up shop producing jennies in secret for one Mr Shipley, with the assistance of a joiner named Thomas James. He and James set up a textile business in Mill Street. On 12 July 1770, he took out a patent (no. 962) on his invention, the Spinning Jennya machine for spinning, drawing and twisting cotton.[11] [12] By this time a number of spinners in Lancashire were using copies of the machine, and Hargreaves sent notice that he was taking legal action against them. The manufacturers met, and offered Hargreaves S3,000. He at first demanded S7,000, and stood out for S4,000, but the case eventually fell apart when it was learned he had sold several in the past.[13]\\r\\nThe spinning jenny succeeded because it held more than one ball of yarn, making more yarn in a shorter time and reducing the overall cost. The spinning jenny would not have been such a success if the flying shuttle had not been invented and installed in textile factories. Its success was limited in that it required the rovings to be prepared on a wheel, and this was limited by the need to card by hand.[1] It continued in common use in the cotton and fustian industry until about 1810.[14] The spinning jenny was superseded by the spinning mule. The jenny was adapted for the process of slubbing, being the basis of the Slubbing Billy.[15]\\r\\nThe most common story told about the invention of the device and the origin of the Jenny in the machine's name is that a daughter (or his wife) named Jenny knocked over one of their own spinning wheels. The device kept working as normal, with the spindle now pointed upright. Hargreaves realized there was no particular reason the spindles had to be horizontal, as they always had been, and he could place them vertically in a row.[16]\\r\\nThe name is variously said to derive from this tale. The Registers of Church Kirk show that Hargreaves had several daughters, but none named Jenny (neither was his wife). A more likely explanation of the name is that 'Jenny' was an abbreviation of 'engine'.[17]\\r\\nThomas Highs of Leigh has claimed to be the inventor[18] and the story is repeated using his wife's name.\\r\\nAnother myth has Thomas Earnshaw inventing a spinning device of a similar description - but destroying it after fearing he might be taking bread out of the mouths of the poor.[19]","input":"Who was the inventor of the spinning jenny?"},{"output":"Lady Jane Grey","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe longest reign of a British monarch is that of the current monarch, Elizabeth II (7004239850000000000?65?years, 243?days since 6 February 1952).

Samuel Gompers of the Cigar Makers' International Union was elected president at its founding convention and reelected every year, except one, until his death in 1924. The A.F. of L was the largest union grouping in the United States for the first half of the 20th century, even after the creation of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) by unions which were expelled by the A.F. of L. in 1935 over its opposition to industrial unionism. The Federation was founded and dominated by craft unions throughout its first fifty years, after which many craft union affiliates turned to organizing on an industrial union basis to meet the challenge from the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in the 1940s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1955, the A.F. of L. merged with the CIO to create the AFL-CIO, which has comprised the longest lasting and most influential labor federation in the United States to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Federation of Labor (A.F. of L.) organized as an association of trade unions in 1886. The organization emerged from a dispute with the Knights of Labor (K of L) organization, in which the leadership of that organization solicited locals of various craft unions to withdraw from their International organizations and to affiliate with the K of L directly, an action which would have taken funds from the various unions and enriched the K of L's coffers.[1]  The Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions also merged into what would become the American Federation of Labor.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the organizations embroiled in this controversy was the Cigar Makers' International Union (CMIU), a group subject to competition from a dual union, a rival \\"Progressive Cigarmakers' Union,\\" organized by members suspended or expelled by the CMIU.[2] The two cigar unions competed with one another in signing contracts with various cigar manufacturers, who were at this same time combining themselves into manufacturers' associations of their own in New York City, Detroit, Cincinnati, Chicago, and Milwaukee.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1886, the Cigar Manufacturers' Association of New York City attempted to flex its muscle by announcing a 20 percent wage cut in factories around the city. The Cigar Makers' International Union refused to accept the cut and 6,000 of its members in 19 factories were locked out by the owners. A strike lasting four weeks ensued.[3] Just when it appeared that the strike might be won, the New York District Assembly of the Knights of Labor leaped into the breach, offering to settle with the 19 factories at a lower wage scale than that proposed by the CMIU, so long as only the Progressive Cigarmakers' Union was employed.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leadership of the CMIU was enraged and demanded that the New York District Assembly be investigated and punished by the national officials of the Knights of Labor. The committee of investigation was controlled by individuals friendly to the New York District Assembly, however, and the latter was exonerated.[4] The American Federation of Labor was thus originally formed as an alliance of craft unions outside the Knights of Labor as a means of defending themselves against this and similar incursions.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 25, 1886, a circular letter was issued by Adolph Strasser of the Cigar Makers and P.

McGuire of the Carpenters, addressed to all national trade unions and calling for their attendance of a conference in Philadelphia on May 18.[6] The call stated that an element of the Knights of Labor was doing \\"malicious work\\" and causing \\"incalculable mischief by arousing antagonisms and dissensions in the labor movement.\\"[5] The call was signed by Strasser and McGuire, along with representatives of the Granite Cutters, the Iron Molders, and the secretary of the Federation of Trades of North America, a forerunner of the A.F. of L. founded in 1881.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nForty-three invitations were mailed, which drew the attendance of 20 delegates and letters of approval from 12 other unions.[7] At this preliminary gathering, held in Donaldson Hall on the corner of Broad and Filbert Streets,[8] the K of L was charged with conspiring with anti-union bosses to provide labor at below going union rates and with making use of individuals who had crossed picket lines or defaulted on payment of union dues.[9] The body authored a \\"treaty\\" to be presented to the forthcoming May 24, 1886, convention of the Knights of Labor, which demanded that the K of L cease attempting to organize members of International Unions into its own assemblies without permission of the unions involved and that K of L organizers violating this provision should suffer immediate suspension.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor its part, the Knights of Labor considered the demand for the parcelling of the labor movement into narrow craft-based fiefdoms to be anathema, a violation of the principle of solidarity of all workers across craft lines.[10] Negotiations with the dissident craft unions were nipped in the bud by the governing General Assembly of the K of L, however, with the organization's Grand Master Workman, Terence V. Powderly refusing to enter into serious discussions on the matter.[11] The actions of the New York District Assembly of the K of L were upheld.\\r\\n\\r\\nConvinced that no accommodation with the leadership of the Knights of Labor was possible, the heads of the five labor organizations which issued the call for the April 1886 conference issued a new call for a convention to be held December 8, 1886 in Columbus, Ohio in order to construct \\"an American federation of alliance of all national and international trade unions.\\"[12] Forty-two delegates representing 13 national unions and various other local labor organizations responded to the call, agreeing to form themselves into an American Federation of Labor.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nRevenue for the new organization was to be raised on the basis of a \\"per-capita tax\\" of its member organizations, set at the rate of one-half cent per member per month (i.e. six cents per year).[14] Governance of the organization was to be by annual conventions, with one delegate allocated for every 4,000 members of each affiliated union.[14] The founding convention voted to make the President of the new federation a full-time official at a salary of $1,000 per year, and Samuel Gompers of the Cigar Makers' International Union was elected to the position.[14] Gompers would ultimately be re-elected to the position by annual conventions of the organization for every year save one until his death nearly four decades later.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the founding convention of the A.F. of L. had authorized the establishment of a publication for the new organization, Gompers made use of the existing labor press to generate support for the position of the craft unions against the Knights of Labor. Powerful opinion-makers of the American labor movement such as the Philadelphia Tocsin, Haverhill Labor, the Brooklyn Labor Press, and the Denver Labor Enquirer granted Gompers space in their pages, in which he made the case for the unions against the attacks of employers, \\"all too often aided by the K of L.\\"[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nHeadway was made in the form of endorsement by various local labor bodies. Some assemblies of the K of L supported the Cigar Makers' position and departed the organization: in Baltimore, 30 locals left the organization, while the membership of the Knights in Chicago fell from 25,000 in 1886 to just 3,500 in 1887.[16] Factional warfare broke out in the K of L, with Terence Powderly blaming the organization's travails on \\"radicals\\" in its ranks, while those opposing Powderly called for an end to what they perceived as \\"autocratic leadership.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the face of the steady disintegration of its rival, the fledgling American Federation of Labor struggled to maintain itself, with the group showing very slow and incremental growth in its first years, only cracking the 250,000 member mark in 1892.[18] The group from the outset concentrated upon the income and working conditions of its membership as its almost sole focus. The A.F. of L.'s founding convention declaring \\"higher wages and a shorter workday\\" to be \\"preliminary steps toward great and accompanying improvements in the condition of the working people.\\" Participation in partisan politics was avoided as inherently divisive, and the group's constitution was structured to prevent the admission of political parties as affiliates.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis fundamentally conservative \\"pure and simple\\" approach limited the A.F. of L. to matters pertaining to working conditions and rates of pay, relegating political goals to its allies in the political sphere. The Federation favored pursuit of workers' immediate demands rather than challenging the property rights of owners, and took a pragmatic view of politics which favored tactical support for particular politicians over formation of a party devoted to workers' interests. The A.F. of L.'s leadership believed the expansion of the capitalist system was seen as the path to betterment of labor, an orientation making it possible for the A.F. of L. to present itself as what one historian has called \\"the conservative alternative to working class radicalism.\\"[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A.F. of L. faced its first major reversal when employers launched an open shop movement in 1903 designed to drive unions out of construction, mining, longshore and other industries. Membership in the A.F. of L.'s affiliated unions declined between 1904 and 1914 in the face of this concerted anti-union drive, which made effective use of legal injunctions against strikes, court rulings given force when backed with the armed might of the state.[citation needed]\\r\\nAt its November 1907 Convention in Norfolk, Virginia the A.F. of L. founded the future North America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU) as Department of Building Trades.[21]:1\\r\\n\\r\\nEver the pragmatist, Gompers argued that labor should \\"reward its friends and punish its enemies\\" in both major parties. However, in the 1900s (decade), the two parties began to realign, with the main faction of the Republican Party coming to identify with the interests of banks and manufacturers, while a substantial portion of the rival Democratic Party took a more labor-friendly position. While not precluding its members from belonging to the Socialist Party or working with its members, the A.F. of L. traditionally refused to pursue the tactic of independent political action by the workers in the form of the existing Socialist Party or the establishment of a new  labor party. After 1908, the organization's tie to the Democratic party grew increasingly strong.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome unions within the A.F. of L. helped form and participated in the National Civic Federation. The National Civic Federation was formed by several progressive employers who sought to avoid labor disputes by fostering collective bargaining and \\"responsible\\" unionism. Labor's participation in this federation, at first tentative, created internal division within the A.F. of L. Socialists, who believed the only way to help workers was to remove large industry from private ownership, denounced labor's efforts at cooperation with the capitalists in the National Civic Federation. The A.F. of L. nonetheless continued its association with the group, which declined in importance as the decade of the 1910s drew to a close.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 1890s, Gompers was planning an international federation of labor, starting with the expansion of A.F. of L. affiliates in Canada, especially Ontario. He helped the Canadian Trades and Labour Congress with money and organizers, and by 1902, the A.F. of L. came to dominate the Canadian union movement.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A.F. of L. vigorously opposed unrestricted immigration from Europe for moral, cultural, and racial reasons. The issue unified the workers who feared that an influx of new workers would flood the labor market and lower wages.[25] Nativism was not a factor because upwards of half the union members were themselves immigrants or the sons of immigrants from Ireland, Germany and Britain.  Nativism was a factor when the A.F. of L. even more strenuously opposed all immigration from Asia because it represented (to its Euro-American members) an alien culture that could not be assimilated into American society. The A.F. of L. intensified its opposition after 1906 and was instrumental in passing immigration restriction bills from the 1890s to the 1920s, such as the 1921 Emergency Quota Act and the Immigration Act of 1924, and seeing that they were strictly enforced.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nMink (1986) concludes that the link between the A.F. of L. and the Democratic Party rested in part on immigration issues, noting the large corporations, which supported the Republicans, wanted more immigration to augment their labor force.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the beginning of World War I, the A.F. of L. was against prohibition as it was viewed as cultural right of the working class to drink.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War I, the A.F. of L.motivated by fear of government repression, and hope of aid (often in the form of pro-A.F. of L. labor policies)had worked out an informal agreement with the United States government, in which the A.F. of L. would coordinate with the government both to support the war effort and to join \\"into an alliance to crush radical labor groups\\" such as the Industrial Workers of the World and Socialist Party of America.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the pro-business environment of the 1920s, business launched a large-scale offensive on behalf of the so-called \\"open shop\\", which meant that a person did not have to be a union member to be hired. A.F. of L. unions lost membership steadily until 1933.[30] In 1924, following the death of Samuel Gompers, UMWA member and A.F. of L. vice president William Green became the president of the labor federation.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe organization endorsed pro-labor progressive Robert M. La Follette Sr. in the 1924 presidential election. He only carried his home state of Wisconsin. The campaign failed to establish a permanent independent party closely connected to the labor movement, however, and thereafter the Federation embraced ever more closely the Democratic Party, despite the fact that many union leaders remained Republicans.[32] Herbert Hoover in 1928 won the votes of many Protestant A.F. of L. members.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Depression were hard times for the unions, and membership fell sharply across the country.  As the national economy began to recover in 1933, so did union membership. The New Deal of president Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, strongly favored labor unions. He made sure that relief operations like the Civilian Conservation Corps did not include a training component that would produce skilled workers who would compete with union members in a still glutted market.  The major legislation was the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, called the Wagner Act. It greatly strengthened organized unions, especially by weakening the company unions that many workers belonged to. It was to the members advantage to transform a company union into a local of an A.F. of L. union, and thousands did so, dramatically boosting the membership. The Wagner Act also set up to the National Labor Relations Board, which used its powers to rule in favor of unions and against the companies.  However, the NLRB was later taken over by leftist elements who favored the CIO over the A.F. of L.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1930s A.F. of L. president William Green (president, 1924ÿ1952) experimented with an industrial approach to organizing in the automobile and steel industries.[34]  The A.F. of L. made forays into industrial unionism by chartering federal labor unions, which would organize across an industry and be chartered by the Federation, not through existing craft unions, guilds, or brotherhoods. As early as 1923, the A.F. of L. had chartered federal labor unions, including six news writer locals that had formerly been part of the International Typographical Union.[35] However, in the 1930s the AFL began chartering these federal labor unions as an industrial organizing strategy. The dues in these federal labor unions (FLUs) were kept intentionally low to make them more accessible to low paid industrial workers; however, these low dues later allowed the Internationals in the Federation to deny members of FLUs voting membership at conventions.[36] In 1933, Green sent William Collins to Detroit to organize automobile workers into a federal labor union.[34]  That same year workers at the Westinghouse plant in East Springfield MA, members of federal labor union 18476, struck for recognition.[37] In 1933, the A.F. of L. received 1,205 applications for charters for federal labor unions, 1006 of which were granted.[38] By 1934, the A.F. of L. had successfully organized 32,500 autoworkers using the federal labor union model.[39] Most of the leadership of the craft union internationals that made up the federation, advocated for the FLU's to be absorbed into existing craft union internationals and for these internationals to have supremacy of jurisdiction.[39][38] At the 1933 A.F. of L. convention in Washington, DC John Frey of the Molders and Metal Trades pushed for craft union internationals to have jurisdictional supremacy over the FLU's; the Carpenters headed by William Hutchenson and the IBEW also pushed for FLU's to turn over their members to the authority of the craft internationals between 1933 and 1935.[40]  In 1934, one hundred FLUs met separately and demanded that the A.F. of L. continue to issue charters to unions organizing on an industrial basis independent of the existing craft union internationals.[41] In 1935 the FLUs representing autoworkers and rubber workers both held conventions independent of the craft union internationals.[42]  \\r\\nBy the 1935 A.F. of L. convention, Green and the advocates of traditional craft unionism faced increasing dissension led by John L. Lewis of the coal miners, Sidney Hillman of the Amalgamated, David Dubinsky of the Garment Workers, Charles Howard of the ITU, Thomas McMahon of the Textile Workers, and Max Zaritsky of the Hat, Cap, and Millinery Workers, in addition to the members of the FLU's themselves.[43] Lewis argued that the A.F. of L. was too heavily oriented toward traditional craftsmen, and was overlooking the opportunity to organize millions of semiskilled workers, especially those in industrial factories that made automobiles, rubber, glass and steel. In 1935 Lewis led the dissenting unions in forming a new Congress for Industrial Organization (CIO) within the A.F. of L.  Both the new CIO industrial unions, and the older A.F. of L. crafts unions grew rapidly after 1935. In 1936 union members enthusiastically supported Roosevelt's landslide reelection. Proposals for the creation of an independent labor party were rejected.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A.F. of L. retained close ties to the Democratic machines in big cities through the 1940s.  Its membership surged during the war and it held on to most of its new members after wartime legal support for labor was removed. Despite its close connections to many in Congress, the A.F. of L. was not able to block the TaftÿHartley Act in 1947.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1955, the A.F. of L. and CIO merged to form the AFLÿCIO, headed by George Meany.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring its first years, the A.F. of L. admitted nearly anyone. Gompers opened the A.F. of L. to radical and socialist workers and to some semiskilled and unskilled workers. Women, African Americans, and immigrants joined in small numbers.  But by the 1890s, the Federation had begun to organize only skilled workers in craft unions and became an organization of mostly white men. Although the Federation preached a policy of egalitarianism in regard to African American workers, it actively discriminated against black workers.[47][48]  The A.F. of L. sanctioned the maintenance of segregated locals within its affiliatesparticularly in the construction and railroad industriesa practice which often excluded black workers altogether from union membership and thus from employment in organized industries.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1901, the A.F. of L. lobbied Congress to reauthorize the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, and issued a pamphlet entitled \\"Some reasons for Chinese exclusion. Which shall survive?\\" The A.F. of L. also began one of the first organized labor boycotts when they began putting white stickers on the cigars made by unionized white cigar rollers while simultaneously discouraging consumers from purchasing cigars rolled by Chinese workers.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most ways, the A.F. of L.'s treatment of women workers paralleled its policy towards black workers. The A.F. of L. never adopted a strict policy of gender exclusion and, at times, even came out in favor of women's unionism. But despite such rhetoric, the Federation only half-heartedly supported women's attempts to organize and, more often, took pains to keep women out of unions and the workforce altogether. Only two national unions affiliated with the A.F. of L. at its founding openly included women, and others passed by-laws barring women's membership entirely. The A.F. of L. hired its first female organizer, Mary Kenney O'Sullivan, only in 1892, released her after five months, and it did not replace her or hire another woman national organizer until 1908.   Women who organized their own unions were often turned down in bids to join the Federation, and even women who did join unions found them hostile or intentionally inaccessible. A.F. of L. unions often held meetings at night or in bars when women might find it difficult to attend and where they might feel uncomfortable, and male unionists heckled women who tried to speak at meetings.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally the A.F. of L. viewed women workers as competition, as strikebreakers, or as an unskilled labor reserve that kept wages low. As such, the Federation often opposed women's employment entirely. When it did organize women workers, most often it did so to protect men's jobs and earning power and not to improve the conditions, lives, or wages of women workers.  In response, most women workers remained outside the labor movement. In 1900, only 3.3% of working women were organized into unions. In 1910, even as the A.F. of L. surged forward in membership, the number had dipped to 1.5%. And while it improved to 6.6% over the next decade, women remained mostly outside of unions and practically invisible inside of them into the mid-1920s.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nAttitudes gradually changed within the A.F. of L. due to the pressure of organized female workers. Female-domination began to emerge in the first two decades of the 20th century, including particularly the International Ladies Garment Workers' Union. Women organized independent locals among New York hat makers, in the Chicago stockyards, and among Jewish and Italian waist makers, to name only three examples. Through the efforts of middle class reformers and activists, often of the Women's Trade Union League, these unions joined the AFL.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the beginning, unions affiliated with the A.F. of L. found themselves in conflict when both unions claimed jurisdiction over the same groups of workers: both the Brewers and Teamsters claimed to represent beer truck drivers, both the Machinists and the International Typographical Union claimed to represent certain printroom employees, and the Machinists and a fledgling union known as the \\"Carriage, Wagon and Automobile Workers Union\\" sought to organize the same employeeseven though neither union had made any effort to organize or bargain for those employees. In some cases the A.F. of L. mediated the dispute, usually favoring the larger or more influential union. The A.F. of L. often reversed its jurisdictional rulings over time, as the continuing jurisdictional battles between the Brewers and the Teamsters showed. In other cases the A.F. of L. expelled the offending union, as it did in 1913 in the case of the Carriage, Wagon and Automobile Workers Union (which quickly disappeared).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese jurisdictional disputes were most frequent in the building trades, where a number of different unions might claim the right to have work assigned to their members. The craft unions in this industry organized their own department within the A.F. of L. in 1908, despite the reservations of Gompers and other leaders about creation of a separate body within the A.F. of L. that might function as a federation within a federation. While those fears were partly borne out in practice, as the Building Trades Department did acquire a great deal of practical power gained through resolving jurisdictional disputes between affiliates, the danger that it might serve as the basis for schism never materialized.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAffiliates within the A.F. of L. formed \\"departments\\" to help resolve these jurisdictional conflicts and to provide a more effective voice for member unions in given industries. The Metal Trades Department engaged in some organizing of its own, primarily in shipbuilding, where unions such as the Pipefitters, Machinists and Iron Workers joined together through local metal workers' councils to represent a diverse group of workers. The Railway Employees Department dealt with both jurisdictional disputes between affiliates and pursued a common legislative agenda for all of them. Even that sort of structure did not prevent A.F. of L. unions from finding themselves in conflict on political issues. For example, the International Seamen's Union opposed passage of a law applying to workers engaged in interstate transport that railway unions supported. The A.F. of L. bridged these differences on an ad hoc basis.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A.F. of L. made efforts in its early years to assist its affiliates in organizing: it advanced funds or provided organizers or, in some cases, such as the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Teamsters and the American Federation of Musicians, helped form the union. The A.F. of L. also used its influence (including refusal of charters or expulsion) to heal splits within affiliated unions, to force separate unions seeking to represent the same or closely related jurisdictions to merge, or to mediate disputes between rival factions where both sides claimed to represent the leadership of an affiliated union. The A.F. of L. also chartered \\"federal unions\\"local unions not affiliated with any international unionin those fields in which no affiliate claimed jurisdiction.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A.F. of L. also encouraged the formation of local labor bodies (known as central labor councils) in major metropolitan areas in which all of the affiliates could participate. These local labor councils acquired a great deal of influence in some cases. For example, the Chicago Federation of Labor spearheaded efforts to organize packinghouse and steel workers during and immediately after World War I. Local building trades councils also became powerful in some areas. In San Francisco, the local Building Trades Council, led by Carpenters official P. H. McCarthy, not only dominated the local labor council but helped elect McCarthy mayor of San Francisco in 1909. In a very few cases early in the A.F. of L.'s history, state and local bodies defied A.F. of L. policy or chose to disaffiliate over policy disputes.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Gompers had contact with socialists and such as A.F. of L. co-founder Peter J. McGuire, the A.F. of L. adopted a philosophy of \\"business unionism\\" that emphasized unions' contribution to businesses' profits and national economic growth. The business unionist approach also focused on skilled workers' immediate job-related interests, while refusing to \\"rush to the support of any one of the numerous society-saving or society destroying schemes\\" involved in larger political issues.[54]\\r\\nThis approach was set by Gompers, who was influenced by a fellow cigar maker (and former socialist) Ferdinand Laurrel. Despite his socialist contacts, Gompers himself was not a socialist.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some respects the A.F. of L. leadership took a pragmatic view toward politicians, following Gompers' slogan to \\"reward your friends and punish your enemies\\" without regard to party affiliation. Over time, after repeated disappointments with the failure of labor's legislative efforts to protect workers' rights, which the courts had struck down as unconstitutional, Gompers became almost anti-political, opposing some forms of protective legislation, such as limitations on working hours, because they would detract from the efforts of unions to obtain those same benefits through collective bargaining.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nEmployers discovered the efficacy of labor injunctions, first used with great effect by the Cleveland administration during the Pullman Strike in 1894. While the A.F. of L. sought to outlaw \\"yellow dog contracts,\\" to limit the courts' power to impose \\"government by injunction\\" and to obtain exemption from the antitrust laws that were being used to criminalize labor organizing, the courts reversed what few legislative successes the labor movement won.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A.F. of L. concentrated its political efforts during the last decades of the Gompers administration on securing freedom from state control of unionsin particular an end to the court's use of labor injunctions to block the right to organize or strike and the application of the anti-trust laws to criminalize labor's use of pickets, boycotts and strikes. The A.F. of L. thought that it had achieved the latter with the passage of the Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914which Gompers referred to as \\"Labor's Magna Carta\\". But in Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U.S. 443 (1921), the United States Supreme Court narrowly read the Act and codified the federal courts' existing power to issue injunctions rather than limit it. The court read the phrase \\"between an employer and employees\\" (contained in the first paragraph of the Act) to refer only to cases involving an employer and its own employees, leaving the courts free to punish unions for engaging in sympathy strikes or secondary boycotts.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A.F. of L.'s pessimistic attitude towards politics did not, on the other hand, prevent affiliated unions from pursuing their own agendas. Construction unions supported legislation that governed entry of contractors into the industry and protected workers' rights to pay, rail and mass production industries sought workplace safety legislation, and unions generally agitated for the passage of workers' compensation statutes.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, the A.F. of L. took efforts on behalf of women in supporting protective legislation. It advocated fewer hours for women workers, and based its arguments on assumptions of female weakness. Like efforts to unionize, most support for protective legislation for women came out of a desire to protect men's jobs. If women's hours could be limited, reasoned A.F. of L. officials, they would infringe less on male employment and earning potential. But the A.F. of L. also took more selfless efforts. Even from the 1890s, the A.F. of L. declared itself vigorously in favor of women's suffrage. It often printed pro-suffrage articles in its periodical, and in 1918, it supported the National Union of Women's Suffrage.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe A.F. of L. relaxed its rigid stand against legislation after the death of Gompers. Even so, it remained cautious. Its proposals for unemployment benefits (made in the late 1920s) were too modest to have practical value, as the Great Depression soon showed. The impetus for the major federal labor laws of the 1930s came from the New Deal. The enormous growth in union membership came after Congress passed the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933 and National Labor Relations Act in 1935. The A.F. of L. refused to sanction or participate in the mass strikes led by John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers and other left unions such as the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. After the A.F. of L. expelled the CIO in 1936, the CIO undertook a major organizing effort. The A.F. of L. responded with its own massive organizing drive that kept its membership totals 50 percent higher than the CIO's.[citation needed]","input":"When was the american federation of labor founded?"},{"output":"December 19, 1801","context":"This History of the University of South Carolina began in the 18th century when intersectional differences arose between the Lowcountry and the Upstate. It was conceived that a state supported college located in the center of the state at Columbia, South Carolina would foster friendships between those of both regions thus allowing the state to present a united front to the nation when threatened with issues jeopardizing the South Carolina way of life. The University of South Carolina's history can be described in four distinct phases: a firebrand college (1801ÿ1862), constant reorganization (1865ÿ1891), college to university (1891ÿ1944) and the state's university (1944ÿpresent).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University was founded as South Carolina College on December 19, 1801 by an act of the General Assembly after Governor John Drayton pushed for its foundation on November 23, 1801. The establishment of a publicly funded college at the capital was intended to unite and promote harmony between the Lowcountry and the Backcountry. On January 10, 1805, having an initial enrollment of nine students, the college commenced classes with a traditional classical curriculum. Jonathan Maxcy was its first president and served until his death in 1820.\\r\\nWith the generous support of the General Assembly, South Carolina College acquired a reputation as the leading institution of the South and attracted several noteworthy scholars, including Francis Lieber, Thomas Cooper, and Joseph LeConte. However, the college suffered greatly and lost most of its prestige when it closed during the American Civil War.\\r\\nThe students formed a cadet company in December 1860 to aid the Southern cause, but an order by Governor Pickens prevented them from leaving Columbia. Undeterred, the students disbanded their company on April 12 and formed a new company while en route to Charleston so that the governor's previous holding orders would be invalid. Once in Charleston, General Beauregard assigned the company to guard Sullivan's Island, much to the dismay of the students who greatly desired to be a part of the Battle of Fort Sumter. After three weeks of guard duty, the student cadet company returned to Columbia to a hero's welcome.\\r\\nLater in June 1861, the students reformed the company and requested to be accepted for service. Governor Pickens accepted their request provided that the faculty also approved the venture, but the faculty did not give its consent because they did not want the college to needlessly be closed. The frustrated students even went as far as negotiating service of their unit with President Jefferson Davis, who agreed, but again Governor Pickens denied their use because the faculty was not willing to let them go.\\r\\nWhen the students returned in October, they reorganized their military unit as the \\"third company.\\" The Union attack of the South Carolina coast in November at the Battle of Port Royal led Governor Pickens to agree to their request to be mustered for active duty, but President Longstreet and the faculty steadfastly maintained their opposition to the students leaving for service. However, with the support of the governor the students ignored the protests of the faculty and departed for the Lowcountry. Governor Pickens kept the student company in Charleston to serve as his bodyguard and because the Union forces at Port Royal did not press their advantage, he released the students from military service on December 10.\\r\\nSeventy-two students were present for classes in January 1862 and the college functioned as best it could until a call by the Confederate government for South Carolina to fill its quota of 18,000 soldiers. A system of conscription would begin on March 20 for all men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, so on March 8 all of the students at the college volunteered for service in order to avoid the dishonor of having been conscripted. Despite the depletion of students, the professors issued a notice that the college would temporarily close and would reopen to those under eighteen. When the college reopened on March 17, only nine students showed up for classes and it became quite apparent to all that the college would not last past the end of the term in June.\\r\\nOn June 25 with the consent of the state government, the Confederate authorities took possession of the college buildings and converted them into a hospital. After many unsuccessful attempts to reopen the college, the trustees passed a resolution on December 2, 1863 that officially closed the college. By February 1865, Sherman's army had reached the outskirts of Columbia and the college was spared from destruction by the Union forces because of its use as a hospital. In addition, a company of the 25th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment was stationed at the campus on February 17 to protect it from harm and to thwart off pillaging Yankee soldiers.\\r\\nThe Union army took possession of the college on May 24, 1865 and although the future for the college under military control, General John Porter Hatch sent a letter on June 19 to the remaining professors at the college that it should reopen as soon as possible. The appointment of Benjamin Franklin Perry as provisional governor of South Carolina on June 30 by President Andrew Johnson restored civilian rule to the state. Perry reinstated the trustees to their positions and the board met on September 20 to authorize the college to reopen on the first Monday of January in 1866.\\r\\nIn a message to the legislature in October, Perry sought to convert the college into a university because with the state in an impoverished situation, it would provide a more practical education. The model that he wished to follow was the elective system used by the University of Virginia. Perry was succeeded in November as governor by James Lawrence Orr, a graduate of the University of Virginia, who also wished to see the college adopt the curriculum of his alma mater. Little opposition developed to change the College into a university and bill to establish the University of South Carolina was passed by the General Assembly on December 19, 1865, sixty-four years after the institution's foundation.\\r\\nThe schools of the university remained largely the same as they were in the College, with the addition of a school of engineering and mathematics. For the students, the difference was great because they were given much more freedom than afforded in the College, and they were given the ability to choose their classes rather than having to submit to a compulsory curriculum identical for all. Perry and Orr believed that the relaxed atmosphere at the University would allow it to prosper and reach three or four hundred students in a few years.[1]\\r\\nThe reopening of the University was pushed back to January 10 due to the dilapidated condition of the buildings on the campus and to celebrate the anniversary of the original opening of South Carolina College. Fewer than fifty students attended in the first term, which alarmed Governor Orr. He recommended to the General Assembly that schools of law and medicine be added, which the legislature established in 1866. Despite this step, the University faced an ominous future as the state was beginning to undergo Reconstruction.\\r\\nAfter Radical Republicans gained control of the state government in 1868, they sought to integrate the University; the constitution of 1868 had stated that all universities of the state should be \\"free and open to all the children and youths of the State, without regard to race and color.\\"[2] Former Governor Orr urged the legislature to preserve the University as an institution for the whites and to convert the dormant campus of The Citadel into a college for the blacks. Governor Robert Kingston Scott ignored this request and recommended that the legislature bring the University into compliance with the Morrill Act to make it qualify as a land grant college and accept federal aid; it had to remove race as an admissions criteria.\\r\\nThe University Act of 1869 reorganized the University and provided it with generous state financial support. An amendment was added to the act by W. J. Whipper, a black representative from Beaufort, to prevent racial discrimination from the admissions policy of the University. The legislature elected two black trustees to the governing board of the University on March 9, 1869. Franklin J. Moses, Jr., state representative and speaker of the house, also supported admission of all races to the state school. In October 1873, Henry E. Hayne, the Republican secretary of state, was admitted as the first black student; he was of mostly white ancestry with a white politician father.\\r\\nThe admission of black students to the University was inevitable, and three factors contributed to this. First, the University never achieved a level of enrollment that was commensurate with its financial backing by the legislature. Enrollment never exceeded one hundred students, whereas the enrollment at Wofford College exceeded that mark in 1870. White students were believed to avoid the university from fear it would be integrated.[citation needed] The second reason was the failure of the state to provide an adequate public university for the education of blacks. It was trying to compensate rapidly for the state's failure to educate blacks in the antebellum years. In 1872, funds were allocated for the Agricultural and Mechanical Institute at Orangeburg, but they were badly mismanaged. Black legislators called for the opening of the University to black students. Finally, the state Republican party split for the election of 1872 between Radical and moderate factions. The Radicals won and pressed their advantage by electing four blacks to the Board of Trustees, thus constituting a majority.\\r\\nThe legislature established a normal school to train teachers for the lower grades on the campus of the University as well as a preparatory school, since most black students of the state had been deprived of strong academic training in years past. In addition, to encourage enrollment by blacks, tuition and other fees were abolished. On October 7, 1873, Henry E. Hayne, the Secretary of State of South Carolina, became the first black student when he registered for the fall session in the medical college of the University.[3][4] As a result of his enrollment, three professors resigned, and some white students left.\\r\\nOn October 8, enrollment stood at eight students, seven of whom were the sons of professors. The number increased to twenty-two students after many politicians registered with the University to show that it was open for both races, yet few of the politicians attended classes. Troubled by the low enrollment, State Treasurer of South Carolina, Francis L. Cardozo went to Washington and persuaded a handful of students at Howard University to transfer to the University. Drastic measures were required to increase the number of students and the legislature passed an act in February 1874 to provide for 124 scholarships of $200. The conservative press denounced this move because with the absence of tuition, it meant that students were effectively being paid to attend the University, but poor students were often critical to family support, and scholarships helped them cover living expenses.[5] Many of the scholarship students could not meet the entrance requirements into the freshman class, so the faculty assembled them into a sub-freshman class. This plan was abolished in 1875 as the legislature had not authorized it.\\r\\nThe scholarships achieved their desired effect in increasing enrollment and by 1875, 90% of the student body was black.[6] The University of South Carolina holds the distinction of being the only state university in the South to admit and grant degrees to black students during Reconstruction. When the Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1876, they quickly acted to end admission of blacks, closing the University on June 7, 1877 by a joint resolution of the General Assembly. They passed legislation authorizing only white students and setting up Claflin College as the state institution for black students.\\r\\nIt was far from certain that the University would be reopened and debate ensued in the General Assembly over the necessity of the University. Many legislators, led by Martin Witherspoon Gary, felt that the state had other obligations and it was not practical for the state to spend money on the University. In addition, these legislators were from the Upstate and had no attachment to the University. They were not part of the planter elite and had attended other schools. An act to reorganize the University was passed by the state Senate by two votes on March 2, 1878, but it did not provide for the appropriation of funds to the reopening. The act specified that the University was to consist of two branches, one styled as the South Carolina College in Columbia for the whites and Claflin College in Orangeburg for the blacks. In order to mollify agitation by the farming interests, a section of the act specified that an agricultural department was to be established with the University.\\r\\nOn October 5, 1880 the institution was reopened as the South Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts and largely derived its funding from the Morrill Act. Despite its name as an agriculture and mechanical college, few students showed an interest in either area. Only nine students worked the 20-acre (81,000?m2) college farm for the first session and just twenty-one attended the mechanical shop. Because the state could not afford a liberal arts University, it took advantage of the Morrill Act in order to acquire federal funds, and offered some agriculture program to satisfy its requirements.\\r\\nBy 1881, the state's financial situation was markedly improved and Governor Johnson Hagood called for greater expenditures on higher education. With a much higher appropriation, the trustees abolished the farming and mechanical foreman positions, in 1882 restoring the institution to its antebellum status as the South Carolina College. An agriculture department remained, but little of the curriculum was agricultural, and it was essentially identical to the general science program. The department suffered from neglect because its professor, John McLauren McBryde, was also the President of the institution and in that position he focused most of his energies.\\r\\nIn the latter years of the 1880s, the College increasingly came under attack from religious groups and agricultural interests. The denominational colleges, struggling to rebuild from the Civil War, demanded that free tuition be ended at the college, and the General Assembly capitulated in 1887 by fixing tuition rates at $40 per year. Led by Ben Tillman [who owned 400 acres as a planter, cultivated by tenant farmers], the agrarians pushed to establish a separate agriculture college because they believed that the College was not providing an adequate education in agriculture. Despite Tillman's rhetoric, a majority of the students were sons of farmers. At that time, the most advanced agricultural research was being conducted at Cornell and the University of California, both liberal arts colleges.[7]\\r\\nTo take advantage of the Hatch Act and to assuage the concerns of the farmers, the legislature passed an act in 1887 to reorganize the college as the University of South Carolina with six schools and colleges. An agricultural experiment station was set up, the college farm was expanded by 100 acres (0.40?km2), and a well-developed agriculture program was initiated. The University was so successful that Ben Tillman announced his retirement from public life.\\r\\nThomas Green Clemson bequeathed his estate in 1888 to establish and endow a separate agriculture college in the state. Tillman reemerged to carry the cause to the legislature and in 1889, Governor Richardson signed the bill accepting the bequest. The Morrill and Hatch funds were transferred to the new agriculture college in June 1890, and the University's agricultural department was closed. The vitality of the University was threatened during the 1890 campaign when Ben Tillman advocated its closing. Although he won the election for governor, he completed reorganization of the university as a liberal arts college during his term.[8]\\r\\nThe University was reorganized as the South Carolina College in 1891, and it struggled to attract students through the rest of the decade. It was restricted to teaching the subjects of law, literature, classics, and theoretical science.[9] The prestige of the College had fallen such that in 1893, a proposal was offered in the legislature to close the campus and provide homes for Confederate veterans on it instead.[10] With enrollment lagging and the state lacking a liberal arts school for women, the legislature passed a bill in 1893 that mandated the College to admit women. On September 24, 1895, Frances Guignard Gibbes was the first woman to be admitted to the College, and in 1898 Mattie Jean Adams was the first to graduate.[11]\\r\\nAlthough Tillman had crippled the institution when he became governor, he did not let it die. The number of students steadily declined from a high of 235 in 1889 to a low of 68 in 1894; but despite the urging of legislators to close it, Tillman ensured through his governorship that the College received an adequate level of funding. Tillman re-established the normal school at the College, long dormant since the end of Reconstruction. In addition, the legislature authorized adding engineering to the College in 1894 despite a previous prohibition.\\r\\nThe victory by Duncan Clinch Heyward in the gubernatorial election of 1902 marked the end of Tillmanism and the return of support by the governor's office for the institution. Heyward pushed the legislature to convert the College into a University in 1905 to mark the centennial by providing the state with a capstone for its educational system. The effort failed when legislators feared that The Citadel was to be absorbed into the University, but the measure was reintroduced in 1906 and passed on February 17 to charter the institution for the last time as the University of South Carolina.\\r\\nFor the next forty years, the institution struggled to find its identity as it cycled through periods of achieving popularity versus academic excellence. Under the vigorous leadership of President Samuel Chiles Mitchell from 1909 to 1913, enrollment at the University doubled; he brought the University to the state by setting up extension courses in 1910. Incessant criticism by Governor Coleman Livingston Blease over Mitchell's handling of University affairs led to his resignation and the trustees elected William Spenser Currell with the intention of raising the level of scholarship at the University. Entrance requirements were made more stringent and Currell's efforts were rewarded when in 1917 the University became the first state-supported college or university in South Carolina to earn accreditation by the Southern Association.[12]\\r\\nThe entrance of America into World War I was enthusiastically supported by the student body, and the vast majority participated in the ROTC unit at the University. To compensate for the loss of enrollment because of conscription, the war department replaced the ROTC program with the Student Army Training Corps. After the war, the SATC was disbanded and military training was made compulsory for freshman and sophomore students in the ROTC program. The ROTC program was scrapped in 1921 due to lack of interest.\\r\\nAn aura of stagnation existed at the University in the early 1920s and the trustees elected William Davis Melton in 1922 to revive its fortunes. Melton launched a campaign to popularize the institution by convincing the people of the state that it was not exclusively for the elite or a special interest group, but rather for the masses. He gained a major increase in the appropriation by the legislature for the University, and in 1924 student enrollment surpassed that of Clemson for the first time. Following Melton's death in 1926, Davison McDowell Douglas was elected President to consolidate the gains and tighten academic standards. The board of trustees called upon James Rion McKissick in 1936 to return to Melton's policies of popularizing the University.\\r\\nMcKissick established the University News Service to combat perceived misconceptions of the University and to promote the high moral character of the students. Due in large part to his efforts, enrollment reached record numbers and the University entered the 1940s with a renewed sense of optimism. Yet, the world soon became engulfed by World War II. To help with the loss of enrollment because of mobilization, the University received a Naval ROTC detachment. The University was quickly transformed into a Naval school when the Navy set up a V-5 Navy Flight Preparatory School, a Civil Aeronautics Administration-War Training Service program, and a V-12 Navy College Training Program. The V-12 program was the most important to the University because the trainees were enrolled in classes; they became active participants in student life and extracurricular activities.\\r\\nBy November 1944 it was clear that World War II would soon be coming to a close and the servicemen would return to enroll in the university in massive numbers due in large part because of the passage of the G.I. Bill. Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives and trustee of the University Solomon Blatt unveiled a proposal called the \\"new and greater university\\" plan that would move the university from its present site to a 1,200-acre (4.9?km2) site just outside Columbia. At the time, the university was the smallest state university in the South and a larger campus would more easily allow for expansion at much less cost. The idea of a move came from that of the relocation of Louisiana State University in 1925 and it was envisioned that a new campus would provide the impetus for the University of South Carolina \\"to establish itself as a great American state university.\\"[13]\\r\\nBlatt obtained support from all the key players in the politics of South Carolina to facilitate the proposal: Governor Olin D. Johnston, Governor-elect Ransome Judson Williams, Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Edgar Allan Brown, and Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Morris Tuten. The Board of Trustees approved the plan in December 1944 by a vote of 17ÿ2, although complaints were issued from the dissenting voters that the decision was made with too much haste and without any input from the public. In addition, Blatt chose Navy Rear Admiral Norman Murray Smith as the President of the University in large part because he held connections in the political establishments of South Carolina and the federal government necessary to secure funds for the relocation of the university.\\r\\nHowever, Blatt's proposal caused an intense uproar[clarification needed] in the state because alumni and students felt that it would needlessly sever the university from its antebellum tradition.[citation needed] Other complaints arose that the process itself did not allow for public input and it was detested as a product of the Barnwell Ring. Even with the outpouring of condemnation, municipalities lobbied to have the University moved to their locale such as Camden, Cheraw, Georgetown, Manning, Spartanburg, Sumter, Kershaw County and Oconee County.[14] Blatt realized that his proposal in February 1945 would not receive the necessary support in the legislature and he modified it so that the University would expand upon its existing area. This idea was warmly received by the alumni and students, but it died in the Finance Committee after Senator Edgar Brown declined to take up the matter.\\r\\nAfter World War II, enrollment at the University swelled from the influx of veterans. They were wholeheartedly welcomed by President Smith who actively campaigned for their attendance and he announced that every qualified veteran would be admitted to the University. The vast majority of South Carolina veterans chose to attend the University because of its hospitable atmosphere, but also for other reasons. They did not want to attend Clemson or The Citadel because \\"the prospect of returning home to attend a military college was distasteful for the older men leaving the military after fighting the largest war in world history.\\"[15] In addition, Clemson's rural location and its self-imposed restriction on the number of students made it inaccessible for a large number of veterans. The University offered several special programs to meet the needs of the veterans and it continued an accelerated calendar until 1949. It was at this point in history that the two universities switched reputations and missions. Carolina became known as the university for the common man and an institution accessible for all whereas Clemson settled into a status of elitism.[15]\\r\\nPresident Smith faced increasing criticism through his tenure because he failed to articulate a clear policy for the University's future and he did not campaign for the legislature to appropriate enough funds for its needs.[citation needed] As president of a public university, Smith's chief responsibility was to be its publicist and develop ties with the political power of the state. Instead, Sol Blatt grew tired of having to carry the burden for the University in the legislature and Governor Thurmond felt that he received an icy reception from the administration. In 1952, Smith resigned and the protg of Governor Byrnes, Donald S. Russell, was elected President by the Board of Trustees.\\r\\nThe ascendancy of Russell was crucial for the University at a critical moment in its history because he brought youth and dynamic leadership to the Presidency. His vision for the University was for it to be the capstone of the state's higher education system and for it to be the senior partner to the other state colleges. Russell's first step toward building a great university was the strengthening of the faculty by bringing in nationally known professors. Secondly, he improved the academics at the University through the expansion of courses, the revamping of programs and the introduction of entrance examinations. A report conducted by MIT to overhaul the engineering department became the standard used by the American Society for Engineering Education to accredit all engineering schools.[16] In response to the ruling by the Supreme Court of Brown v. Board of Education, the University instituted entrance examinations so as to prevent the mass rush of black high school graduates to enroll at USC. The examinations were also welcomed because they would promote individual merit over wealth or connections and USC became the first college to introduce entrance examinations. Thirdly, a massive building and renovation program was initiated and it was made possible through the acquisition of the properties on the southern boundary of the campus. The renaissance enjoyed by the University became evident by the speakers for commencement addresses and special convocations. Among the distinguished who came to speak at the University were John F. Kennedy, Carl Sandburg, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Ren Pleven, and John Foster Dulles.\\r\\nRussell resigned in 1957 so that he could run for governor in 1958 and Robert L. Sumwalt was named as the temporary president by the trustees. By the end of the summer of 1958, Russell had failed to win the Democratic nomination for governor and the University was still without a permanent President. A movement was started to bring Russell back as the President and he gave positive indications that he would return as President if offered. Yet, many were opposed because they felt that Russell was opportunistic and would leave the University again for the next gubernatorial campaign. Russell had also annoyed many associated with the University through his harsh rhetoric against Ernest Hollings on the campaign trail. The board of trustees was split and instead voted unanimously in 1959 to make Sumwalt the permanent President.\\r\\nAn initiative started by Russell and continued by Sumwalt was the establishment of regional campuses and the formation of the University System. The first extension campus was set up at Florence in 1957 and additional campuses were gained in Beaufort, Lancaster and Conway in 1959. Another campus was added to the system in 1961 at Aiken. The University System served two purposes, it expanded the University's reach across the state and the branch campuses acted as a feeder system for the main campus in Columbia.\\r\\nSumwalt retired in 1962 and he was replaced by Thomas F. Jones as President. Immediately, Jones was confronted by the integration problem that the University faced. Clemson admitted Harvey Gantt in January 1963 and it was just a matter of time before the University would be forced to admit blacks. USC exhausted its legal options in the summer and although large sentiment was against the integration of the University, there was no extra resistance to it requiring federal troops as occurred that same summer at the University of Alabama or at the University of Mississippi the previous year; the latter of which contained violence which had a dramatic conscientious effect on many segregationists in the University community. A student leader perhaps best expressed the altered sentiments of many when he wrote that while \\"we do not want integration . . . neither do we want to be blamed for the loss of dignity and integrity.\\"[17] On September 11, African-Americans Henrie Dobbins Monteith, Robert G. Anderson, and James L. Solomon, Jr. were admitted to the University peacefully.\\r\\nFor the next two decades following integration, the University experienced rapid growth and expansion due in large part to the baby boomer generation entering college. Enrollment stood at 5,660 in 1960, but by 1979 had reached nearly 26,000 students on the Columbia campus alone. The expansion of the University was not limited to the Columbia campus; additional campuses and colleges were set up throughout the state. Clemson established an extension center in 1965 at Sumter, only 40 miles (64?km) away from Columbia. Sol Blatt, then the Speaker of the House, wrote President Tom Jones that \\"the University should build as many two year colleges over the State as rapidly as possible to prevent the expansion of Clemson schools for the Clemson people.\\"[18] President Jones heeded Blatt's advice and over the next decade, the University added campuses in Allendale, Spartanburg, Union and Walterboro. The Clemson extension at Sumter never proved popular, and USC acquired the campus in 1973.\\r\\nThe growth of the University in the 1960s and 70s also brought with it the social activism and disorder of the time. Due to the massive influx of so many students in a short time period, the administration lost control of student life. Drug and alcohol use became so rampant at the University that it became known as a party school.[19] Black students protested the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968 by setting fire to Hamilton College and the USC Field House. On May 7, 1970, approximately 400 students seized the Russell House as a symbolic gesture towards honoring those killed in the Kent State shootings and four days later on May 11, they attempted to meet with the members of the board of trustees, but were rebuffed. Columbia police were called in to quell the student protest but were ineffective. State troopers were also unable to disperse the students. National Guard troops were ordered to the campus by Gov. Bob McNair, and soon dispersed most of the protestors with tear gas. The inability of the administration to control such student outbursts led to President Jones' resignation in 1974. But he had succeeded in turning a sleepy southern college into a full-fledged research institution.\\r\\nJames B. Holderman, a flamboyant and charming executive, was elected President by the board of trustees in 1977. Right away, Holderman championed a proposal to create an honors college because it would foster an academic environment conducive to excellence necessary to keep South Carolina's best students instate. The proposal was approved and the first students were admitted into the South Carolina Honors College in 1978.\\r\\nA persistent problem for the University was the Columbia campus's relationship with the semi-autonomous regional campuses. Once a campus reached a Full-time equivalent of 1,000 students, it was entitled to become a four-year college and the campuses in Aiken, Spartanburg, and Conway took advantage of this rule. The law providing such a transformation was repealed, but it was apparent that the regional campuses were acting in their own interests and not for the University system. Furthermore, the Columbia campus had to compete against its regional campuses for funding because each campus submitted its budget to the General Assembly. To correct these problems, Holderman issued the Carolina Plan that outlined a centralized and unified approach to be taken by the University system. This meant that it would be necessary for lawmakers to fully fund the University system in order for the branch campus to receive the funds they need. The Carolina Plan worked brilliantly as the University system was fully funded in 1977 for the first time since 1967.\\r\\nFollowing up on his success with the Carolina Plan, Holderman issued the Carolina Plan II which called for making USC an international university and a \\"Window to the World.\\" To achieve his goals, Holderman used his connections and his personal charisma to attract world leaders to the USC campus. He was able to put USC on the map by bringing in such world leaders as UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, President Ronald Reagan, Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and many other foreign dignitaries. The highlight of the visits was that of Pope John Paul II in 1987. He exclaimed on the Horseshoe that \\"it is wonderful to be young and a student at the University of South Carolina.\\"[20] The Pope later led a non-denominational service before more than 60,000 at Williams-Brice Stadium.\\r\\nThe international spotlight on the University came at a price and an inquisitive journalism student led to Holderman's downfall. Paul Perkins, a journalism student upset with tuition increases, requested that the University release the salary of visiting professor Jehan Sadat. Holderman balked and refused to release the details even after Perkins and his wife Cheryl filed a Freedom of Information Act request. This denial and the secrecy on the part of the administration led the media to scrutinize other aspects of Holderman's presidency. They inspected his travel budgets and construction contracts and found overwhelming evidence of financial irregularities and extravagant spending. In face of all the negative publicity, Holderman resigned in 1990. Holderman would later be convicted of laundering drug money in 2003.[21] The University trustees elected John M. Palms to succeed Holderman to restore the institution's credibility and respect in the state and world. After leading the University's bicentennial celebrations in 2001,[22] Palms retired and was replaced by Andrew A. Sorensen in 2002. During his tenure from 2002 to 2008, Sorensen raised large sums for research, including a $300 million grant for colorectal cancer. In the spirit of Palms' \\"Cathedrals of Excellence\\" budgeting philosophy, the board of directors moved to transform university land on Assembly Street into an \\"innovation district\\" called Innovista that will develop four strengths: biomedicine, nanotechnology, environmental science and alternative fuels. The Board of Trustees announced the selection of Harris Pastides as the University's 28th president on July 11, 2008.\\r\\nStudent literary societies were an important part of student life at Carolina for the first 150 years or so. The Philomathic was the first such society and was formed within weeks of the opening of SCC in 1805; it included practically the whole student body. In 1806 it was split into the Clariosophic and Euphradian societies.[23] After the university admitted women students, the Hypatian Society was founded in 1915 for women, followed by the Euphrosynean Society in 1924.[24] While both the Clariosophic and Euphradian Societies were deactivated in the 1970s, alumni from the Euphradian Society reactivated the organization in 2010. It continues to operate to this day.","input":"When was the university of south carolina established?"},{"output":"voyeur","context":"Voyeurism is the sexual interest in or practice of spying on people engaged in intimate behaviors, such as undressing, sexual activity, or other actions usually considered to be of a private nature.[1]\\r\\nThe term comes from the French voir which means \\"to see\\". A male voyeur is commonly labeled as \\"Peeping Tom\\" or a \\"Jags\\", a term which originates from the Lady Godiva legend.[2] However, that term is usually applied to a male who observes somebody secretly and, generally, not in a public place.\\r\\nThe American Psychiatric Association has classified certain voyeuristic fantasies, urges and behavior patterns as a paraphilia in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) if the person has acted on these urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.[3] It is described as a disorder of sexual preference in the ICD-10.[4] The DSM-IV defines voyeurism as the act of looking at \\"unsuspecting individuals, usually strangers, who are naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity\\".[5] The diagnosis would not be given to people who experience typical sexual arousal simply by seeing nudity or sexual activity. In order to be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder the symptoms must persist for over six months and the person in question must be over the age of 18.[6]\\r\\nThere is relatively little academic research regarding voyeurism. When a review was published in 1976 there were only 15 available resources.[7] While there has been more research since then, there is still little information on the topic. This is particularly surprising considering the increase in use of the term voyeur and the group of people it can encompass. Historically the term voyeur was used specifically to describe people who fit within the DSM description. However society has accepted the use of the term voyeur as a description of anyone who views the intimate lives of others, even outside of a sexual context.[8] This term is specifically used regarding reality television and other media which allow people to view the personal lives of others. This is a reversal from the historical perspective, moving from a term which describes a specific population in detail, to one which describes the general population vaguely.\\r\\nOne of the few historical theories on the causes of voyeurism comes from psychoanalytic theory. Psychoanalytic theory proposes that voyeurism results from a failure to accept castration anxiety and as a result a failure to identify with the father.[5]\\r\\nVoyeurism has high prevalence rates in most studied populations. Voyeurism was initially believed to only be present in a small portion of the population. This perception changed when Alfred Kinsey discovered that 30% of men prefer coitus with the lights on.[5] This behavior is not considered voyeurism by today's diagnostic standards, but there was little differentiation between normal and pathological behavior at the time. Subsequent research showed that 65% of men had engaged in peeping, which suggests that this behavior is widely spread throughout the population.[5] Congruent with this, research found voyeurism to be the most common sexual law-breaking behavior in both clinical and general populations.[9] In the same study it was found that 42% of college males who had never been convicted of a crime had watched others in sexual situations. An earlier study indicates that 54% of men have voyeuristic fantasies, and that 42% have tried voyeurism.[10] In a national study of Sweden it was found that 7.7% of the population (both men and women) had engaged in voyeurism at some point.[11] It is also believed that voyeurism occurs up to 150 times more frequently than police reports indicate.[11] This same study also indicates that there are high levels of co-occurrence between voyeurism and exhibitionism, finding that 63% of voyeurs also report exhibitionist behavior.[11]\\r\\nDue to the prevalence of voyeurism in society, the people who engage in voyeuristic behaviors are diverse. However, there are some trends regarding who is likely to engage in voyeurism. These statistics apply only to those who qualify as voyeurs under the definition of the DSM, and not the broader modern concept of voyeurism as discussed earlier in this article.\\r\\nEarly research indicated that voyeurs were more mentally healthy than other groups with paraphilias.[7] Compared to the other groups studied, it was found that voyeurs were unlikely to be alcoholics or drug users. More recent research shows that, compared to the general population, voyeurs were moderately more likely to have psychological problems, use alcohol and drugs, and have higher sexual interest generally.[11] This study also shows that voyeurs have a greater number of sexual partners per year, and are more likely to have had a same-sex partner than general populations.[11] Both older and newer research found that voyeurs typically have a later age of first sexual intercourse.[7][11] However, other research found no difference in sexual history between voyeurs and non-voyeurs.[10] Voyeurs who are not also exhibitionists tend to be from a higher socioeconomic status than those who do show exhibitionist behavior.[11]\\r\\nResearch shows that, like almost all paraphilias, voyeurism is more common in men than in women.[11] However, research has found that men and women both report roughly the same likelihood that they would hypothetically engage in voyeurism.[12] There appears to be a greater gender difference when actually presented with the opportunity to perform voyeurism. There is very little research done on voyeurism in women, so very little is known on the subject. One of the few studies deals with a case study of a woman who also had schizophrenia. This limits the degree to which it can generalize to normal populations.[13]\\r\\nLovemap theory suggests that voyeurism exists because looking at naked others shifts from an ancillary sexual behavior, to a primary sexual act.[12] This results in a displacement of sexual desire making the act of watching someone the primary means of sexual satisfaction.\\r\\nVoyeurism has also been linked with obsessiveÿcompulsive disorder (OCD). When treated by the same approach as OCD, voyeuristic behaviors significantly decrease.[14]\\r\\nHistorically voyeurism has been treated in a variety of ways. Psychoanalytic, group psychotherapy and shock aversion approaches have all been attempted with limited success.[7] There is some evidence that shows that pornography can be used as a form of treatment for voyeurism. This is based on the idea that countries with pornography censorship have high amounts of voyeurism.[15] Additionally shifting voyeurs from voyeuristic behavior, to looking at graphic pornography, to looking at the nudes in Playboy has been successfully used as a treatment.[16] These studies show that pornography can be used as a means of satisfying voyeuristic desires without breaking the law.\\r\\nVoyeurism has also been successfully treated with a mix of anti-psychotics and antidepressants. However the patient in this case study had a multitude of other mental health problems. Intense pharmaceutical treatment may not be required for most voyeurs.[17]\\r\\nThere has also been success in treating voyeurism through using treatment methods for obsessive compulsive disorder. There have been multiple instances of successful treatment of voyeurism through putting patients on fluoxetine and treating their voyeuristic behavior as a compulsion.[8][14]\\r\\nAlthough small spy cameras had existed for decades, advances in miniaturization and electronics since the 1950s have greatly aided the ability to conceal miniature cameras, and the quality and affordability of tiny cameras (often called \\"spy cameras\\" or subminiature cameras) has greatly increased. Some consumer digital cameras are now so small that in previous decades they would have qualified as \\"spy cameras\\", and digital cameras of twenty megapixels or more are now being embedded in some mobile camera phones. The vast majority of mobile phones in use are camera phones.\\r\\nCertain image capturing devices are capable of producing images through materials that are opaque to visible light, including clothing. These devices form images by using electromagnetic radiation outside the visible range. Infrared and terahertz-wave cameras are capable of creating images through clothing, though these images differ from what would be created with visible light.[18][19]\\r\\nNon-consensual voyeurism is considered to be a form of sexual abuse.[20][21][22][23] When the interest in a particular subject is obsessive, the behavior may be described as stalking.\\r\\nThe United States FBI assert that some individuals who engage in \\"nuisance\\" offenses (such as voyeurism) may also have a propensity for violence based on behaviors of serious sex offenders.[24] An FBI researcher has suggested that voyeurs are likely to demonstrate some characteristics that are common, but not universal, among serious sexual offenders who invest considerable time and effort in the capturing of a victim (or image of a victim); careful, methodical planning devoted to the selection and preparation of equipment; and often meticulous attention to detail.[25]\\r\\nLittle to no research has been done into the demographics of voyeurs.\\r\\nVoyeurism is not a crime at common law. In common law countries it is only a crime if made so by legislation. In Canada, for example, voyeurism was not a crime when the case Frey v. Fedoruk et al. arose in 1947. In that case, in 1950, the Supreme Court of Canada held that courts could not criminalize voyeurism by classifying it as a breach of the peace and that Parliament would have to specifically outlaw it. On November 1, 2005, this was done when section 162 was added to the Canadian Criminal Code, declaring voyeurism to be a sexual offense.[26]\\r\\nIn some countries voyeurism is considered to be a sex crime. In the United Kingdom, for example, non-consensual voyeurism became a criminal offence on May 1, 2004.[27] In the English case of R v Turner (2006),[28] the manager of a sports centre filmed four women taking showers. There was no indication that the footage had been shown to anyone else or distributed in any way. The defendant pleaded guilty. The Court of Appeal confirmed a sentence of nine months' imprisonment to reflect the seriousness of the abuse of trust and the traumatic effect on the victims.\\r\\nAnother English case in 2009, R v Wilkins (2010),[29][30] resulted in a man who filmed his intercourse with five of his lovers for his own private viewing, being sentenced to imprisonment for eight months and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register, where his name would remain for ten years.\\r\\nIn a more recent English case in 2013, Mark Lancaster was found guilty and jailed for voyeurism, after having tricked an 18-year-old student into traveling to a rented flat in Milton Keynes, where he filmed her with four secret cameras dressing up as a schoolgirl and posing for photographs before he had sex with her.[31]\\r\\nIn the United States, video voyeurism is an offense in nine states[32] and may require the convicted person to register as a sex offender.[33] The original case that led to the criminalization of voyeurism has been made into a television movie called Video Voyeur and documents the criminalization of secret photography. Criminal voyeurism statutes are related to invasion of privacy laws[34] but are specific to unlawful surreptitious surveillance without consent and unlawful recordings including the broadcast, dissemination, publication, or selling of recordings involving places and times when a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a reasonable supposition they are not being photographed or filmed by \\"any mechanical, digital or electronic viewing device, camera or any other instrument capable of recording, storing or transmitting visual images that can be utilized to observe a person.\\"[35]\\r\\nSaudi Arabia banned the sale of camera phones nationwide in April 2004, but reversed the ban in December 2004. Some countries, such as South Korea and Japan, require all camera phones sold in their country to make a clearly audible sound whenever a picture is being taken.\\r\\nIn 2013, the Indian Parliament made amendments to the Indian Penal Code, introducing voyeurism as a criminal offence.[36] A man committing the offence of voyeurism would be liable for imprisonment not less than one year and which may extend up to three years for the first offence, and shall also be liable to fine and for any subsequent conviction would be liable for imprisonment for not less than three years and which may extend up to seven years and with fine.\\r\\nVoyeurism is generally deemed illegal in Singapore. Singapore sentences technologically-enabled voyeurs to a maximum punishment of one year's jail and a fine under the context of insulting a woman's modesty.[37] Recent cases in 2016 include the sentencing of church facility manager Kenneth Yeo Jia Chuan who filmed women in toilets by planting pinhole cameras in a handicapped toilet at the Church of Singapore (Bukit Timah) at Hindhede Road, and in the unisex toilet of the church's office at Bukit Timah Shopping Centre.[38][39]\\r\\nSecret photography by law enforcement authorities is called surveillance and is not considered to be voyeurism, though it may be unlawful or regulated in some countries.\\r\\nNotes","input":"What is the legal term for peeping tom?"},{"output":"Tales From a Not-So-Popular Party Girl","context":"Dork Diaries is a humorous children's book series written and illustrated by Rachel Rene Russell.\\r\\nThe series, written in a diary format, uses drawings, doodles, and comic strips to chronicle the daily life of its 14-year-old protagonist, Nikki Maxwell, in and outside of middle school.\\r\\nRachel Renee Russell said that this series was inspired by her own middle school experiences as well as those of her two daughters, Erin and Nikki.

Dreys are usually built of twigs, dry leaves, and grass, and typically assembled in the forks of a tall tree.[1] They are sometimes referred to as \\"drey nests\\" to distinguish them from squirrel \\"cavity nests\\" (also termed \\"dens\\"). In temperate regions, dreys become much more visible in the autumn, when leaf-fall reveals new nests built the previous summer or in early fall.\\r\\nA favoured site for a drey is a tree crotch about 30 to 45 feet (9.1 to 13.7?m) above ground level. Squirrels may also nest in attics or exterior walls of buildings, where a drey may be regarded as a fire hazard, as some squirrels have a habit of gnawing on electrical cables. At other times, squirrels may inhabit a permanent tree den in the hollow of a trunk or large branch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of the word \\"drey\\" is unknown, but has been traced in English to the early 17th century.[2]\\r\\nIn North America, dreys begin as a collection of small, gnawed-off branches bearing green leaves. The habit of harvesting these branches well before autumn (when the leaves would naturally fall) allows the leaves ÿ though they turn brown ÿ to adhere tightly throughout the winter.[3] A finished drey is a hollow sphere, about a foot or more in diameter, with branches and other rough-hewn materials loosely woven on the outside and an inner surface lined with a variety of finer materials, such as grass, moss, leaves, shredded bark or pine needles. There may be one, or occasionally two, entrance/exit holes in a drey, usually close to the bottom and oriented toward the trunk, which keeps rain out. A second hole is used for an escape route. The incomplete or flat dreys sometimes seen may be hot-weather sleeping platforms, or abandoned efforts built by very young, inexperienced squirrels.\\r\\nDrey construction materials and sizes differ according to squirrel species and region. Eastern gray squirrels, for example, tend to use the leaves, bark and twigs of deciduous trees such as beech, elm, and oak. Southern flying squirrels will often employ fungal rhizomorphs, deciduous leaves, bark and twigs in their nests, while northern flying squirrels often use shredded cedar bark (among other types of bark), lichens, mosses, leaves and twigs in their dreys. In the Pacific Northwest, the northern flying squirrel employs the common Bryoria lichen as the primary material.[4] A drey is almost always at least 20 feet (6.1?m) above the ground, and flying squirrels build much higher.\\r\\nSometimes squirrels build their own dreys and sometimes they occupy a vacant drey that was previously constructed by another tree squirrel, often of a different species. Dreys must protect against the environment, and require constant upkeep to remain water and predator-resistant. Squirrels often build more than one in a season, as reserve nests, lest the primary drey be disturbed by predators or overrun by fleas or lice. Some dreys have been observed in use for more than a decade by multiple generations of squirrels, although the average drey may be used only a year or two before being abandoned. If used repeatedly, squirrels must constantly maintain their drey, replenishing twigs and leaves as necessary. Remnants of an abandoned nest may be visible for years.\\r\\nMale and female squirrels may share the same nest for short times during a breeding season, and during cold winter spells squirrels may share a drey to stay warm. However, females nest alone when pregnant. In North America, squirrels produce broods of about three \\"pups\\" twice a year. (After leaving the drey, a young squirrel is termed a \\"juvenile\\" for its first year of life.) The June broods are sometimes born in dreys, but January broods are usually born and raised in tree cavities, which are much safer. Drey broods are about 40% less likely to survive than tree cavity broods, so long as the cavity entrance hole is no wider than about four inches, which can keep out hungry raccoons.[3]","input":"What animal lives in nests known as dre's?"},{"output":"Muhammad Iqbal","context":"\\"Sare Jahan se Accha\\" (Urdu: ???? ???? ?? ??????, Hindi: ???? ???? ?? ?????; Sre Jahn? se Acch), formally known as \\"Tarnah-i-Hindi\\" (Urdu: ????? ??????, Hindi: ?????-?-??????; \\"Anthem of the People of India\\"), is an Urdu language patriotic song written for children by poet Muhammad Iqbal in the ghazal style of Urdu poetry.[a] The poem was published in the weekly journal Ittehad on 16 August 1904.[1] Publicly recited by Iqbal the following year at Government College, Lahore, British India (now in Pakistan) it quickly became an anthem of opposition to the British Raj. The song, an ode to Hindustanthe land comprising present-day Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, was later published in 1924 in the Urdu book Bang-i-Dara.[2]\\r\\nThe song has remained popular, especially in India. An abridged version is sung and played frequently as a patriotic song and as a marching song of the Indian Armed Forces. A satirical version of the same from a 1958 Hindi movie also remains popular.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIqbal was a lecturer at the Government College, Lahore at that time, and was invited by a student Lala Har Dayal to preside over a function. Instead of delivering a speech, Iqbal sang \\"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\\". The song, in addition to embodying yearning and attachment to the land of Hindustan, expressed \\"cultural memory\\" and had an elegiac quality. In 1905, the 27-year-old Iqbal viewed the future society of the subcontinent as both a pluralistic and composite Hindu-Muslim culture. Later that year he left for Europe for a three-year sojourn that was to transform him into an Islamic philosopher and a visionary of a future Islamic society.[2]\\r\\nIn 1910, Iqbal wrote another song for children, \\"Tarana-e-Milli\\" (Anthem of the Religious Community), which was composed in the same metre and rhyme scheme as \\"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\\", but which renounced much of the sentiment of the earlier song.[4] The sixth stanza of \\"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\\" (1904), which is often quoted as proof of Iqbal's secular outlook:\\r\\nMaz?hab nahؐn? sikht pas men? bair rakhn\\r\\nHindؐ hain? ham, wat?an hai Hindstn? hamr\\r\\nReligion does not teach us to bear ill-will among ourselves\\r\\nWe are of Hind, our homeland is Hindustan.\\r\\ncontrasted significantly with the first stanza of Tarana-e-Milli (1910) reads:[4]\\r\\nCؐn o-?Arab hamr, Hindstn? hamr\\r\\nMuslim hain? ham, wat?an hai sr jahn? hamr\\r\\nCentral Asia[5] and Arabia are ours, Hindustan is ours\\r\\nWe are Muslims, the whole world is our homeland.[4]\\r\\nIqbal's world view had now changed; it had become both global and Islamic. Instead of singing of Hindustan, \\"our homeland,\\" the new song proclaimed that \\"our homeland is the whole world.\\"[6] Two decades later, in his presidential address to the Muslim League annual conference in Allahabad in 1930, he supported a separate nation-state in the Muslim majority areas of the sub-continent, an idea that inspired the creation of Pakistan.[7]\\r\\n???? ???? ?? ???? ???????? ?????\\r\\n?? ?????? ??? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ?????\\r\\n???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???? ?? ?? ??? ???\\r\\n????? ???? ???? ??? ?? ?? ???? ?????\\r\\n???? ?? ?? ?? ?????? ?????? ????? ??\\r\\n?? ????? ?????? ?? ?????? ?????\\r\\n???? ??? ?????? ??? ?? ?? ?????? ?????\\r\\n???? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ???? ???? ?????\\r\\n?? ??? ???? ????! ?? ?? ??? ??? ??? ???\\r\\n???? ??? ????? ?? ?????? ?????\\r\\n???? ???? ?????? ??? ??? ??? ?????\\r\\n???? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???????? ?????\\r\\n????? ? ??? ? ???? ?? ?? ??? ???? ??\\r\\n?? ?? ??? ?? ???? ??? ? ???? ?????\\r\\n??? ??? ?? ?? ???? ???? ???? ?????\\r\\n????? ??? ?? ???? ???? ???? ?????\\r\\n?????! ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???\\r\\n????? ??? ??? ?? ???? ???? ?????!?\\r\\n???? ???? ?? ????? ??????????? ?????\\r\\n?? ???????? ??? ???? ?? ???????? ?????\\r\\n??????? ??? ??? ??? ??, ???? ?? ??? ??? ???\\r\\n???? ???? ???? ?? ??? ?? ???? ?????\\r\\n???? ?? ???? ????, ??????? ????? ??\\r\\n?? ????? ?????, ?? ?????? ?????\\r\\n???? ??? ????? ??? ???? ??????? ??????\\r\\n?????? ?? ????? ?? ?? ????-?-???? ?????\\r\\n? ??-?-???-?-????! ?? ??? ??? ??? ??????\\r\\n???? ???? ?????? ?? ?????? ?????\\r\\n?????? ???? ?????? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n????? ??? ??, ??? ?? ??????????? ?????\\r\\n?????-?-?????-?-???? ?? ??? ?? ???? ??\\r\\n?? ?? ??? ?? ????? ???-?-????? ?????\\r\\n??? ??? ?? ?? ????? ????? ???? ?????\\r\\n?????? ??? ?? ?????? ???-?-????? ?????\\r\\n???????! ??? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???\\r\\n????? ???? ???? ?? ????-?-????? ??????!\\r\\nSre jahn? se acch, Hindositn?[8] hamr\\r\\nHam bulbulen? hain? is kؐ, yih gulsitn?[8] hamr\\r\\nG?h?urbat men? hon? agar ham, raht hai dil wat?an men?\\r\\nSamjho wuhؐn? hamen? bhؐ dil ho jahn? hamr\\r\\nParbat wuh sab se n?ch, hamsyah smn? k\\r\\nWuh santarؐ hamr, wuh psbn? hamr\\r\\nGodؐ men? kheltؐ hain? is kؐ hazron? nadiyn?\\r\\nGuls?h?an hai jin ke dam se ras?h?k-i jann? hamr\\r\\nAi b-i rd-i Gang! wuh din hain? yd tujh ko?\\r\\nUtr tire[9] kinre jab krwn? hamr\\r\\nMaz?hab nahؐn? sikht pas men? bair rakhn\\r\\nHindؐ hain? ham, wat?an hai Hindositn? hamr\\r\\nYnn o-Mi?r o-Rm, sab mi? ga'e jahn? se\\r\\nAb tak magar hai bqؐ, nm o-nis?h?an? hamr\\r\\nKuch bt hai kih hastؐ, mi?tؐ nahؐn? hamrؐ\\r\\n?adiyon? rah hai dus?h?man daur-i zamn? hamr\\r\\nIqbl! ko'ؐ ma?ram apn nahؐn? jahn? men?\\r\\nMa?lm ky kisؐ ko dard-i nihn? hamr!\\r\\nBetter than the entire world, is our Hindustan,\\r\\nWe are its nightingales, and it (is) our garden abode\\r\\nIf we are in an alien place, the heart remains in the homeland,\\r\\nKnow us to be only there where our heart is.\\r\\nThat tallest mountain, that shade-sharer of the sky,\\r\\nIt (is) our sentry, it (is) our watchman\\r\\nIn its lap where frolic thousands of rivers,\\r\\nWhose vitality makes our garden the envy of Paradise.\\r\\nO the flowing waters of the Ganges, do you remember that day\\r\\nWhen our caravan first disembarked on your waterfront?\\r\\nReligion does not teach us to bear animosity among ourselves\\r\\nWe are of Hind, our homeland is Hindustan.\\r\\nIn a world in which ancient Greece, Egypt, and Rome have all vanished\\r\\nOur own attributes (name and sign) live on today.\\r\\nThere is something about our existence for it doesn't get wiped\\r\\nEven though, for centuries, the time-cycle of the world has been our enemy.\\r\\nIqbal!

Modern Germany was formed in 1871 when Otto von Bismarck unified most of the German states, with the notable exception of Austria, into the German Empire.[1] After the First World War Germany lost about 10% of its territory to its neighbours and the Weimar Republic was formed. This republic included territories to the east of today's German borders.\\r\\nThe period of Nazi rule from the 1930s through the end of the Second World War brought significant territorial losses for the country. Nazi Germany initially expanded the country's territory dramatically and conquered most of Europe, though not all areas were added to Germany proper. The Nazis' fortunes changed after the failure of the invasion of Soviet Union. The Nazi regime eventually collapsed, and the Allies occupied Germany.\\r\\nImmediately after the war, all territorial gains were reversed and pre-war Germany was split into British, French and American occupation zones in the northwest, west and south and a Soviet occupation zone in the centre; the capital Berlin was similarly divided into four sectors. The former eastern territories of Germany were ceded to Poland and the Soviet Union and the Oder and Neisse Rivers became Germany's new eastern boundary. This territory became Poland's so-called \\"Recovered Territories\\", while approximately one-third of East Prussia became Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast; virtually the entire German population in these areas was expelled or fled. In the west, the Saar area formed a French-controlled protectorate with limited autonomy, but its own citizenship laws.\\r\\nWith the onset of the Cold War, the western part of Germany was unified as the Trizone, becoming the Federal Republic of Germany in May 1949 (\\"West Germany\\"). Western-occupied West Berlin declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 but was denied by the occupying powers. The Soviet zone, including the Soviet sector of Berlin, became the communist German Democratic Republic (\\"East Germany\\") in October the same year.[1] Effective 1 January 1957 the Saar Protectorate declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany, as provided by its Grundgesetz (constitution) art. 23 (Little Reunification). Following the end of the Cold War, East Germany, including East Berlin, and West Berlin used the same West German constitutional clause and declared their accession to the Federal Republic of Germany effective 3 October 1990 ÿ an event referred to as German reunification.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of the motivation behind the territorial changes is based on historical events in Germany and Western Europe. Migrations that took place over more than a millennium led to pockets of Germans living throughout Central and Eastern Europe as far east as Russia. The existence of these enclaves was sometimes used by German nationalists, such as the Nazis, to justify territorial claims.\\r\\nThe territorial changes of Germany after World War II can be interpreted in the context of the evolution of global nationalism and European nationalism.\\r\\nThe latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century saw the rise of nationalism in Europe. Previously, a country consisted largely of whatever peoples lived on the land that was under the dominion of a particular ruler. As principalities and kingdoms grew through conquest and marriage, a ruler could wind up with many different ethnicities under his dominion.\\r\\nThe concept of nationalism was based on the idea of a \\"people\\" who shared a common bond through race, religion, language and culture. Furthermore, nationalism asserted that each \\"people\\" had a right to its own state. Thus, much of European history in the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century can be understood as efforts to realign national boundaries with this concept of \\"one people, one state\\". Many interior conflicts were a result of more or less pressurising citizens of alternative ethnicities and/or other native languages to assimilate to the ethnicity dominant in the state. Switzerland was the exception, lacking a common native language.\\r\\nMuch conflict would arise when one nation asserted territorial rights to land outside its borders on the basis of an ethnic bond with the people living on the land. Another source of conflict arose when a group of people who constituted a minority in one nation would seek to secede from the nation either to form an independent nation or join another nation with whom they felt stronger ties. Yet another source of conflict was the desire of some nations to expel people from territory within its borders because people did not share a common bond with the majority of people of that nation.\\r\\nTerritorial expansion of the Kingdom of Prussia, which in the 19th century would lead the future German reunification efforts, started with the annexation of territories belonging to the PolishÿLithuanian Commonwealth. Between 1772 and 1795, Prussia took 141,400 km2 (54,600 sq mi) of the Commonwealth's western territoryareas known as Greater Poland, Pomorze and Mazovia (renaming them as South Prussia, West Prussia and New East Prussia)and with it nearly 1 million Polish speaking inhabitants. Frederick the Great immediately sent 57,475 German families to the newly conquered lands in order to solidify his new acquisitions,[2] and abolished the use of the Polish language.[3]\\r\\nFollowing the Napoleonic wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire the North German Confederation, led by Prussia, was combined with the southern states of Baden, Wrttemberg, Bavaria and Hesse and the formerly French newly annexed Alsace-Lorraine to form the German Empire in 1871. In some areas of Prussia's eastern provinces, such as the Province of Posen, the majority of the population was Polish. Many Lorrainians were by native language French. Most of the Alsatians and the Lorrainians of German native language rather clung to France (see Dput protestataire?(fr)), despite all nationalistic claim that language and culture would and should determine one's national affiliation.\\r\\nBritain ceded Heligoland to Germany in 1890 in accordance with the terms of the HeligolandÿZanzibar Treaty. The Heligolanders, then still prevailingly fluent in their Heligolandic dialect of North Frisian, adopted German citizenship, like many other Frisians of Germany along the North Sea coast.\\r\\nAs part of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Russia's new Bolshevik (communist) government renounced all claim to Finland, the future Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Poland, Belarus, Ukraine.\\r\\nMost of these territories were in effect ceded to the German Empire, intended to become economically dependent on and politically closely tied to that empire under different German kings and dukes.\\r\\nRegarding the ceded territories, the treaty stated that \\"Germany and Austria-Hungary intend to determine the future fate of these territories in agreement with their population\\" with few other effects than the appointment of German rulers to the new thrones of Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.\\r\\nThe provisions of the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I obliged Germany to cede some territory to other countries. Besides the loss of the German colonial empire the territories Germany lost were:\\r\\nThe Sudeten Germans had attempted to prevent the German language border areas of former Austria-Hungary from becoming part of Czechoslovakia in 1918. Once part of Bohemia, they had proclaimed the German-Austrian province of Sudetenland in October 1918, voting instead to join the newly declared Republic of German Austria in November 1918. However, this had been forbidden by the victorious allied powers of the First World War (the Treaty of Saint-Germain) and by the Czechoslovak government, partly with force of arms in 1919. Many Sudeten Germans rejected an affiliation to Czechoslovakia, since they had been refused the right to self-determination promised by US president Woodrow Wilson in his Fourteen Points of January 1918.\\r\\nThe Silesian Uprisings (Polish: Powstania ?l?skie) were a series of three armed uprisings (1919ÿ1921) of Poles in the Upper Silesia region against Weimar Republic in order to separate the region (where in some parts Poles constituted a majority) from Germany and join it with the Second Polish Republic.\\r\\nBy World War I, there were isolated groups of Germans or so-called Schwaben as far southeast as the Bosphorus (Turkey), Georgia, and Azerbaijan. After the war, Germany's and Austria-Hungary's loss of territory and the rise of communism in the Soviet Union meant that more Germans than ever constituted sizable minorities in various countries.[clarification needed]\\r\\nGerman nationalists used the existence of large German minorities in other countries as a basis for territorial claims. Many of the propaganda themes of the Nazi regime against Czechoslovakia and Poland claimed that the ethnic Germans (Volksdeutsche) in those territories were persecuted.\\r\\nThe Nazis negotiated a number of population transfers with Joseph Stalin and others with Benito Mussolini so that both Germany and the other country would increase their ethnic homogeneity. However, these population transfers were not sufficient to appease the demands of the Nazis. The Heim ins Reich rhetoric of the Nazis over the continued disjoint status of enclaves such as Danzig and East Prussia was an agitating factor in the politics leading up to World War II, and is considered by many to be among the major causes of Nazi aggressiveness and thus the war. Adolf Hitler used these issues as a pretext for waging wars of aggression against Czechoslovakia and Poland.\\r\\nOn 7 March 1936, Hitler sent a small expeditionary force into the demilitarized Rhineland. This was a clear violation of the Treaty of Versailles (1919, official end of World War I), and as such, France and Britain were within their rights, via the Treaty, to oust the German forces. British public opinion blocked any use of military force, thus preventing French action, as they were internally divided and would not act without British support.\\r\\nIn 1933, a considerable number of anti-Nazi Germans fled to the Saar, as it was the only part of Germany left outside the Third Reich's control. As a result, anti-Nazi groups campaigned heavily for the Saarland to remain under control of League of Nations as long as Adolf Hitler ruled Germany. However, long-held sentiments against France remained entrenched, with very few sympathizing openly with France. When the 15-year-term was over, a plebiscite was held in the territory on 13 January 1935: 90.3% of those voting wished to join Germany.\\r\\nOn 17 January 1935, the territory's re-union with Germany was approved by the League Council. On 1 March, Nazi Germany took over the region and appointed Josef Brckel as Reichskommissar fr die Rckgliederung des Saarlandes, \\"Imperial Commissioner for the re-union of Saarland\\".\\r\\nAs the new Gau was extended to the Rhine, including the historic Palatinate, the region's name was changed again on 8 April 1940 to Gau Saarpfalz (Saar-Palatinate). After the Battle of France, the re-annexed French dpartement of Moselle was incorporated in the Reichsgau.\\r\\nThe Allies were, on paper, committed to upholding the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which specifically prohibited the union of Austria and Germany. This notwithstanding, the Anschluss was among the first major steps in the Austrian-born Adolf Hitler's long-desired creation of an empire including German-speaking lands and territories Germany had lost after World War I.\\r\\nThe events of 12 March 1938, marked the culmination of historical cross-national pressures to unify the German populations of Austria and Germany under one nation. However, the 1938 Anschluss, regardless of its popularity, was enacted by Germany. Earlier, Hitler's Germany had provided support for the Austrian National Socialist Party (Austrian Nazi Party) in its bid to seize power from Austria's Austrofascist leadership. Fully devoted to remaining independent but amidst growing pressures, the chancellor of Austria, Kurt Schuschnigg, tried to hold a plebiscite.\\r\\nAlthough Schuschnigg expected Austria to vote in favour of maintaining autonomy, a well-planned coup d'tat by the Austrian Nazi Party of Austria's state institutions in Vienna took place on 11 March, prior to the vote. With power quickly transferred over to Germany, the Wehrmacht troops entered Austria to enforce the Anschluss. The Nazis held a plebiscite within the following month, where they received 99.73% of the vote. No fighting ever took place and the strongest voices against the annexation, particularly Fascist Italy, France and the United Kingdom (parties to the Stresa Front), were powerless or, in the case of Italy, appeased.\\r\\nOn 29 September 1938, Adolf Hitler, Neville Chamberlain, Benito Mussolini and douard Daladier signed the Munich Agreement. The Czechoslovak government capitulated on September 30 and reluctantly agreed to abide by the agreement. The settlement gave Germany the Sudetenland starting October 10, and de facto control over the rest of Czechoslovakia as long as Hitler promised to go no further.\\r\\nHitler and Chamberlain signed an additional resolution determining to resolve all future disputes between Germany and the United Kingdom through peaceful means. This is often confused with the Four-Power Munich Agreement itself, not least because most photographs of Chamberlain's return show him waving the paper containing the resolution, not the Munich Agreement itself.\\r\\nWithout fortification which was built in Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia was now defenseless. On 5 October, Edvard Bene? resigned as President of Czechoslovakia, realising that the fall of Czechoslovakia was fait accompli. Following the outbreak of World War II, he would form a Czechoslovak government-in-exile in London.\\r\\nOn 13 March 1939, Nazi armies entered Prague and proceeded to occupy the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia, which was transformed into a protectorate of the Reich. The eastern half of the country, Slovakia, became a separate pro-Nazi state, the Slovak Republic.\\r\\nPrime Minister Chamberlain felt betrayed by the Nazi seizure of Czechoslovakia, realising his policy of appeasement towards Hitler had failed, and immediately began to mobilize the British Empire's armed forces on a war footing. France did the same. Though no immediate action followed, Hitler's move on Poland in September started World War II in Europe.\\r\\nBy late 1938, Lithuania had lost control over the situation in the Memel Territory. In the early hours of 23 March 1939, after a political ultimatum had made a Lithuanian delegation travel to Berlin, the Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Juozas Urb?ys and his German counterpart Joachim von Ribbentrop signed the Treaty of the Cession of the Memel Territory to Germany in exchange for a Lithuanian Free Zone in the port of Memel, using the facilities erected in previous years.\\r\\nAfter invading Poland in 1939, Germany annexed the lands it was forced to give to a reformed Poland in 1919ÿ1922 by the Treaty of Versailles, including the \\"Polish Corridor\\", West Prussia, the Province of Posen, and East Upper Silesia. The Volkstag of the Free City of Danzig voted to become a part of Germany again, although Poles and Jews were deprived of their voting rights and all non-Nazi political parties were banned. Parts of Poland that had not been part of Wilhelmine Germany were also incorporated into the Reich.\\r\\nTwo decrees by Adolf Hitler (8 October and 12 October 1939) provided for the division of the annexed areas of Poland into the following administrative units:\\r\\nThese territories had an area of 94,000?km2 (36,000?sq?mi) and a population of 10,000,000 people. The remainder of the Polish territory was annexed by the Soviet Union (c. 52%; see Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) or made into the German-controlled General Government occupation zone.\\r\\nAfter the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Bia?ystok Voivodeship, which included the Bia?ystok, Bielsk Podlaski, Grajewo, ?om?a, Sok܇?ka, Volkovysk, and Grodno Counties, was \\"attached to\\" (not incorporated into) East Prussia, while East Galicia was added to the General Government.\\r\\nAfter the invasion of France in 1940, Germany annexed the dpartements of Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin and Moselle (Alsace-Lorraine). The German government never negotiated or declared a formal annexation, however, in order to preserve the possibility of an agreement with the West.[citation needed]\\r\\nSee Eupen-Malmedy\\r\\nLuxembourg was invaded and occupied by German Forces in June 1940. It was formally annexed to Germany in August 1942.\\r\\nFrom: History of Slovenia \\"After Yugoslavia fell, Germany, Italy, and Hungary each annexed parts of Slovenia, the largest part being Lower Styria which was annexed to the \\"Ostmark\\" (Nazi German Austria).\\"\\r\\nSee Annexation of South Tyrol to Nazi Germany and Italian Social Republic.\\r\\nAll areas that were incorporated into Nazi Germany between 1937 and 8 May 1945 were de facto repudiated at the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences, and were therefore non-issues in the post-war division of Nazi Germany. One exception was Memelland, the incorporation of which at the end of March 1939 was recognised by the UK and France, but not by the USA.\\r\\nAs it became evident that the Allies were going to defeat Nazi Germany decisively, the question arose as to how to redraw the borders of Central and Eastern European countries after the war. In the context of those decisions, the problem arose of what to do about ethnic minorities within the redrawn borders. The territorial changes at the end of World War II were part of negotiated agreements between the victorious Allies to redraw national borders and arrange for deportation of all Germans that were east of the OderÿNeisse line. The Allies occupied Germany, but the Western allies and Soviet Union formed separate governments covering specific parts of Germany (West Germany, as well as West Berlin, and East Germany). The Germanies and West Berlin reunified in 1990.\\r\\nThe final decision to move Poland's boundary westward was made by the US, Britain and the Soviets at the Yalta Conference, shortly before the end of the war. The precise location of the border was left open; the western Allies also accepted in general the principle of the Oder River as the future western border of Poland and of population transfer as the way to prevent future border disputes. The open question was whether the border should follow the eastern or western Neisse rivers, and whether Stettin, the traditional seaport of Berlin, should remain German or be included in Poland.\\r\\nOriginally, Germany was to retain Stettin while the Poles were to annex East Prussia with K?nigsberg. [1]. Eventually, however, Stalin decided that he wanted K?nigsberg as a year-round warm water port for the Soviet Navy and argued that the Poles should receive Stettin instead. The wartime Polish government in exile had little to say in these decisions.[2]\\r\\nKey points of the meeting that are relevant to the territorial changes of Germany are as follows:\\r\\nAt the Potsdam Conference the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union placed the German territories within the 1937 Nazi Germany borders east of the OderÿNeisse line, and with the exception of parts of East Prussia, as formally under Polish administrative control (These were referred to by the Polish communist government as the \\"Western Territories\\" or \\"Regained Territories\\"). It was anticipated that a final peace treaty would follow shortly and either confirm this border or determine whatever alterations might be agreed upon. Northern East Prussia and Memelland were placed under Soviet administrative control. The 1919 Versailles Treaty created Free City of Danzig was also placed under Polish administration. The German population east of the OderÿNeisse line was expelled.\\r\\nAt the end of the conference, the Three Heads of Government agreed on the following actions:\\r\\nThe problem with the status of these territories was that the concluding document of the Potsdam Conference in 1945 was not a legally binding treaty, but a memorandum between the USSR, the USA and the UK. It regulated the issue of the eastern German border, which was to be the OderÿNeisse line, but the final article of the memorandum said that the final decisions concerning Germany were to be subject to a separate peace treaty.\\r\\nBased upon this interpretation of the Potsdam Agreement, the CDU controlled German government maintained that the OderÿNeisse line was completely unacceptable and subject to negotiation. Also the Social Democrats of the SPD initially refused to accept the OderÿNeisse line. Thus, the official German government position on the status of areas vacated by settled German communities east of the OderÿNeisse rivers was that the areas were \\"temporarily under Polish (or [Soviet]) administration.\\"\\r\\nBetween 1970 and 1990, the West German political establishment gradually recognised the \\"facts on the ground\\" and accepted clauses in the Treaty on the Final Settlement, whereby Germany renounced all claims to territory east of the OderÿNeisse line. In the Treaty of Warsaw (1970; ratified in 1972) West Germany recognized the OderÿNeisse line as Poland's western border and renounced any present and future territorial claims; this was reaffirmed by both German states in the 1990 Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany as a pre-condition for re-union. The treaty was ratified in 1991 by the united Germany. United Germany and Poland then finally settled the issue of the OderÿNeisse border by the GermanÿPolish Border Treaty in November 1990. This ended the legal limbo which meant that for 45 years, people on both sides of the border could not be sure whether the status quo reached in 1945 might be changed at some future date.\\r\\nThe \\"Working Party on Provisional Adjustments to the Western Frontiers of Germany\\" approved in 1949 the provisional transfer of 20?km2 (7.7?sq?mi) containing 500 inhabitants to Belgium:[5]\\r\\nAs part of the 1956 treaty, in exchange for the territory ceded by Germany, Belgium ceded to Germany its territory north of the Fringshaus roads and bounded by the Vennbahn. The detached territory, in 1956 containing 704 inhabitants including refugees, was, prior to its 1956 dissolution and partition between West Germany and Belgium, ruled as an independent territory by Belgian Army Major General Paul Bolle, who enjoyed dictatorial powers.[6]\\r\\nDespite the more extensive annexation proposals of the Bakker-Schut Plan, only a few border modifications were implemented. On 23 April 1949, Dutch troops occupied an area of 69?km2 (27?sq?mi), the largest parts of which were Elten (near Emmerich am Rhein) and Selfkant. Many other small border changes were executed, mostly in the vicinity of Arnhem and Dinxperlo. At that time, these areas were inhabited by a total of almost 10,000 people.\\r\\nStarting in March 1957, West Germany negotiated with the Netherlands for the return of these areas. The negotiations led to an agreement (German: Vertrag vom 8. April 1960 zwischen der Bundesrepublik Deutschland und dem K?nigreich der Niederlande zur Regelung von Grenzfragen und anderen zwischen beiden L?ndern bestehenden Problemen; short: Ausgleichsvertrag, i.e. treaty of settlement[7]) made in The Hague on 8 April 1960, in which Germany agreed to pay DEM 280 million for the return of Elten, Selfkant, and Suderwick, as Wiedergutmachung.\\r\\nThe territory was returned to Germany on 1 August 1963, except for one small hill (about 3?km2, 1.2?sq?mi) near Wyler village, called Duivelsberg/Wylerberg which was annexed by the Netherlands.\\r\\nStarting on 16 February 1946 France disentangled the Saar area and established the separate Saar Protectorate, further attaching parts of the Prussian Rhine Province and the Bavarian Palatinate (Saarpfalz). Like the former eastern territories of Germany the Saar area was out of the jurisdiction of the Allied Control Council for Germany and thus no part of Allied-occupied Germany. However, unlike the eastern territories the domestic Saar population was not expelled by the controlling French. With effect of 1 January 1957 the Saar Protectorate declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany, as provided by its Grundgesetz (constitution) art. 23 (Little Reunification), thus becoming the new federal state of Saarland.","input":"What land was lost by germany after ww1?"},{"output":"James Kirkup","context":"James Falconer Kirkup, FRSL (23 April 1918 ÿ 10 May 2009), born James Harold Kirkup,[1] was an English poet, translator and travel writer.  He wrote over 30 books, including autobiographies, novels and plays.  He wrote under many pen-names including James Falconer, Jun Honda, Andrew James, Taeko Kawai, Felix Liston, Edward Raeburn, and Ivy B. Summerforest.[2]  He became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1962.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Kirkup was brought up in South Shields, educated at Westoe Secondary School, and then at King's College, Durham University.[3] In World War II he was a conscientious objector, and worked for the Forestry Commission and on the land in the Yorkshire Dales and at the Lansbury Gate Farm, Clavering, Essex. He taught at The Downs School in Colwall, Malvern, where W.H. Auden had earlier been a master. Kirkup wrote his first book of poetry, The Drowned Sailor at the Downs, which was published in 1947. From 1950 to 1952 he was the first Gregory Poetry Fellow at Leeds University, making him the first resident university poet in the United Kingdom.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1952 he moved south with his partner Derek to Gloucestershire and became visiting poet at Bath Academy of Art for the next three years. Moving on from Bath, he taught in a London grammar school before leaving England in 1956 to live and work in Europe, the Americas and the Far East. In Japan, he found acceptance and appreciation of his work, and he settled there for 30 years, lecturing in English literature at several universities.\\r\\n\\r\\nKirkup came to public attention in 1977, after the newspaper Gay News published his poem The Love That Dares to Speak Its Name, in which a Roman centurion describes his lust for and attraction to the crucified Jesus.

This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface.\\r\\nPhysically, a mouse consists of an object held in one's hand, with one or more buttons. Mice often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and \\"wheels\\", which enable additional control and dimensional input.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest known publication of the term mouse as referring to a computer pointing device is in Bill English's July 1965 publication, \\"Computer-Aided Display Control\\".[1][2][3]\\r\\nThe plural for the small rodent is always \\"mice\\" in modern usage. The plural of a computer mouse is \\"mouses\\" and \\"mice\\" according to most dictionaries, but \\"mice\\" being more common.[4] The first recorded plural usage is \\"mice\\"; the online Oxford Dictionaries cites a 1984 use, and earlier uses include J. C. R. Licklider's \\"The Computer as a Communication Device\\" of 1968.[5]\\r\\nThe trackball, a related pointing device, was invented in 1946 by Ralph Benjamin as part of a post-World War II-era fire-control radar plotting system called Comprehensive Display System (CDS). Benjamin was then working for the British Royal Navy Scientific Service. Benjamin's project used analog computers to calculate the future position of target aircraft based on several initial input points provided by a user with a joystick. Benjamin felt that a more elegant input device was needed and invented what they called a \\"roller ball\\" for this purpose.[6][7]\\r\\nThe device was patented in 1947,[7] but only a prototype using a metal ball rolling on two rubber-coated wheels was ever built, and the device was kept as a military secret.[6]\\r\\nAnother early trackball was built by British electrical engineer Kenyon Taylor in collaboration with Tom Cranston and Fred Longstaff. Taylor was part of the original Ferranti Canada, working on the Royal Canadian Navy's DATAR (Digital Automated Tracking and Resolving) system in 1952.[8]\\r\\nDATAR was similar in concept to Benjamin's display. The trackball used four disks to pick up motion, two each for the X and Y directions. Several rollers provided mechanical support. When the ball was rolled, the pickup discs spun and contacts on their outer rim made periodic contact with wires, producing pulses of output with each movement of the ball. By counting the pulses, the physical movement of the ball could be determined. A digital computer calculated the tracks and sent the resulting data to other ships in a task force using pulse-code modulation radio signals. This trackball used a standard Canadian five-pin bowling ball. It was not patented, since it was a secret military project.[9][10]\\r\\nDouglas Engelbart of the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) has been credited in published books by Thierry Bardini,[11] Paul Ceruzzi,[12] Howard Rheingold,[13] and several others[14][15][16] as the inventor of the mouse. Engelbart was also recognized as such in various obituary titles after his death in July 2013.[17][18][19][20]\\r\\nBy 1963, Engelbart had already established a research lab at SRI, the Augmentation Research Center (ARC), to pursue his objective of developing both hardware and software computer technology to \\"augment\\" human intelligence. That November, while attending a conference on computer graphics in Reno, Nevada, Engelbart began to ponder how to adapt the underlying principles of the planimeter to X-Y coordinate input.[11] On November 14, 1963, he first recorded his thoughts in his personal notebook about something he initially called a \\"bug,\\" which in a \\"3-point\\" form could have a \\"drop point and 2 orthogonal wheels.\\"[11] He wrote that the \\"bug\\" would be \\"easier\\" and \\"more natural\\" to use, and unlike a stylus, it would stay still when let go, which meant it would be \\"much better for coordination with the keyboard.\\"[11]\\r\\nIn 1964, Bill English joined ARC, where he helped Engelbart build the first mouse prototype.[2][21] They christened the device the mouse as early models had a cord attached to the rear part of the device which looked like a tail, and in turn resembled the common mouse.[22] As noted above, this \\"mouse\\" was first mentioned in print in a July 1965 report, on which English was the lead author.[1][2][3] On December 9, 1968, Engelbart publicly demonstrated the mouse at what would come to be known as The Mother of All Demos. Engelbart never received any royalties for it, as his employer SRI held the patent, which expired before the mouse became widely used in personal computers.[23] In any event, the invention of the mouse was just a small part of Engelbart's much larger project of augmenting human intellect.[24][25]\\r\\nSeveral other experimental pointing-devices developed for Engelbart's oN-Line System (NLS) exploited different body movements ÿ?for example, head-mounted devices attached to the chin or nose?ÿ but ultimately the mouse won out because of its speed and convenience.[27] The first mouse, a bulky device (pictured) used two potentiometers perpendicular to each other and connected to wheels: the rotation of each wheel translated into motion along one axis.[28] At the time of the \\"Mother of All Demos\\", Engelbart's group had been using their second generation, 3-button mouse for about a year.\\r\\nOn October 2, 1968, a mouse device named Rollkugel (German for \\"rolling ball\\") was described as an optional device for its SIG-100 terminal was developed by the German company Telefunken.[29] As the name suggests and unlike Engelbart's mouse, the Telefunken model already had a ball. It was based on an earlier trackball-like device (also named Rollkugel) that was embedded into radar flight control desks. This trackball had been developed by a team led by Rainer Mallebrein at Telefunken Konstanz for the German Bundesanstalt fr Flugsicherung as part of their TR?86 process computer system with its SIG?100-86[29][30] vector graphics terminal.\\r\\nWhen the development for the Telefunken main frame TR 440?(de) began in 1965, Mallebrein and his team came up with the idea of \\"reversing\\" the existing Rollkugel into a moveable mouse-like device, so that customers did not have to be bothered with mounting holes for the earlier trackball device. Together with light pens and trackballs, it was offered as an optional input device for their system since 1968. Some Rollkugel mouses installed at the Leibniz-Rechenzentrum in Munich in 1972 are well preserved in a museum.[29][31] Telefunken considered the invention too unimportant to apply for a patent on it.\\r\\nThe Xerox Alto was one of the first computers designed for individual use in 1973 and is regarded as the first modern computer to utilize a mouse.[32] Inspired by PARC's Alto, the Lilith, a computer which had been developed by a team around Niklaus Wirth at ETH Zrich between 1978 and 1980, provided a mouse as well. The third marketed version of an integrated mouse shipped as a part of a computer and intended for personal computer navigation came with the Xerox 8010 Star in 1981.\\r\\nBy 1982 the Xerox 8010 was probably the best-known computer with a mouse. The Sun-1 also came with a mouse, and the forthcoming Apple Lisa was rumored to use one, but the peripheral remained obscure; Jack Hawley of The Mouse House reported that one buyer for a large organization believed at first that his company sold lab mice. Hawley, who manufactured mice for Xerox, stated that \\"Practically, I have the market all to myself right now\\"; a Hawley mouse cost $415.[33] That year Microsoft made the decision to make the MS-DOS program Microsoft Word mouse-compatible, and developed the first PC-compatible mouse. Microsoft's mouse shipped in 1983, thus beginning the Microsoft Hardware division of the company.[34] However, the mouse remained relatively obscure until the appearance of the Macintosh 128K (which included an updated version of the Lisa Mouse) in 1984,[35] and of the Amiga 1000 and the Atari ST in 1985.\\r\\nA mouse typically controls the motion of a pointer in two dimensions in a graphical user interface (GUI). The mouse turns movements of the hand backward and forward, left and right into equivalent electronic signals that in turn are used to move the pointer.\\r\\nThe relative movements of the mouse on the surface are applied to the position of the pointer on the screen, which signals the point where actions of the user take place, so hand movements are replicated by the pointer.[36] Clicking or hovering (stopping movement while the cursor is within the bounds of an area) can select files, programs or actions from a list of names, or (in graphical interfaces) through small images called \\"icons\\" and other elements. For example, a text file might be represented by a picture of a paper notebook and clicking while the cursor hovers this icon might cause a text editing program to open the file in a window.\\r\\nDifferent ways of operating the mouse cause specific things to happen in the GUI:[36]\\r\\nUsers can also employ mice gesturally; meaning that a stylized motion of the mouse cursor itself, called a \\"gesture\\", can issue a command or map to a specific action. For example, in a drawing program, moving the mouse in a rapid \\"x\\" motion over a shape might delete the shape.\\r\\nGestural interfaces occur more rarely than plain pointing-and-clicking; and people often find them more difficult to use, because they require finer motor control from the user. However, a few gestural conventions have become widespread, including the drag and drop gesture, in which:\\r\\nFor example, a user might drag-and-drop a picture representing a file onto a picture of a trash can, thus instructing the system to delete the file.\\r\\nStandard semantic gestures include:\\r\\nOther uses of the mouse's input occur commonly in special application-domains. In interactive three-dimensional graphics, the mouse's motion often translates directly into changes in the virtual objects' or camera's orientation. For example, in the first-person shooter genre of games (see below), players usually employ the mouse to control the direction in which the virtual player's \\"head\\" faces: moving the mouse up will cause the player to look up, revealing the view above the player's head. A related function makes an image of an object rotate, so that all sides can be examined. 3D design and animation software often modally chords many different combinations to allow objects and cameras to be rotated and moved through space with the few axes of movement mice can detect.\\r\\nWhen mice have more than one button, the software may assign different functions to each button. Often, the primary (leftmost in a right-handed configuration) button on the mouse will select items, and the secondary (rightmost in a right-handed) button will bring up a menu of alternative actions applicable to that item. For example, on platforms with more than one button, the Mozilla web browser will follow a link in response to a primary button click, will bring up a contextual menu of alternative actions for that link in response to a secondary-button click, and will often open the link in a new tab or window in response to a click with the tertiary (middle) mouse button.\\r\\nThe German company Telefunken published on their early ball mouse on October 2, 1968.[29] Telefunken's mouse was sold as optional equipment for their computer systems. Bill English, builder of Engelbart's original mouse,[37] created a ball mouse in 1972 while working for Xerox PARC.[38]\\r\\nThe ball mouse replaced the external wheels with a single ball that could rotate in any direction. It came as part of the hardware package of the Xerox Alto computer. Perpendicular chopper wheels housed inside the mouse's body chopped beams of light on the way to light sensors, thus detecting in their turn the motion of the ball. This variant of the mouse resembled an inverted trackball and became the predominant form used with personal computers throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The Xerox PARC group also settled on the modern technique of using both hands to type on a full-size keyboard and grabbing the mouse when required.\\r\\nThe ball mouse has two freely rotating rollers. These are located 90 degrees apart. One roller detects the forwardÿbackward motion of the mouse and other the leftÿright motion. Opposite the two rollers is a third one (white, in the photo, at 45 degrees) that is spring-loaded to push the ball against the other two rollers. Each roller is on the same shaft as an encoder wheel that has slotted edges; the slots interrupt infrared light beams to generate electrical pulses that represent wheel movement. Each wheel's disc has a pair of light beams, located so that a given beam becomes interrupted or again starts to pass light freely when the other beam of the pair is about halfway between changes.\\r\\nSimple logic circuits interpret the relative timing to indicate which direction the wheel is rotating. This incremental rotary encoder scheme is sometimes called quadrature encoding of the wheel rotation, as the two optical sensors produce signals that are in approximately quadrature phase. The mouse sends these signals to the computer system via the mouse cable, directly as logic signals in very old mice such as the Xerox mice, and via a data-formatting IC in modern mice. The driver software in the system converts the signals into motion of the mouse cursor along X and Y axes on the computer screen.\\r\\nThe ball is mostly steel, with a precision spherical rubber surface. The weight of the ball, given an appropriate working surface under the mouse, provides a reliable grip so the mouse's movement is transmitted accurately. Ball mice and wheel mice were manufactured for Xerox by Jack Hawley, doing business as The Mouse House in Berkeley, California, starting in 1975.[39][40] Based on another invention by Jack Hawley, proprietor of the Mouse House, Honeywell produced another type of mechanical mouse.[41][42] Instead of a ball, it had two wheels rotating at off axes. Key Tronic later produced a similar product.[43]\\r\\nModern computer mice took form at the cole Polytechnique Fdrale de Lausanne (EPFL) under the inspiration of Professor Jean-Daniel Nicoud and at the hands of engineer and watchmaker Andr Guignard.[44] This new design incorporated a single hard rubber mouseball and three buttons, and remained a common design until the mainstream adoption of the scroll-wheel mouse during the 1990s.[45] In 1985, Ren Sommer added a microprocessor to Nicoud's and Guignard's design.[46] Through this innovation, Sommer is credited with inventing a significant component of the mouse, which made it more \\"intelligent\\";[46] though optical mice from Mouse Systems had incorporated microprocessors by 1984.[47]\\r\\nAnother type of mechanical mouse, the \\"analog mouse\\" (now generally regarded as obsolete), uses potentiometers rather than encoder wheels, and is typically designed to be plug compatible with an analog joystick. The \\"Color Mouse\\", originally marketed by RadioShack for their Color Computer (but also usable on MS-DOS machines equipped with analog joystick ports, provided the software accepted joystick input) was the best-known example.\\r\\nOptical mice rely entirely on one or more light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and an imaging array of photodiodes to detect movement relative to the underlying surface, eschewing the internal moving parts a mechanical mouse uses in addition to its optics. A laser mouse is an optical mouse that uses coherent (laser) light.\\r\\nThe earliest optical mice detected movement on pre-printed mousepad surfaces, whereas the modern LED optical mouse works on most opaque diffuse surfaces; it is usually unable to detect movement on specular surfaces like polished stone. Laser diodes are also used for better resolution and precision, improving performance on opaque specular surfaces. Battery powered, wireless optical mice flash the LED intermittently to save power, and only glow steadily when movement is detected.\\r\\nOften called \\"air mice\\" since they do not require a surface to operate, inertial mice use a tuning fork or other accelerometer (US Patent 4787051, published in 1988) to detect rotary movement for every axis supported. The most common models (manufactured by Logitech and Gyration) work using 2 degrees of rotational freedom and are insensitive to spatial translation. The user requires only small wrist rotations to move the cursor, reducing user fatigue or \\"gorilla arm\\".\\r\\nUsually cordless, they often have a switch to deactivate the movement circuitry between use, allowing the user freedom of movement without affecting the cursor position. A patent for an inertial mouse claims that such mice consume less power than optically based mice, and offer increased sensitivity, reduced weight and increased ease-of-use.[48] In combination with a wireless keyboard an inertial mouse can offer alternative ergonomic arrangements which do not require a flat work surface, potentially alleviating some types of repetitive motion injuries related to workstation posture.\\r\\nAlso known as bats,[49] flying mice, or wands,[50] these devices generally function through ultrasound and provide at least three degrees of freedom. Probably the best known example would be 3Dconnexion/Logitech's SpaceMouse from the early 1990s. In the late 1990s Kantek introduced the 3D RingMouse. This wireless mouse was worn on a ring around a finger, which enabled the thumb to access three buttons. The mouse was tracked in three dimensions by a base station.[51] Despite a certain appeal, it was finally discontinued because it did not provide sufficient resolution.\\r\\nOne example of a 2000s consumer 3D pointing device is the Wii Remote. While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and direction of movement), Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the lights from the IR emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the nunchuk accessory lacks a camera, it can only tell its current heading and orientation). The obvious drawback to this approach is that it can only produce spatial coordinates while its camera can see the sensor bar. More accurate consumer devices have since been released, including the PlayStation Move, the Razer Hydra and the controllers part of the HTC Vive virtual reality system. All of these devices can accurately detect position and orientation in 3D space regardless of angle relative to the sensor station.[citation needed]\\r\\nA mouse-related controller called the SpaceBall[52] has a ball placed above the work surface that can easily be gripped. With spring-loaded centering, it sends both translational as well as angular displacements on all six axes, in both directions for each. In November 2010 a German Company called Axsotic introduced a new concept of 3D mouse called 3D Spheric Mouse. This new concept of a true six degree-of-freedom input device uses a ball to rotate in 3 axes without any limitations.[53]\\r\\nIn 2000, Logitech introduced a \\"tactile mouse\\" that contained a small actuator to make the mouse vibrate. Such a mouse can augment user-interfaces with haptic feedback, such as giving feedback when crossing a window boundary. To surf by touch requires the user to be able to feel depth or hardness; this ability was realized with the first electrorheological tactile mice[54] but never marketed.\\r\\nTablet digitizers are sometimes used with accessories called pucks, devices which rely on absolute positioning, but can be configured for sufficiently mouse-like relative tracking that they are sometimes marketed as mice.[55]\\r\\nAs the name suggests, this type of mouse is intended to provide optimum comfort and avoid injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis and other repetitive strain injuries. It is designed to fit natural hand position and movements, to reduce discomfort.\\r\\nWhen holding a typical mouse, ulna and radius bones on the arm are crossed. Some designs attempt to place the palm more vertically, so the bones take more natural parallel position.[56] Some limit wrist movement, encouraging to use arm instead that may be less precise but more optimal from the health point of view. A mouse may be angled from the thumb downward to the opposite side ÿ this is known to reduce wrist pronation.[57] However such optimizations make the mouse right or left hand specific, making more problematic to change the tired hand. Time magazine has criticized manufacturers for offering few or no left-handed ergonomic mice: \\"Oftentimes I felt like I was dealing with someone whod never actually met a left-handed person before.\\"[58]\\r\\nAnother solution is a pointing bar device. The so-called roller bar mouse is positioned snugly in front of the keyboard, thus allowing bi-manual accessibility.[59]\\r\\nThese mice are specifically designed for use in computer games. They typically employ a wide array of controls and buttons and have designs that differ radically from traditional mice. It is also common for gaming mice, especially those designed for use in real-time strategy games such as StarCraft, or in multiplayer online battle arena games such as Dota 2 to have a relatively high sensitivity, measured in dots per inch (DPI).[60] Some advanced mice from gaming manufacturers also allow users to customize the weight of the mouse by adding or subtracting weights to allow for easier control.[61] Ergonomic quality is also an important factor in gaming mice, as extended gameplay times may render further use of the mouse to be uncomfortable. Some mice have been designed to have adjustable features such as removable and/or elongated palm rests, horizontally adjustable thumb rests and pinky rests. Some mice may include several different rests with their products to ensure comfort for a wider range of target consumers.[62] Gaming mice are held by gamers in three styles of grip:[63][64]\\r\\nTo transmit their input, typical cabled mice use a thin electrical cord terminating in a standard connector, such as RS-232C, PS/2, ADB or USB. Cordless mice instead transmit data via infrared radiation (see IrDA) or radio (including Bluetooth), although many such cordless interfaces are themselves connected through the aforementioned wired serial buses.\\r\\nWhile the electrical interface and the format of the data transmitted by commonly available mice is currently standardized on USB, in the past it varied between different manufacturers. A bus mouse used a dedicated interface card for connection to an IBM PC or compatible computer.\\r\\nMouse use in DOS applications became more common after the introduction of the Microsoft Mouse, largely because Microsoft provided an open standard for communication between applications and mouse driver software. Thus, any application written to use the Microsoft standard could use a mouse with a driver that implements the same API, even if the mouse hardware itself was incompatible with Microsoft's. This driver provides the state of the buttons and the distance the mouse has moved in units that its documentation calls \\"mickeys\\",[68] as does the Allegro library.[69]\\r\\nThe earliest mass-market mice, such as on the original Macintosh, Amiga, and Atari ST used a D-subminiature 9-pin connector to send the quadrature encoded X and Y axis signals directly, plus one pin per mouse button. The mouse was a simple optomechanical device, and the deciding circuitry was all in the main computer.\\r\\nThe DE-9 connectors were designed to be electrically compatible with the joysticks popular on numerous 8-bit systems, such as the Commodore 64 and the Atari 2600. Although the ports could be used for both purposes, the signals must be interpreted differently. As a result, plugging a mouse into a joystick port causes the \\"joystick\\" to continuously move in some direction, even if the mouse stays still, whereas plugging a joystick into a mouse port causes the \\"mouse\\" to only be able to move a single pixel in each direction.\\r\\nBecause the IBM PC did not have a quadrature decoder built in, early PC mice used the RS-232C serial port to communicate encoded mouse movements, as well as provide power to the mouse's circuits. The Mouse Systems Corporation version used a five-byte protocol and supported three buttons. The Microsoft version used a three-byte protocol and supported two buttons. Due to the incompatibility between the two protocols, some manufacturers sold serial mice with a mode switch: \\"PC\\" for MSC mode, \\"MS\\" for Microsoft mode.[70]\\r\\nIn 1986 Apple first implemented the Apple Desktop Bus allowing the daisy-chaining together of up to 16 devices, including arbitrarily many mice and other devices on the same bus with no configuration whatsoever. Featuring only a single data pin, the bus used a purely polled approach to computer/mouse communications and survived as the standard on mainstream models (including a number of non-Apple workstations) until 1998 when iMac joined the industry-wide switch to using USB. Beginning with the Bronze Keyboard PowerBook G3 in May 1999, Apple dropped the external ADB port in favor of USB, but retained an internal ADB connection in the PowerBook G4 for communication with its built-in keyboard and trackpad until early 2005.\\r\\nWith the arrival of the IBM PS/2 personal-computer series in 1987, IBM introduced the eponymous PS/2 interface for mice and keyboards, which other manufacturers rapidly adopted. The most visible change was the use of a round 6-pin mini-DIN, in lieu of the former 5-pin connector. In default mode (called stream mode) a PS/2 mouse communicates motion, and the state of each button, by means of 3-byte packets.[71] For any motion, button press or button release event, a PS/2 mouse sends, over a bi-directional serial port, a sequence of three bytes, with the following format:\\r\\nHere, XS and YS represent the sign bits of the movement vectors, XV and YV indicate an overflow in the respective vector component, and LB, MB and RB indicate the status of the left, middle and right mouse buttons (1 = pressed). PS/2 mice also understand several commands for reset and self-test, switching between different operating modes, and changing the resolution of the reported motion vectors.\\r\\nA Microsoft IntelliMouse relies on an extension of the PS/2 protocol: the ImPS/2 or IMPS/2 protocol (the abbreviation combines the concepts of \\"IntelliMouse\\" and \\"PS/2\\"). It initially operates in standard PS/2 format, for backwards compatibility. After the host sends a special command sequence, it switches to an extended format in which a fourth byte carries information about wheel movements. The IntelliMouse Explorer works analogously, with the difference that its 4-byte packets also allow for two additional buttons (for a total of five).[72]\\r\\nMouse vendors also use other extended formats, often without providing public documentation. The Typhoon mouse uses 6-byte packets which can appear as a sequence of two standard 3-byte packets, such that an ordinary PS/2 driver can handle them.[73] For 3-D (or 6-degree-of-freedom) input, vendors have made many extensions both to the hardware and to software. In the late 1990s, Logitech created ultrasound based tracking which gave 3D input to a few millimeters accuracy, which worked well as an input device but failed as a profitable product. In 2008, Motion4U introduced its \\"OptiBurst\\" system using IR tracking for use as a Maya (graphics software) plugin.\\r\\nThe industry-standard USB (Universal Serial Bus) protocol and its connector have become widely used for mice; it is among the most popular types.[74]\\r\\nCordless or wireless mice transmit data via infrared radiation (see IrDA) or radio (including Bluetooth and Wi-Fi). The receiver is connected to the computer through a serial or USB port, or can be built in (as is sometimes the case with Bluetooth and WiFi[75]). Modern non-Bluetooth and non-WiFi wireless mice use USB receivers. Some of these can be stored inside the mouse for safe transport while not in use, while other, newer mice use newer \\"nano\\" receivers, designed to be small enough to remain plugged into a laptop during transport, while still being large enough to easily remove.[76]\\r\\nSome systems allow two or more mice to be used at once as input devices. 16-bit era home computers such as the Amiga used this to allow computer games with two players interacting on the same computer (Lemmings and The Settlers for example). The same idea is sometimes used in collaborative software, e.g. to simulate a whiteboard that multiple users can draw on without passing a single mouse around.\\r\\nMicrosoft Windows, since Windows 98, has supported multiple simultaneous pointing devices. Because Windows only provides a single screen cursor, using more than one device at the same time requires cooperation of users or applications designed for multiple input devices.\\r\\nMultiple mice are often used in multi-user gaming in addition to specially designed devices that provide several input interfaces.\\r\\nWindows also has full support for multiple input/mouse configurations for multi-user environments.\\r\\nStarting with Windows XP, Microsoft introduced a SDK for developing applications that allow multiple input devices to be used at the same time with independent cursors and independent input points.[77]\\r\\nThe introduction of Vista and Microsoft Surface (now known as Microsoft PixelSense) introduced a new set of input APIs that were adopted into Windows 7, allowing for 50 points/cursors, all controlled by independent users. The new input points provide traditional mouse input; however, they were designed with other input technologies like touch and image in mind. They inherently offer 3D coordinates along with pressure, size, tilt, angle, mask, and even an image bitmap to see and recognize the input point/object on the screen.\\r\\nAs of 2009, Linux distributions and other operating systems that use X.Org, such as OpenSolaris and FreeBSD, support 255 cursors/input points through Multi-Pointer X. However, currently no window managers support Multi-Pointer X leaving it relegated to custom software usage.\\r\\nThere have also been propositions of having a single operator use two mice simultaneously as a more sophisticated means of controlling various graphics and multimedia applications.[78]\\r\\nMouse buttons are microswitches which can be pressed to select or interact with an element of a graphical user interface, producing a distinctive clicking sound.\\r\\nSince around the late 1990s, the three-button scrollmouse has become the de facto standard. Users most commonly employ the second button to invoke a contextual menu in the computer's software user interface, which contains options specifically tailored to the interface element over which the mouse cursor currently sits. By default, the primary mouse button sits located on the left-hand side of the mouse, for the benefit of right-handed users; left-handed users can usually reverse this configuration via software.\\r\\nNearly all mice now have an integrated input primarily intended for scrolling on top, usually a single-axis digital wheel or rocker switch which can also be depressed to act as a third button. Though less common, many mice instead have two-axis inputs such as a tiltable wheel, trackball, or touchpad.\\r\\nMickeys per second is a unit of measurement for the speed and movement direction of a computer mouse,[68] where direction is often expressed as \\"horizontal\\" versus \\"vertical\\" mickey count. However, speed can also refer to the ratio between how many pixels the cursor moves on the screen and how far the mouse moves on the mouse pad, which may be expressed as pixels per mickey, pixels per inch, or pixels per centimeter.\\r\\nThe computer industry often measures mouse sensitivity in terms of counts per inch (CPI), commonly expressed as dots per inch (DPI)?ÿ the number of steps the mouse will report when it moves one inch. In early mice, this specification was called pulses per inch (ppi).[39] The Mickey originally referred to one of these counts, or one resolvable step of motion. If the default mouse-tracking condition involves moving the cursor by one screen-pixel or dot on-screen per reported step, then the CPI does equate to DPI: dots of cursor motion per inch of mouse motion. The CPI or DPI as reported by manufacturers depends on how they make the mouse; the higher the CPI, the faster the cursor moves with mouse movement. However, software can adjust the mouse sensitivity, making the cursor move faster or slower than its CPI. Current[update] software can change the speed of the cursor dynamically, taking into account the mouse's absolute speed and the movement from the last stop-point. In most software, an example being the Windows platforms, this setting is named \\"speed,\\" referring to \\"cursor precision\\". However, some operating systems name this setting \\"acceleration\\", the typical Apple OS designation. This term is incorrect. Mouse acceleration in most mouse software refers to the change in speed of the cursor over time while the mouse movement is constant.\\r\\nFor simple software, when the mouse starts to move, the software will count the number of \\"counts\\" or \\"mickeys\\" received from the mouse and will move the cursor across the screen by that number of pixels (or multiplied by a rate factor, typically less than 1). The cursor will move slowly on the screen, with good precision. When the movement of the mouse passes the value set for some threshold, the software will start to move the cursor faster, with a greater rate factor. Usually, the user can set the value of the second rate factor by changing the \\"acceleration\\" setting.\\r\\nOperating systems sometimes apply acceleration, referred to as \\"ballistics\\", to the motion reported by the mouse. For example, versions of Windows prior to Windows XP doubled reported values above a configurable threshold, and then optionally doubled them again above a second configurable threshold. These doublings applied separately in the X and Y directions, resulting in very nonlinear response.[79]\\r\\nEngelbart's original mouse did not require a mousepad;[80] the mouse had two large wheels which could roll on virtually any surface. However, most subsequent mechanical mice starting with the steel roller ball mouse have required a mousepad for optimal performance.\\r\\nThe mousepad, the most common mouse accessory, appears most commonly in conjunction with mechanical mice, because to roll smoothly the ball requires more friction than common desk surfaces usually provide. So-called \\"hard mousepads\\" for gamers or optical/laser mice also exist.\\r\\nMost optical and laser mice do not require a pad. Whether to use a hard or soft mousepad with an optical mouse is largely a matter of personal preference. One exception occurs when the desk surface creates problems for the optical or laser tracking, for example, a transparent or reflective surface.\\r\\nAround 1981 Xerox included mice with its Xerox Star, based on the mouse used in the 1970s on the Alto computer at Xerox PARC. Sun Microsystems, Symbolics, Lisp Machines Inc., and Tektronix also shipped workstations with mice, starting in about 1981. Later, inspired by the Star, Apple Computer released the Apple Lisa, which also used a mouse. However, none of these products achieved large-scale success. Only with the release of the Apple Macintosh in 1984 did the mouse see widespread use.[81]\\r\\nThe Macintosh design,[82] commercially successful and technically influential, led many other vendors to begin producing mice or including them with their other computer products (by 1986, Atari ST, Amiga, Windows 1.0, GEOS for the Commodore 64, and the Apple IIGS).[83]\\r\\nThe widespread adoption of graphical user interfaces in the software of the 1980s and 1990s made mice all but indispensable for controlling computers. In November 2008, Logitech built their billionth mouse.[84]\\r\\nThe Classic Mac OS Desk Accessory Puzzle in 1984 was the first game designed specifically for a mouse.[85] The device often functions as an interface for PC-based computer games and sometimes for video game consoles.\\r\\nFPSs naturally lend themselves to separate and simultaneous control of the player's movement and aim, and on computers this has traditionally been achieved with a combination of keyboard and mouse. Players use the X-axis of the mouse for looking (or turning) left and right, and the Y-axis for looking up and down; the keyboard is used for movement and supplemental inputs.\\r\\nMany shooting genre players prefer a mouse over a gamepad analog stick because the mouse is a linear input device, which allows for fast and precise control. Holding a stick in a given position produces a corresponding constant movement or rotation, i.e. the output is an integral of the user's input, and requires that time be spent moving to or from its null position before this input can be given; in contrast, the output of a mouse directly and instantaneously corresponds to how far it is moved in a given direction (often multiplied by an \\"acceleration\\" factor derived from how quickly the mouse is moved). The effect of this is that a mouse is well suited to small, precise movements; large, quick movements; and immediate, responsive movements; all of which are important in shooter gaming.[86] This advantage also extends in varying degrees to similar game styles such as third-person shooters.\\r\\nSome incorrectly ported games or game engines have acceleration and interpolation curves which unintentionally produce excessive, irregular, or even negative acceleration when used with a mouse instead of their native platform's non-mouse default input device. Depending on how deeply hardcoded this misbehavior is, internal user patches or external 3rd-party software may be able to fix it.[87]\\r\\nDue to their similarity to the WIMP desktop metaphor interface for which mice were originally designed, and to their own tabletop game origins, computer strategy games are most commonly played with mice. In particular, real-time strategy and MOBA games usually require the use of a mouse.\\r\\nThe left button usually controls primary fire. If the game supports multiple fire modes, the right button often provides secondary fire from the selected weapon. Games with only a single fire mode will generally map secondary fire to ironsights. In some games, the right button may also invoke accessories for a particular weapon, such as allowing access to the scope of a sniper rifle or allowing the mounting of a bayonet or silencer.\\r\\nGamers can use a scroll wheel for changing weapons (or for controlling scope-zoom magnification, in older games). On most first person shooter games, programming may also assign more functions to additional buttons on mice with more than three controls. A keyboard usually controls movement (for example, WASD for moving forward, left, backward and right, respectively) and other functions such as changing posture. Since the mouse serves for aiming, a mouse that tracks movement accurately and with less lag (latency) will give a player an advantage over players with less accurate or slower mice. In some cases the right mouse button may be used to move the player forward, either in lieu of, or in conjunction with the typical WASD configuration.\\r\\nMany games provide players with the option of mapping their own choice of a key or button to a certain control. An early technique of players, circle strafing, saw a player continuously strafing while aiming and shooting at an opponent by walking in circle around the opponent with the opponent at the center of the circle. Players could achieve this by holding down a key for strafing while continuously aiming the mouse towards the opponent.\\r\\nGames using mice for input are so popular that many manufacturers make mice specifically for gaming. Such mice may feature adjustable weights, high-resolution optical or laser components, additional buttons, ergonomic shape, and other features such as adjustable CPI. Mouse Bungees are typically used with gaming mice because it eliminates the annoyance of the cable.\\r\\nMany games, such as first- or third-person shooters, have a setting named \\"invert mouse\\" or similar (not to be confused with \\"button inversion\\", sometimes performed by left-handed users) which allows the user to look downward by moving the mouse forward and upward by moving the mouse backward (the opposite of non-inverted movement). This control system resembles that of aircraft control sticks, where pulling back causes pitch up and pushing forward causes pitch down; computer joysticks also typically emulate this control-configuration.\\r\\nAfter id Software's commercial hit of Doom, which did not support vertical aiming, competitor Bungie's Marathon became the first first-person shooter to support using the mouse to aim up and down.[88] Games using the Build engine had an option to invert the Y-axis. The \\"invert\\" feature actually made the mouse behave in a manner that users now[update] regard as non-inverted (by default, moving mouse forward resulted in looking down). Soon after, id Software released Quake, which introduced the invert feature as users now[update] know it.\\r\\nIn 1988, the VTech Socrates educational video game console featured a wireless mouse with an attached mouse pad as an optional controller used for some games. In the early 1990s, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game system featured a mouse in addition to its controllers. The Mario Paint game in particular used the mouse's capabilities[89] as did its successor on the N64. Sega released official mice for their Genesis/Mega Drive, Saturn and Dreamcast consoles. NEC sold official mice for its PC Engine and PC-FX consoles. Sony released an official mouse product for the PlayStation console, included one along with the Linux for PlayStation 2 kit, as well as allowing owners to use virtually any USB mouse with the PS2, PS3, and PS4. Nintendo's Wii also had this added on in a later software update, retained on the Wii U.","input":"Who developed the first model of the mouse?"},{"output":"The Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League","context":"The Pan-African flag  also known as the UNIA flag, Afro-American flag and Black Liberation Flag  is a tri-color flag consisting of three equal horizontal bands of (from top down) red, black and green. The Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL) formally adopted it on August 13, 1920 in Article 39 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World,[1] during its month-long convention at Madison Square Garden in New York City.[2][3] Variations of the flag can and have been used in various countries and territories in Africa and the Americas to represent Pan-Africanist ideologies. Several Pan-African organizations and movements have often employed the emblematic tri-color scheme in various contexts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag was created in 1920 by members of UNIA in response to the enormously popular 1900 coon song \\"Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon\\".[4] which has been cited as one of the three songs that \\"firmly established the term coon in the American vocabulary\\". In a 1927 report of a 1921 speech appearing in the Negro World weekly newspaper, Marcus Garvey was quoted as saying:[5]\\r\\nShow me the race or the nation without a flag, and I will show you a race of people without any pride. Aye! In song and mimicry they have said, \\"Every race has a flag but the coon.\\" How true! Aye! But that was said of us four years ago. They can't say it now....\\r\\nThe Universal Negro Catechism, published by the UNIA in 1921, refers to the colors of the flag meaning:[6]\\r\\nRed is the color of the blood which men must shed for their redemption and liberty; black is the color of the noble and distinguished race to which we belong; green is the color of the luxuriant vegetation of our Motherland.\\r\\nJournalist Charles Mowbray White has asserted that Garvey proposed the colors red, black and green for the following reasons: \\"Garvey said red because of sympathy for the 'Reds of the world', and the Green their sympathy for the Irish in their fight for freedom, and the Black- [for] the Negro.\\"[7]\\r\\nAccording to the UNIA as of recent; the three Pan-African colors on the flag represent: red: the blood that unites all people of Black African ancestry, and shed for liberation; black: black people whose existence as a nation, though not a nation-state, is affirmed by the existence of the flag; and green: the abundant natural wealth of Africa.[8]\\r\\nThe flag later became an African nationalist symbol for the worldwide liberation of people of African origin. As an emblem of Black pride, the flag became popular during the Black Liberation movement of the 1960s. In 1971, the school board of Newark, New Jersey, passed a resolution permitting the flag to be raised in public school classrooms. Four of the board's nine members were not present at the time, and the resolution was introduced by the board's teen member, a mayoral appointee. Fierce controversy ensued, including a court order that the board show cause why they should not be forced to rescind the resolution, and at least two state legislative proposals to ban ethnic or national flags in public classrooms other than the U.S. flag.\\r\\nIn the United States, the flag is presently widely available through flag shops or ethnic specialty stores.

The family members are holding food, gifts, and a flag. The flag in the stamp may have been meant to represent the Pan-African flag, However, instead of the stripes descending red, black, and green, the stamp's flag transposes the top two bands and descends black, red, and green.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2000, artist David Hammons created a work called African-American Flag, which is held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Based on the standard U.S. flag, its stripes are black and red, the field is green, and the stars on the field are black.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn response to the controversy over the flying of the Confederate flag, an African American-run company called NuSouth[13] created a flag based on the Confederate naval jack, with the white stars and saltire outline replaced by green and the blue saltire made black.[14]\\r\\nAlthough Libya is located in Africa and its flag (introduced in 1951 and re-adopted in 2011) resembles a UNIA flag with a wider black band with a star and crescent in the center, it is actually based on the flag of the Cyrenaica Emirate with added red and green bands.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Flag of Kenya of 1963 is very similar to the red, black and green flag.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Flag of Saint Kitts and Nevis has similar colors.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1999, an article appeared in the July 25 edition of The Black World Today suggesting that, as an act of global solidarity, every August 17 should be celebrated worldwide as Universal African Flag Day by flying the red, black, and green banner.

The federal civil service was established in 1871 (5 U.S.C.??2101).[1] U.S. state and local government entities often have comparable civil service systems that are modeled on the national system, in varying degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Office of Personnel Management, as of  December 2011[update], there were approximately 2.79 million civil servants employed by the U.S. government.[2][3][4] This includes employees in the departments and agencies run by any of the three branches of government (the executive branch, legislative branch, and judicial branch), such as over 600,000 employees in the U.S. Postal Service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of civil service positions are classified as competitive service, meaning employees are selected based on merit after a competitive hiring process for positions that are open to all applicants. The Senior Executive Service (SES) is the classification for non-competitive, senior leadership positions filled by career employees or political appointments (e.g., Cabinet members, ambassadors, etc.). Excepted service positions (also known as unclassified service) are non-competitive jobs in certain federal agencies with security and intelligence functions (e.g., the CIA, FBI, State Department, etc.) that are authorized to create their own hiring policies and are not subject to most appointment, pay, and classification laws.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 19th century, positions in the federal government were held at the pleasure of the presidenta person could be fired at any time. The spoils system meant that jobs were used to support the American political parties, though this was gradually changed by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 and subsequent laws. By 1909, almost two-thirds of the U.S. federal workforce was appointed based on merit, that is, qualifications measured by tests. Certain senior civil service positions, including some heads of diplomatic missions and executive agencies, are filled by political appointees. Under the Hatch Act of 1939, civil servants are not allowed to engage in political activities while performing their duties.[6] In some cases, an outgoing administration will give its political appointees positions with civil service protection in order to prevent them from being fired by the new administration; this is called \\"burrowing\\" in civil service jargon.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nEmployees in the civil services work under one of the independent agencies or one of the 15 executive departments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to departments, there are a number of staff organizations grouped into the Executive Office of the President. These include the White House staff, the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also independent agencies such as the United States Postal Service, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In addition, there are government-owned corporations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were 456 federal agencies in 2009.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pay system of the United States government civil service has evolved into a complex set of pay systems that include principally the General Schedule (GS) for white-collar employees, Federal Wage System (FWS) for blue-collar employees, Senior Executive System (SES) for Executive-level employees, Foreign Service Schedule (FS) for members of the Foreign Service and more than twelve alternate pay systems that are referred to as alternate or experimental pay systems such as the first experimental system China Lake Demonstration Project. The current system began as the Classification Act of 1923[10] and was refined into law with the Classification Act of 1949. These acts that provide the foundation of the current system have been amended through executive orders and through published amendments in the Federal Register that sets for approved changes in the regulatory structure of the federal pay system. The common goal among all pay systems is to achieve the goal of paying equitable salaries to all involved workers regardless of system, group or classification. This is referred to as pay equity or (\\"equal pay for equal work\\"). Select careers in high demand may be subject to a special rate table,[11] which can pay above the standard GS tables. These careers include certain engineering disciplines and patent examiners.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe General Schedule (GS) includes white collar workers at levels 1 through 15, most professional, technical, administrative, and clerical positions in the federal civil service. The Federal Wage System or Wage Grade (WG) schedule includes most federal blue-collar workers. As of  September?2004[update], 71% of federal civilian employees were paid under the GS; the remaining 29% were paid under other systems such as the Federal Wage System for federal blue-collar civilian employees, the Senior Executive Service/Senior Level and the Executive Schedule for high-ranking federal employees, and the pay schedules for the United States Postal Service and the Foreign Service. In addition, some federal agenciessuch as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporationhave their own unique pay schedules.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll federal employees in the GS system receive a base pay that is adjusted for locality. Locality pay varies, but is at least 10% of base salary in all parts of the United States. The following salary ranges represent the lowest and highest possible amounts a person can earn in base salary, without earning over-time pay or receiving a merit-based bonus. Actual salary ranges differ adjusted for increased locality pay (for instance a GS-9, step 1 in rural Arkansas may start at $50,598[14] versus $61,084[15] in San Jose, California), but all base salaries lie within the parameters of the following ranges (effective January, 2018):[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nNineteen percent of federal employees earned salaries of $100,000 or more in 2009. The average federal worker's pay was $71,208 compared with $40,331 in the private sector, although under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, most menial or lower paying jobs have been outsourced to private contractors.[18] In 2010, there were 82,034 workers, 3.9% of the federal workforce, making more than $150,000 annually, compared to 7,240 in 2005.[19] GS salaries are capped by law so that they do not exceed the salary for Executive Schedule IV positions.[20] The increase in civil servants making more than $150,000 resulted mainly from an increase in Executive Schedule salary approved during the Administration of George W. Bush, which raised the salary cap for senior GS employees slightly above the $150,000 threshold.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nBasic pay rates for Senior Executive Service (i.e. non-Presidentially appointed civil servants above GS-15) will range from $119,554 to $179,700 in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  January?2009[update], the Federal Government, excluding the Postal Service and soldiers, employed about 2 million civilian workers.\\r\\n The Federal Government is the nation's single largest employer.  Although most federal agencies are based in the Washington, D.C. region, only about 16% (or about 288,000) of the federal government workforce is employed in this region.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic support in the United States for civil service reform strengthened following the assassination of President James Garfield.[24] The United States Civil Service Commission was created by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, which was passed into law on January 16, 1883. The commission was created to administer the civil service of the United States federal government. The law required federal government employees to be selected through competitive exams and basis of merit;[24] it also prevented elected officials and political appointees from firing civil servants, removing civil servants from the influences of political patronage and partisan behavior.[24][25]  However, the law did not apply to state and municipal governments.\\r\\n\\r\\nEffective January 1, 1978, the commission was renamed the Office of Personnel Management under the provisions of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978 (43 F.R. 36037, 92 Stat. 3783) and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Civil service exams have since been abolished for many positions, since statistics show that they do not accurately allow hiring of minorities according to the affirmative action guidelines.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis act abolished the United States Civil Service Commission and created the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) and the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). OPM primarily provides management guidance to the various agencies of the executive branch and issues regulations that control federal human resources. FLRA oversees the rights of federal employees to form collective bargaining units (unions) and to engage in collective bargaining with agencies. MSPB conducts studies of the federal civil service and mainly hears the appeals of federal employees who are disciplined or otherwise separated from their positions. This act was an effort to replace incompetent officials.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Donald Trump signed three executive orders designed to enforce merit-system principles in the civil service and intended to improve efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the federal government. Supporters of the executive orders hope that these initiatives will make civil service more accountable and that both taxpayers and federal workers will benefit.[29]","input":"How many federal workers are there in the us?"},{"output":"6 August 1952","context":"The National Development Council (NDC) or Rashtriya Vikas Parishad is the apex body for decision creating and deliberations on development matters in India, presided over by the Prime Minister. It was set up on 6 August 1952 to strengthen and mobilize the effort and resources of the nation in support of the Plan, to promote common economic policies in all vital spheres, and to ensure the balanced and rapid development of all parts of the country.

The meeting was presided over by Dr Manmohan Singh Prime Minister of India. Dr Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the Dy Chairman of Planning Commission, raised six major issues for consideration at the NDC:\\r\\n1. Determining the state level five year plans for the Twelfth Plan period early and set targets for growth and other social indicators. They need to be built into consistent national targets for the Twelfth Plan. Create an economic environment that would support the efforts of farmers and entrepreneurs. It will determine much of the outcome in terms of the flow of investment to the State, and the growth of both output and employment.\\r\\n2. Mobilization and allocation of resources for the Plan. Since inclusive growth depends on the development of rural and urban infrastructure, provision of health services and extension of education and skill development, adequate provisioning shall be done for these sectors. Centres Gross Budgetary Support for the Plan as a ratio of GDP shall be increased while reducing the fiscal deficit. That requires raising of the ratio of tax revenues to GDP, and cut untargeted subsidies. States have to aim at much better revenue performance and also exercise progressive control over subsidies. Early implementation of the GST would not only raise more revenue for both the Centre and the States, it would also create a single market in the country and remove many of the distortions in the indirect tax system. Both the Centre and the States must explore the scope for public private partnership, wherever possible to leverage limited public resources.\\r\\n3. Agriculture needs more attention and priority at State Government levels (e.g. exempting horticultural products entirely from the application of the APMC Act.)\\r\\n4. Management of energy resources will be a major challenge because rapid growth will require a significant expansion in domestic energy supplies and also a much greater focus on energy efficiency. The viability of the power sector as a whole depends critically upon the financial viability of the distribution system. The total losses of the distribution system, if properly accounted, are probably as high as Rs 70,000 crores. If the States could cover these losses by subsidies, the system would not be at risk. However, state budgets cannot provide subsidies on this scale and the losses are effectively being funded by the banking system. AT&C losses shall be reduced to 15% by the end of the Twelfth Plan. The electricity tariffs have to be adjusted in line with costs. There is an urgent need to implement a package of distribution reforms combined with tariff increases, which will make the distribution companies viable for all additional sales. The Twelfth Plan version of the Accelerated Power Development Reform Programme should be tailored to provide resources to States taking credible steps along these lines. New energy efficient building standards should be made mandatory.\\r\\n5. Management of water resources - demand for water in the country is outstripping supply, leading to serious water shortages and unsustainable drawal of ground water in many parts of the country. Whereas we increase the amount of water that is effectively available, the real solution lies in increasing the efficiency of water use. At present, almost 80% of our water is used in agriculture, and it is used very inefficiently. Water use in agriculture can be cut to half with known technology, e.g., by switching from flood irrigation of paddy to SRI. Water availability can be improved by treating sewage water before it enters our fresh water system. At present, only about 30% of sewage water is treated. There are similar problems with industrial effluents. With urbanisation and industrialisation set to accelerate, these pressures on our fresh water systems will increase. Corrective action in all these areas lies largely in the domain of state governments. The Approach paper called for a comprehensive re-examination of water policy including changes in the laws. It also calls for empowered water regulatory authorities which can ensure effective allocation of water to different uses and also different areas. Some States have introduced innovative schemes for rational use of water by involving farmers actively. Future assistance under AIBP should be linked to moves which ensure more rational use of water.\\r\\n6. Improve implementation of Plan schemes on the ground. Over the past several years, we have greatly expanded the volume of resources devoted to various flagship programmes in health, education, clean drinking water, sanitation, area development programme, etc. The while these schemes focus on the right areas, their implementation leaves a great deal to be desired. Report of the Chaturvedi Committee made a number of recommendations on the need for streamlining the centrally sponsored schemes. Ways of improving governance, promoting innovation, extending e-governance to the panchayat level, introducing transparency in government programmes and use of the UID number combined with the benefits of IT become areas of priority. The Aadhar platform can be used to improve efficiency in many of these programmes. The Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System will be used to serve as a management information and decision support system which will enable tracking of the Central government disbursements under a Centrally Sponsored Scheme. There is a need to track funds from the State Governments down through different levels in the state Government to the final expenditure incurred at the implementing level.\\r\\nOther Constitutional bodies","input":"When was national development council established in india?"},{"output":"123 points","context":"The California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST) is a standardized test administered throughout the state of California and Oregon for individuals who want to teach at public schools and gain a credential. The test is designed to provide information about basic proficiency in reading, mathematics, and writing. The test is divided into three sections; the reading and math sections each contain 50 multiple-choice questions, while the writing section consists of two essay questions. The test must be completed in four hours, but test-takers may use that time to work on any or all of the three sections. Also, there is no limit to the number of times someone may take the test in order to pass, and test-takers do not have to pass all three sections at one sitting, but a $41 registration fee for paper-based testing ($102 for computer-based testing) must be paid each time the test is taken.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST) is a standardized test required by the states of California and Oregon for individuals seeking their first teaching or services credential. It was developed by the Commission of Teacher Credentialing (CTC)[1] to meet the California Education Code (Section 44254),[2] which was amended by the legislature of California on February 1, 1983.[1] This amendment requires teachers, administrators, and other school practitioners, [to] demonstrate adequate proficiency, in English, of three basic skills: reading, mathematics, and writing. The CBEST is administered by the National Evaluation Systems, Inc. (NES), under the direction of the CBEST Program.[2] It does not test an individuals teaching skills or abilities; it only test reading skills (critical analysis, evaluation, comprehension, and research skills), mathematics skills (estimation, measurement, computation, and problem solving, etc.), and writing skills that are considered important for a job in the education field, either at the elementary, secondary, or higher education levels.[2]\\r\\nThe CBEST gives a separate score for each section tested, but a passing score must be obtained in every section, in order to satisfy the California Education Code requirement and obtain the proper credential for employment as educator in the state of California or Oregon.[2]\\r\\nThe CBEST format was implemented by the Oregon Teachers Standards and Practices Commission (TSPC) in July 1984 to assess the basic skills of individuals entering the education field. Six months after, it became a requirement for obtaining a license in Oregon as an educator. The CBEST is an additional requirement for obtaining a license or credential, and it does not replace the other requirements established for the issuance of teaching credentials.[2]\\r\\nThe CBEST consists of three sections. It contains multiple-choice questions and two essay questions. Each multiple-choice question presents five choices (A through E) and examinees are given four hours to take the test. The time given can be divided among the three sections in any way desired.\\r\\nThis section contains 50 multiple-choice questions based on original passages of between 100 and 200 words. But in some cases, these passages may be short statements of not more than one or two sentences. These questions measure the ability to understand information given through the written word, or in charts and graphs. They emphasize on critical analysis, evaluation, comprehension, and research skills.[2]\\r\\nThe critical analysis and evaluation portion is approximately 40 percent of the questions from this section, and the comprehension and research skills portion is approximately 60 percent of the questions from this section.[3]\\r\\nThis section contains 50 multiple-choice questions that assess cumulative knowledge of the mathematics traditionally taught in elementary and high school and, sometimes, in college. These questions come from three broad categories: arithmetic, algebra, and measurement and geometry. None of the questions strictly tests computation, but computational skills are required throughout the test.[2]\\r\\nAbout 40% of the questions on the mathematics section of the CBEST are related to arithmetic. About 20% of the questions are related to elementary geometry, and the remaining items are related to other mathematical concepts and skills.[3]\\r\\nThis section contains two essay questions. This portion of the CBEST assesses the ability to compose two effective essays within the given time session. The essays must answer the two topics printed in the test booklet. One topic requires an analysis of a given situation or a particular statement, and the other asks for a narrative about a personal experience. These essays test the ability to compose effective prose and to communicate ideas to an intended audience.[2]\\r\\nEssay writing demonstrates the ability to think critically and to use language logically and clearly. The 30-minute time limit for each essay allows little time to rewrite or to reflect on the writing. Therefore, the performance on this portion of the test will demonstrate the ability to organize and support ideas quickly.\\r\\nOne must earn a total of 123 points to get a passing status across all three sections, but you can get away with a score as low as 37 in one or two sections. However, you must make up the rest of remaining points of 123 points elsewhere.\\r\\nEssays are scored by California and Oregon educators, and they score according to standardized procedures during scoring sessions held immediately after each CBEST administration.

It was published in 1962 and includes commentary by Rose Wilder Lane.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first book of the Little House series, Little House in the Big Woods, was published in 1932.[5] This first book did well when it was first published.[6] The Little House books were reissued by Ursula Nordstrom to be illustrated by Garth Williams.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore writing the Little House series Laura Ingalls Wilder was a columnist in a farm journal.[6] Her daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, was the motivator behind Wilder's writing and publishing of the first book.[5] Since the first book , there have been around 60 million Little House books sold.[5] There are 9 books that fall under the Little House books umbrella.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nRose Wilder Lane had a heavy hand in the editing of the books, though Laura Ingalls Wilder's voice is still strong.[6]  It is contested the amount of influence that Lane had on the books, especially regarding any political themes, but views that align with hers are very visible within the books.[5]  Regardless, Rose Wilder Lane was a large part in the publishing and form of the books.  Lane, also had a hand in giving the rights to Roger Lea MacBride, who then led to the creation of the television show entitled Little House on the Prairie.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nTime ranks the Little House series as 22 out of 100 of the \\"100 Best Young Adult Books of All Time.\\"[9]  They are considered classics of American children's literature and remain widely read. In a 2012 survey published by School Library Journal, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience, Little House in the Big Woods was ranked number 19 among all-time best children's novels, and two of its sequels were ranked among the top 100.[10]  Five of the Little House book have been Honor Books for the Newbery Medal.  In 1938, On the Banks of Plum Creek, was a honor book, in 1940 By the Shores of Silver Lake was as well. Later in 1941, The Long Winter, was an honor book, and the two honor books later were The Little Town on the Prairie, in 1942, and Those Happy Golden Years in 1944.[11]  In addition to this, the American Library Association stated that The Long Winter, the seventh book in the series, was a \\"resource for teaching about pioneer history.\\"[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Little House books do include people from ethnic minorities, mainly Native Americans.  There have been criticisms of the Little House books because of portrayals of Native Americans.[13]  Much of the criticism relates to the negative stereotyping as well as a view of them as less than human.[14]  There's also been criticism of the ignorance present in the books of the illegality of the Ingalls' occupation of land they did not have the right to occupy.[14]  Wilder presents the land as \\"uninhabited,\\" which it was not.[6]  She moves through the series in which she gets older and her growth \\"gradually forces her to embrace whiteness... as a sign of refinement and to reject brownness as its antithesis.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn important moment concerning Wilder's depiction of Native Americans occurred in 1998, when an eight year old girl read Little House on the Prairie in her elementary school class.  The novel contains the line, \\"The only good Indian is a dead Indian\\"; and this caused the girl great distress. Her mother, Waziyatawin Angela Cavender Wilson, a member of the Wahpetunwan Dakota nation, challenged the school on its use of the book in the classroom.[15]  This prompted the American Library Association to investigate and ultimately change the name of the Wilder Award, an award named after Laura Ingalls Wilder, to the Children's Literature Legacy Award.[15]  This award is given to books that have made a large impact on children's literature in America.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nLaura Ingalls Wilder work is autobiographical fiction. Wilder embellished or bent the truth on more than one occasion to keep her story interesting.[14]  She also presented a view of the world that supported her family's experiences[17] and has been criticized regarding the history of the government's involvement in homesteading,[17] and the related tragedies faced by Native American people.[14] including illegal occupation of the land by her family, when that land was still recognized by the United States government as the Osage's territory.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Little House books may not be blatantly political in the sense of aligning outright with political parties, there are underlying themes within the books that are anti-government, and there have been owners of the rights to the books who are aligned with political parties.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote the Little House books, it was Rose Wilder Lane who edited them and it was Lane who had the rights after Laura's death.  Rose was an \\"outspoken antigovernment polemicist and is called one of the grandmothers of the libertarian movement.\\"[5]  Lane's views were supported by her mother.[6]  Though despite her mother's support of her political views, Lane went against her mother, and what was written in her will, by leaving the rights of the Little House books to Roger Lea MacBride after her own death.[6]  Roger Lea MacBride has strong connections to politics, being a once libertarian presidential candidate, and a member of the Republican Liberty Caucus.[5]  His gaining of the rights to the books, was not only from Lane's will but also through a legal battle with the library that Wilder wrote in her will would gain the rights after Lane's death.[5] MacBride was the one to allow the television show to be made, and through the rights he has made a great deal of money.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to being involved in party politics the Little House books were used for the \\"reeducation process\\" of Japanese and German people after World War Two.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother layer of politics the Little House books brings to the surface is John Locke's Labor Theory of Property.  That is essential in the rhetoric surrounding the Little House books because of the relation between homesteading and the labor theory of property.  The labor theory of property is the idea that if someone improves the land with their own labor that they then have rights to that land.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnti-governmental political views, such as those held by Rose Wilder Lane, can be found in the Little House books. In her article, \\"'Little House on the Prairie' and the Truth About the American West,\\" Patricia Nelson Limerick connects Wilder's apparent and Lane's outright distaste for the government as a way to blame the government for their father's failure at homesteading.[6]  The books show the Wilder family to be entrepreneurs and shows a form of hero worship of Laura Ingalls Wilder's parents.[17] this shaped a hatred of the government, who in fact helped homesteaders.[17]  In \\"'Little House on the Prairie' and the Myth of Self Reliance,\\" Julie Tharp and Jeff Kleiman claim that the idea of the settlers' self-reliance, which they consider to be a myth, has contributed to conservative rhetoric, and that the Little House books are full of this narrative.[17]  Within the books there is also rhetoric against the New Deal.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour series of books expand the Little House series to include five generations of Laura Ingalls Wilder's family. The \\"Martha Years\\" and \\"Charlotte Years\\" series, by Melissa Wiley, are fictionalized tales of Laura's great-grandmother in Scotland in the late 18th century and grandmother in early 19th century Massachusetts.[19] The \\"Caroline Years\\" series narrates Laura's mother, Caroline Quiner's, childhood in Wisconsin.[20] The Rose Years (originally known as the \\"Rocky Ridge Years\\") series follows Rose Wilder Lane from childhood in Missouri to early adulthood in San Francisco. It was written by her surrogate grandson Roger MacBride.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo volumes of Laura's letters and diaries have also been issued under the Little House imprint: On The Way Home and West From Home, both published by Harper Collins in 1962 and 1974 respectively.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of the first book in the series, Little House in the Big Woods, revolves around the life of the Ingalls family in their small home near Pepin, Wisconsin. The family includes mother Caroline Ingalls, father Charles Ingalls, elder daughter Mary Amelia Ingalls, and younger daughter (and protagonist), Laura Ingalls Wilder.[24] Also in the story, though not yet born historically, is Laura's baby sister Carrie. In the book, Laura herself turns five years old, when the real-life author had only been three during the events of the book.  According to a letter from her daughter, Rose, to biographer William Anderson, the publisher had Laura change her age in the book because it seemed unrealistic for a three-year-old to have specific memories such as she wrote about.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle House in the Big Woods describes the homesteading skills Laura observed and began to practice during her fifth year. The cousins come for Christmas that year, and Laura receives a doll, which she names Charlotte. Later that winter, the family goes to Grandma Ingallss and has a sugaring off, when they harvest sap and make maple syrup. They return home with buckets of syrup, enough to last the year. Laura remembered that sugaring off, and the dance that followed, for the rest of her life.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book also describes other farm work duties and events, such as the birth of a calf, and the availability of milk, butter and cheese, gardening, field work, hunting, gathering, and more. Everyday housework is also described in detail. When Pa went into the woods to hunt, he usually came home with a deer then smoked the meat for the coming winter. One day he noticed a bee tree and returned from hunting early to get the wash tub and milk pail to collect the honey. When Pa returned in the winter evenings, Laura and Mary always begged him to play his fiddle, as he was too tired from farm work to play during the summertime.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nFarmer Boy, published in 1933, is the second-published of the Little House books and it is commonly numbered two in the series, but its story is unrelated to that of the inaugural novel, Little House in the Big Woods. It features the boyhood of Laura's future husband Almanzo Wilder from before his ninth birthday until after his tenth. The book describes his schooling, holidays, farm work, and most of all, food.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle House on the Prairie, published in 1935, is the third book in the Little House series but only the second that features the Ingalls family; it continues directly the story of the inaugural novel, Little House in the Big Woods.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book tells about the months the Ingalls family spent on the prairie of Kansas, around the town of Independence, Kansas. At the beginning of this story, Pa Ingalls decides to sell the house in the Big Woods of Wisconsin, and move the family, via covered wagon to the Indian Territory near Independence, Kansas, as there were widely circulating stories that the land (technically still under Osage ownership) would be opened to settlement by homesteaders imminently. So Laura, along with Pa and Ma, Mary, and baby Carrie, move to Kansas. Along the way, Pa trades his two horses for two Western mustangs, which Laura and Mary name Pet and Patty.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the family reaches Indian Territory, they meet Mr. Edwards, who is extremely polite to Ma, but tells Laura and Mary that he is \\"a wildcat from Tennessee.\\" Mr. Edwards is an excellent neighbor, and helps the Ingalls in every way he can, beginning with helping Pa erect their house. Pa builds a roof and a floor for their house and digs a well, and the family is finally settled.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt their new home, unlike their time in the Big Woods, the family meets difficulty and danger. The Ingalls family becomes terribly ill from a disease called at that time \\"fever 'n' ague\\" (fever with severe chills and shaking) which was later identified as malaria. Laura comments on the varied ways they believe to have acquired it, with \\"Ma\\" believing it came from eating bad watermelon. Mrs. Scott, another neighbor, takes care of the family while they are sick. Around this time,  Mr. Edwards brings Laura and Mary their Christmas presents from Independence, and in the spring, the Ingalls plant the beginnings of a small farm.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIrony also becomes a part of this book. Ma's prejudice about American Indians, and Laura's childish observations of them, are contrasted with Pa's more egalitarian view of them, and these views collectively are shown side by side with the objective portrayal of the Osage tribe that lives on and owns that land.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of this book, the family is told that the land must be vacated by settlers as it is not legally open to settlement yet, and in 1870 Pa elects to leave the land and move before the Army forcibly requires him to abandon the land.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Banks of Plum Creek, published in 1937 and fourth in the series, follows the Ingalls family as they move from Pepin, Wisconsin to Kansas to an area near Walnut Grove, Minnesota, and settle in a dugout \\"on the banks of Plum Creek (Redwood County, Minnesota)\\".[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nPa trades his horses Pet and Patty to the property owner (a man named Hanson) for the land and crops, but later gets two new horses as Christmas presents for the family, which Laura and her sister Mary name \\"Sam\\" and \\"David\\". Pa soon builds a new, above-ground, wooden house for the family. During this story, Laura and Mary go to school for the first time in town where they meet their teacher, Miss Eva Beadle. They also meet Nellie Oleson, who makes fun of Laura and Mary for being \\"country girls.\\" Laura plays with her bulldog Jack when she is home, and she and Mary are invited to a party at the Olesons' home. Laura and Mary invite all the girls (including Nellie) to a party at their house to reciprocate. The family soon goes through hard times when a plague of Rocky Mountain Locust decimates their crops. The book ends with Pa returning safely to the house after being unaccounted for during a severe four-day blizzard.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the Shores of Silver Lake, published in 1939 and fifth in the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story begins when the family is about to leave Plum Creek, shortly after the family has recovered from the scarlet fever which caused Mary to become blind. The family welcomes a visit from Aunt Docia, whom they had not seen for several years. She suggests that Pa and Ma move west to the rapidly developing Dakota Territory, where Pa could work in Uncle Henrys railroad camp at very good wages for that era. Ma and Pa agree, since it will allow Pa to look for a homestead while he works. The family has endured many hardships on Plum Creek and Pa especially is anxious for a new start. After selling his land and farm to neighbors, Pa goes ahead with the wagon and team. Mary is still too weak to travel so the rest of the family follows later by train.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day Pa leaves, however, their beloved bulldog Jack is found dead, which saddens Laura greatly. In actuality, the dog upon whom Jack was based was no longer with the family at this point, but the author inserted his death here to serve as a transition between her childhood and her adolescence. Laura also begins to play a more mature role in the family due to Mary's blindness ÿ Pa instructs Laura to \\"be Mary's eyes\\" and to assist her in daily life as she learns to cope with her disability. Mary is strong and willing to learn.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe family travels to Dakota Territory by train ÿ this is the children's first train trip and they are excited by the novelty of this new mode of transportation that allows them to travel in one hour the distance it would take a horse and wagon an entire day to cover.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the family reunited and situated at the railroad camp, Laura meets her cousin Lena, and the two become good friends.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs winter approaches, and the railroad workers take down the cabins and head back East, the family wonders where they might stay for the winter. As luck would have it, the county surveyor needs a house-sitter while he is East for the winter, and Pa signs up. It is a winter of luxury for the Ingalls family as they are given all the provisions they need in the large, comfortable house. They spend a cozy winter with their new friends, Mr. and Mrs. Boast, and both families look forward to starting their new claims in the spring.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the \\"Spring Rush\\" comes early. The large mobilization of pioneers to the Dakotas in early March prompts Pa to leave immediately on the few days' trip to the claims office. The girls are left alone and spend their days and nights boarding and feeding all the pioneers passing through. They charge 25 cents for dinner and boarding, starting a savings account toward sending Mary to the School for the Blind in Vinton, Iowa.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nPa successfully files his claim, with the aid of old friend Mr. Edwards. As the spring flowers bloom and the prairie comes alive with new settlers, the Ingalls family moves to their new piece of land and begins building what will become their permanent home.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Long Winter, published in 1940 and sixth in the series, covers the shortest timespan of the novels, only an eight-month period.  The winter of 1880ÿ1881 was a notably severe winter in history, sometimes known as \\"The Snow Winter\\".[32][33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story begins in Dakota Territory at the Ingalls homestead in South Dakota on a hot September day in 1880 as Laura and her father (\\"Pa\\") are haying. Pa tells Laura that he knows the winter is going to be hard because muskrats always build a house with thick walls before a hard winter, and this year, they have built the thickest walls he has ever seen. In mid-October, the Ingalls wake with an unusually early blizzard howling around their poorly insulated claim shanty. Soon afterward, Pa receives another warning from an unexpected source: a dignified old Native American man comes to the general store in town to warn the white settlers that there will be seven months of blizzards. Impressed, Pa decides to move the family into town for the winter.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nLaura attends school with her younger sister, Carrie until the weather becomes too severe to permit them to walk to and from the school building. Blizzard after blizzard sweeps through the town over the next few months. Food and fuel become scarce and expensive, as the town depends on the trains to bring supplies but the frequent blizzards prevent the trains from getting through. Eventually, the railroad company suspends all efforts to dig out the train, stranding the town. For weeks, the Ingalls subsist on potatoes and coarse brown bread, using twisted hay for fuel. As even this meager food runs out, Laura's future husband Almanzo Wilder and his friend Cap Garland risk their lives to bring wheat to the starving townspeople ÿ enough to last the rest of the winter.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nLaura's age in this book is also accurate. (In 1880, she would have been 13, as she states in the first chapter.) However, Almanzo Wilder's age is misrepresented in this book.  Much is made of the fact that he is 19 pretending to be 21 in order to illegally obtain a homestead claim from the US government.  But in 1880, his true age would have been 23.  Scholar Ann Romines has suggested that Laura made Almanzo younger because it was felt that more modern audiences would be scandalized by the great difference in their ages in light of their young marriage.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs predicted, the blizzards continue for seven months. Finally, the trains begin running again, bringing the Ingalls a Christmas barrel full of good things ÿ including a turkey. In the last chapter, they sit down to enjoy their Christmas dinner in May.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Town on the Prairie, published in 1941 and seventh in the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story begins as Laura accepts her first job performing sewing work in order to earn money for Mary to go to a college for the blind in Iowa. Laura's hard work comes to an end by summer when she is let go, and the family begins planning to raise cash crops to pay for Mary's college. After the crops are destroyed by blackbirds, Pa sells a calf to earn the balance of the money needed. When Ma and Pa escort Mary to the college, Laura, Carrie, and Grace are left alone for a week. In order to stave off the loneliness stemming from Mary's departure, Laura, Carrie, and Grace do the fall cleaning. They have several problems, but the house is sparkling when they are done. Ma and Pa come home, and are truly surprised.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fall, the Ingalls quickly prepare for a move to town for the winter. Laura and Carrie attend school in town and Laura is reunited with her friends Minnie Johnson and Mary Power and meets a new girl, Ida Brown. There is a new schoolteacher for the winter term: Eliza Jane Wilder, Almanzos sister. Nellie Oleson, Laura's nemesis from Plum Creek, has moved to De Smet and is attending the school. Nellie turns the teacher against Laura and Miss Wilder loses control of the school for a time. A visit by the school board restores order; however, Miss Wilder leaves at the end of the fall term, and is eventually replaced by Mr. Clewett and then Mr. Owen, the latter of whom befriends Laura. Through the course of the winter, Laura sets herself to studying, as she only has one year left before she can apply for a teaching certificate.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, Almanzo Wilder begins escorting Laura home from church. By Christmastime, Almanzo once again sees Laura home, and offers to take her on a sleigh ride after he completes the cutter he is building.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt home, Laura is met by Mr. Boast and Mr. Brewster, who ask Laura if she would be interested in a teaching position at a settlement led by Brewster twelve miles (19?km) from town. The school superintendent, George Williams, comes and tests Laura (though she is two months too young, he never asks her age), and she is awarded a third-grade teaching certificate.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese Happy Golden Years, published in 1943 and eighth in the series, originally ended with a note alone on the last page: \\"The end of the Little house books.\\"[38] It takes place between 1882 and 1885. As the story begins, Pa is taking Laura 12 miles (19?km) from home to her first teaching assignment at Brewster settlement. Laura, only 15 and a schoolgirl herself, is apprehensive as this is both the first time she has left home and the first school she has taught. She is determined to complete her assignment and earn $40 to help her sister Mary, who is attending Vinton College for the Blind in Iowa.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis first school proves difficult for her. Laura must board with the Brewsters in their two-room claim shanty, sleeping on their sofa. The Brewsters are an unhappy family and Laura is deeply uncomfortable observing the way husband and wife quarrel. In one particularly unsettling incident, she wakes in the night to see Mrs Brewster standing over her husband with a knife. It is a bitterly cold winter, and neither the claim shanty or the school house can be heated adequately. The children she is teaching, some of whom are older than she is herself, test her skills as a teacher. Laura grows more self-assured through the term, and successfully completes the two-month term.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Laura's surprise and delight, homesteader Almanzo Wilder (with whom she became acquainted in Little Town on the Prairie) appears at the end of her first week of school in his new two-horse cutter to bring her home for the weekend. Already fond of Laura and wanting to ease her homesickness, Almanzo takes it upon himself to bring her home and back to school each weekend.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationship continues after the school term ends. Sleigh rides give way to buggy rides in the spring, and Laura impresses Almanzo with her willingness to help break his new and often temperamental horses. Laura's old nemesis, Nellie Oleson, makes a brief appearance during two Sunday buggy rides with Almanzo. Nellie's chatter and flirtatious behavior towards Almanzo annoys Laura. Shortly thereafter, Nellie moves back to New York after her family loses their homestead.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nLaura's Uncle Tom (Ma's brother) visits the family and tells of his failed venture with a covered wagon brigade seeking gold in the Black Hills. Laura helps out seamstress Mrs. McKee by staying with her and her daughter on their prairie claim for two months to \\"hold it down\\" as required by law. The family enjoys summer visits from Mary.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe family finances have improved to the point that Pa can sell a cow to purchase a sewing machine for Ma. Laura continues to teach and work as a seamstress.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmanzo invites Laura to attend summer \\"singing school\\" with him and her classmates. On the last evening of singing school while driving Laura home, Almanzo ÿ who has by now been courting Laura for three years ÿ proposes to Laura. During their next ride, Almanzo presents Laura with a garnet-and-pearl ring and they share their first kiss.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral months later, after Almanzo has finished building a house on his tree claim, he asks Laura if she would mind getting married within a few days as his sister and mother have their hearts set on a large church wedding, which Pa cannot afford. Laura agrees, and she and Almanzo are married in a simple ceremony by the Reverend Brown. After a wedding dinner with her family, Laura drives away with Almanzo and the newlyweds settle contentedly into their new home.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Four Years, published in 1971, is commonly considered the ninth and last book in the original Little House series. It covers the earliest years of Laura and Almanzo's marriage.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Four Years derives its title from a promise Laura made to Almanzo when they became engaged. Laura did not want to be a farm wife, but she consented to try farming for three years. At the end of that time, Laura and Almanzo mutually agreed to continue for one more year, a \\"year of grace\\", in Laura's words. The book ends at the close of that fourth year, on a rather optimistic note. In reality, the continually hot, dry Dakota summers, and several other tragic events described in the book eventually drove them from their land, but they later founded a very successful fruit and dairy farm in Missouri, where they lived comfortably until their respective deaths.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nJackanory is a British television series intended to encourage children to read; it ran from 1965 to 1996, and was revived in 2006. From October 24 through October 28, 1966, five short episodes aired that were based on Little House in the Big Woods, with Red Shively as the storyteller. From October 21 through October 25, 1968, five more were released, this time based on Farmer Boy, with Richard Monette as the storyteller.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe television series Little House on the Prairie aired on the NBC network from 1974 to 1983. The show was a loose adaptation of Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House on the Prairie semi-autobiographical novel series, although the namesake book was represented in the premiere only; the ensuing television episodes primarily followed characters and locations from the follow-up book, On the Banks of Plum Creek (1937), although the continuity of the television series greatly departed from this book as well. Some storylines were borrowed from Wilder's later books but were portrayed as having taken place in the Plum Creek setting. Michael Landon starred as Charles Ingalls, Karen Grassle played Caroline Ingalls, Melissa Gilbert played Laura Ingalls, Melissa Sue Anderson played Mary Ingalls, and the twins Lindsay and Sidney Greenbush (credited as Lindsay Sidney Greenbush) played Carrie Ingalls. Victor French portrayed long-time friend Mr. Edwards. Dean Butler portrayed Laura's husband, Almanzo Wilder. Some characters were added in the show, such as Albert, played by Matthew Laborteaux, an orphan whom the family adopted.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough it deviated from the original books in many respects, the television series, which was set in Walnut Grove, Minnesota, was one of a few long-running successful dramatic family shows.[citation needed] It remained a top-rated series, and garnered 17 Emmy? and three Golden Globe? nominations, along with two Peoples Choice? Awards.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Japanese cartoon series of 26 episodes (about 24 minutes each), originally entitled Sgen no shjo Laura.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo made for television movies by Marcus Cole, with Meredith Monroe as Laura. Part 1 tells the story of teenage Laura in DeSmet, while the second part is about Laura and Almanzo's (Walton Goggins) marriage and their life in Mansfield, Missouri. It also focuses a lot on the character of Wilder's young daughter; Rose (Skye McCole Bartusiak).[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2005 ABC five-hour (six-episode) miniseries Little House on the Prairie attempted to follow closely the books Little House in the Big Woods and Little House on the Prairie. It starred Cameron Bancroft as Charles Ingalls; Erin Cottrell as Caroline Ingalls; Kyle Chavarria as Laura Ingalls; Danielle Chuchran as Mary Ingalls; and Gregory Sporleder as Mr Edwards. It was directed by David L. Cunningham. In 2006 the mini-series was released on DVD and the 2-disc set runs approximately 255 minutes long.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nA musical version of the Little House books premiered at the Guthrie Theater, Minnesota on July 26, 2008. The musical has music by Rachel Portman and lyrics by Donna DiNovelli and is directed by Francesca Zambello with choreography by Michele Lynch. The cast includes Melissa Gilbert as \\"Ma\\". The musical began a US national tour in October 2009.[44][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle House on the Prairie: The Legacy of Laura Ingalls Wilder is a one-hour documentary film that looks at the life of Wilder. Wilder's story as a writer, wife, and mother is explored through interviews with scholars and historians, archival photography, paintings by frontier artists, and dramatic reenactments.[46]","input":"Where did little house on the prairie live?"},{"output":"Australopithecines","context":"","input":"Who was the first person to live in south africa?"},{"output":"September 1, 1905","context":"","input":"When did alberta become a province of canada?"},{"output":"must be bred and produce calves","context":"Dairy cattle (also called dairy cows) are cattle cows bred for the ability to produce large quantities of milk, from which dairy products are made. Dairy cows generally are of the species Bos taurus.[1]\\r\\nHistorically, there was little distinction between dairy cattle and beef cattle, with the same stock often being used for both meat and milk production. Today, the bovine industry is more specialized and most dairy cattle have been bred to produce large volumes of milk.\\r\\nThe United States dairy herd produced 84.2?billion kilograms (185.7?billion pounds) of milk in 2007,[2] up from 52.9?billion kilograms (116.6?billion pounds) in 1950,[3] yet there were only about 9 million cows on U.S. dairy farmsabout 13 million fewer than there were in 1950.[3] The top breed of dairy cow within Canada's national herd category is Holstein, taking up 93% of the dairy cow population, have an annual production rate of 10,257 kilograms (22,613 pounds) of milk per cow that contains 3.9% butter fat and 3.2% protein.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDairy cows may be found either in herds or dairy farms where dairy farmers own, manage, care for, and collect milk from them, or on commercial farms. Herd sizes vary around the world depending on landholding culture and social structure. The United States has 9 million cows in 75,000 dairy herds, with an average herd size of 120 cows. The number of small herds is falling rapidly with the 3,100 herds with over 500 cows producing 51% of U.S. milk in 2007.[5] The United Kingdom dairy herd overall has nearly 1.5 million cows, with about 100 head reported on an average farm.[6] In New Zealand, the average herd has more than 375 cows, while in Australia, there are approximately 220 cows in the average herd.[7][8]\\r\\nPasteurization is the process of heating milk to a high enough temperature for a short period of time to kill the microbes in the milk and increase keep time and decrease spoilage time by killing the microbes, decrease the transmission of infection and eliminates enzymes that reduce the quality and shelf life. Pasteurization is either completed at 63?C for 30 minutes or a flash pasteurization is completed for 15 seconds at 72?C.[9]\\r\\nTo maintain lactation, a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves. Depending on market conditions, the cow may be bred with a \\"dairy bull\\" or a \\"beef bull.\\" Female calves (heifers) with dairy breeding may be kept as replacement cows for the dairy herd. If a replacement cow turns out to be a substandard producer of milk, she then goes to market and can be slaughtered for beef. Male calves can either be used later as a breeding bull or sold and used for veal or beef. Dairy farmers usually begin breeding or artificially inseminating heifers around 13 months of age.[10] A cow's gestation period is approximately nine months.[11] Newborn calves are removed from their mothers quickly, usually within three days, as the mother/calf bond intensifies over time and delayed separation can cause extreme stress on both cow and calf.[12]\\r\\nDomestic cows can live to 20 years; however, those raised for dairy rarely live that long, as the average cow is removed from the dairy herd around age four and marketed for beef.[11][13] In 2014, approximately 9.5% of the cattle slaughtered in the U.S. were culled dairy cows: cows that can no longer be seen as an economic asset to the dairy farm.[14] These animals may be sold due to reproductive problems or common diseases of milk cows such as mastitis and lameness.[13]\\r\\nMarket calves are generally sold at two weeks of age and bull calves may fetch a premium over heifers due to their size, either current or potential. Calves may be sold for veal, or for one of several types of beef production, depending on available local crops and markets. Such bull calves may be castrated if turnout onto pastures is envisaged, in order to render the animals less aggressive. Purebred bulls from elite cows may be put into progeny testing schemes to find out whether they might become superior sires for breeding. Such animals may become extremely valuable.\\r\\nMost dairy farms separate calves from their mothers within a day of birth to reduce transmission of disease and simplify management of milking cows. Studies have been done allowing calves to remain with their mothers for 1, 4, 7 or 14 days after birth. Cows whose calves were removed longer than one day after birth showed increased searching, sniffing and vocalizations. However, calves allowed to remain with their mothers for longer periods showed weight gains at three times the rate of early removals as well as more searching behavior and better social relationships with other calves.[15][16]\\r\\nAfter separation, some young dairy calves subsist on commercial milk replacer, a feed based on dried milk powder. Milk replacer is an economical alternative to feeding whole milk because it is cheaper, can be bought at varying fat and protein percentages, and is typically less contaminated than whole milk when handled properly. Some farms pasteurize and feed calves milk from the cows in the herd instead of using replacer. A day-old calf consumes around 5 liters of milk per day.\\r\\nA bull calf with high genetic potential may be reared for breeding purposes. It may be kept by a dairy farm as a herd bull, to provide natural breeding for the herd of cows. A bull may service up to 50 or 60 cows during a breeding season. Any more and the sperm count will decline, leading to cows \\"returning to service\\" (to be bred again). A herd bull may only stay for one season, as when most bulls reach over two years old their temperament becomes too unpredictable.\\r\\nBull calves intended for breeding commonly are bred on specialized dairy breeding farms, not production farms. These farms are the major source of stocks for artificial insemination.\\r\\nThe dairy cow will produce large amounts of milk in its lifetime. Production levels peak at around 40 to 60 days after calving. Production declines steadily afterwards until milking is stopped at about 10 months. The cow is \\"dried off\\" for about sixty days before calving again. Within a 12 to 14-month inter-calving cycle, the milking period is about 305 days or 10 months long.[17][18][19] Among many variables, certain breeds produce more milk than others within a range of around 6,800 to 17,000?kg (15,000 to 37,500?lbs) of milk per year.[citation needed] The Holstein Friesian is the main breed of dairy cattle in Australia, and said to have the \\"world's highest\\" productivity, at 10000L of milk per year.[20] The average for a single dairy cow in the US in 2007 was 9164.4?kg (20,204?lbs) per year, excluding milk consumed by her calves,[2] whereas the same average value for a single cow in Israel was reported in the Philippine press to be 12,240?kg in 2009.[21] High production cows are more difficult to breed at a two-year interval. Many farms take the view that 24 or even 36 month cycles are more appropriate for this type of cow.[citation needed]\\r\\nDairy cows may continue to be economically productive for many lactation cycles. In theory a longevity of 10 lactations is possible. The chances of problems arising which may lead to a cow being culled are high, however; the average herd life of US Holstein is today fewer than 3 lactations. This requires more herd replacements to be reared or purchased. Over 90% of all cows are slaughtered for 4 main reasons:\\r\\nCow longevity is strongly correlated with production levels.[22] Lower production cows live longer than high production cows, but may be less profitable. Cows no longer wanted for milk production are sent to slaughter. Their meat is of relatively low value and is generally used for processed meat. Another factor affecting milk production is the stress the cow is faced with. Psychologists at the University of Leicester, UK, analyzed the musical preference of milk cows and found out that music actually influences the dairy cow's lactation. Calming music can improve milk yield, probably because it reduces stress and relaxes the cows in much the same way as it relaxes humans. [23]\\r\\nCertain behaviors such as eating, rumination, and lying down can be related to the health of the cow and cow comfort.[24] These behaviors can also be related to the productivity of the cows.[24] Likewise, stress, disease, and discomfort will have a negative effect on the productivity of the dairy cows.[24] Therefore, it can be said that it is in the best interest of the farmer to increase eating, rumination, and lying down and decrease stress, disease, and discomfort to achieve the maximum productivity possible.[24] Also, estrous behaviors such as mounting can be a sign of cow comfort, since if a cow is lame, nutritionally deficient, or are housed in an over crowded barn, the performance of estrous behaviors will be altered.[25]\\r\\nFeeding behaviors are obviously important for the dairy cow, as feeding is how the cow will ingest dry matter, however, the cow must ruminate to fully digest the feed and utilize the nutrients in the feed.[26] Dairy cows with good rumen health will likely be more profitable than cows with poor rumen health, as a healthy rumen will aid in the digestion of nutrients.[24] An increase in the time a cow spends ruminating is associated with the increase in health and an increase in milk production.[24]\\r\\nCows have a high motivation to lie down [26] so farmers should be conscious of this, not only because they have a high motivation to lie down, but also because lying down can increase milk yield.[27] When the lactating dairy cow lies down, blood flow is increased to the mammary gland which in return results in a higher milk yield.[27]\\r\\nTo ensure that the dairy cows lie down as much as needed, the stalls must be comfortable.[28] Put very simply, a stall should have a rubber mat, bedding, and be large enough for the cow to lie down and get up comfortably.[28] Signs that the stalls may not be comfortable enough for the cows are the cows are standing, either ruminating or not, instead of lying down, or perching, which is when the cow has its front end in the stall and their back end out of the stall.[28]\\r\\nThere are 2 types of housing systems in dairy production, free style housing and tie stall. Free style housing is where the cow is free to walk around and interact with its environment and other members of the herd. Tie stall housing is when the cow is chained to a stantion stall with the milking units and feed coming to them.[29]\\r\\nBy-products of milk include butterfat, cream, curds, and whey. Butterfat is the fat in milk. The cream is the yellowish part of the milk. The cream contains 18ÿ40% butterfat. Whey is the watery part of the milk.\\r\\nThe industry can be divided into 2 market territories; fluid milk and industrialized milk such as yogurt, cheeses, and ice cream.[30]\\r\\nSince the 1950s, artificial insemination (AI) is used at most dairy farms; these farms may keep no bull. Artificial insemination uses estrus synchronization to indicate when the cow is going through ovulation and is susceptible to fertilization. Advantages of using AI include its low cost and ease compared to maintaining a bull, ability to select from a large number of bulls, elimination of diseases in the dairy industry, improved genetics and improved animal welfare [31] Rather than a large bull jumping on a smaller heifer or weaker cow, AI allows the farmer to complete the breeding procedure within 5 minutes with minimum stress placed on the individual female's body [31]\\r\\nMore recently, embryo transfer has been used to enable the multiplication of progeny from elite cows. Such cows are given hormone treatments to produce multiple embryos. These are then 'flushed' from the cow's uterus. 7-12 embryos are consequently removed from these donor cows and transferred into other cows who serve as surrogate mothers. The result will be between 3 and 6 calves instead of the normal single, or rarely, twins.\\r\\nHormone treatments are sometimes given to dairy cows in some countries to increase reproduction and to increase milk production.\\r\\nThe hormones are used to produce multiple embryos have to be administered at specific times to dairy cattle to induce ovulation. Frequently, for economic considerations, these drugs are also used to synchronise a group of cows to ovulate simultaneously. The hormones prostaglandin, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and progesterone are used for this purpose and sold under the brand names Lutalyse, Cystorelin, Estrumate, Estroplan, Factrel, Prostamate, Fertagyl, Insynch, and Ovacyst. They may be administered by injection.[32]\\r\\nAbout 17% of dairy cows in the United States are injected with Bovine somatotropin, also called recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST), recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), or artificial growth hormone.[33] The use of this hormone increases milk production from 11%ÿ25%. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has ruled that rBST is harmless to people. The use of rBST is banned in Canada, parts of the European Union, as well as Australia and New Zealand.\\r\\nIn Canada, Canadian Dairy farmers have high screening procedures they have to go through every time the milk is retrieved from the farm; if the regulations are not met the milk does not get loaded onto the truck for further processing. There is to be no medication or hormones in the milk for safety reasons [9]\\r\\nNutrition plays an important role in keeping cattle healthy and strong.[34] Implementing an adequate nutrition program can also improve milk production and reproductive performance. Nutrient requirements may not be the same depending on the animal's age and stage of production.\\r\\nForages, which refer especially to hay or straw, are the most common type of feed used. Cereal grains, as the main contributors of starch to diets, are important in meeting the energy needs of dairy cattle. Barley is one example of grain that is extensively used around the world. Barley is grown in temperate to subarctic climates, and it is transported to those areas lacking the necessary amounts of grain. Although variations may occur, in general, barley is an excellent source of balanced amounts of protein, energy, and fiber.[35]\\r\\nEnsuring adequate body fat reserves is essential for cattle to produce milk and also to keep reproductive efficiency. However, if cattle get excessively fat or too thin, they run the risk of developing metabolic problems and may have problems with calving.[36] Scientists have found that a variety of fat supplements can benefit conception rates of lactating dairy cows. Some of these different fats include oleic acids, found in canola oil, animal tallow, and yellow grease; palmitic acid found in granular fats and dry fats; and linolenic acids which are found in cottonseed, safflower, sunflower, and soybean.[37] It is also important to note that proper levels of fat also improve cattle longevity.\\r\\nUsing by-products is one way of reducing the normally high feed costs. However, lack of knowledge of their nutritional and economic value limits their use. Although the reduction of costs may be significant, they have to be used carefully because animal may have negative reactions to radical changes in feeds, (e.g. fog fever). Such a change must then be made slowly and with the proper follow up.[38]\\r\\nA survey of the primary dairy producing areas in the US indicated that 13 percent of lactating animals were treated with insecticides permethrin, pyrethrin, coumaphos, and dichlorvos primarily by daily or every-other-day coat sprays. Workers, particularly in stanchion barns, may be exposed to higher than recommended amounts of these pesticides.[39]\\r\\nAccording to the Purebred Dairy Cattle Association, PDCA, there are 7 major dairy breeds in the United States. These are: Holstein, Brown Swiss, Guernsey, Ayrshire, Jersey, Red and White, and Milking Shorthorn.[40]\\r\\nHolstein cows either have distinct white and black markings, or distinct red and white markings. Holstein cows are the biggest of all U.S. dairy breeds. A full mature Holstein cow usually weighs around 1,500 pounds (700?kg) and is 58 inches (147?cm) tall at the shoulder. They are known for their outstanding milk production among the main breeds of dairy cattle. An average Holstein cow produces around 23,000 pounds (10,000?kg) of milk each lactation. Of the 9 million dairy cows in the U.S., approximately 90% of them are of the Holstein descent.[41] The top breed of dairy cow within Canada's national herd category is Holstein, taking up 93% of the dairy cow population, have a production rate of 10,257 kilograms (22,613?lb) of milk per cow that contains 3.9% butter fat and 3.2% protein[4]\\r\\nBrown Swiss cows are widely accepted as the oldest dairy cattle breed, originally coming from a part of northeastern Switzerland. Some experts think that the modern Brown Swiss skeleton is similar to one found that looks to be from around the year 4000 B.C. Also, there is evidence that monks started breeding these cows about 1000 years ago.[42]\\r\\nThe Ayrshire breed first originated in the County of Ayr in Scotland. It became regarded as a well established breed in 1812. The different breeds that were crossed to form the Ayrshire are not exactly known. However, there is evidence that several breeds were crossed with the native cattle to create the breed.[43]\\r\\nGuernsey cows originated just off the coast of France on the small Isle of Guernsey. The breed was first known as a separate breed around 1700. Guernseys are known for their ability to produce very high quality milk from grass. Also, the term \\"Golden Guernsey\\" is very common as Guernsey cattle produce rich, yellow milk rather than the standard white milk other cow breeds produce.[44]\\r\\nThe Jersey breed of dairy cow originated on a small island located off the coast of France called Jersey.[45] Despite being one of the oldest breeds of dairy cattle they now only occupy 4% of the Canadian National Herd[46]. Purebred Jersey cows, according to available data, have been in the UK area since about the year 1741. When they were first bred in this area, they were not known as Jerseys, but rather as the related Alderneys. The period between 1860 and around 1914 was a popular time for Jerseys. In this time span, many countries other than the United States started importing this breed, including Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand, among others.[47] Among the smallest of the dairy breeds, the average Jersey cow matures at approximately 900 pounds (410?kg), with a typical weight range between 800 and 1,200 pounds (360ÿ540?kg). According to North Dakota State University, the fat content of the Jersey cow's milk is 4.9 percent. It's also the highest in protein, at 3.8 percent.[48] This high fat content means the milk is often used for making ice cream and cheeses. According to the American Jersey Cattle Association, Jerseys are found on 20 percent of all US dairy farms and are the primary breed in about 4 percent of dairies.\\r\\nAmongst the Bos indicus, the most popular dairy breed in the world is Sahiwal of the Indian subcontinent. It does not give as much milk as the Taurine breeds, but it is by far the most suitable breed for warmer climates. Australian Friesian Sahiwal and Australian Milking Zebu have been developed in Australia using Sahiwal genetics. Gir, another of the Bos Indicus breeds, has been improved in Brazil for its milk production and is widely used there for dairy.\\r\\nAnimal welfare refers to both the physical and mental state of an animal, and how it is coping with its situation. An animal is considered in a good state of welfare if it is able to express its innate behaviour, comfortable, healthy, safe, well nourished, and is not suffering from negative states such as distress, fear and pain. Good animal welfare requires disease prevention and veterinary treatment, appropriate shelter, management, nutrition, and humane handling. If said animal is slaughtered then it is no longer \\"good animal welfare\\". [49]\\r\\nProper animal handling, or stockmanship, is crucial to dairy animals' welfare as well as the safety of their handlers. Improper handling techniques can stress cattle leading to impaired production and health, such as increased slipping injuries. Additionally, the majority of nonfatal worker injuries on a dairy farm are from interactions with cattle. Dairy animals are handled on a daily basis for a wide variety of purposes including health-related management practices and movement from freestalls to the milking parlor. Due to the prevalence of human-animal interactions on dairy farms, researchers, veterinarians, and farmers alike have focused on furthering our understanding of stockmanship and educating agriculture workers. Stockmanship is a complex concept that involves the timing, positioning, speed, direction of movement, and sounds and touch of the handler. A recent survey of Minnesota dairy farms revealed that 42.6% of workers learned stockmanship techniques from a family members, and 29.9% had participated in stockmanship training. However, as the growing U.S. dairy industry increasingly relies on an immigrant workforce, stockmanship training and education resources will become more pertinent. Clearly communicating and managing a large culturally diverse workforce brings new challenges such as language barriers and time limitations.[50] Organizations like the Upper Midwest Agriculture Safety and Health Center (UMASH) offer resources such as bilingual training videos, fact sheets, and informational posters for dairy worker training. Additionally the Beef Quality Assurance Program offer seminars, live demonstrations, and online resources for stockmanship training.\\r\\nThe practice of dairy production in a factory farm environment has been criticized by animal rights activists. Some of the ethical reasons regarding dairy production cited include how often the dairy cattle are impregnated, the separation of calves from their mothers, and the fact that the cows are considered \\"spent\\" and culled at a relatively young age, as well as environmental concerns regarding dairy production.\\r\\nThe production of milk requires that the cow be in lactation, which is a result of the cow having given birth to a calf. The cycle of insemination, pregnancy, parturition, and lactation is followed by a \\"dry\\" period of about two months before calving, which allows udder tissue to regenerate. A dry period that falls outside this time frames can result in decreased milk production in subsequent lactation.[51] Dairy operations therefore include both the production of milk and the production of calves. Bull calves are either castrated and raised as steers for beef production or veal.\\r\\nAnimal rights groups such as Mercy for Animals also raise welfare concerns by citing undercover footage showing abusive practices at factory farms.[52]","input":"How do cow produce milk all the time?"},{"output":"John Wallis is credited with introducing the infinity symbol with its mathematical meaning in 1655, in his De sectionibus conicis","context":"The infinity symbol  (sometimes called the lemniscate) is a mathematical symbol representing the concept of infinity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shape of a sideways figure eight has a long pedigree; for instance, it appears in the cross of Saint Boniface, wrapped around the bars of a Latin cross.[1] However, John Wallis is credited with introducing the infinity symbol with its mathematical meaning in 1655, in his De sectionibus conicis.[1][2][3][4] Wallis did not explain his choice of this symbol, but it has been conjectured to be a variant form of a Roman numeral for 1,000 (originally CI?, also C?), which was sometimes used to mean \\"many\\", or of the Greek letter? (omega), the last letter in the Greek alphabet.[5]\\r\\nLeonhard Euler used an open variant of the symbol[6] in order to denote \\"absolutus infinitus\\". Euler freely performed various operations on infinity, such as taking its logarithm.

For instance, in the mathematical notation for summations and limits such as\\r\\nthe infinity sign is conventionally interpreted as meaning that the variable grows arbitrarily large (towards infinity) rather than actually taking an infinite value.\\r\\nIn areas other than mathematics, the infinity symbol may take on other related meanings; for instance, it has been used in bookbinding to indicate that a book is printed on acid-free paper and will therefore be long-lasting.[7]\\r\\nIn modern mysticism, the infinity symbol has become identified with a variation of the ouroboros, an ancient image of a snake eating its own tail that has also come to symbolize the infinite, and the ouroboros is sometimes drawn in figure-eight form to reflect this identification, rather than in its more traditional circular form.[8]\\r\\nIn the works of Vladimir Nabokov, including The Gift and Pale Fire, the figure-eight shape is used symbolically to refer to the M?bius strip and the infinite, for instance in these books' descriptions of the shapes of bicycle tire tracks and of the outlines of half-remembered people. The poem after which Pale Fire is entitled explicitly refers to \\"the miracle of the lemniscate\\".[9]\\r\\nThe well known shape and meaning of the infinity symbol have made it a common typographic element of graphic design. For instance, the Mtis flag, used by the Canadian Mtis people in the early 19th century, is based around this symbol.[10] In modern commerce, corporate logos featuring this symbol have been used by, among others, Room for PlayStation Portable, Microsoft Visual Studio, Fujitsu, and CoorsTek.\\r\\nThe symbol is encoded in Unicode at U+221E  infinity and in LaTeX as \\\\infty: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\infty }\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\r\\nThe Unicode set of symbols also includes several variant forms of the infinity symbol, that are less frequently available in fonts: U+29DC ?

It is located on Capitol Hill at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Though not at the geographic center of the Federal District, the Capitol forms the origin point for the District's street-numbering system and the District's four quadrants.\\r\\nThe original building was completed in 1800 and was subsequently expanded, particularly with the addition of the massive dome, and expanded chambers for the bicameral legislature, the House of Representatives in the south wing and the Senate in the north wing. Like the principal buildings of the executive and judicial branches, the Capitol is built in a distinctive neoclassical style and has a white exterior. Both its east and west elevations are formally referred to as fronts, though only the east front was intended for the reception of visitors and dignitaries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to establishing the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., the United States Congress and its predecessors had met in Philadelphia (Independence Hall and Congress Hall), New York City (Federal Hall), and a number of other locations (York, Pennsylvania; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Maryland State House in Annapolis, Maryland; and Nassau Hall in Princeton, New Jersey).[2] In September 1774, the First Continental Congress brought together delegates from the colonies in Philadelphia, followed by the Second Continental Congress, which met from May 1775 to March 1781.\\r\\nAfter adopting the Articles of Confederation in York, Pennsylvania, the Congress of the Confederation was formed and convened in Philadelphia from March 1781 until June 1783, when a mob of angry soldiers converged upon Independence Hall, demanding payment for their service during the American Revolutionary War. Congress requested that John Dickinson, the Governor of Pennsylvania, call up the militia to defend Congress from attacks by the protesters. In what became known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, Dickinson sympathized with the protesters and refused to remove them from Philadelphia. As a result, Congress was forced to flee to Princeton, New Jersey, on June 21, 1783,[3] and met in Annapolis, Maryland, and Trenton, New Jersey, before ending up in New York City.\\r\\nThe United States Congress was established upon ratification of the United States Constitution and formally began on March 4, 1789. New York City remained home to Congress until July 1790,[4] when the Residence Act was passed to pave the way for a permanent capital. The decision to locate the capital was contentious, but Alexander Hamilton helped broker a compromise in which the federal government would take on war debt incurred during the American Revolutionary War, in exchange for support from northern states for locating the capital along the Potomac River. As part of the legislation, Philadelphia was chosen as a temporary capital for ten years (until December 1800), until the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., would be ready.[5]\\r\\nPierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant was given the task of creating the city plan for the new capital city.[6] L'Enfant chose Jenkin's Hill as the site for the \\"Congress House\\", with a \\"grand avenue\\" (now Pennsylvania Avenue, NW) connecting it with the President's House, and a public space containing a broader \\"grand avenue\\" (now the National Mall) stretching westward to the Potomac River (see: L'Enfant Plan).[7][8]\\r\\nIn reviewing L'Enfant's plan, Thomas Jefferson insisted the legislative building be called the \\"Capitol\\" rather than \\"Congress House\\".[7] The word \\"Capitol\\" comes from Latin and is associated with the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on Capitoline Hill, one of the seven hills of Rome.[9][10] The connection between the two is not, however, crystal clear.[11] In addition to coming up with a city plan, L'Enfant had been tasked with designing the Capitol and President's House; however, he was dismissed in February 1792 over disagreements with President George Washington and the commissioners, and there were no plans at that point for the Capitol.[12]\\r\\nIn spring 1792, United States Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson proposed a design competition to solicit designs for the Capitol and the \\"President's House\\", and set a four-month deadline. The prize for the competition was $500 and a lot in the Federal City. At least ten individuals submitted designs for the Capitol; however the drawings were regarded as crude and amateurish, reflecting the level of architectural skill present in the United States at the time.[13] The most promising of the submissions was by Stephen Hallet, a trained French architect.[14] However, Hallet's designs were overly fancy, with too much French influence, and were deemed too costly.[15]\\r\\nA late entry by amateur architect William Thornton was submitted on January 31, 1793, to much praise for its \\"Grandeur, Simplicity, and Beauty\\" by Washington, along with praise from Thomas Jefferson. Thornton was inspired by the east front of the Louvre, as well as the Paris Pantheon for the center portion of the design.[16][17] Thornton's design was officially approved in a letter dated April 5, 1793, from Washington, and Thornton served as the first Architect of the Capitol (and later first Superintendent of the United States Patent Office).[18] In an effort to console Hallet, the commissioners appointed him to review Thornton's plans, develop cost estimates, and serve as superintendent of construction. Hallet proceeded to pick apart and make drastic changes to Thornton's design, which he saw as costly to build and problematic.[19] In July 1793, Jefferson convened a five-member commission, bringing Hallet and Thornton together, along with James Hoban (winning architect of the \\"President's Palace\\") to address problems with and revise Thornton's plan. Hallet suggested changes to the floor plan, which could be fitted within the exterior design by Thornton.[20][21] The revised plan was accepted, except that Secretary Jefferson and President Washington insisted on an open recess in the center of the East front, which was part of Thornton's original plan.[22]\\r\\nThe original design by Thornton was later modified by the famous British-American architects Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Sr., and then Charles Bulfinch.[23] The current cast-iron dome and the House's new southern extension and Senate new northern wing were designed by Thomas U. Walter and August Schoenborn, a German immigrant, in the 1850s,[24] and were completed under the supervision of Edward Clark.[25]\\r\\nL'Enfant secured the lease of quarries at Wigginton Island and along Aquia Creek in Virginia for use in the foundations and outer walls of the Capitol in November 1791.[26] Surveying was under way soon after the Jefferson conference plan for the Capitol was accepted.[20] On September 18, 1793, President George Washington, along with eight other Freemasons dressed in masonic regalia, laid the cornerstone, which was made by silversmith Caleb Bentley.[27][28]\\r\\nConstruction proceeded with Hallet working under supervision of James Hoban, who was also busy working on construction of the \\"President's House\\" (also later known as the \\"Executive Mansion\\"). Despite the wishes of Jefferson and the President, Hallet went ahead anyway and modified Thornton's design for the East Front and created a square central court that projected from the center, with flanking wings which would house the legislative bodies. Hallet was dismissed by Secretary Jefferson on November 15, 1794.[29] George Hadfield was hired on October 15, 1795, as Superintendent of Construction, but resigned three years later in May 1798, because of his dissatisfaction with Thornton's plan and quality of work done thus far.[30]\\r\\nThe Senate (north) wing was completed in 1800. The Senate and House shared quarters in the north wing until a temporary wooden pavilion was erected on the future site of the House wing which served for a few years for the Representatives to meet in, until the House of Representatives (south) wing was finally completed in 1811, with a covered wooden temporary walkway connecting the two wings with the Congressional chambers where the future center section with rotunda and dome would eventually be. However, the House of Representatives moved early into their House wing in 1807. Though the Senate wing building was incomplete, the Capitol held its first session of the United States Congress with both chambers in session on November 17, 1800. The National Legislature was moved to Washington prematurely, at the urging of President John Adams, in hopes of securing enough Southern votes in the Electoral College to be re-elected for a second term as President.[31]\\r\\nFor several decades, beginning when the federal government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, the Capitol building was used for Sunday religious services as well as for governmental functions. The first services were conducted in the \\"hall\\" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the \\"Oven\\", which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Then, from 1807 to 1857, they were held in the then-House Chamber (now called Statuary Hall). When held in the House chamber, the Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. According to the U.S. Library of Congress exhibit Religion and the Founding of the American Republic:\\r\\nIt is no exaggeration to say that on Sundays in Washington during the administrations of Thomas Jefferson (1801ÿ1809) and of James Madison (1809ÿ1817) the state became the church. Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the chamber of the House of Representatives. Madison followed Jefferson's example, although unlike Jefferson, who rode on horseback to church in the Capitol, Madison came in a coach and four. Worship services in the Housea practice that continued until after the Civil Warwere acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary. Preachers of every Protestant denomination appeared. (Catholic priests began officiating in 1826.) As early as January 1806 a female evangelist, Dorothy Ripley, delivered a camp meeting-style exhortation in the House to Jefferson, Vice President Aaron Burr, and a \\"crowded audience\\".[32]\\r\\nNot long after the completion of both wings, the Capitol was partially burned by the British on August 24, 1814, during the War of 1812. George Bomford and Joseph Gardner Swift, both military engineers, were called upon to help rebuild the Capitol. Reconstruction began in 1815 and included redesigned chambers for both Senate and House wings (now sides), which were completed by 1819. During the reconstruction, Congress met in the Old Brick Capitol, a temporary structure financed by local investors. Construction continued through to 1826, with the addition of the center section with front steps and columned portico and an interior Rotunda, rising above the first low dome of the Capitol. Latrobe is principally connected with the original construction and many innovative interior features; his successor, Bulfinch, also played a major role, such as the design of the first low dome covered in copper.\\r\\nBy 1850, it became clear that the Capitol could not accommodate the growing number of legislators arriving from newly admitted states. A new design competition was held, and President Millard Fillmore appointed Philadelphia architect Thomas U. Walter to carry out the expansion. Two new wings were added ÿ a new chamber for the House of Representatives on the south side, and a new chamber for the Senate on the north.[33]\\r\\nWhen the Capitol was expanded in the 1850s, some of the construction labor was carried out by slaves \\"who cut the logs, laid the stones and baked the bricks\\".[34] The original plan was to use workers brought in from Europe; however, there was a poor response to recruitment efforts, and African Americans, some free and some enslaved, composed the majority of the work force.[35]\\r\\nThe 1850 expansion more than doubled the length of the Capitol, dwarfing the original, timber-framed, copper-sheeted, low dome of 1818, designed by Charles Bulfinch and no longer in proportion with the increased size of the building. In 1855, the decision was made to tear it down and replace it with the \\"wedding-cake style\\" cast-iron dome that stands today. Also designed by Thomas U. Walter, the new dome would stand three times the height of the original dome and 100 feet (30?m) in diameter, yet had to be supported on the existing masonry piers. Like Mansart's dome at \\"Les Invalides\\" (which he had visited in 1838), Walter's dome is double, with a large oculus in the inner dome, through which is seen \\"The Apotheosis of Washington\\" painted on a shell suspended from the supporting ribs, which also support the visible exterior structure and the tholos that supports The \\"Statue of Freedom\\", a colossal statue that was raised to the top of the dome in 1863. This statue was cast by a slave named Philip Reid. The weight of the cast iron for the dome has been published as 8,909,200 pounds (4,041,100?kg).[36]\\r\\nWhen the Capitol's new dome was finally completed, its massive visual weight, in turn, overpowered the proportions of the columns of the East Portico, built in 1828. The East Front of the Capitol building was rebuilt in 1904, following a design of the architects Carrre and Hastings, who also designed the Russell Senate and Cannon House office buildings.\\r\\nThe next major expansion to the Capitol started in 1958, with a 33.5 feet (10.2?m) extension of the East Portico.[citation needed] During this project, in 1960 the dome underwent a restoration.[37] A marble duplicate of the sandstone East Front was built 33.5 feet (10.2?m) from the old Front. (In 1962, a connecting extension incorporated what had been an outside wall as an inside wall.) In the process, the Corinthian columns were removed. It was not until 1984 that landscape designer Russell Page created a suitable setting for them in a large meadow at the U.S. National Arboretum in northeast Washington as the National Capitol Columns, where they are combined with a reflecting pool in an ensemble that reminds some visitors of the ruins of Persepolis, in Persia. Besides the columns, hundreds of blocks of the original stone were removed and are stored behind a National Park Service maintenance yard in Rock Creek Park.[38][39]\\r\\nOn December 19, 1960, the Capitol was declared a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service.[40] The building was ranked #6 in a 2007 survey conducted for the American Institute of Architects' \\"America's Favorite Architecture\\" list.[41] The Capitol draws heavily from other notable buildings, especially churches and landmarks in Europe, including the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican and St. Paul's Cathedral in London.[42] On the roofs of the Senate and House Chambers are flagpoles that fly the U.S. flag when either is in session. On September 18, 1993, to commemorate the Capitol's bicentennial, the Masonic ritual cornerstone laying with George Washington was reenacted. U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond was one of the Freemason politicians who took part in the ceremony.\\r\\nOn June 20, 2000, ground was broken for the Capitol Visitor Center, which opened on December 2, 2008.[43] From 2001 through 2008, the East Front of the Capitol (site of most presidential inaugurations until Ronald Reagan began a new tradition in 1981) was the site of construction for this massive underground complex, designed to facilitate a more orderly entrance for visitors to the Capitol. Prior to the center being built, visitors to the Capitol had to line up in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building or the Russell Senate Office Building. The new underground facility provides a grand entrance hall, a visitors theater, room for exhibits, and dining and restroom facilities, in addition to space for building necessities such as an underground service tunnel.\\r\\nA large-scale Capitol dome restoration project, the first extensive such work since 1959ÿ1960, began in 2014, with completion scheduled before the 2017 presidential inauguration.[44] As of 2012, $20 million in work around the skirt of the dome had been completed, but other deterioration, including at least 1,300 cracks in the brittle iron that have led to rusting and seepage inside, needed to be addressed. Before the August 2012 recess, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to spend $61 million to repair the exterior of the dome. The House wanted to spend less on government operations,[37] but in late 2013, it was announced that renovations would take place over two years, starting in spring 2014.[45] Extensive scaffolding was erected in 2014, enclosing and obscuring the dome.[44] All exterior scaffolding was removed by mid-September 2016.[46]\\r\\nWith the increased use of technologies such as the internet, a bid tendering process was approved in 2001/2002 for a contract to install a wireless communication network within the Capitol Building and annexes, followed by the new Capitol Visitor Center. The winning bidder was an Israeli company called Foxcom which has since changed it\`s name and been acquired by Corning Incorporated.[47][48]\\r\\nThe Capitol building is marked by its central dome above a rotunda in the central section of the structure (which also includes, the older original smaller center flanked by the two original (designed 1793, occupied 1800) smaller two wings (inner north) and inner south) containing the two original smaller meeting chambers for the Senate and the House of Representatives (between 1800 and late 1850s) and then flanked by two further extended (newer) wings, one also for each chamber of the larger, more populous Congress: the new north wing is the Senate chamber and the new south wing is the House of Representatives chamber. Above these newer chambers are galleries where visitors can watch the Senate and House of Representatives. It is an example of the neoclassical architecture style.\\r\\nUnderground tunnels and internal subways connect the Capitol building with the Congressional office buildings in the Capitol Complex. All rooms in the Capitol are designated as either S (for Senate) or H (for House), depending on whether they are in the Senate or House wing of the Capitol.\\r\\nThe Capitol has a long history in art of the United States, beginning in 1856 with Italian/Greek American artist Constantino Brumidi and his murals in the hallways of the first floor of the Senate side of the Capitol. The murals, known as the Brumidi Corridors,[49] reflect great moments and people in United States history. Among the original works are those depicting Benjamin Franklin, John Fitch, Robert Fulton, and events such as the Cession of Louisiana. Also decorating the walls are animals, insects and natural flora indigenous to the United States. Brumidi's design left many spaces open so that future events in United States history could be added. Among those added are the Spirit of St. Louis, the Moon landing, and the Space Shuttle Challenger shuttle crew.\\r\\nBrumidi also worked within the Rotunda. He is responsible for the painting of The Apotheosis of Washington beneath the top of the dome, and also the famous Frieze of American History.[50] The Apotheosis of Washington was completed in 11 months and painted by Brumidi while suspended nearly 180 feet (55?m) in the air. It is said to be the first attempt by the United States to deify a founding father. Washington is depicted surrounded by 13 maidens in an inner ring with many Greek and Roman gods and goddesses below him in a second ring. The frieze is located around the inside of the base of the dome and is a chronological, pictorial history of the United States from the landing of Christopher Columbus to the Wright Brothers's flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The frieze was started in 1878 and was not completed until 1953. The frieze was therefore painted by four different artists: Brumidi, Filippo Costaggini, Charles Ayer Whipple, and Allyn Cox. The final scenes depicted in the fresco had not yet occurred when Brumidi began his Frieze of the United States History.\\r\\nWithin the Rotunda there are eight large paintings about the development of the United States as a nation. On the east side are four paintings depicting major events in the discovery of America. On the west are four paintings depicting the founding of the United States. The east side paintings include The Baptism of Pocahontas by John Gadsby Chapman, The Embarkation of the Pilgrims by Robert Walter Weir, The Discovery of the Mississippi by William Henry Powell, and The Landing of Columbus by John Vanderlyn. The paintings on the west side are by John Trumbull: Declaration of Independence, Surrender of General Burgoyne, Surrender of Lord Cornwallis, and General George Washington Resigning His Commission. Trumbull was a contemporary of the United States' founding fathers and a participant in the American Revolutionary War; he painted a self-portrait into Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.\\r\\nFirst Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln hangs over the west staircase in the Senate wing.[51]\\r\\nThe Capitol also houses the National Statuary Hall Collection, comprising two statues donated by each of the fifty states to honor persons notable in their histories. One of the most notable statues in the National Statuary Hall is a bronze statue of King Kamehameha donated by the state of Hawaii upon its accession to the union in 1959. The statue's extraordinary weight of 15,000 pounds (6,800?kg) raised concerns that it might come crashing through the floor, so it was moved to Emancipation Hall of the new Capitol Visitor Center. The 100th, and last statue for the collection, that of Po'pay from the state of New Mexico, was added on September 22, 2005. It was the first statue moved into the Emancipation Hall.\\r\\nOn the ground floor is an area known as the Crypt. It was intended to be the burial place of George Washington, with a ringed balustrade at the center of the Rotunda above looking down to his tomb. However, under the stipulations of his last will, Washington was buried at Mount Vernon. The Crypt houses exhibits on the history of the Capitol. A compass star inlaid in the floor marks the point at which Washington, D.C. is divided into its four quadrants and is the basis for how addresses in Washington, D.C., are designated (NE, NW, SE, or SW). However, due to the retrocession of the Virginia portions of the District, the geographic center of the city lies near the White House.\\r\\nWithin the Crypt is Gutzon Borglum's massive Abraham Lincoln Bust. The sculptor had a fascination with large-scale art and themes of heroic nationalism, and carved the piece from a six-ton block of marble. Borglum carved the bust in 1908, and it was donated to the Congress by Eugene Meyer, Jr., and accepted by the Joint Committee on the Library, in the same year. The pedestal was specially designed by the sculptor and installed in 1911. The bust and pedestal were on display in the Rotunda for many years until 1979 when, after a rearrangement of all sculpture in the Rotunda, they were placed in the Crypt.[52] Borglum was a patriot; believing that the \\"monuments we have built are not our own,\\" he looked to create art that was \\"American, drawn from American sources, memorializing American achievement\\", according to a 1908 interview article. Borglum's depiction of Lincoln was so accurate, that Robert Todd Lincoln, the president's son, praised the bust as \\"the most extraordinarily good portrait of my father I have ever seen.\\"[52] Supposedly, according to legend, the marble head remains unfinished (missing a left ear) to symbolize Lincoln's unfinished life.\\r\\nAt one end of the room near the Old Supreme Court Chamber is a statue of John C. Calhoun. On the right leg of the statue, a mark from a bullet fired during the 1998 shooting incident is clearly visible. The bullet also left a mark on the cape, located on the back right side of the statue.\\r\\nEleven presidents have lain in state in the Rotunda for public viewing, most recently Gerald Ford. The tomb meant for Washington stored the catafalque which is used to support coffins lying in state or honor in the Capitol. The catafalque is now on display in the Capitol Visitors Center for the general public to see when not in use.\\r\\nThe Hall of Columns is located on the House side of the Capitol, home to twenty-eight fluted columns and statues from the National Statuary Hall Collection. In the basement of the Capitol building in a utility room are two marble bathtubs, which are all that remain of the once elaborate Senate baths. These baths were a spa-like facility designed for members of Congress and their guests before many buildings in the city had modern plumbing. The facilities included several bathtubs, a barbershop, and a massage parlor.\\r\\nA steep, metal staircase, totaling 365 steps, leads from the basement to an outdoor walkway on top of the Capitol's dome.[53] The number of steps represents each day of the year.[54] Also in the basement, the weekly Jummah prayer is held on Fridays by Muslim staffers.[55]\\r\\nContrary to a popular myth, D.C. building height laws have never referred to the height of the Capitol building, which rises to 289 feet (88?m).[56] Indeed, the Capitol is only the fifth-tallest structure in Washington.\\r\\nThe House of Representatives Chamber has 448 permanent seats. Unlike Senators, Representatives do not have assigned seats.[57] The chamber is large enough to accommodate members of all three branches of the federal government and invited guests for joint sessions of Congress such as the State of the Union speech and other events. It is adorned with relief portraits of famous lawmakers and lawgivers throughout history. The United States national motto \\"In God We Trust\\" is written over the tribune below the clock and above the United States flag. Of the twenty-three relief portraits only Moses is sculpted from a full front view and is located across from the dais where the Speaker of the House ceremonially sits.\\r\\nIn order clockwise around the chamber:\\r\\nThere is also a quote etched in the marble of the chamber, as stated by venerable statesman Daniel Webster: \\"Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be remembered.\\"[59]\\r\\nFrom 1800 to 1806, this room served as the Senate Chamber and from 1806 until 1860, the room was used as the Supreme Court Chamber. In 1860, the Supreme Court began using the newly vacated Old Senate Chamber. Since 1935, the Supreme Court has met in the United States Supreme Court Building.\\r\\nThe current Senate Chamber opened in 1859[60] and is adorned with white marble busts of the former Presidents of the Senate (Vice Presidents).[61]\\r\\nThe Capitol Grounds cover approximately 274 acres (1.11?km2), with the grounds proper consisting mostly of lawns, walkways, streets, drives, and planting areas. Several monumental sculptures used to be located on the east facade and lawn of the Capitol including The Rescue and George Washington. The current grounds were designed by noted American landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who planned the expansion and landscaping performed from 1874 to 1892. In 1875, as one of his first recommendations, Olmsted proposed the construction of the marble terraces on the north, west, and south sides of the building that exist today.\\r\\nOlmsted also designed the Summer House, the open-air brick building that sits just north of the Capitol. Three arches open into the hexagonal structure, which encloses a fountain and twenty-two brick chairs. A fourth wall holds a small window that looks onto an artificial grotto. Built between 1879 and 1881, the Summer House was intended to answer complaints that visitors to the Capitol had no place to sit and no place to obtain water for their horses and themselves. Modern drinking fountains have since replaced Olmsted's fountain for the latter purpose. Olmsted intended to build a second, matching Summer House on the southern side of the Capitol, but congressional objections led to the project's cancellation.\\r\\nUp to four U.S. flags can be seen flying over the Capitol. Two flagpoles are located at the base of the dome on the East and West sides. These flagpoles have flown the flag day and night since World War I. The other two flagpoles are above the North (Senate) and South (House of Representatives) wings of the building, and fly only when the chamber below is in session. The flag above the House of Representatives is raised and lowered by House pages. The flag above the United States Senate is raised and lowered by Senate Doorkeepers. To raise the flag, Doorkeepers access the roof of the Capitol from the Senate Sergeant at Arms's office. Several auxiliary flagpoles, to the west of the dome and not visible from the ground, are used to meet congressional requests for flags flown over the Capitol.[citation needed] Constituents pay for U.S. flags flown over the Capitol to commemorate a variety of events such as the death of a veteran family member.\\r\\nThe Capitol, as well as the grounds of Capitol Hill, have played host to major events, including presidential inaugurations held every four years. During an inauguration, the front of the Capitol is outfitted with a platform and a grand staircase. Annual events at the Capitol include Independence Day celebrations, and the National Memorial Day Concert.\\r\\nThe general public has paid respect to a number of individuals lying in state at the Capitol, including numerous former presidents, senators, and other officials. Other Americans lying in honor include Officers Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson, the two officers killed in the 1998 shooting incident. Chestnut was the first African American ever to lie in honor in the Capitol. The public also paid respect to Rosa Parks, an icon of the civil rights movement, at the Capitol in 2005. She was the first woman and second African American to lie in honor in the Capitol. In February 2018, the evangelical Rev. Billy Graham became the fourth private citizen to lie in honor in the Rotunda.[62]\\r\\nOn September 24, 2015, Pope Francis gave a joint address to Congress, the first Pope to do so.[63]\\r\\nOn January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the United States Capitol. When President Andrew Jackson was leaving the Capitol out of the East Portico after the funeral of South Carolina Representative Warren R. Davis, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed and deranged housepainter from England, either burst from a crowd or stepped out from hiding behind a column and aimed a pistol at Jackson which misfired. Lawrence then pulled out a second pistol which also misfired. It has since been postulated that the moisture from the humid weather of the day contributed to the double misfiring.[64] Lawrence was then restrained, with legend saying that Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane, prompting his aides to restrain him. Others present, including Davy Crockett, restrained and disarmed Lawrence.\\r\\nOn July 2, 1915, prior to the United States' entry into World War I, Eric Muenter (aka Frank Holt), a German professor who wanted to stop American support of the Allies of World War I, exploded a bomb in the reception room of the U.S. Senate. The next morning he tried to assassinate J. P. Morgan, Jr., son of the financier, at his home on Long Island, New York. In a letter to the Washington Evening Star published after the explosion, Muenter, writing under an assumed name, said he hoped that the detonation would \\"make enough noise to be heard above the voices that clamor for war.\\" J.P. Morgan's company served as Great Britain's principal U.S. purchasing agent for munitions and other war supplies.\\r\\nIn 1954, Puerto Rican nationalists opened fire on members of Congress from the visitors' gallery, injuring five representatives. On March 1, 1971, a bomb exploded on the ground floor of the Capitol, placed by the radical left domestic terrorist group, the Weather Underground. They placed the bomb as a demonstration against U.S. involvement in Laos. On November 7, 1983, a group called the Armed Resistance Unit claimed responsibility for a bomb that detonated in the lobby outside the office of Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd.[65] Six people associated with the John Brown Anti-Klan Committee were later found in contempt of court for refusing to testify about the bombing.[66] In 1990, three members of the Armed Resistance Unit were convicted of the bombing, which they claimed was in response to the invasion of Grenada.[67] On July 24, 1998, Russell Eugene Weston Jr. burst into the Capitol and opened fire, killing two Capitol Police officers. The Capitol is believed to have been the intended target of the hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11, 2001, before it crashed near Shanksville in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, after passengers tried to take over control of the plane from hijackers.[68][69]\\r\\nSince the September 11 attacks, the roads and grounds around the Capitol have undergone dramatic changes. The United States Capitol Police have also installed checkpoints to inspect vehicles at specific locations around Capitol Hill,[70][71] and have closed a section of one street indefinitely.[71] The level of screening employed varies. On the main east-west thoroughfares of Constitution and Independence Avenues, barricades are implanted in the roads that can be raised in the event of an emergency. Trucks larger than pickups are interdicted by the Capitol Police and are instructed to use other routes. On the checkpoints at the shorter cross streets, the barriers are typically kept in a permanent \\"emergency\\" position, and only vehicles with special permits are allowed to pass. All Capitol visitors are screened by a magnetometer, and all items that visitors may bring inside the building are screened by an x-ray device. In both chambers, gas masks are located underneath the chairs in each chamber for members to use in case of emergency.[citation needed] Structures ranging from scores of Jersey barriers to hundreds of ornamental bollards have been erected to obstruct the path of any vehicles that might stray from the designated roadways.[72]\\r\\nIn 2004 the capitol was briefly evacuated after a plane carrying the then governor of Kentucky strayed into restricted airspace over the district. A shooting incident occurred in March 2016. One female bystander was wounded by police but not seriously injured; a man pointing a gun was shot and arrested, in critical but stable condition.[73] The city police of Washington D.C. described the shooting incident as \\"isolated\\".[74]\\r\\nThe United States Capitol Visitor Center (CVC), located below the East Front of the Capitol and its plaza, between the Capitol building and 1st Street East, opened on December 2, 2008. The CVC provides a single security checkpoint for all visitors, including those with disabilities, and an expansion space[clarification needed] for the US Congress.[75][76] The complex contains 580,000 square feet (54,000?m2) of space below ground on three floors,[77] and offers visitors a food court, restrooms, and educational exhibits, including an 11-foot scale model of the Capitol dome.[78] It also features skylights affording views of the actual dome. Long in the planning stages, construction began in the fall of 2001, following the killing of two Capitol police officers in 1998. The estimated final cost of constructing the CVC was $621 million.[79]","input":"What is the capitol building in washington dc?"},{"output":"24 hours","context":"Ertapenem is a carbapenem antibiotic marketed by Merck as Invanz. It is structurally very similar to meropenem in that it possesses a 1--methyl group. Other members of the carbapenem group (imipenem, doripenem, and meropenem) are broadly active antibacterials that are used for infections caused by difficult to treat or multidrug-resistant bacteria (such as ESBL expressing Klebsiella pneumonia). They have very short serum half-lives and must be administered by intravenous infusion every 6 to 8 hours. Ertapenem differs from other carbapenems in having a somewhat less broad spectrum of activity (not against Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and in that its extended serum half-life allows it to be administered once every 24 hours.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nErtapenem has been designed to be effective against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It is not active against MRSA, ampicillin-resistant enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Acinetobacter species. Ertapenem also has clinically useful activity against anaerobic bacteria.\\r\\nErtapenem has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following micro-organisms in vitro and in clinical infections.\\r\\nAerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pyogenes,\\r\\nNote: Methicillin-resistant staphylococci and Enterococcus spp. are resistant to ertapenem.\\r\\nAerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms:\\r\\nEscherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Proteus mirabilis,\\r\\nAnaerobic microorganisms:\\r\\nBacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis, Clostridium clostridioforme, Eubacterium lentum, Peptostreptococcus species, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Prevotella bivia,\\r\\nErtapenem is marketed by Merck as a first-line treatment for community-acquired infections. It should not be used as empirical treatment for hospital-acquired infections because of its lack of activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In practice, it is reserved primarily for use against Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and high level AmpC-producing Gram-negative bacteria.\\r\\nErtapenem is dosed as 1 g given by intravenous injection over 30 minutes, or 1 g diluted with 3.2 ml of 1% lidocaine given intramuscularly. There is no oral preparation of ertapenem available. Ertapenem cannot be mixed with glucose.\\r\\nThe marketing slogan for ertapenem is \\"The Power of One\\", because the dose is one gram, once a day.\\r\\nUnlike imipenem and meropenem, ertapenem is highly protein-bound, which results in a longer half-life (4 hours).[2]\\r\\nErtapenem is excreted primarily (80%) by the kidneys. Metabolism by the liver is not clinically important and does not affect dosing.\\r\\nPatients on haemodialysis should be given ertapenem at least 6 hours before dialysis. If it is given less than six hours before dialysis, the patient should be given an additional dose of 150?mg IV after dialysis. Ideally, patients on haemodialysis should be given ertapenem immediately following dialysis.\\r\\nAcquired resistance to ertapenem is usually mediated by up-regulation of efflux mechanisms and by the selection of porin-deficient mutants. Organisms that produce a metallo--lactamase are innately immune to ertapenem (as well as all carbapenems).[citation needed]\\r\\nThere are a few adverse effects of ertapenem like confusion and headache, which may worsen to convulsions and seizures. The only absolute contra-indication is a previous anaphylactic reaction to ertapenem or other -lactam antibiotic. There are no studies done in pregnant women, so the manufacturers cannot comment on its safety in pregnancy. In 2006, Ertapenem became approved for pediatric use in certain infections. Ertapenem is not recommended for children under 3 months of age and children with meningitis.\\r\\nAs with many antibiotics, Clostridium difficile colitis has been associated with its use.","input":"How long does invanz stay in your system?"},{"output":"a pluton, a type of igneous intrusion","context":"Stone Mountain is a quartz monzonite dome monadnock and the site of Stone Mountain Park near Stone Mountain, Georgia. At its summit, the elevation is 1,686 feet (514?m) MSL and 825 feet (251?m) above the surrounding area. Stone Mountain is well known for not only its geology, but also the enormous rock relief on its north face, the largest bas-relief in the world.[1] The carving depicts three Confederate figures, Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, and has been the subject of widespread controversy.[2]\\r\\nStone Mountain was once owned by the Venable Brothers and was the site of the founding of the second Ku Klux Klan in 1915. It was purchased by the State of Georgia in 1958[3] \\"as a memorial to the Confederacy.\\"[4] Stone Mountain Park officially opened on April 14, 1965  100 years to the day after Lincoln's assassination.[5] It is the most visited destination in the state of Georgia.[4]\\r\\nStone Mountain is more than 5 miles (8?km) in circumference at its base. The summit of the mountain can be reached by a walk-up trail on the west side of the mountain or by the Skyride aerial tram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStone Mountain is a pluton, a type of igneous intrusion. Primarily composed of quartz monzonite, the dome of Stone Mountain was formed during the formation of the Blue Ridge Mountains around 300ÿ350 million years ago (during the Carboniferous period), part of the Appalachian Mountains.[6] It formed as a result of the upwelling of magma from within the Earth's crust. This magma solidified to form granite within the crust five to ten miles below the surface.\\r\\nThe Stone Mountain pluton continues underground 9 miles (14?km) at its longest point into Gwinnett County. Numerous reference books and Georgia literature have dubbed Stone Mountain as the largest exposed piece of granite in the world\\".[7] This misconception is most likely a result of misrepresentation by granite companies and early park administration. Stone Mountain, though often called a pink granite dome, actually ranges in composition from quartz monzonite[8] to granite and granodiorite.[9]\\r\\nThe minerals within the rock include quartz, plagioclase feldspar, microcline and muscovite, with smaller amounts of biotite and tourmaline. The tourmaline is mostly black in color, and the majority of it exists as optically continuous skeletal[10] crystals, but much larger, euhedral pegmatitic tourmaline crystals can also be found in the mountain's numerous, cross-cutting felsic dikes. Embedded in the granite are xenoliths or pieces of foreign rocks entrained in the magma.\\r\\nThe granite intruded into the metamorphic rocks of the Piedmont region during the last stages of the Alleghenian Orogeny, which was the time when North America and North Africa collided. Over time, erosion eventually exposed the present mountain of more resistant igneous rock. This intrusion of granite also gave rise to Panola Mountain and Arabia Mountain, both in DeKalb County, smaller outcroppings farther south of Stone Mountain.\\r\\nThe top of the mountain is a landscape of bare rock and rock pools, and it provides views of the surrounding area including the skyline of downtown Atlanta, often Kennesaw Mountain, and on very clear days even the Appalachian Mountains. On some days, the top of the mountain is shrouded in a heavy fog, and visibility may be limited to only a few feet. The clear freshwater pools on the summit form by rainwater gathering in eroded depressions, and are home to unusual clam shrimp and fairy shrimp. The tiny shrimp appear only during the rainy season. Through the process of cryptobiosis, the tiny shrimp eggs (or cysts) can remain dormant for years in the dried out depressions, awaiting favorable conditions.\\r\\nThe mountain's lower slopes are wooded. The rare Georgia oak was first discovered at the summit, and several specimens can easily be found along the walk-up trail and in the woods around the base of the mountain. In the fall, the extremely rare Confederate yellow daisy (Helianthus porteri) flowers appear on the mountain, growing in rock crevices and in the large wooded areas.\\r\\nThe largest bas-relief sculpture in the world, the Confederate Memorial Carving depicts three Confederate leaders of the Civil War: President Jefferson Davis and Generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson (and their favorite horses, \\"Blackjack\\", \\"Traveller\\", and \\"Little Sorrel\\", respectively). The entire carved surface measures 1.57 acres (6,400?m2). The carving of the three men towers 400 feet (120?m) above the ground, measures 76 by 158 feet (23 by 48?m), and is recessed 42 feet (13?m) into the mountain. The deepest point of the carving is at Lee's right elbow, which is 12 feet (3.7?m) to the mountain's surface.[11]\\r\\nThe carving was conceived by Mrs. C. Helen Plane,[12] a charter member of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC). The Venable Brothers, owners of the mountain, deeded the north face of the mountain to the UDC in 1916. The UDC was given 12 years to complete a sizable Civil War monument. Gutzon Borglum was commissioned to do the carving. Borglum abandoned the project in 1925 (and later went on to begin Mount Rushmore). The US Mint issued a 1925 Commemorative silver US half dollar, bearing the words \\"Stone Mountain\\", as part of a fundraiser for the monument.[13] American sculptor Augustus Lukeman continued until 1928, when further work stopped for thirty years. In 1941 segregationist Governor Eugene Talmadge formed the Stone Mountain Memorial Association (SMMA) to continue work on the memorial, but the project was delayed once again by the U.S. entry into World War II (1941ÿ45).[14]\\r\\nIn response to Brown v. Board of Education of 1954, and the birth of the Civil Rights Movement, in 1958, at the urging of segregationist Governor Marvin Griffin,[5]:21 the Georgia legislature approved a measure to purchase Stone Mountain at a price of $1,125,000. In 1963, Walker Hancock was selected to complete the carving, and work began in 1964. The carving was completed by Roy Faulkner, who later operated the Stone Mountain Carving Museum (now closed) on nearby Memorial Drive commemorating the carving's history.[15] The carving was completed on March 3, 1972.[16] An extensive archival collection related to the project is now at Emory University, with the bulk of the materials dating from 1915 to 1930; the finding aid provides a history of the project, and an index of the papers contained in the collection.[12]\\r\\nStone Mountain Park officially opened on April 14, 1965  100 years to the day after Lincoln's assassination.[5] Four flags of the Confederacy are flown.[17] The Stone Mountain Memorial Lawn \\"contains...thirteen terraces  one for each Confederate state.... Each terrace flies the flag that the state flew as member of the Confederacy.\\"[18]\\r\\nThe revival of the Ku Klux Klan was emboldened by the release of D. W. Griffith's Klan-glorifying film The Birth of a Nation (1915).[19] It was followed in August by the highly publicized lynching of Leo Frank in nearby Marietta, Georgia. On November 25 of the same year, Thanksgiving Day, a small group, including fifteen robed and hooded \\"charter members\\" of the new organization, met at the summit of Stone Mountain to create a new iteration of the Klan. They were led by William J. Simmons, and included two elderly members of the original Klan. As part of their ceremony, they set up on the summit an altar covered with a flag, opened a Bible, and burned a 16-foot cross.[5]:20[20]\\r\\nFundraising for the monument resumed in 1923. In October of that year, Venable granted the Klan easement with perpetual right to hold celebrations as they desired.[21] The influence of the UDC continued, in support of Mrs. Plane's vision of a carving explicitly for the purpose of creating a Confederate memorial. She suggested in a letter to the first sculptor, Gutzon Borglum:\\r\\nI feel it is due to the Klan[,] which saved us from Negro dominations [sic] and carpetbag rule, that it be immortalized on Stone Mountain. Why not represent a small group of them in their nightly uniform approaching in the distance?[5]:21[14]\\r\\nThe UDC established the Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial Association (SMCMA) for fundraising and on-site supervision of the project. Venable and Borglum, who were both closely associated with the Klan, arranged to pack the SMCMA with Klan members.[22] The SMCMA, along with the United Daughters of the Confederacy, continued fundraising efforts. Of the $250,000 raised, part came from the federal government, which in 1925 issued special fifty-cent coins with the soldiers Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson on them.[23] The image on the verso of the coin was based upon 'The Last Meeting of Lee and Jackson'[24] executed in 1869 by Everett B. D. Fabrino Julio (American, b. St. Helena 1843 ÿ 1879, emigrated to US 1860) itself an icon of 'Lost Cause' mythology, now in the American Civil War Museum (until 2012 the Museum of the Confederacy), Richmond VA. [25] When the state completed the purchase in 1960, it condemned the property to remove Venable's agreement to allow the Klan perpetual right to hold meetings on the premises.[22]\\r\\nAfter the Charleston church shooting in the summer of 2015, Stone Mountain was the subject of a political debate related to the removal of symbols of the Confederacy.[26] This controversy was stimulated by a movement in other states to remove the Confederate battle flag and statues of Confederate leaders from public areas.\\r\\nA proposal was made to remove the Confederate carving from Stone Mountain Park.[27] However, according to Georgia state law, no one is allowed to alter the figures carved upon the stone face. Any changes within the state park would require approval by the state legislature.[28]\\r\\nOn October 11, 2015, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the park is considering a proposal of a permanent \\"Freedom Bell\\" honoring Martin Luther King, Jr. and the line \\"Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia\\" as part of King's \\"I Have A Dream\\" speech of 1963.[29] The proposed monument is inspired by a bell-ringing ceremony held in 2013 honoring the 50th anniversary of King's speech. It is not supported by the NAACP or King-founded Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), who want the Confederate symbols removed.[30]\\r\\nIn August 2017, after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia - a white nationalist protest against the removal of a Confederate monument - turned violent, many people across the country again demanded the removal of many Confederate monuments and memorials as a part of a national political debate.[31][32][33] Georgia State Representative and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams called for the removal of Stone Mountain's carving.[34]\\r\\nHuman habitation of Stone Mountain and its surroundings date back into prehistory. When the mountain was first encountered by European explorers, its summit was encircled by a rock wall, similar to that still to be found on Georgia's Fort Mountain. The wall is believed to have been built by early Native American inhabitants of the area, although its purpose remains unclear. By the beginning of the 20th century, the wall had disappeared, the rocks having been taken away by early visitors as souvenirs, rolled down the rockface, or removed by the commercial quarrying operation. The mountain was as well the eastern end of the Campbellton Trail, a Native American path that ran through what is now the Atlanta area.\\r\\nEuropeans first learned of the mountain in 1567, when Spanish explorers were told of a mountain farther inland which was \\"very high, shining when the sun set like a fire.\\"[further explanation needed] By this time, the Stone Mountain area was inhabited by the Creek and (to a lesser extent) Cherokee peoples.\\r\\nIn the early 19th century, the area was known as Rock Mountain. After the founding of DeKalb County and the county seat of Decatur in 1822, Stone Mountain was a natural recreation area; it was common for young couples on dates to ride to the mountain on horseback. The mountain is easy to climb and there has been a path since the nineteenth century.\\r\\nEntrepreneur Aaron Cloud built a 165 feet (50?m) wooden observation tower at the summit of the mountain in 1838, but it was destroyed by a storm and replaced by a much smaller tower in 1851. Visitors to the mountain would travel to the area by rail and road, and then walk up the 1.1-mile (1.8?km) mountaintop trail to the top, where Cloud also had a restaurant and club.\\r\\nGranite quarrying started at Stone Mountain in the 1830s, but became a major industry following the completion of a railroad spur to the quarry site in 1847. This line was rebuilt by the Georgia Railroad in 1869. Over the years, Stone Mountain granite was used in many buildings and structures, including the locks of the Panama Canal, the steps to the East Wing of the United States Capitol and the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. In recent years, granite suppliers in Georgia sent stone samples cut from Stone Mountain to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Foundation to be considered for use in a planned monument in King's honor; the Foundation later chose to use granite imported from China.[35] Unfortunately, quarrying during earlier periods also destroyed several spectacular geological features on Stone Mountain, such as the Devil's Crossroads, which was located on top of the mountain.\\r\\nIn 1887 Stone Mountain was purchased for $45,000 by the Venable Brothers of Atlanta, who quarried the mountain for 24 more years, and descendents of the Venable family would retain ownership of the mountain until it was purchased by the State of Georgia in the 1950s.\\r\\nMartin Luther King, Jr. mentioned the monument in his 1963 \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech in Washington, D.C., when he said \\"let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!\\"[36]\\r\\nDuring the 1996 Summer Olympics, Stone Mountain Park provided venues for Olympic events in tennis, archery and track cycling.[37][38] The venues for archery and cycling were temporary and are now part of the songbird and habitat trail.[39]\\r\\nSome of the outdoor scenes for the Netflix series Stranger Things were filmed in the park.[40]\\r\\nAccording to George Weiblen's annotated calendar for Monday, May 7, 1928: \\"Mail plane crashed on mountain at 8:00 P.M.\\"[citation needed] The pilot, Johnny S. Kytle (1905ÿ1931), not only survived the crash, but managed to grab the mail and walk down the mountain.\\r\\nAround dusk on September 16, 2003, in clear weather, a small airplane circled the mountain five times, then crashed headlong into the south side, burst into flames and killed the pilot. A witness testifying at the NTSB investigation stated that the pilot, a 69-year-old accountant, had threatened on multiple occasions to commit suicide by flying into the mountain. The official NTSB accident report lists the probable cause as \\"The pilot's intentional flight into the ground for the purpose of suicide while impaired by alcohol.\\"[41]\\r\\nStone Mountain Park, which surrounds the Confederate Memorial, is owned by the state of Georgia and managed by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, a Georgia state authority. The Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation currently has a long-term contract to operate park attractions while the Stone Mountain Memorial Association retains ownership and the right to reject any project deemed unfit.\\r\\nConfederate Hall, operated directly by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association or SMMA, is a museum that educates students and park guests on the geology and ecology of Stone Mountain as well as historical aspects of the area. A small theater shows a historical documentary about the Civil War in Georgia called \\"The Battle for Georgia\\".\\r\\nThe education department is host to thousands of students each school year, teaching the subjects of geology, ecology, and history. Classes are designed to meet the Georgia Performance Standards and the North American Association for Environmental Education guidelines.\\r\\nThe Antebellum Plantation and Farmyard is an open-air museum composed of 19 historic buildings, built between 1790 and 1875, which have been re-erected on the site to represent a pre-Civil War Georgia plantation. The historic houses have been furnished with an extensive collection of period furniture and decorations. The farm features a petting zoo.\\r\\nA 732-bell carillon that originated at the 1964 New York World's Fair provides a daily concert.\\r\\nA covered bridge, dating from 1892, which originally spanned the Oconee River in Athens, Georgia.[42]\\r\\nA grist mill, dating from 1869 and moved to the park in 1965.\\r\\nThe short broadcast tower on the top of the mountain transmits two non-commercial stations: television station WGTV TV 8, and weather radio station KEC80 on 162.55?MHz. FM radio station WABE FM 90.1 was located on this tower from 1984 until 2005, when it was required to relocate to accommodate WGTV's digital conversion.[citation needed] W266BW FM 101.1 now has a permit as well. Atop the tower also sits the W4BOC Amateur Radio repeater, which operates on a frequency of 146.760 mhz.\\r\\nThe tower is also used for the park's Project 25 two-way radio systems.[43][44]\\r\\nWalk Up Trail: A 1.3-mile (2.1?km) trail to the top of Stone Mountain ascending 786?ft (240?m) in elevation to a height of 1,686?ft (514?m). The trail is steep, but spectacular panoramic views and cool winds await hikers at the top.\\r\\nCherokee Trail: A 5-mile (8?km) National Recreation Trail, the Cherokee Trail loops around the mountain base, with a mile section going up and over the west side of the mountain (crosses Walk Up Trail). It passes primarily through an oak-hickory forest, but views of the lakes, streams, and mountain are common.[45]\\r\\nNature Garden Trail: A scenic 3?4 mile (1.2?km) loop trail through a mature oak-hickory forest community, it is excellent for viewing shade-loving native plants. A small garden with interpretive native plant signs is at the entrance to the trail.\\r\\nSongbird Habitat Trails: Comprising two loop trails each running 1 mile (1.6?km), the field trail is an excellent birding spot and the woodland trail provides shade and numerous native plants. Dogs are not allowed.\\r\\nThe Park features several attractions that are operated by Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation.\\r\\nOn summer evenings the mountain hosts the Stone Mountain Laser Show Spectacular, a fireworks and laser light display. The laser lightshow projects moving images of the Deep South as well as Georgia history onto the Confederate Memorial carving on the side of the mountain. During Memorial Day Weekend of 2011, Stone Mountain unveiled its overhaul of the laser show, dubbed Mountainvision. This incorporates digital projectors, lasers, special effects, and pyrotechnics.[46]\\r\\nThe Skyride, a Swiss-built cable car to the summit of the mountain, passes by the carving on the way up.\\r\\nThe Riverboat offered a scenic cruise aboard a reproduction of a Mississippi riverboat on 363-acre (147 ha) Stone Mountain Lake. It has been retired.\\r\\nThe Antebellum Plantation is a collection of historic buildings relocated from around the state of Georgia, including three plantation manor-houses dating from 1794, 1850, and 1845; two slave cabins; a barn; and other outbuildings. The Plantation Farmyard features historic breeds of sheep, goats, and pigs that guests can pet.\\r\\nCrossroads is a recreation of an 1872 southern town with several attractions that include a modern 4-D movie theater, an adventure mini-golf course, a duck tour ride, stores and restaurants. Craft demonstrators include glass blowing and candy-making. Among other attractions in this area:\\r\\nThe Great Barn is a children's activity area that features 65 interactive games, climbing structures, trampoline floors, slides and more.\\r\\nSky Hike is a family ropes adventure course.

The Internet in the United States in turn provided the foundation for the worldwide Internet of today. Internet access in the United States is largely provided by the private sector and is available in a variety of forms, using a variety of technologies, at a wide range of speeds and costs. In 2015, 97.5% of Americans were using the Internet, which ranks the U.S. 4th out of 211 countries in the world.[1] The United States ranks #1 in the world with 7,000 Internet Service Providers (ISPs) according to the CIA.[2]\\r\\nInternet top-level domain names specific to the U.S. include .us, .edu, .gov, .mil, .as (American Samoa), .gu (Guam), .mp (Northern Mariana Islands), .pr (Puerto Rico), and .vi (U.S. Virgin Islands). Many U.S.-based organizations and individuals also use generic top-level domains, such as .com, .net, .org, .name, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccess to the Internet can be divided into dial-up and broadband access. Around the start of the 21st century, most residential access was by dial-up, while access from businesses was usually by higher speed connections. In subsequent years dial-up declined in favor of broadband access. Both types of access generally use a modem, which converts digital data to analog for transmission over a particular analog network (ex. the telephone or cable networks).[4]\\r\\nDial-up access is a connection to the Internet through a phone line, creating a semi-permanent link to the Internet.[4] Operating on a single channel, it monopolizes the phone line and is the slowest method of accessing the Internet. Dial-up is often the only form of Internet access available in rural areas because it requires no infrastructure other than the already existing telephone network. Dial-up connections typically do not exceed a speed of 56 kbit/s, because they are primarily made via a 56k modem.[4] Since the mid 2000s, this technology became obsolete in most developed countries.\\r\\nBroadband access includes a wide range of speeds and technologies, all of which provide much faster access to the Internet than dial-up. The term \\"broadband\\" once had a technical meaning, but today it is more often a marketing buzzword that simply means \\"faster\\". Broadband connections are continuous or \\"always on\\" connections, without the need to dial and hangup, and do not monopolize phone lines.[4] Common types of broadband access include DSL (digital subscriber lines), cable Internet access, satellite Internet access, mobile broadband via cell phones and other mobile devices among many others. In 2015, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defined broadband as any connection with a download speed of at least 25 Mbit/s and an upload speed of at least 3 Mbit/s, though the definition has used a slower speed in the past.[5]\\r\\nThe percentage of the U.S. population using the Internet grew steadily through 2007, and declined slightly in 2008 and 2009. Growth resumed in 2010, and reached its highest level so far (81.0%) in 2012, the latest year for which data is available. 81.0% is slightly above the 2012 figure of 73% for all developed countries. Based on these figures the U.S. ranked 12th out of 206 countries in 2000, fell to 31st out of 209 by 2010, and was back up slightly to 28th out of 211 in 2012. In 2012 the U.S. figure of 81.0% was similar to those of France (83.0%), Belgium (82.0%), Australia (82.3%), Austria (81.0%), Slovakia (80%), Kuwait (79.2%), and Japan (79.1%). The figures for the top ten countries in 2012 ranged from 91.0% for Finland to 96.9% for the Falkland Islands.[6]\\r\\nInternet usage in the United States varies widely from state to state. For example, in the U.S. overall in 2011, 77.9% of the population used the Internet. But in that same year (2011), there was a large gap in usage between the top three states - Washington (80.0%), New Hampshire (79.8%) and Minnesota (79.0%) - and the bottom three states - Mississippi (59.0%), New Mexico (60.4%) and Arkansas (61.4%).[7]\\r\\nAccording to an April 2018 article in Motherboard, \\"In every single state, a portion of the population doesnt have access to broadband, and some have no access to the internet at all.\\"[8]\\r\\nFixed (wired) and wireless broadband penetration have grown steadily, reaching peaks of 28.0% and 89.8% respectively in 2012. These rates place the U.S. above the world average of 25.9% for fixed broadband in developed countries and well above the average of 62.8% for wireless broadband in OECD countries. Wireless broadband subscriptions in the U.S. are primarily mobile-cellular broadband. Because a single Internet subscription may be shared by many people and a single person may have more than one subscription, the penetration rate will not reflect the actual level of access to broadband Internet of the population and penetration rates larger than 100% are possible.\\r\\nA 2013 Pew study on home broadband adoption found that 70% of consumers have a high-speed broadband connection. About a third of consumers reported a \\"wireless\\" high-speed connection,[8] but the report authors suspect that many of these consumers have mistakenly reported wireless connections to a wired DSL or cable connection.[9] Another Pew Research Center survey, results of which were published on February 27, 2014, revealed 68% of American adults connect to the Internet with mobile devices like smartphones or tablet computers. The report also put Internet usage by American adults as high as 87%, while young adults aged between 18 and 29 were at 97%.[12]\\r\\nIn measurements made between April and June 2013 (Q2), the United States ranked 8th out of 55 countries with an average connection speed of 8.7 Mbit/s. This represents an increase from 14th out of 49 countries and 5.3 Mbit/s for January to March 2011 (Q1). The global average for Q2 2013 was 3.3 Mbit/s, up from 2.1 Mbit/s for Q1 2011. In Q2 2013 South Korea ranked first at 13.3 Mbit/s, followed by Japan at 12.0 Mbit/s, and Switzerland at 11.0 Mbit/s.[13][14][needs update]\\r\\nThe lack of competition and choice in some areas has led to debate as to the cause. Part of the problem may be due to the historical regulation of utilities such as phone lines as natural monopoly.[15] Local governments charge for rights-of-way to lay fiber.[15]\\r\\nIn 1998 the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act halted the expansion of direct taxation of the Internet that had begun in several states in the mid-1990s.[16] The law, however, did not affect sales taxes applied to online purchases which continue to be taxed at varying rates depending on the jurisdiction, in the same way that phone and mail orders are taxed.\\r\\nThe absence of direct taxation of the Internet does not mean that all transactions taking place online are free of tax, or even that the Internet is free of all tax. In fact, nearly all online transactions are subject to one form of tax or another. The Internet Tax Freedom Act merely prevents states from imposing their sales tax, or any other kind of gross receipts tax, on certain online services. For example, a state may impose an income or franchise tax on the net income earned by the provider of online services, while the same state would be precluded from imposing its sales tax on the gross receipts of that provider.\\r\\nAs a practical matter, there is a degree of net neutrality in the United States, in that telecommunications companies rarely offer different rates to broadband and dial-up Internet consumers based on content or service type. However, there are no clear legal restrictions against these practices. Internet access is categorized under U.S. law as an information service, and not a telecommunications service, and thus has not been subject to common carrier regulations.\\r\\nFive failed attempts have been made to pass network neutrality bills in Congress. Each of these bills sought to prohibit Internet service providers from using various variable pricing models based upon the user's Quality of Service level. Described as tiered service in the industry and as price discrimination by some economists, typical provisions in the bill state \\"[Broadband service providers may] only prioritize...based on the type of content, applications, or services and the level of service purchased by the user, without charge for such prioritization\\".[17]\\r\\nOn August 5, 2005, the FCC reclassified some services as information services rather than telecommunications services, and replaced common carrier requirements on them with a set of four less-restrictive net neutrality principles.[18] These principles, however, are not FCC rules, and therefore not enforceable requirements. Actually implementing the principles requires either official FCC rule-making or federal legislation.\\r\\nOn June 6, 2010, the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia in Comcast Corp. v. FCC ruled that the FCC lacks the authority as an information service, under the ancillary statutory authority of Title One of the Communications Act of 1934, to force Internet service providers to keep their networks open, while employing reasonable network management practices, to all forms of legal content.[19] On December 21, 2010, the FCC approved the FCC Open Internet Order banning cable television and telephone service providers from preventing access to competitors or certain web sites such as Netflix. The rules would not keep ISPs from charging more for faster access.[20]\\r\\nOn February 26, 2015, the FCC's Open Internet rules went into effect when the FCC designated the Internet as a telecommunications tool and applied to it new \\"rules of the road\\".\\r\\n\\"[Open Internet Rules are] designed to protect free expression and innovation on the Internet and promote investment in the nation's broadband networks. The Open Internet rules are grounded in the strongest possible legal foundation by relying on multiple sources of authority, including: Title II of the Communications Act and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. As part of this decision, the Commission also refrains (or \\"forbears\\") from enforcing provisions of Title II that are not relevant to modern broadband service. Together Title II and Section 706 support clear rules of the road, providing the certainty needed for innovators and investors, and the competitive choices and freedom demanded by consumers.\\r\\nThe new rules apply to both fixed and mobile broadband service. This approach recognizes advances in technology and the growing significance of mobile broadband Internet access in recent years. These rules will protect consumers no matter how they access the Internet, whether on a desktop computer or a mobile device.\\"[21]\\r\\nIn summary the new rules are as follows:\\r\\nOn December 14, 2017, the FCC voted to reverse the 2015 Title II classifications of ISPs[22]\\r\\nThe strong protections for freedom of speech and expression against federal, state, and local government censorship are rooted in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. These protections extend to the Internet and as a result very little government mandated technical filtering occurs in the U.S. Nevertheless, the Internet in the United States is highly regulated, supported by a complex set of legally binding and privately mediated mechanisms.[23]\\r\\nAfter a decade and half of ongoing contentious debate over content regulation, the country is still very far from reaching political consensus on the acceptable limits of free speech and the best means of protecting minors and policing illegal activity on the Internet. Gambling, cyber security, and dangers to children who frequent social networking sitesreal and perceivedare important ongoing debates. Significant public resistance to proposed content restriction policies have prevented the more extreme measures used in some other countries from taking hold in the U.S.[23]\\r\\nPublic dialogue, legislative debate, and judicial review have produced filtering strategies in the United States that are different from those found in most of the rest of the world. Many government-mandated attempts to regulate content have been barred on First Amendment grounds, often after lengthy legal battles.[24] However, the government has been able to exert pressure indirectly where it cannot directly censor. With the exception of child pornography, content restrictions tend to rely more on the removal of content than blocking; most often these controls rely upon the involvement of private parties, backed by state encouragement or the threat of legal action.[25] In contrast to much of the rest of the world, where ISPs are subject to state mandates, most content regulation in the United States occurs at the private or voluntary level.[23]\\r\\nThe broadband Internet access providers in the United States with more than one million subscribers at the end of Q4 2017 were:\\r\\nIn 2010 four of these companies ranked among the ten largest ISPs in the world in terms of subscribers: Comcast (4th), AT&T (5th), Time Warner (7th), and Verizon (8th).[45]\\r\\nWith the advent of the World Wide Web, the commercialization of the Internet, and its spread beyond use within the government and the research and education communities in the 1990s, Internet access became an important public policy and political issue.\\r\\nThe High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991 (HPCA), Pub.L. 102ÿ194, built on prior U.S. efforts toward developing a national networking infrastructure, starting with the ARPANET in the 1960s and the funding of the National Science Foundation Network (NSFnet) in the 1980s. It led to the development of the National Information Infrastructure and included funding for a series of projects under the titles National Research and Education Network (NREN) and High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative which spurred many significant technological developments, such as the Mosaic web browser,[46] and the creation of a high-speed fiber optic computer network.[47] The HPCA provided the framework for the transition of the Internet from a largely government sponsored network to the commercial Internet that followed.\\r\\nUniversal service is a program dating back to early in the 20th century with a goal to encourage/require the interconnection of telephone networks operated by different providers. Over time this grew into the more general goal of providing telephone service to everyone in the United States at a reasonable price. When Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 it provided for the creation of a Universal Service Fund to help meet the challenges and opportunities of the digital information age. The Universal Service Fund (USF) was established in 1997 by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to implement the goals of the Telecommunications Act.\\r\\nThe Telecommunications Act requires all telecommunications companies to make equitable and non-discriminatory contributions to the USF. Under the supervision of the FCC, the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), is responsible for allocating money from the central fund to four programs: High Cost, Low Income, Rural Health Care, and Schools and Libraries (E-rate). These programs are designed to:[48]\\r\\nTelecommunications companies may, but are not required to, charge their customers a fee to recover the costs of contributing to the Universal Service fund. Consumers may see this reflected in a line-item charge labeled Universal Service\\" on telecommunications bills. The amount of this charge, if any, and the method used to collect the fee from consumers is determined by the companies and is not mandated by the FCC.[48]\\r\\nIn October 2011 the FCC voted to phase out the USF's high-cost program that has been subsidizing voice telephone services in rural areas by shifting $4.5 billion a year in funding over several years to a new Connect America Fund focused on expanding broadband deployment.[49][50]\\r\\nMore formally known as the Schools and Libraries Program, the E-Rate is funded from the Universal Service Fund. The E-Rate provides discounts to K-12 schools and libraries in the United States to reduce the cost of installing and maintaining telecommunications services, Internet access, and internal connections. The discounts available range from 20% to 90% depending on the poverty level and urban/rural status of the communities where the schools and libraries are located.[51]\\r\\nThere has been a good deal of controversy surrounding the E-Rate, including legal challenges from states and telecommunications companies. The impact of the program is hard to measure, but at the beginning of 2005 over 100,000 schools had participated in the program. Annual requests for discounts are roughly three times the $2.25 billion that is available, so while all eligible schools and libraries receive some discounts, some do not receive all of the discounts to which they are entitled under the rules of the program.[52]\\r\\nSeventy-eight percent of rural community members have internet access. <http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/06/26/americans-internet-access-2000-2015/> Like the E-Rate, the Rural Health Care Program (RHC) is funded from the Universal Service Fund. It provides funding to eligible health care providers for telecommunications services, including broadband Internet access, necessary for the provision of health care. The goal of the program is to improve the quality of health care available to patients in rural communities by ensuring that eligible health care providers have access to affordable telecommunications services, most often to implement tele-health and tele-medicine services, typically a combination of video-conferencing infrastructure and high speed Internet access, to enable doctors and patients in rural hospitals to access specialists in distant cities.[53]\\r\\nOver $417 million has been allocated for the construction of 62 statewide or regional broadband telehealth networks in 42 states and three U.S. territories under the Rural Health Care Pilot Program.[54]\\r\\nThe Healthcare Connect Fund (HCF) is a new component of the Rural Health Care Program. The HCF will provide a 65 percent discount on eligible expenses related to broadband Internet connectivity to both individual rural health care providers (HCPs) and consortia, which can include non-rural HCPs (if the consortium has a majority of rural sites). Applications under the new program will be accepted starting in late summer 2013 witih funding beginning on January 1, 2014. Discounts for traditional telecommunications will continue to be available under the existing RHC Telecommunications Program.[53]\\r\\nThe Rural Utilities Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture oversees several programs designed to bring the benefits of broadband Internet access and advanced telecommunications services to under served areas in the U.S. and its territories:\\r\\nThe 2009 Stimulus Bill, as it is commonly termed, was enacted by the 111th United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009.

As a result, Internet penetration and, more specifically, broadband Internet penetration rates are now treated as key economic indicators. The United States is widely perceived as falling behind in both its rate of broadband Internet penetration and the speed of its broadband infrastructure.[61]\\r\\nFor all of these reasons, there were calls for the U.S. to develop, adopt, fund, and implement a National Broadband Plan, which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) did in March 2010,[62] after first soliciting public comments from April 2009 through February 2010.[63] The goals of the plan as described on Broadband.gov are:[64]","input":"How many internet service providers in the united states?"},{"output":"Robert Sumwalt","context":"Christopher A.

As of 2012[update], the movement has 120 members.[1]\\r\\nThe purpose of the organization has been enumerated as to ensure \\"the national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of non-aligned countries\\" in their \\"struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, and all forms of foreign aggression, occupation, domination, interference or hegemony as well as against great power and bloc politics,\\" by Fidel Castro in the Havana Declaration of 1979.[3] The countries of the Non-Aligned Movement represent nearly two-thirds of the United Nations' members and contain 55% of the world population. Membership is particularly concentrated in countries considered to be developing or part of the Third World.[4]\\r\\nAlthough many of the Non-Aligned Movement's members were actually quite closely aligned with one or another of the superpowers, the movement still maintained cohesion throughout the Cold War, even despite several conflicts between members which also threatened the movement. In the years since the Cold War's end, it has focused on developing multilateral ties and connections as well as unity among the developing nations of the world, especially those within the Global South.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe founding fathers of the Non-Aligned Movement were Josip Broz Tito of Socialist Yugoslavia, Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Sukarno of Indonesia, Gamal Abdul Nasser of Egypt and Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana. Their actions were known as 'The Initiative of Five'.\\r\\nThe Non-Aligned Movement as an organization was founded on the Brijuni islands in Yugoslavia in 1956, and was formalized by signing the Declaration of Brijuni on July 19th, 1956. The Declaration was signed by Yugoslavia's president, Josip Broz Tito, India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Egypt's second president, Gamal Abdel Nasser. One of the quotations within the Declaration is \\"Peace can not be achieved with separation, but the aspiration towards collective security in global terms and expansion of freedom, as well as terminating the domination of one country over another\\". The Movement advocates a middle course for states in the developing world between the Western and Eastern Blocs during the Cold War. The phrase itself was first used to represent the doctrine by Indian diplomat V. K. Krishna Menon in 1953, at the United Nations.[5][unreliable source?]\\r\\nBut it soon after became the name to refer to the participants of the Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries first held in 1961. The term \\"non-alignment\\" was established in 1953 at the United Nations. Nehru used the phrase in a 1954 speech in Colombo, Sri Lanka. In this speech, Nehru described the five pillars to be used as a guide for Sino-Indian relations called Panchsheel (five restraints), these principles would later serve as the basis of the Non-Aligned Movement. The five principles were:\\r\\nA significant milestone in the development of the Non-Aligned Movement was the 1955 Bandung Conference, a conference of Asian and African states hosted by Indonesian president Sukarno, who gave a significant contribution to promote this movement. Bringing together Sukarno, U Nu, Nasser, Nehru, Tito, Nkrumah and Menon with the likes of Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai, and Norodom Sihanouk, as well as U Thant and a young Indira Gandhi, the conference adopted a \\"declaration on promotion of world peace and cooperation\\", which included Nehru's five principles, and a collective pledge to remain neutral in the Cold War. Six years after Bandung, an initiative of Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito led to the first Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, which was held in September 1961 in Belgrade.[6] The term non-aligned movement appears first in the fifth conference in 1976, where participating countries are denoted as members of the movement.[7]\\r\\nAt the Lusaka Conference in September 1970, the member nations added as aims of the movement the peaceful resolution of disputes and the abstention from the big power military alliances and pacts. Another added aim was opposition to stationing of military bases in foreign countries.[8]\\r\\nSome members were involved in serious conflicts with other members (e.g. India and Pakistan, Iran and Iraq). The movement fractured from its own internal contradictions when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979. Although the Soviet allies supported the invasion, other members of the movement (particularly predominantly Muslim states) condemned it.\\r\\nBecause[original research?] the Non-Aligned Movement was formed as an attempt to thwart the Cold War,[8] it has struggled to find relevance since the Cold War ended. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, a founding member, its membership was suspended[9] in 1992 at the regular Ministerial Meeting of the Movement, held in New York during the regular yearly session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.[10][11] The successor states of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have expressed little interest in membership, though Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina have observer status. In 2004, Malta and Cyprus ceased to be members and joined the European Union. Belarus is the only member of the Movement in Europe. Azerbaijan and Fiji are the most recent entrants, joining in 2011. The applications of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Costa Rica were rejected in 1995 and 1998, respectively.[11]\\r\\nSince the end of the Cold War, the Non-Aligned Movement has been forced to redefine itself and reinvent its purpose in the current world system. A major question has been whether many of its foundational ideologies, principally national independence, territorial integrity, and the struggle against colonialism and imperialism, can be applied to contemporary issues. The movement has emphasised its principles of multilateralism, equality, and mutual non-aggression in attempting to become a stronger voice for the global South, and an instrument that can be utilised to promote the needs of member nations at the international level and strengthen their political leverage when negotiating with developed nations. In its efforts to advance Southern interests, the movement has stressed the importance of cooperation and unity amongst member states,[12] but as in the past, cohesion remains a problem since the size of the organisation and the divergence of agendas and allegiances present the ongoing potential for fragmentation. While agreement on basic principles has been smooth, taking definitive action vis--vis particular international issues has been rare, with the movement preferring to assert its criticism or support rather than pass hard-line resolutions.[13]\\r\\nThe movement continues to see a role for itself, as in its view, the world's poorest nations remain exploited and marginalised, no longer by opposing superpowers, but rather in a uni-polar world,[14] and it is Western hegemony and neo-colonialism that the movement has really re-aligned itself against. It opposes foreign occupation, interference in internal affairs and aggressive unilateral measures, but it has also shifted to focus on the socio-economic challenges facing member states, especially the inequalities manifested by globalization and the implications of neo-liberal policies. The Non-Aligned Movement has identified economic underdevelopment, poverty, and social injustices as growing threats to peace and security.[15]\\r\\nThe 16th NAM summit took place in Tehran, Iran, from 26 to 31 August 2012. According to Mehr News Agency, representatives from over 150 countries were scheduled to attend.[16] Attendance at the highest level includes 27 presidents, 2 kings and emirs, 7 prime ministers, 9 vice presidents, 2 parliament spokesmen and 5 special envoys.[17] At the summit, Iran took over from Egypt as Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement for the period 2012 to 2015.[18]\\r\\nThe movement stems from a desire not to be aligned within a geopolitical/military structure and therefore itself does not have a very strict organizational structure.[2] Some organizational basics were defined at the 1996 Cartagena Document on Methodology[19] The Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned States is \\"the highest decision making authority\\". The chairmanship rotates between countries and changes at every summit of heads of state or government to the country organizing the summit.[19]\\r\\nRequirements for membership of the Non-Aligned Movement coincide with the key beliefs of the United Nations. The current requirements are that the candidate country has displayed practices in accordance with the ten \\"Bandung principles\\" of 1955:[19]\\r\\nSecretaries General of the NAM had included such diverse figures as Suharto,[20] militaristic[21] anti-communist, and Nelson Mandela, a democratic socialist and famous anti-apartheid activist. Consisting of many governments with vastly different ideologies, the Non-Aligned Movement is unified by its declared commitment to world peace and security. At the seventh summit held in New Delhi in March 1983, the movement described itself as \\"history's biggest peace movement\\".[22] The movement places equal emphasis on disarmament. NAM's commitment to peace pre-dates its formal institutionalisation in 1961. The Brioni meeting between heads of governments of India, Egypt and Yugoslavia in 1956 recognized that there exists a vital link between struggle for peace and endeavours for disarmament.[22]\\r\\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, the NAM also sponsored campaigns for restructuring commercial relations between developed and developing nations, namely the New International Economic Order (NIEO), and its cultural offspring, the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO). The latter, on its own, sparked a Non-Aligned initiative on cooperation for communications, the Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool, created in 1975 and later converted into the NAM News Network in 2005.\\r\\nThe Non-Aligned Movement espouses policies and practices of cooperation, especially those that are multilateral and provide mutual benefit to all those involved. Many of the members of the Non-Aligned Movement are also members of the United Nations. Both organisations have a stated policy of peaceful cooperation, yet the successes the NAM has had with multilateral agreements tend to be ignored by the larger, western and developed nation dominated UN.[23] African concerns about apartheid were linked with Arab-Asian concerns about Palestine[23] and multilateral cooperation in these areas has enjoyed moderate success. The Non-Aligned Movement has played a major role in various ideological conflicts throughout its existence, including extreme opposition to apartheid governments and support of guerrilla movements in various locations, including Rhodesia and South Africa.[4]\\r\\nIn recent years the organization has criticized certain aspects of US foreign policy. The 2003 invasion of Iraq and the War on Terrorism, its attempts to stifle Iran and North Korea's nuclear plans, and its other actions have been denounced by some members of the Non-Aligned Movement as attempts to run roughshod over the sovereignty of smaller nations; at the most recent summit, Kim Yong-nam, the head of North Korea's parliament, stated that, \\"The United States is attempting to deprive other countries of even their legitimate right to peaceful nuclear activities.\\"[24]\\r\\nSince 1961, the organization has supported the discussion of the case of Puerto Rico's self-determination before the United Nations. A resolution on the matter was to be proposed on the XV Summit by the Hostosian National Independence Movement.[needs update][25]\\r\\nSince 1973, the group has supported the discussion of the case of Western Sahara's self-determination before the United Nations.[26] The movement reaffirmed in its last meeting (Sharm El Sheikh 2009) the support to the Self-determination of the Sahrawi people by choosing between any valid option, welcomed the direct conversations between the parties, and remembered the responsibility of the United Nations on the Sahrawi issue.[27]\\r\\nThe movement is publicly committed to the tenets of sustainable development and the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals, but it believes that the international community has not created conditions conducive to development and has infringed upon the right to sovereign development by each member state. Issues such as globalization, the debt burden, unfair trade practices, the decline in foreign aid, donor conditionality, and the lack of democracy in international financial decision-making are cited as factors inhibiting development.[28]\\r\\nThe movement has been outspoken in its criticism of current UN structures and power dynamics, stating that the organisation has been utilised by powerful states in ways that violate the movement's principles. It has made a number of recommendations that it says would strengthen the representation and power of \\"non-aligned\\" states. The proposed UN reforms are also aimed at improving the transparency and democracy of UN decision-making. The UN Security Council is the element it considers the most distorted, undemocratic, and in need of reshaping.[29]\\r\\nThe movement has collaborated with other organisations of the developing world?ÿ  primarily the Group of 77?ÿ  forming a number of joint committees and releasing statements and documents representing the shared interests of both groups. This dialogue and cooperation can be taken as an effort to increase the global awareness about the organisation and bolster its political clout.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe movement accepts the universality of human rights and social justice, but fiercely resists cultural homogenisation.[citation needed] In line with its views on sovereignty, the organisation appeals for the protection of cultural diversity, and the tolerance of the religious, socio-cultural, and historical particularities that define human rights in a specific region.[30][not in citation given]\\r\\nThe conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries, often referred to as Non-Aligned Movement Summit is the main meeting within the movement and are held every few years:[32]\\r\\nA variety of ministerial meetings are held between the summit meetings. Some are specialist, such as the meeting on \\"Inter-Faith Dialogue and Co-operation for Peace\\", held in Manila, the Philippines, 16ÿ18 March 2010. There is a general Conference of Foreign Ministers every three years. The most recent were in Bali, Indonesia, 23ÿ27 May 2011 and Algiers, Algeria, 26ÿ29 May 2014.\\r\\nThe Non-Aligned Movement celebrated its 50th anniversary in Belgrade on 5ÿ6 September 2011.[33][34]\\r\\nBetween summits, the Non-Aligned Movement is run by the secretary general elected at the last summit meeting.

They may help viruses avoid the host immune system. Glycoproteins on the surface of the envelope serve to identify and bind to receptor sites on the host's membrane. The viral envelope then fuses with the host's membrane, allowing the capsid and viral genome to enter and infect the host.\\r\\nThe cell from which the virus itself buds will often die or be weakened and shed more viral particles for an extended period.

The food served in fast food restaurants is typically part of a \\"meat-sweet diet\\", offered from a limited menu, cooked in bulk in advance and kept hot, finished and packaged to order, and usually available for take away, though seating may be provided. Fast food restaurants are typically part of a restaurant chain or franchise operation that provides standardized ingredients and/or partially prepared foods and supplies to each restaurant through controlled supply channels. The term \\"fast food\\" was recognized in a dictionary by MerriamÿWebster in 1951.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nArguably, the first fast food restaurants originated in the United States with White Castle in 1921.[2] Today, American-founded fast food chains such as McDonald's (est. 1940) and KFC (est. 1952)[3][4][5][6] are multinational corporations with outlets across the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nVariations on the fast food restaurant concept include fast casual restaurants and catering trucks. Fast casual restaurants have higher sit-in ratios, offering a hybrid between counter-service typical at fast food restaurants and a traditional table service restaurant.  Catering trucks (also called food trucks) often park just outside worksites and are popular with factory workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome trace the modern history of fast food in the United States to 7 July 1912, with the opening of a fast food restaurant called the Automat in New York. The Automat was a cafeteria with its prepared foods behind small glass windows and coin-operated slots. Joseph Horn and Frank Hardart had already opened the first Horn & Hardart Automat in Philadelphia in 1902, but their \\"Automat\\" at Broadway and 13th Street, in New York City, created a sensation. Numerous Automat restaurants were built around the country to deal with the demand. Automats remained extremely popular throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The company also popularized the notion of \\"take-out\\" food, with their slogan \\"Less work for Mother\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nSome historians concur that A&W, which opened in 1921 and began franchising in 1923, was the first fast food restaurant (E. Tavares). Thus, the American company White Castle is sometimes considered the second fast-food outlet in Wichita, Kansas in 1921, selling hamburgers for five cents apiece from its inception and spawning numerous competitors and emulators. What is certain, however, is that White Castle made the first significant effort to standardize the food production in, look of, and operation of fast-food hamburger restaurants. William Ingram's and Walter Anderson's White Castle System created the first fast food supply chain to provide meat, buns, paper goods, and other supplies to their restaurants, pioneered the concept of the multi-state hamburger restaurant chain, standardized the look and construction of the restaurants themselves, and even developed a construction division that manufactured and built the chain's prefabricated restaurant buildings. The McDonald's Speedee Service System and, much later, Ray Kroc's McDonald's outlets and Hamburger University all built on principles, systems and practices that White Castle had already established between 1923 and 1932.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hamburger restaurant most associated by the public with the term \\"fast food\\" was created by two brothers originally from Nashua, New Hampshire. Richard and Maurice McDonald opened a barbecue drive-in in 1940 in the city of San Bernardino, California. After discovering that most of their profits came from hamburgers, the brothers closed their restaurant for three months and reopened it in 1948 as a walk-up stand offering a simple menu of hamburgers, french fries, shakes, coffee, and Coca-Cola, served in disposable paper wrapping. As a result, they could produce hamburgers and fries constantly, without waiting for customer orders, and could serve them immediately; hamburgers cost 15 cents, about half the price at a typical diner. Their streamlined production method, which they named the \\"Speedee Service System\\" was influenced by the production line innovations of Henry Ford.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1954, The McDonald brothers' stand was restaurant equipment manufacturer Prince Castle's  biggest purchaser of milkshake blending machines. Prince Castle salesman Ray Kroc traveled to California to discover why the company had purchased almost a dozen of the units as opposed to the normal one or two found in most restaurants of the time. Enticed by the success of the McDonald's concept, Kroc signed a franchise agreement with the brothers and began opening McDonald's restaurants in Illinois.[7] By 1961, Kroc had bought out the brothers and created what is now the modern McDonald's Corporation. One of the major parts of his business plan was to promote cleanliness of his restaurants to growing groups of Americans that had become aware of food safety issues. As part of his commitment to cleanliness, Kroc often took part in cleaning his own Des Plaines, Illinois outlet by hosing down the garbage cans and scraping gum off the cement. Another concept Kroc added was great swaths of glass which enabled the customer to view the food preparation, a practice still found in chains such as Krispy Kreme. A clean atmosphere was only part of Kroc's grander plan which separated McDonald's from the rest of the competition and attributes to their great success. Kroc envisioned making his restaurants appeal to suburban families.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt roughly the same time as Kroc was conceiving what eventually became McDonald's Corporation, two Miami, Florida businessmen, James McLamore and David Edgerton, opened a franchise of the predecessor to what is now the international fast food restaurant chain Burger King. McLamore had visited the original McDonald's hamburger stand belonging to the McDonald brothers; sensing potential in their innovative assembly line-based production system, he decided he wanted to open a similar operation of his own.[9][10] The two partners eventually decided to invest their money in Jacksonville, Florida-based Insta-Burger King. Originally opened in 1953, the founders and owners of the chain, Kieth J. Kramer and his wife's uncle Matthew Burns, opened their first stores around a piece of equipment known as the Insta-Broiler. The Insta-Broiler oven proved so successful at cooking burgers, they required all of their franchises to carry the device.[9] By 1959 McLamore and Edgarton were operating several locations within the Miami-Dade area and were growing at a fast clip. Despite the success of their operation, the partners discovered that the design of the insta-broiler made the unit's heating elements prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized gas grill that avoided the problems by changing the way the meat patties were cooked in the unit. After the original company began to falter in 1959, it was purchased by McLamore and Edgerton who renamed the company Burger King.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile fast food restaurants usually have a seating area in which customers can eat the food on the premises, orders are designed to be taken away, and traditional table service is rare. Orders are generally taken and paid for at a wide counter, with the customer waiting by the counter for a tray or container for their food. A \\"drive-through\\" service can allow customers to order and pick up food from their cars.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly from its inception, fast food has been designed to be eaten \\"on the go\\" and often does not require traditional cutlery and is eaten as a finger food. Common menu items at fast food outlets include fish and chips, sandwiches, pitas, hamburgers, fried chicken, french fries, chicken nuggets, tacos, pizza, and ice cream, although many fast food restaurants offer \\"slower\\" foods like chili, mashed potatoes, and  salads.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern commercial fast food is highly processed and prepared on a large scale from bulk ingredients using standardized cooking and production methods and equipment. It is usually rapidly served in cartons, bags, or in a plastic wrapping, in a fashion which reduces operating costs by allowing rapid product identification and counting, promoting longer holding time, avoiding transfer of bacteria, and facilitating order fulfillment. In most fast food operations, menu items are generally made from processed ingredients prepared at central supply facilities and then shipped to individual outlets where they are cooked (usually by grill, microwave, or deep-frying) or assembled in a short amount of time either in anticipation of upcoming orders (i.e., \\"to stock\\") or in response to actual orders (i.e., \\"to order\\"). Following standard operating procedures, pre-cooked products are monitored for freshness and disposed of if holding times become excessive.  This process ensures a consistent level of product quality, and is key to delivering the order quickly to the customer and avoiding labor and equipment costs in the individual stores.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of commercial emphasis on taste, speed, product safety, uniformity, and low cost, fast food products are made with ingredients formulated to achieve an identifiable flavor, aroma, texture, and \\"mouth feel\\" and to preserve freshness and control handling costs during preparation and order fulfillment. This requires a high degree of food engineering. The use of additives, including salt, sugar, flavorings and preservatives, and processing techniques may limit the nutritional value of the final product.\\r\\n\\r\\nA value meal is a group of menu items offered together at a lower price than they would cost individually. A hamburger, side of fries, and drink commonly constitute a value mealor combo depending on the chain. Value meals at fast food restaurants are common as a merchandising tactic to facilitate bundling, up-selling, and price discrimination. Most of the time they can be upgraded to a larger side and drink for a small fee.  The perceived creation of a \\"discount\\" on individual menu items in exchange for the purchase of a \\"meal\\" is also consistent with the loyalty marketing school of thought.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make quick service possible and to ensure accuracy and security, many fast food restaurants have incorporated hospitality point of sale systems. This makes it possible for kitchen crew people to view orders placed at the front counter or drive through in real time. Wireless systems allow orders placed at drive through speakers to be taken by cashiers and cooks. Drive through and walk through configurations will allow orders to be taken at one register and paid at another. Modern point of sale systems can operate on computer networks using a variety of software programs. Sales records can be generated and remote access to computer reports can be given to corporate offices, managers, troubleshooters, and other authorized personnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nFood service chains partner with food equipment manufacturers to design highly specialized restaurant equipment, often incorporating heat sensors, timers, and other electronic controls into the design.  Collaborative design techniques, such as rapid visualization and computer-aided design of restaurant kitchens are now being used to establish equipment specifications that are consistent with restaurant operating and merchandising requirements.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, consumers spent about US$110 billion on fast food in 2000 (which increased from $6 billion in 1970).[14] The National Restaurant Association forecasts that fast food restaurants in the US will reach $142 billion in sales in 2006, a 5% increase over 2005. In comparison, the full-service restaurant segment of the food industry is expected to generate $173 billion in sales. Fast food has been losing market share to so-called fast casual restaurants, which offer more robust and expensive cuisines.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's, a fast food supplier, opened its first franchised restaurant in the US in 1955 (1974 in the UK). It has become a phenomenally successful enterprise in terms of financial growth, brand-name recognition, and worldwide expansion. Ray Kroc, who bought the franchising license from the McDonald brothers, pioneered concepts which emphasized standardization. He introduced uniform products, identical in all respects at each outlet, to increase sales. Kroc also insisted on cutting food costs as much as possible, eventually using the McDonald's Corporation's size to force suppliers to conform to this ethos.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther prominent international fast food companies include Burger King, the number two hamburger chain in the world, known for promoting its customized menu offerings (Have it Your Way). Another international fast food chain is KFC, which sells Chicken-related products and is the number 1 Fast Food company in the People's Republic of China.\\r\\n\\r\\nMultinational corporations typically modify their menus to cater to local tastes, and most overseas outlets are owned by native franchisees. McDonald's in India, for example, uses chicken and paneer rather than beef and pork in their burgers because Hinduism traditionally forbids eating beef. In Israel some McDonald's restaurants are kosher and respect the Jewish Shabbat; there is also a kosher McDonald's in Argentina. In Egypt, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Singapore, all menu items are halal.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany fast food operations have more local and regional roots, such as White Castle in the Midwest United States, along with Hardee's (owned by CKE Restaurants, which also owns Carl's Jr., whose locations are primarily on the United States West Coast); Krystal, Bojangles' Famous Chicken 'n Biscuits, Cook Out, and Zaxby's restaurants in the American Southeast; Raising Cane's in Louisiana and other mostly Southern states; Hot 'n Now in Michigan and Wisconsin; In-N-Out Burger (in California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Texas) and Original Tommy's chains in Southern California; Dick's Drive-In in Seattle, Washington and Arctic Circle in Utah and other western states; Halo Burger around Flint, Michigan and Burgerville in the Portland, Oregon area. Also, Whataburger is a popular burger chain in the American South, and Jack in the Box is located in the West and South. Canada pizza chains Topper's Pizza and Pizza Pizza are primarily located in Ontario. Coffee chain Country Style operates only in Ontario, and competes with the famous coffee and donut chain Tim Hortons. Maid-Rite restaurant is one of the oldest chain fast food restaurants in the United States. Founded in 1926, their specialty is a loose meat hamburger. Maid-Rites can be found in the midwest - mainly Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, and Missouri.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational brands dominant in North America include McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's, the number three burger chain in the USA; Dunkin' Donuts, a New England-based chain; automobile oriented Sonic Drive-In's from Oklahoma City; Starbucks, Seattle-born coffee-based fast food beverage corporation; KFC and Taco Bell, which are both part of the largest restaurant conglomerate in the world, Yum! Brands; and Domino's Pizza, a pizza chain known for popularizing home delivery of fast food.\\r\\n\\r\\nSubway is known for their sub sandwiches and are the largest restaurant chain to serve such food items.[15] Quiznos a Denver-based sub shop is another fast-growing sub chain, yet with over 6,000 locations it is still far behind Subway's 34,000 locations. Other smaller sub shops include Blimpie, Jersey Mike's Subs, Mr. Goodcents, Jimmy John's, and Firehouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nA&W Restaurants was originally a United States and Canada fast food brand, but it is currently an International fast food corporation in several countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada the majority of fast food chains are American owned or were originally American owned but have since set up a Canadian management/headquarters locations such as Panera Bread, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Five Guys, and Carl's Jr.. Although the case is usually American fast food chains expanding into Canada, Canadian chains such as Tim Hortons have expanded into 22 states in the United States, but are more prominent in border states such as New York and Michigan.  Tim Hortons has started to expand to other countries outside of North America. The Pita Pit franchise originated in Canada and has expanded to the United States and other Countries.  The Canadian Extreme Pita franchise sells low fat and salt pita sandwiches with stores in the larger Canadian cities. Other Canadian fast food chains such as Manchu Wok serve North American style Asian foods; this company is located mainly in Canada and the USA, with other outlets on US military bases on other continents. Harvey's is a Canadian-only burger restaurant chain, present in every province.\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralia's fast food market began in the early 1970s, with the opening of several American franchises including McDonald's and KFC. Pizza Hut was introduced in the 1980s, and Burger King followed. However, the Burger King market found that this name was already a registered trademark to a takeaway food shop in Adelaide.[16] Thus, the Burger King Australian market was forced to pick another name, selecting the Hungry Jack's brand name. Prior to this, the Australian fast food market consisted primarily of privately owned take-away shops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Kingdom's signature type of fast food restaurant is a fish and chip shop, which specializes in fish and chips and also other foods such as kebabs and burgers. Fish and chip shops are usually owned independently. Many other types of home based fast food operations were closed in the 1970s and 1980s after McDonald's became the number one outlet in the market[citation needed]. However, brands like Wimpy still remain, although the majority of branches became Burger King in 1989.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to home-grown chains such as Supermac's, numerous American chains such as McDonald's and Burger King have also established a presence in Ireland. In 2015, a study developed by Treated.com was published in the Irish Times, which named Swords in County Dublin as Ireland's 'fast food capital'.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican chains such as Domino's Pizza, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, and KFC have a big presence in Japan, but local gyudon chains such as Sukiya, Matsuya and Yoshinoya also blanket the country.  Japan has its own burger chains including MOS Burger, Lotteria and Freshness Burger.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major fast food chains in India which serve European/American food are KFC, McDonald's, Starbucks, Burger King, Subway, Pizza Hut, and Dominos. Most of these have had to make a lot of changes to their standard menus to cater to Indian food habits and taste preferences. Some emerging Indian food chains include Haldiram's, Faaso's, Chick King, Pitstop and Caf Coffee Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nFood habits vary widely across states within India. While typical Idli/Dosa is fast food in Southern India, in Maharashtra it is misal-pav / pav-bhaji / pohe etc. Further north in Punjab/Haryana, Chole-bhature are very popular and in Bihar/Jharkhand litti-chokha is their staple fast food. Maintaining consistency in taste and texture of Indian fast food is a challenge and hence local chains are emerging armed with new food-technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Nigeria, Mr. Bigg's, Chicken Republic, Tantalizers, and Tastee Fried Chicken are the predominant fast food chains. KFC and Domino's Pizza have recently entered the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nFast food In Pakistan varies. There are many international chains serving fast food, including Nandos, Burger King, KFC, McDonald's, Domino's Pizza, Fatburger, Dunkin' Donuts, Subway, Pizza Hut, Hardees, Telepizza, Steak Escape and Gloria Jean's Coffees. In addition to the international chains, in local cuisine people in Pakistan like to have biryani, bun kebabs, Nihari, kebab rolls etc. as fast food.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost international fast food chains like Subway, McDonald's, Burger King etc. are represented in major Russian cities. There are also local chains like Teremok specializing in Russian cuisine or having elements of it added into their menu.\\r\\n\\r\\nKFC is the most popular fast food chain in South Africa according to a 2010 Sunday Times survey.[18] Chicken Licken, Wimpy and Ocean Basket along with Nando's and Steers are examples of homegrown franchises that are highly popular within the country. McDonald's, Subway and Pizza Hut have a significant presence within South Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Hong Kong, although McDonald's and KFC are quite popular, three major local fast food chains provide Hong Kong style fast food, namely Caf de Coral, Fairwood, and Maxim MX. Caf de Coral alone serves more than 300,000 customers daily.[19] Unlike western fast food chains, these restaurants offer four different menus at different times of the day, namely breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner. Siu mei is offered throughout the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nDai pai dong and traditional Hong Kong street food may be considered close relatives of the conventional fast food outlet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Israel, local burger chain Burger Ranch is popular as are McDonald's and Burger King. Domino's Pizza is also a popular fast food restaurant. Chains like McDonald's offer kosher branches. Non-kosher foods such as cheeseburgers are rare in Israeli fast food chains, even in non-kosher branches. There are many small local fast food chains that serve pizza, hamburgers, sushi and local foods such as hummus, falafel and shawarma.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn New Zealand, the fast food market began in the 1970s with KFC (opened 1971), Pizza Hut (1974), and McDonald's (1976),[20] and all three remain popular today. Burger King and Domino's entered the market later in the 1990s. Australian pizza chains Eagle Boys and Pizza Haven also entered the market in the 1990s, but their New Zealand operations were later sold to Pizza Hut and Domino's.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few fast food chains have been founded in New Zealand, including Burger Fuel (founded 1995), Georgie Pie (founded 1977, but closed 1998 after falling into financial trouble and being bought out by McDonald's) and Hell Pizza (founded 1996).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Philippines, fast-food is the same as in the US. However, the only difference is that they serve Filipino dishes and a few American products being served Filipino-style. Jollibee is the leading fast food chain in the country with 1,000 stores nationwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fast food chain restaurant is generally owned either by the parent company of the fast food chain or a franchisee ÿ an independent party given the right to use the company's trademark and trade name. In the latter case, a contract is made between the franchisee and the parent company, typically requiring the franchisee to pay an initial, fixed fee in addition to a continual percentage of monthly sales. Upon opening for business, the franchisee oversees the day-to-day operations of the restaurant and acts as a manager of the store. Once the contract expires, the parent company may choose to \\"renew the contract, sell the franchise to another franchisee, or operate the restaurant itself.\\" [21] In most fast food chains, the number of franchised locations exceeds the number of company owned locations.\\r\\n\\r\\nFast food chains rely on consistency and uniformity, in internal operations and brand image, across all of their restaurant locations in order to convey a sense of reliability to their customers. This sense of reliability coupled with a positive customer experience brings customers to place trust in the company. This sense of trust leads to increased customer loyalty which gives the company a source of recurring business. When a person is presented with a choice of different restaurants to eat at, it is much easier for them to stick with what they know, rather than to take a gamble and dive into the unknown.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the importance of consistency, most companies set standards unifying their various restaurant locations with a set of common rules and regulations. Parent companies often rely on field representatives to ensure that the practices of franchised locations are consistent with the company's standards. However, the more locations a fast food chain has, the harder it is for the parent company to guarantee that these standards are being followed. Moreover, it is much more expensive to discharge a franchisee for noncompliance with company standards, than it is to discharge an employee for that same reason. As a consequence, parent companies tend to deal with franchisee violations in a more relaxed manner.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the most part, someone visiting a McDonald's in the United States will have the same experience as someone visiting a McDonald's in Japan. The interior design, the menu, the speed of service, and the taste of the food will all be very similar. However, some differences do exist to tailor to particular cultural differences. For example, in October 2005 during a midst of plummeting sales in Japan, McDonald's added a shrimp burger to the Japanese menu.[23] The choice to introduce a shrimp burger was no coincidence, as a 1989 study stated that world consumption of shrimp was \\"led by Japan.\\" [24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2010, Taco Bell opened their first restaurant in India. Because non-consumption of beef is a cultural norm in light of India's Dharmic beliefs, Taco Bell had to tailor its menu to the dietary distinctions of Indian culture by replacing all of the beef with chicken. By the same token, completely meatless options were introduced to the menu due to the prevalence of vegetarianism throughout the country.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the large fast food chains are beginning to incorporate healthier alternatives in their menu, e.g., white meat, snack wraps, salads, and fresh fruit. However, some people see these moves as a tokenistic and commercial measure, rather than an appropriate reaction to ethical concerns about the world ecology and people's health. McDonald's announced that in March 2006, the chain would include nutritional information on the packaging of all of its products.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September and October 2000, during the Starlink corn recalls, up to $50 million worth of corn-based foods were recalled from restaurants as well as supermarkets. The products contained Starlink genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption.[27] It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food.[28][29] The environmental group Friends of the Earth that had first detected the contaminated shells was critical of the FDA for not doing its own job.\\r\\n\\r\\nFast food outlets have become popular with consumers for several reasons. One is that through economies of scale in purchasing and producing food, these companies can deliver food to consumers at a very low cost. In addition, although some people dislike fast food for its predictability, it can be reassuring to a hungry person in a hurry or far from home.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the post-World War II period in the United States, fast food chains like McDonald's rapidly gained a reputation for their cleanliness, fast service, and a child-friendly atmosphere where families on the road could grab a quick meal, or seek a break from the routine of home cooking[citation needed]. Prior to the rise of the fast food chain restaurant, people generally had a choice between greasy spoon diners where the quality of the food was often questionable and service lacking, or high-end restaurants that were expensive and impractical for families with children[citation needed]. The modern, stream-lined convenience of the fast food restaurant provided a new alternative and appealed to Americans' instinct for ideas and products associated with progress, technology, and innovation.[citation needed]  Fast food restaurants rapidly became the eatery \\"everyone could agree on\\", with many featuring child-size menu combos, play areas, and whimsical branding campaigns, like the iconic Ronald McDonald, designed to appeal to younger customers. Parents could have a few minutes of peace while children played or amused themselves with the toys included in their Happy Meal.  There is a long history of fast food advertising campaigns, many of which are directed at children.\\r\\n\\r\\nFast food marketing largely focuses on children and teenagers. Popular methods of advertising include television, product placement in toys, games, educational materials, songs, and movies, character licensing and celebrity endorsements, and websites.[30]  Advertisements targeting children mainly focus on free toys, movie tie-ins and other giveaways.[31] Fast food restaurants use kid's meals with toys, kid friendly mascots, vibrant colors, and play areas to draw children toward their products. . Children's power over their parents' purchases is estimated to total $300 to $500 billion every year.[32] Fast food has become a part of American culture as a reward for children. To deny a child \\"desirable things\\" such as the advertised fast food restaurant can cause stigmatization of parents as the \\"mean parent\\" when it is common among other parents to comply with their child's desires.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major focus on children by the fast food industry has created controversy due to the rising issue of children obesity in America.[33] As a result of this focus, in 2008 a coalition was created and run by the Council of Better Business Bureaus called Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative(CFBAI), to stop ads aimed at children or to promote only what the council dubs \\"better-for- you\\" products in ads directed towards children.[34] However, it was not until 2011 that Congress requested guidelines be put in place by the CFBAI, FDA, Agriculture Department, and Centers for Disease Control. There are two basic requirements identified in the guidelines for foods that are advertised for children: (1) The food has to include healthful ingredients; (2) The food can't contain unhealthful amounts of sugar, Saturated fat, Trans fat, and salt. The guidelines are voluntary but companies experience heavy pressure to comply. Once a company complies they have 5ÿ10 years to comply with the guidelines.[33] Many fast food industries have started to comply with the guidelines. Although many companies have ways to go. In 2012 the fast food industry spent $4.6 billion to advertise unhealthy products to children and teens according to a report by the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity.[31] There are points of progress that include healthier sides and beverages in most fast food restaurant kids' meals.[31] The guidelines are interested in a healthier lifestyle for children and the growing problem of American obesity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other parts of the world, American and American-style fast food outlets have been popular for their quality, customer service, and novelty, even though they are often the targets of popular anger towards American foreign policy or globalization more generally[citation needed]. Many consumers nonetheless see them as symbols of the wealth, progress, and well-ordered openness of Western society and they therefore become trendy attractions in many cities around the world, particularly among younger people with more varied tastes.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver time, fast food restaurants have been growing rapidly, especially in urban neighborhoods. According to US research, low-income and predominantly African-American neighborhoods have greater exposure to fast food outlets than higher income and predominantly white areas.[35] This has put into question whether urbanized neighborhoods were targeted, which causes a more unhealthy group of people compared to people from a higher socioeconomic status. It has also been shown that there is a lower chance of finding a fast food restaurant in a suburban neighborhood. In a study of selected US locations, Morland et al. (2002) found the number of fast food restaurants and bars was inversely proportional to the wealth of the neighborhood, and that predominantly African-American residential areas were four times less likely to have a supermarket near them than predominantly white areas.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe introduction of the halal option by some fast food companies saw the expansion of fast food chains into Muslim majority countries has resulted in a rise of restaurant options in non-western nations and has also increased revenue for some western restaurant chains.[39] Some outlets offering Halal options include KFC, Nando's, Pizza Express, and Subway. McDonald's carried out a trial but decided that the cost of operations would be too high.[40] There have also been court cases involving start-up businesses during attempts to alter the halal-certified method by machine killing, which is against the beliefs of some Muslims.[41] However, the trend towards halal has been unpopular in some communities which have at times resulted in internet petitions.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fast food industry is a popular target for critics, from anti-globalization activists like Jos Bov to vegetarian activist groups such as PETA as well as the workers themselves. A number of fast food worker strikes occurred in the United States in the 2010s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his best-selling 2001 book Fast Food Nation, investigative journalist Eric Schlosser leveled a broad, socioeconomic critique against the fast food industry, documenting how fast food rose from small, family-run businesses (like the McDonald brothers' burger joint) into large, multinational corporate juggernauts whose economies of scale radically transformed agriculture, meat processing, and labor markets in the late twentieth century. Schlosser argues that while the innovations of the fast food industry gave Americans more and cheaper dining options, it has come at the price of destroying the environment, economy, and small-town communities of rural America while shielding consumers from the real costs of their convenient meal, both in terms of health and the broader impact of large-scale food production and processing on workers, animals, and land.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fast food industry is popular in the United States, the source of most of its innovation, and many major international chains are based there. Seen as symbols of US dominance and perceived cultural imperialism, American fast food franchises have often been the target of Anti-globalization protests and demonstrations against the US government. In 2005, for example, rioters in Karachi, Pakistan, who were initially angered because of the bombing of a Shiite mosque, destroyed a KFC restaurant.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, McDonald's was sued in a New York court by a family who claimed that the restaurant chain was responsible for their teenage daughter's obesity and attendant health problems. By manipulating food's taste, sugar and fat content, and directing their advertising to children, the suit argued that the company purposely misleads the public about the nutritional value of its product. A judge dismissed the case, but the fast food industry disliked the publicity of its practices, particularly the way it targets children in its advertising.[44]  Although further lawsuits have not materialized, the issue is kept alive in the media and political circles by those promoting the need for tort reform.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to this, the \\"Cheeseburger Bill\\" [46] was passed by the US House of Representatives in 2004; it later stalled in the US Senate. The law was reintroduced in 2005, only to meet the same fate. This law was claimed to \\"[ban] frivolous lawsuits against producers and sellers of food and non-alcoholic drinks arising from obesity claims.\\"\\r\\nThe bill arose because of an increase in lawsuits against fast food chains by people who claimed that eating their products made them obese, disassociating themselves from any of the blame.","input":"What was the first chain of hamburger resturants in the united states?"},{"output":"April 1957","context":"","input":"When did the us start using nuclear energy?"},{"output":"simple circular space","context":"The ancient Greek drama was a theatrical culture that flourished in ancient Greece from c. 700 BC. The city-state of Athens, which became a significant cultural, political, and military power during this period, was its center, where it was institutionalised as part of a festival called the Dionysia, which honoured the god Dionysus. Tragedy (late 500 BC), comedy (490 BC), and the satyr play were the three dramatic genres to emerge there. Athens exported the festival to its numerous colonies and allies in order to promote a common cultural identity. Only men were allowed to play female parts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word ϫ?Ѵ?ϫ (tragoidia), from which the word \\"tragedy\\" is derived, is a compound of two Greek words: ?? (tragos) or \\"goat\\" and ?Ѵ? (ode) meaning \\"song\\", from ??Ѵ (aeidein), \\"to sing\\".[1] This etymology indicates a link with the practices of the ancient Dionysian cults. It is impossible, however, to know with certainty how these fertility rituals became the basis for tragedy and comedy.[2]\\r\\nThe classical Greeks valued the power of spoken word, and it was their main method of communication and storytelling. Bahn and Bahn write, \\"To Greeks the spoken word was a living thing and infinitely preferable to the dead symbols of a written language.\\" Socrates himself believed that once something was written down, it lost its ability for change and growth. For these reasons, among many others, oral storytelling flourished in Greece.[3]\\r\\nGreek tragedy as we know it was created in Athens around the time of 532 BC, when Thespis was the earliest recorded actor. Being a winner of the first theatrical contest held in Athens, he was the exarchon, or leader,[4] of the dithyrambs performed in and around Attica, especially at the rural Dionysia. By Thespis' time, the dithyramb had evolved far away from its cult roots. Under the influence of heroic epic, Doric choral lyric and the innovations of the poet Arion, it had become a narrative, ballad-like genre. Because of these, Thespis is often called the \\"Father of Tragedy\\"; however, his importance is disputed, and Thespis is sometimes listed as late as 16th in the chronological order of Greek tragedians; the statesman Solon, for example, is credited with creating poems in which characters speak with their own voice, and spoken performances of Homer's epics by rhapsodes were popular in festivals prior to 534 BC.[5] Thus, Thespis's true contribution to drama is unclear at best, but his name has been given a longer life, in English, as a common term for performer  i.e., a \\"thespian.\\"\\r\\nThe dramatic performances were important to the Athenians ÿ this is made clear by the creation of a tragedy competition and festival in the City Dionysia. This was organized possibly to foster loyalty among the tribes of Attica (recently created by Cleisthenes). The festival was created roughly around 508 BC. While no drama texts exist from the sixth century BC, we do know the names of three competitors besides Thespis: Choerilus, Pratinas, and Phrynichus. Each is credited with different innovations in the field.\\r\\nMore is known about Phrynichus. He won his first competition between 511 BC and 508 BC. He produced tragedies on themes and subjects later exploited in the golden age such as the Danaids, Phoenician Women and Alcestis. He was the first poet we know of to use a historical subject ÿ his Fall of Miletus, produced in 493-2, chronicled the fate of the town of Miletus after it was conquered by the Persians. Herodotus reports that \\"the Athenians made clear their deep grief for the taking of Miletus in many ways, but especially in this: when Phrynichus wrote a play entitled \\"The Fall of Miletus\\" and produced it, the whole theatre fell to weeping; they fined Phrynichus a thousand drachmas for bringing to mind a calamity that affected them so personally and forbade the performance of that play forever.\\"[6] He is also thought to be the first to use female characters (though not female performers).[7]\\r\\nUntil the Hellenistic period, all tragedies were unique pieces written in honour of Dionysus and played only once, so that today we primarily have the pieces that were still remembered well enough to have been repeated when the repetition of old tragedies became fashionable (the accidents of survival, as well as the subjective tastes of the Hellenistic librarians later in Greek history, also played a role in what survived from this period).\\r\\nAfter the Great Destruction of Athens by the Persian Empire in 480 BCE, the town and acropolis were rebuilt, and theatre became formalized and an even greater part of Athenian culture and civic pride. This century is normally regarded as the Golden Age of Greek drama. The centre-piece of the annual Dionysia, which took place once in winter and once in spring, was a competition between three tragic playwrights at the Theatre of Dionysus. Each submitted three tragedies, plus a satyr play (a comic, burlesque version of a mythological subject). Beginning in a first competition in 486 BC each playwright submitted a comedy.[8] Aristotle claimed that Aeschylus added the second actor (deuteragonist), and that Sophocles introduced the third (tritagonist). Apparently the Greek playwrights never used more than three actors based on what is known about Greek theatre.[9]\\r\\nTragedy and comedy were viewed as completely separate genres, and no plays ever merged aspects of the two. Satyr plays dealt with the mythological subject matter of the tragedies, but in a purely comedic manner.\\r\\nThe power of Athens declined following its defeat in the Peloponnesian War against the Spartans. From that time on, the theatre started performing old tragedies again. Although its theatrical traditions seem to have lost their vitality, Greek theatre continued into the Hellenistic period (the period following Alexander the Great's conquests in the fourth century BCE). However, the primary Hellenistic theatrical form was not tragedy but 'New Comedy', comic episodes about the lives of ordinary citizens. The only extant playwright from the period is Menander. One of New Comedy's most important contributions was its influence on Roman comedy, an influence that can be seen in the surviving works of Plautus and Terence.\\r\\nThe plays had a chorus from 12 to 15[10] people, who performed the plays in verse accompanied by music, beginning in the morning and lasting until the evening. The performance space was a simple circular space, the orchestra, where the chorus danced and sang. The orchestra, which had an average diameter of 78 feet, was situated on a flattened terrace at the foot of a hill, the slope of which produced a natural theatron, literally \\"seeing place\\". Later, the term \\"theatre\\" came to be applied to the whole area of theatron, orchestra, and sken. The coryphaeus was the head chorus member who could enter the story as a character able to interact with the characters of a play.\\r\\nThe theatres were originally built on a very large scale to accommodate the large number of people on stage, as well as the large number of people in the audience, up to fourteen thousand. Mathematics played a large role in the construction of these theatres, as their designers had to be able to create acoustics in them such that the actors' voices could be heard throughout the theatre, including the very top row of seats. The Greek's understanding of acoustics compares very favourably with the current state of the art. The first seats in Greek theatres (other than just sitting on the ground) were wooden, but around 499 BCE the practice of inlaying stone blocks into the side of the hill to create permanent, stable seating became more common. They were called the \\"prohedria\\" and reserved for priests and a few most respected citizens.\\r\\nIn 465 BCE, the playwrights began using a backdrop or scenic wall, which hung or stood behind the orchestra, which also served as an area where actors could change their costumes. It was known as the skn (from which the word \\"scene\\" derives). The death of a character was always heard behind the skn, for it was considered inappropriate to show a killing in view of the audience.[citation needed] Conversely, there are scholarly arguments that death in Greek tragedy was portrayed off stage primarily because of dramatic considerations, and not prudishness or sensitivity of the audience.[11] In 425 BC a stone scene wall, called a paraskenia, became a common supplement to skn in the theatres. A paraskenia was a long wall with projecting sides, which may have had doorways for entrances and exits. Just behind the paraskenia was the proskenion. The proskenion (\\"in front of the scene\\") was beautiful, and was similar to the modern day proscenium.\\r\\nGreek theatres also had tall arched entrances called parodoi or eisodoi, through which actors and chorus members entered and exited the orchestra. By the end of the 5th century BC, around the time of the Peloponnesian War, the skn, the back wall, was two stories high. The upper story was called the episkenion. Some theatres also had a raised speaking place on the orchestra called the logeion.\\r\\nThere were several scenic elements commonly used in Greek theatre:\\r\\nThe Ancient Greek term for a mask is prosopon (lit., \\"face\\"),[12] and was a significant element in the worship of Dionysus at Athens, likely used in ceremonial rites and celebrations. Most of the evidence comes from only a few vase paintings of the 5th century BC, such as one showing a mask of the god suspended from a tree with decorated robe hanging below it and dancing and the Pronomos vase,[13] which depicts actors preparing for a Satyr play.[14] No physical evidence remains available to us, as the masks were made of organic materials and not considered permanent objects, ultimately being dedicated at the altar of Dionysus after performances. Nevertheless, the mask is known to have been used since the time of Aeschylus and considered to be one of the iconic conventions of classical Greek theatre.[15]\\r\\nMasks were also made for members of the chorus, who play some part in the action and provide a commentary on the events in which they are caught up. Although there are twelve or fifteen members of the tragic chorus, they all wear the same mask because they are considered to be representing one character.\\r\\nIllustrations of theatrical masks from 5th century display helmet-like masks, covering the entire face and head, with holes for the eyes and a small aperture for the mouth, as well as an integrated wig. These paintings never show actual masks on the actors in performance; they are most often shown being handled by the actors before or after a performance, that liminal space between the audience and the stage, between myth and reality.[14] This demonstrates the way in which the mask was to 'melt' into the face and allow the actor to vanish into the role.[16] Effectively, the mask transformed the actor as much as memorization of the text. Therefore, performance in ancient Greece did not distinguish the masked actor from the theatrical character.\\r\\nThe mask-makers were called skeuopoios or \\"maker of the properties,\\" thus suggesting that their role encompassed multiple duties and tasks. The masks were most likely made out of light weight, organic materials like stiffened linen, leather, wood, or cork, with the wig consisting of human or animal hair.[17] Due to the visual restrictions imposed by these masks, it was imperative that the actors hear in order to orient and balance themselves. Thus, it is believed that the ears were covered by substantial amounts of hair and not the helmet-mask itself. The mouth opening was relatively small, preventing the mouth to be seen during performances. Vervain and Wiles posit that this small size discourages the idea that the mask functioned as a megaphone, as originally presented in the 1960s.[14] Greek mask-maker, Thanos Vovolis, suggests that the mask serves as a resonator for the head, thus enhancing vocal acoustics and altering its quality. This leads to increased energy and presence, allowing for the more complete metamorphosis of the actor into his character.[18]\\r\\nIn a large open-air theatre, like the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens, the classical masks were able to create a sense of dread in the audience creating large scale panic, especially since they had intensely exaggerated facial features and expressions.[18] They enabled an actor to appear and reappear in several different roles, thus preventing the audience from identifying the actor to one specific character. Their variations help the audience to distinguish sex, age, and social status, in addition to revealing a change in a particular character's appearance, e.g. Oedipus after blinding himself.[19] Unique masks were also created for specific characters and events in a play, such as The Furies in Aeschylus' Eumenides and Pentheus and Cadmus in Euripides' The Bacchae. Worn by the chorus, the masks created a sense of unity and uniformity, while representing a multi-voiced persona or single organism and simultaneously encouraged interdependency and a heightened sensitivity between each individual of the group. Only 2-3 actors were allowed on the stage at one time, and masks permitted quick transitions from one character to another. There were only male actors, but masks allowed them to play female characters.\\r\\nThe actors in these plays that had tragic roles wore boots called cothurni that elevated them above the other actors. The actors with comedic roles only wore a thin soled shoe called a sock. For this reason, dramatic art is sometimes alluded to as \\"Sock and Buskin.\\"\\r\\nMelpomene is the muse of tragedy and is often depicted holding the tragic mask and wearing cothurni. Thalia is the muse of comedy and is similarly associated with the mask of comedy and the comedic \\"socks\\".\\r\\nMale actors playing female roles would wear a wooden structure on their chests (posterneda) to imitate the look of breasts and another structure on their stomachs (progastreda) to make them appear softer and more lady like. They would also wear white body stockings under their costumes to make their skin appear fairer.\\r\\nMost costuming detail comes from pottery paintings from that time as costumes and masks were fabricated out of disposable material, so there are little to no remains of any costume from that time. The biggest source of information is the Pronomos Vase where actors are painted at a show's after party.\\r\\nCostuming would give off a sense of character, as in gender, age, social status, and class. For example, characters of higher class would be dressed in nicer clothing, although everyone was dressed fairly nice. Contrary to popular belief, they did not dress in only rags and sandals, as they wanted to impress. Some examples of greek theatre costuming include long robes called the chiton that reached the floor for actors playing gods, heroes, and old men. Actors playing Goddesses and women characters that held a lot of power wore purples and golds. Actors playing Queens and Princesses wore long cloaks that dragged on the ground and were decorated with gold stars and other jewels, and warriors were dressed in a variety of armor and wore helmets adorned with plumes. Costumes were supposed to be colourful and obvious to be easily seen by every seat in the audience.","input":"What type of space was used during the greek theatre era?"},{"output":"Jeanne Calment","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a list of the 100 verified oldest people, arranged in descending order of each individual's age in years and days.

Latin was the original language of the Romans and remained the language of imperial administration, legislation, and the military throughout the classical period.[2] In the West it became the lingua franca and came to be used for even local administration of the cities including the law courts.[3][4] After all freeborn inhabitants of the Empire were universally enfranchised in 212 AD, a great number of Roman citizens would have lacked Latin, though they were expected to acquire at least a token knowledge, and Latin remained a marker of \\"Romanness\\".[5][dubious ÿ discuss]\\r\\nKoine Greek had become a shared language around the eastern Mediterranean and into Asia Minor as a consequence of the conquests of Alexander the Great.[6] The \\"linguistic frontier\\" dividing the Latin West and the Greek East passed through the Balkan peninsula.[7] Educated Romans, particularly those of the ruling elite, studied and often achieved a high degree of fluency in Greek, which was useful for diplomatic communications in the East even beyond the borders of the Empire. The international use of Greek was one condition that enabled the spread of Christianity, as indicated for example by the choice of Greek as the language of the Epistles of Paul[8] and its use for the ecumenical councils of the Christian Roman Empire. With the dissolution of the Empire in the West, Greek became the dominant language of the Eastern Roman Empire, later known as the Byzantine Empire.\\r\\nBecause communication in ancient society was predominantly oral, it can be difficult to determine the extent to which regional or local languages continued to be spoken or used for other purposes under Roman rule. Some evidence exists in inscriptions, or in references in Greek and Roman texts to other languages and the need for interpreters. For Punic, Coptic, and Aramaic or Syriac, a significant amount of epigraphy or literature survives.[9] The Celtic languages were widespread throughout much of western Europe, and while the orality of Celtic education left scant written records,[10] Celtic epigraphy is limited in quantity but not rare.[11] The Germanic languages of the Empire have left next to no inscriptions or texts, with the exception of Gothic.[12] Multilingualism contributed to the \\"cultural triangulation\\" by means of which an individual who was neither Greek nor Roman might construct an identity through the processes of Romanization and Hellenization.[13]\\r\\nAfter the decentralization of political power in late antiquity, Latin developed locally in the Western provinces into branches that became the Romance languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Italian. In the early 21st century, the first or second language of more than a billion people derived from Latin.[14] Latin itself remained an international medium of expression for diplomacy and for intellectual developments identified with Renaissance humanism up to the 17th century, and for law and the Roman Catholic Church to the present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLatin was the language of the Romans from the earliest known period. Writing under the first Roman emperor Augustus, Virgil emphasizes that Latin was a source of Roman unity and tradition. In Virgil's epic Aeneid about the founding of Rome, the supreme deity Jupiter dictates that the refugee Trojans who have come to settle in Italy will use the language of the native Latini as a means of unification: \\"they will keep the speech (sermo) and mores of their fathers ... and I will make them all Latins with one mode of expression\\" (uno ore, literally \\"with one mouth\\").[15] The Julio-Claudian emperors, who claimed descent from the Virgilian hero Aeneas, encouraged high standards of correct Latin (Latinitas), a linguistic movement identified in modern terms as Classical Latin, and favored Latin for conducting official business.[16]\\r\\nLatin became the language of conquered areas because local people started speaking it, and not because the population was displaced by Latin-speakers.[17] Latin was not imposed officially on peoples brought under Roman rule.[18] Saint Augustine observed that Romans preferred for Latin to be adopted per pacem societatis, through a social pact.[19] This language policy contrasts with that of Alexander, who aimed to impose Greek throughout his empire as the official language.[20] Latin was not a requirement for Roman citizenship, and there was no state-supported schooling that privileged it as the medium for education: fluency was desirable for its \\"high cultural, political, legal, social and economic value\\".[21]\\r\\nLatin was needed for Imperial service and advancement, and was the language used for the internal functioning of government.[22] Edicts and official communications of the emperor were in Latin, including rulings on local laws that might be in another language.[23]\\r\\nThe Romans placed a high value on the written word, as indicated by their obsession with documentation and public inscriptions. The Imperial bureaucracy was so dependent on writing that the Babylonian Talmud declared \\"if all seas were ink, all reeds were pen, all skies parchment, and all men scribes, they would be unable to set down the full scope of the Roman government's concerns.\\"[24] Estimates of the average literacy rate in the Empire range from 5 to 30 percent or higher, depending in part on the definition of \\"literacy\\".[25] The lack of state intervention in access to education was a barrier to literacy, since formal education was available only to children from families who could pay for it.[26]\\r\\nThe birth certificates and wills of Roman citizens had to be written in Latin until the time of Alexander Severus (reigned 222ÿ235).[28] Illiterate Roman subjects would have someone such as a government scribe (scriba) read or write their official documents for them.[29] Laws and edicts were posted in writing as well as read out.[30] Public art and religious ceremonies were ways to communicate imperial ideology regardless of language spoken or ability to read.[31] An early form of story ballet (pantomimus) was brought to Rome by Greek performers and became popular throughout the multilingual Empire in part because it relied on gesture rather than verbal expression.[32]\\r\\nLatin was the official language of the Roman army until the mid-6th century, and remained the most common language for military use even in the Eastern empire until the 630s.[33] By contrast, only two bishops are known to have spoken Latin at the ecumenical councils held during the reign of Theodosius II (d. 450 AD).[34]\\r\\nKoine Greek had become the common language of the eastern Mediterranean and into Asia Minor after the conquests of Alexander the Great.[35] Lucian even imagines that Greek is the universal language of the dead in the underworld.[36] In late antiquity, a Greek-speaking majority lived in the Greek peninsula and islands, major cities of the East, western Anatolia, and some coastal areas.[37] Greek continued as the language of the Byzantine Empire, and developed into a distinctive medieval Greek that gave rise to modern Greek.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe emperor Claudius tried to limit the use of Greek, and on occasion revoked the citizenship of those who lacked Latin. Even in addressing the Roman Senate, however, he drew on his own bilingualism in communicating with Greek-speaking ambassadors.[40] Suetonius quotes him as referring to \\"our two languages,\\"[41] and the employment of two imperial secretaries, one for Greek and one Latin, dates to his reign.[42]\\r\\nThe everyday interpenetration of the two languages is indicated by bilingual inscriptions, which sometimes even switch back and forth between Greek and Latin. The epitaph of a Greek-speaking soldier, for instance, might be written primarily in Greek, with his rank and unit in the Roman army expressed in Latin.[43]\\r\\nIn the Eastern empire, laws and official documents were regularly translated into Greek from Latin.[44] Both languages were in active use by government officials and the Church during the 5th century.[45] From the 6th century, Greek culture was studied in the West almost exclusively through Latin translation.[46] Latin loanwords appear liberally in Greek texts on technical topics from late antiquity and the Byzantine period.[47]\\r\\nAtticism was a trend of the Second Sophistic. Intellectuals such as Aelius Aristides sought to restore the standards of classical Greek characteristic of the Attic dialect, represented by Thucydides, Plato, Demosthenes, and other authors from the Classical period. Prose stylists who aspired to Atticism tried to avoid the vulgarisms of koinean impractical goal, but this linguistic purism reflected also the 2nd-century flourishing of grammarians and lexicographers.[48] Expertise in language and literature contributed to preserving Hellenic culture in the Roman Imperial world.[49]\\r\\nAmong other reforms, the emperor Diocletian (reigned 284ÿ305) sought to renew the authority of Latin, and the Greek expression ? ϫ?ϫ Ѵ?ٶ? (h kratousa dialektos) attests to the continuing status of Latin as \\"the language of power.\\"[50] The scholar Libanius (4th century) regarded Latin as causing a decline in the quality of Greek rhetoric.[51] In the early 6th century, the emperor Justinian engaged in a quixotic effort to reassert the status of Latin as the language of law, even though in his time Latin no longer held any currency as a living language in the East.[52]\\r\\nThe dominance of Latin and Greek among the literate elite may obscure the continuity of spoken languages, since all cultures within the Roman Empire were predominantly oral.[53] In areas where Syriac, Coptic, Hebrew and Aramaic were spoken, they coexisted with Greek.[54]\\r\\nAramaic was the primary language of Syria and Mesopotomia, with several dialects.[55] Syriac was in use around Antioch, one of the three largest cities of the Empire, and particularly by Christians.[56] Syriac literature is known from the latter 2nd century, spreading from the Christian community in Edessa.[57] Early Syriac literature was produced in a largely Greek intellectual milieu until the 4th century, but was distinctive for its use of rich symbolism and verse forms, and influenced Greek writers such as Eusebius, Basil and Theodoret.[58] Among the earliest Syriac literature was the Diatessaron of Tatian, and translations of sections from the Bible.[59]\\r\\nThe prolific Syrian scholar Bardesanes knew Greek and sent his son for schooling in Athens, but chose to write in his ethnic language. In addition to Syriac homilies and treatises, Bardesanes wrote 150 hymns \\"of enormous influence and doubtful doctrine\\".[60] Other Syriac literature of the time included Christian treatises, dialogues, and apocryphal Acts.[61] Some Syriac literature had Gnostic elements, and also played a role in the dissemination of Manicheanism. From the 5th century onward, it included Monophysite and Nestorian writings.[62]\\r\\nWorks by the Syriac writer Ephraim were translated into Greek.[63] The satirist and rhetorician Lucian came from Samosata in the province of Syria; although he wrote in Greek, he calls himself a Syrian, and a reference to himself as a \\"barbarian\\" suggests that he spoke Syriac.[64]\\r\\nSoldiers from Palmyra even used their dialect of Aramaic for inscriptions, in a striking exception to the rule that Latin was the language of the military.[65]\\r\\n\\"Coptic\\" is the modern term for the form of ancient Egyptian that had developed in late antiquity.[66] Written Coptic as a literary language seems to have resulted from a conscious effort among Egypt's educated class to revive their cultural heritage.[67]\\r\\nIn the 4th century, Coptic scriptbased on the Greek alphabet with additional characters from Egyptian demotic to reflect Egyptian phonologyis found in documents in several dialects, including Old Bohairic, Fayumic, Achmimic, and Sahidic.[68] At this time Coptic emerged as a fully literary language, including major translations of Greek scriptures, liturgical texts, and patristic works.[69] From the 4th to 7th centuries, original worksincluding homilies, saints' lives, monastic rules, letters, and exhortationswere composed in Coptic, primarily in the Sahidic dialect.[70] As a writing system, Coptic was used for everyday purposes such as inventories and real estate transactions, as well as for poetry.[71] By the 640s, when Egypt came under Arab rule, Coptic-speaking Christians constituted the majority of the population.[72] At the end of the 7th century, legal texts might still be written in Coptic: in one example, a bilingual Greek-Arabic protocol with a reference to Mohammed precedes a document entirely in Coptic that invokes the Trinity.[73]\\r\\nPunic, the Semitic language of the Carthaginians, continued to be used in North Africa during the Imperial period.[74] Before the Roman conquest in 146 BC, nearly all Punic inscriptions had been votives to the deities Tanit and Ba'al or funerary commemorations, but during the Roman era a broader range of content is found in Neo-Punic, often appearing with parallel texts in Latin or Greek.[75] A striking occurrence of Neo-Punic is found at the otherwise thoroughly Roman temple of Roma and Augustus, built 14ÿ19 AD at Leptis Magna.[76] One of the latest Neo-Punic inscriptions on a monument dates to the reign of Domitian (81ÿ96 AD).[77] No inscription in Punic script on stone can be dated later than the 2nd or 3rd century.[78] Latin script was used to write Punic in the 4th and 5th centuries.[79]\\r\\nPunic was spoken at the highest level of society: the emperor Septimius Severus (reigned 193ÿ211) was born in Leptis Magna and spoke Punic as well as Latin and Greek, while his sister supposedly had little command of Latin at all.[80] Augustine, who was from North Africa, several times mentions Punic; he observed that it was related to Hebrew and Syriac, and his knowledge of Punic helped him figure out transliterated Semitic words from the Bible.[81]\\r\\nCeltic languages at the beginning of the Imperial period include Gaulish, spoken in Gaul (Gallia, present-day France, Belgium, Switzerland and northern Italy); Celtiberian, in parts of Hispania (Spain and Portugal); Brittonic in Britannia (Roman Britain), and Galatian, a branch of Celtic brought to Anatolia by the Gallic invasions of the 3rd century BC. The place name Galatia, a Roman province, derives from the Greek word for \\"Gauls\\" or \\"Celts\\", Galatai. Loanwords from Gaulish are recorded in Latin as early as the time of Ennius (ca. 239ÿ169 BC), due to the presence of Celtic settlements on the Italian peninsula.[82] By late antiquity, some Gaulish words had become so Latinized that their origin was no longer recognized as such.[83]\\r\\nCeltiberian is documented as a written language only after contact with the Romans in the 2nd century BC.[84] Of 103 Celtiberian inscriptions, thirty in Iberian script are hospitality tokens (tesserae hospitales), twenty of which are in the shape of animals.[85] The social custom of pledging mutual support among families or communities was compatible with hospitium in Roman culture, and the Celtiberians continued to produce the tokens, though switching to Latin, into the 2nd century of the Imperial era.[86] Under Augustus, the territory of the Celtiberians became part of the Tarraconensis province.[87] Written Celtiberian ceases early in the reign of Augustus, if not before.[88]\\r\\nSeveral references to Gaulish in late antiquity may indicate that it continued to be spoken. Irenaeus, bishop of Lugdunum (present-day Lyon) from 177 AD, complains that he has to communicate with his parishioners in their \\"barbarous tongue\\", probably Gaulish.[89] The jurist Ulpian (170ÿ228) mentions the need to recognize Gaulish verbal contracts.[90] Lampridius says that a druidess made a prophecy in Gaulish to Alexander Severus (208ÿ235).[91] Jerome (331ÿ420), who had first-hand knowledge, observes that the Gallic Treveri speak a language \\"more or less the same\\" as that of the Galatians.[92] The collection of pharmacological recipes by Marcellus of Bordeaux (late 4th- or early 5th-century) contains several Gaulish words, mainly plant names, and seems to indicate that the language remained in use for at least some purposes such as traditional medicine and magic.[93] Sulpicius Severus (363ÿ425), also from Gallia Aquitania, takes note of Gaulish-Latin bilingualism, with Gaulish as the first language. Other mentions of people who speak \\"in the Gallic manner\\" (gallice) or similar may refer to speaking Latin with a regional Gaulish accent.[94]\\r\\nNext to nothing is recorded of the Germanic languages spoken in the Empire, with the exception of Gothic. A phrase of Gothic is quoted in an elegiac couplet from the Latin Anthology,[95] and more substantially parts of the Gospels were translated into Gothic and preserved by the 6th-century Codex Argenteus.[96] While Latin gained some Germanic loanwords, most linguistic influence ran the other way.[97]\\r\\nBilingualism in a Germanic language and Latin was especially important in the military for officers in command of units recruited from Germanic-speaking areas. Tacitus observes that Arminius, the Cheruscan officer who later led a disastrously successful rebellion against the Romans, was bilingual.[98] The emperor Julian employed a bilingual Germanic military tribune as a spy.[99] The officers and secretaries who kept the records preserved in the Vindolanda tablets were Batavian, but their Latin contains no hint; the common soldiers of their units, however, may have retained their Germanic speech.[100] Less commonly, Latin-speaking officers learned a Germanic language through their service and acted as interpreters.[101] Acquiring Germanic might be regarded as a dubious achievement inducing anxieties of \\"barbarism\\": in 5th-century Gaul, Sidonius thinks it funny that his learned friend Syagrius has become fluent in Germanic.[102]\\r\\nTrilingualism was perhaps not uncommon among educated people who came from regions where a language other than Latin or Greek was spoken. The Latin novelist Apuleius also wrote in Greek, and had learned Punic from his mother.[103] The Babatha Archive is a suggestive example of practical multilingualism. These papyri, named for a Jewish woman in the province of Arabia and dating from 93 to 132 AD, mostly employ Aramaic, the local language, written in Greek characters with Semitic and Latin influences; a petition to the Roman governor, however, was written in Greek.[104]\\r\\nOne striking example of multilingualism as well as multiculturalism in the Empire is a 2nd-century epitaph for a woman named Regina, discovered in 1878 near the Roman fort at South Shields, northeast England. The inscription is written in Latin and Palmyrene Aramaic, the language of Regina's husband, Barates, who has been identified with a standardbearer (vexillarius) of that name from Palmyra, Syria.[105] He was most likely in the military stationed along Hadrian's Wall. The Latin, however, is constructed grammatically in the manner of Greek honorific inscriptions typical of Palmyra, suggesting that Barates was bilingual in Aramaic and Greek, and added Latin as a third language. The Latin portion is larger and longer, and provides most of the information. The Palmyrene is carved in a fluid cursive script, and conveys only the name of Regina and an expression of grief. Since few people in Britain could have read Palmyrene, its use may be Barates' personal statement of his identity and emotions. A fourth linguistic element is the name Regina, which can be either Latin or Celtic. Such names seem often to have been chosen for their deliberate duality. Regina herself is identified as from the British Catuvellauni, a people whose civitas capital was Verulamium, but the Gallo-Brittonic spelling Catuallauna (feminine) is used in the Latin inscription.[106]\\r\\nIn Italy, the written use of Latin had replaced Oscanlike Latin, an Italic languageand Etruscan by the end of the 1st century AD.[107] Oscan graffiti are preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD at Pompeii, which was in the Oscan region, and a couple may date after the earlier eruption in 63.[108] In the mid-1st century, the emperor Claudius, who had keen antiquarian interests, knew Etruscan and wrote a multivolume history of the Etruscans, but the work has not survived.[109]\\r\\nMultilingualism had been characteristic of Sicily for centuries, resulting from occupations by the Carthaginians, Greeks, and Romans. While the slave trade during the Republican period brought speakers of Greek and other languages from the East to the island, Greek was the language of higher-status persons such as government officials and businessmen during the Imperial era.[110] Immigration to Sicily in the early Empire originated more often in places where Latin was spoken than in Greek-speaking areas. African speakers of Latin were a significant presence in Sicily.[111] Christian inscriptions are far more likely to be in Greek.[112] In late antiquity, Greek-Latin bilingualism was common enough that it would have been acquired through everyday personal interaction.[113] The Jewish communities of Syracuse seem to have been bilingual in Greek and Hebrew.[114] There is some Sicilian evidence of Syriac.[115]\\r\\nIn the Western Empire, Latin gradually replaced the Celtic languages, which were related to it by a shared Indo-European origin. Commonalities in syntax and vocabulary facilitated the adoption of Latin.[116] Mediterranean Gaul (southern France) had become trilingual (Greek, Latin, Gaulish) by the mid-1st century BC.[117] The importance of Latin in gaining access to the ruling power structure caused the rapid extinction of inscriptions in scripts that had been used to represent local languages on the Iberian peninsula (Hispania) and in Gaul. Among other aspects of a distinctive Gallo-Roman culture was the creation of Gallo-Latin text.[118] In Latin commemorative inscriptions, individuals with Celtic names rarely identify themselves as \\"Celtic\\" or \\"Gallic\\"; they are much more likely to name the people of their civitas (such as Aedui, Remi, Pictones)[119] or their voting tribe (tribus) as Roman citizens. Several major writers of Latin came from the Iberian peninsula in the Imperial period, including Seneca, Lucan, Quintilian,[120] Martial, and Prudentius.\\r\\nMost of the 136 Greek inscriptions from Mediterraean Gaul (the Narbonensis), including those from originally Greek colonies, are post-Augustan.[121] Their content indicates that Greek was used increasingly for specialized purposes: \\"education, medicine, acting, agonistic activities, art, magic, religion, including Christianity\\".[122] Inscriptions from Marseilles (ancient Massilia), founded as a Greek Phocaean colony around 600 BC, show the continued use of Greek, especially in education and medicine, into the 2nd and 3rd centuries of the Imperial era.[123] In the 4th century, the Latin poet and scholar Ausonius, from Gallia Aquitania (present-day Bordeaux), characterizes his physician father as speaking Attic Greek with more eloquence than Latin.[124]\\r\\nBasque, not an Indo-European language, survived in the region of the Pyrenees.[125] The people of southwestern Gaul and northeastern Hispania (roughly present-day Aquitaine and Navarre) were regarded by Julius Caesar as ethnically distinct from the Celts, and the Aquitanian language they spoke was Vasconic like Basque, judging from place names. The Aquitani adopted Latin under Roman rule.[126]\\r\\nGaulish was probably spoken in central and northern parts of Gaul into the 4th and possibly 5th century, and in Brittany (ancient Aremorica) perhaps into the 6th.[127] Latin did not become as deeply entrenched in the province of Britannia, and may have dwindled rapidly after the Roman withdrawal around 410 AD, although pockets of Latin-speaking Britons survived in western Britain until about 700 AD.[128][129] The evidence of Latin loanwords into Brittonic suggests that the Latin of Roman Britain was academic, in contrast to the everyday conversational Latin (\\"Vulgar\\" Latin) on the continent.[130]\\r\\nIn the provinces of Africa westwards of Cyrenaica (a region colonised by Greeks since the 7th century BC), the people of Carthage and other Phoenician colonies spoke and wrote Punic, with Latin common in urban centers. Other Roman Africans spoke Afroasiatic languages (Libyan, Numidian), debatably early versions of Berber.[131]\\r\\nPunic was used for legends on coins during the time of Tiberius (1st century AD), and Punic inscriptions appear on public buildings into the 2nd century, some bilingual with Latin.[132] Inscriptions might also be trilingual: one pertaining to Imperial cult presents \\"the official Latin, the local Punic, and the Greek of passing traders and an educated or cosmopolitan elite\\".[133]\\r\\nInscriptions in Libyan use a script similar to tifinagh, usually written vertically from the bottom up. The 23 characters are \\"of a rather rigid geometric form\\".[134] Bilingual examples are found with either Punic or Latin, and indicate that some people who could write these languages could also at least transliterate their names into the Libyan script. Although Libyan inscriptions are concentrated southeast of Hippo, near the present-day Algerian-Tunisia border, their distribution overall suggests that knowledge of the language was not confined to isolated communities.[135]\\r\\nNotable writers of Latin from Africa during the Imperial period include the novelist Apuleius, and the Church Fathers Tertullian and Augustine. Latin-speaking communities remained in North Africa, particularly around Carthage, during the period of the Vandal Kingdom (435ÿ534), but died out by the late 7th century, with the Arab conquest.[136]\\r\\nIn Egypt, Coptic predominated,[137] but Greek had been in use since the conquest of Alexander, and Latin and Greek were the administrative languages during the Roman Imperial period.[138] Alexandria, founded in 331 BC under Greek rule and one of the three largest cities of the Roman Empire, was a leading city in Greek intellectual life during the Hellenistic and Imperial periods. Famed for the Library of Alexandria, it was also a center for the dissemination of Christianity, which spread first among Greek speakers in Egypt.[139]\\r\\nAround 700 AD, Greek was replaced for administrative use by Arabic, the language of the conquerors. Coptic began to decline, and from this point was preserved mainly for liturgical purposes.[140]\\r\\nAlthough Greek was in common use around the Mediterranean and into Asia Minor even beyond Imperial borders, linguistic distribution in the eastern part of the Empire was complex. Now-extinct languages in Anatolia included Galatian (the form of Celtic introduced by invading Gauls in the 3rd century BC), Phrygian, Pisidian, and Cappadocian, attested by Imperial-era inscriptions.[141] Christian sources also mention the survival of Galatian, Cappadocian, Mysian, and Isaurian in Asia Minor.[142] Like Greek and Latin, these are categorized as Indo-European. Phrygian is not named as a language in a literary text until the 6th century, but is preserved in about a hundred funerary inscriptions in Greek script, most accompanied by Greek text as well and dating from the 3rd century.[143] A Cappadocian accent in speaking Greek seems to be mentioned in a few sources.[144]\\r\\nOutside the military, Latin never became the language of everyday life in the East. An exception was the Roman colony of Berytus (present-day Beirut), where a Latin education could be obtained, and which became famous for its school of Roman law.[145]\\r\\nThe Danubian provinces lay within a geographical area encompassing the middle and lower Danube basins, the Eastern Alps, the Dinarides, and the Balkans. Provinces in this general region include Noricum, Dacia, Dalmatia, Moesia, Thrace, Scythia, and Pannonia.[146] The relative influence of Latin versus Greek and vice versa in this area and in the Balkans in general, is sometimes demarcated by the Jire?ek Line.\\r\\nGreek had been in use in the southern part of the Balkans since the late 4th century BC, as a result of the Macedonian conquests of Philip and Alexander. The ancient Macedonian language, perhaps a Greek dialect,[147] may have been spoken in some parts of what is now Macedonia and northern Greece; to the north of this area, Paeonian would have been used, and to the south Epirot, both scantily attested.[148]\\r\\nIllyrian was spoken in the northwest, and to the northeast Thracian and Dacian.[149] These three languages, all Indo-European, are sometimes thought to be earlier forms of Albanian.[150] From his exile in Tomis on the Black Sea (present-day Constan?a, Romania), the Augustan poet Ovid learned Getic and Sarmatian, and noted that Greek was spoken with a markedly Getic accent.[151] Inscriptions from Tomis in the Imperial period are generally Greek, with Thracian personal names and religious references.[152]\\r\\nInscriptions in Greek and Latin set up by Jews attest to Jewish bi- or multilingualism, and their distribution in the Empire reflects the Jewish diaspora.[153] These may have the Hebrew tag shalom at the end.[154] Evidence for Jews in Egypt is preserved by papyri until the Jewish revolt of 116ÿ117.[155] In the first half of the 5th century, Greek coexisted with Hebrew and Jewish Aramaic in the Jewish communities of Palaestina Prima and Secunda, and is found in mosaic inscriptions even in synagogues.[156]\\r\\nLike the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible that predated the Imperial era, Jewish literature in Greek under the Empire was written mainly for Jews who spoke Greek.[157] Some Jews writing in Greek during the late Hellenistic and early Imperial periodnotably the philosopher Philo and the historian Josephusincluded gentiles among their intended audience.[158] The Sibylline Oracles and the Wisdom of Solomon are other examples of Jewish literature in Greek from this general period.[159]\\r\\nNo surviving Greek texts written after the year 100 can be securely identified as having a Jewish author. After this time, Jewish writings in Greek became irrelevant to Christians, who were thus unlikely to preserve them. The manuscription tradition of medieval Jewish culture has preserved only writings in Hebrew and Aramaic.[160]\\r\\nThe Epistle to Diognetus states that language was not a determining factor in Christian identity; Christians might speak any language.[161] By late antiquity, at least some Christian literature had been created for virtually every language in regular use throughout the Empire.[162]\\r\\nThe international use of Greek was one factor enabling the spread of Christianity, as indicated for example by the use of Greek for the Epistles of Paul.[164] Constantine, the first emperor to convert to Christianity, presumably knew some Greek, but Latin was spoken in his court, and he used an interpreter to address Greek-speaking bishops at the Council of Nicaea.[165] In the Christian Latin West, Greek became associated with \\"paganism\\" and regarded as a foreign language (lingua peregrina).[166] Saint Augustine confessed that he loathed Greek and found it hard to learn.[167] By late antiquity, however, it was possible to speak Greek as a primary language while not conceiving of oneself as a \\"Hellene\\" in matters of religion and culture.[168] In the first half of the 5th century, Greek was the standard language in which bishops communicated,[169] and the Acta Conciliorum (\\"Acts of the Church Councils\\") were recorded originally in Greek and then translated into Latin, Syriac, or Coptic.[170] During this period, Latin played only a subordinate role in the ecumenical councils, as did representatives from the Western empire.[171] Although traditionally Armenian is regarded as having been established as a Christian language by this time, it does not appear in the Acta.[172] There are hints that Coptic might be spoken at the councils, but no secure record.[173] On-the-spot translation into Greek was available for the participant who used his own language, including some who are referred to as \\"Arabs\\", \\"Saracens\\" or \\"Ishmaelites\\".[174] Christian content has been found in a few Arabic inscriptions from the 6th century.[175]\\r\\nThe form of private or personalized ritual characterized as \\"magic\\"[176] might be conducted in a hodgepodge of languages. Magic, and even some therapies for illnesses, almost always involved incantation or the reciting of spells (carmina), often accompanied by the ritualized creation of inscribed tablets (lamellae) or amulets. These are known from both archaeological artifacts and written texts such as the Greek Magical Papyri, a collection of spells dating variously from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD. Although Augustus attempted to suppress magic by burning some 2,000 esoteric books early in his reign,[177] magical practices were disseminated widely throughout the Greco-Roman world, and attest to an awareness of multilingualism among the peoples of the Empire.[178] Spells were not translated, because their efficacy was thought to reside in their precise wording;[179] a language such as Gaulish thus may have persisted for private ritual purposes when it no longer had everyday currency.[180]\\r\\nThe Greek Magical Papyri (PGM) reflect Greco-Egyptian syncretism, incorporating not only Egyptian and Hellenistic religion, but Near Eastern elements, including Jewish magic and dashes of Christian magic. Egyptian and Greek deities, the God of the Jews and Judaic angels, and Jesus are named. The PGM are written primarily in Greek with substantial passages in Demotic Egyptian[181] and inserted strings of syllables that are \\"pronounceable, though unintelligible\\".[182] These voces magicae (\\"magic words\\") occur throughout magic texts and inscriptions,[183] and often suggest corrupt Coptic or Egyptian,[184] Hebrew,[185] Aramaic or other Semitic languages,[186] and Celtic.[187] Hebrew and Greek appear in Demotic magical texts; Coptic magic incorporates Hebrew; Egyptian pops up in Latin spells.[188] While many voces magicae may be deliberate neologisms or obscurantism,[189] scholars have theorized that the more recognizable passages may be the products of garbled or misunderstood transmission, either in copying a source text or transcribing oral material.[190]\\r\\nInscriptions for the practice of magic in Gaul show the characteristic use of Greek for spells in the Imperial period. A 2nd-century curse tablet from Autun (Augustodunum) lists the names of those to be cursed in Latin, two magic words in Greek, and a series of voces magicae.[191] A defixio (binding spell) from Amlie-les-Bains seems composed in Celtic with bits of Latin.[192] A lamella from Roman Britain has been interpreted as Hebrew written in Greek characters.[193]\\r\\nChristians in late antiquity might insert Hebrew into Greek exorcisms.[194] Saint Jerome reports an odd story about a Frankish-Latin bilingual man of the Candidati Imperial bodyguard who, in a state of demonic possession, began speaking perfect Aramaic, a language he did not know.[195]\\r\\nRoman law was written in Latin, and the \\"letter of the law\\" was tied strictly to the words in which it was expressed.[196] Any language, however, could be binding in more general verbal contracts and procedures grounded in the ius gentium or international law.[197] The ius gentium was not a written legal code, but was thought to exist among all peoples as a matter of natural law. Roman jurists show a concern for local languages such as Punic, Gaulish, and Aramaic in assuring the correct understanding and application of laws and oaths.[198]\\r\\nWhile the birth certificates and wills of Roman citizens had to be written in Latin until the 220s,[199] in the legal opinion of Ulpian (ca. 215), fideicommissa (bequests in trust[200]) were not limited to Latin or even Greek, but could also be created in \\"Punic, Gaulish or any other\\" language.[201] Originally, a testator's fideicommissum placed the heir under a moral rather than legal obligation,[202] and Ulpian asserted that \\"any kind of speech contains the obligation of its words, provided that each party understands the other's language himself or through accurate interpreters\\".[203] The jurist Gaius distinguished between verbal contracts that derived their validity from formulaic utterance in Latin, and obligations expressing a mutual understanding of the ius gentium regardless of whether the parties were Roman or not.[204]\\r\\nAfter the decentralization of political power in late antiquity, Latin developed locally in the Western provinces into branches that became the Romance languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Romanian and Catalan. As an international language of learning and literature, Latin itself continued as an active medium of expression for diplomacy and for intellectual developments identified with Renaissance humanism up to the 17th century, and for law and the Roman Catholic Church to the present.[205]\\r\\nGreek continued as the language of the Byzantine Empire, but never replaced certain Afroasiatic languages with which it had long coexistedprimarily Coptic in Egypt, and Aramaic in Syria and Mesopotamia.[206]","input":"How did rome contribute to the development of world languages?"},{"output":"Massachusetts","context":"American Football League (1960ÿ1969)\\r\\nNational Football League (1970ÿpresent)\\r\\nNavy Blue, Red, Silver, White[2][3]\\r\\nLeague championships (5)\\r\\nConference championships (10)\\r\\nDivision championships (20)\\r\\nThe New England Patriots are a professional American football team based in the Greater Boston region. The Patriots compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Gillette Stadium in the town of Foxborough, Massachusetts, which is located 21 miles (34?km) southwest of downtown Boston, Massachusetts and 20 miles (32?km) northeast of downtown Providence, Rhode Island. The Patriots are also headquartered at Gillette Stadium.\\r\\nAn original member of the American Football League (AFL), the Patriots joined the NFL in the 1970 merger of the two leagues. The team changed its name from the original Boston Patriots after relocating to Foxborough in 1971. The Patriots played their home games at Foxboro Stadium from 1971 to 2001, then moved to Gillette Stadium at the start of the 2002 season. The Patriots' rivalry with the New York Jets is considered one of the most bitter rivalries in the NFL.\\r\\nThe Patriots have appeared in the Super Bowl ten times in franchise history, the most of any team, eight of them since the arrival of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady in 2000. The Patriots have since become one of the most successful teams in NFL history, winning 15 AFC East titles in 17 seasons since 2001, without a losing season in that period. The franchise has since set numerous notable records, including most wins in a ten-year period (126, in 2003ÿ2012), an undefeated 16-game regular season in 2007, the longest winning streak consisting of regular season and playoff games in NFL history (a 21-game streak from October 2003 to October 2004), and the most consecutive division titles won by a team in NFL history (won nine straight division titles from 2009 to 2017). The team owns the record for most Super Bowls reached (eight) and won (five) by a head coachÿquarterback tandem. Currently, the team is tied with the 49ers and Cowboys for the second most Super Bowl wins with five, after the Steelers, who have six.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 16, 1959, Boston business executive Billy Sullivan was awarded the eighth and final franchise of the developing American Football League (AFL). The following winter, locals were allowed to submit ideas for the Boston football team's official name. The most popular choice ÿ and the one that Sullivan selected ÿ was the \\"Boston Patriots,\\" with \\"Patriots\\" referring to those colonists of the Thirteen Colonies who rebelled against British control during the American Revolution and in July 1776 declared the United States of America an independent nation. Immediately thereafter, artist Phil Bissell of The Boston Globe developed the \\"Pat Patriot\\" logo.[6]\\r\\nThe Patriots struggled for most of their years in the AFL, and they never had a regular home stadium. Nickerson Field, Harvard Stadium, Fenway Park, and Alumni Stadium all served as home fields during their time in the American Football League. They played in only one AFL championship game, following the 1963 season, in which they lost to the San Diego Chargers 51ÿ10. They did not appear again in an AFL or NFL post-season game for another 13 years.[6]\\r\\nWhen the NFL and AFL merged in 1970, the Patriots were placed in the American Football Conference (AFC) East division, where they still play today.[6] The following year, the Patriots moved to a new stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which would serve as their home for the next 30 years. As a result of the move, they announced they would change their name from the Boston Patriots to the Bay State Patriots.[5] The name was rejected by the NFL and on March 22, 1971, the team officially announced they would change its geographic name to New England.[6]\\r\\nDuring the 1970s, the Patriots had some success, earning a berth to the playoffs in 1976as a wild card teamand in 1978as AFC East champions. They lost in the first round both times. In 1985, they returned to the playoffs, and made it all the way to Super Bowl XX, which they lost to the Chicago Bears 46ÿ10. Following their Super Bowl loss, they returned to the playoffs in 1986, but lost in the first round. The team would not make the playoffs again for eight more years. During the 1990 season, the Patriots went 1ÿ15. They changed ownership three times in the ensuing 14 years, being purchased from the Sullivan family first by Victor Kiam in 1988, who sold the team to James Orthwein in 1992. Orthwein intended to move the team to his native St. Louis, Missouri (where it would have been renamed as the St. Louis Stallions), but instead sold the team in 1994 to its current owner Robert Kraft.[6]\\r\\nThough Orthwein's period as owner was short and controversial, he did oversee major changes to the team, first with the hiring of former New York Giants coach Bill Parcells in 1993. Orthwein and his marketing team also commissioned the NFL to develop a new visual identity and logo, and changed their primary colors from the traditional red, white and blue to blue and silver for the team uniforms.[7] Parcells would bring the Patriots to two playoff appearances, including Super Bowl XXXI, which they lost to the Green Bay Packers by a score of 35ÿ21. Pete Carroll, Parcells's successor, would also take the team to the playoffs twice in 1997 & 1998 before being dismissed as head coach after the 1999 season.[6]\\r\\nThe Patriots' current coach, Bill Belichick, was hired in 2000, and a new home field, Gillette Stadium, was opened in 2002. Under Belichick, the team won three Super Bowls in four years (2001, 2003, and 2004). The Patriots finished the 2007 regular season with a perfect 16ÿ0 record, becoming only the fourth team in league history to go undefeated in the regular season, and the only one since the league expanded its regular season schedule to 16 games.[6] After advancing to Super Bowl XLII, the team's fourth Super Bowl in seven years, the Patriots were defeated by the Giants to end their bid for a 19ÿ0 season. With the loss, the Patriots ended the year at 18ÿ1, becoming only one of three teams to go 18ÿ1 along with the 1984 San Francisco 49ers and the 1985 Chicago Bears. The Patriots' returned to the Super Bowl in 2012 but lost again to the Giants, 21ÿ17.[8] In 2015, they won Super Bowl XLIX, defeating the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 28ÿ24.[9] The Patriots became the first team to reach nine Super Bowls in the 2016ÿ17 playoffs and faced the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI,[10] which ended up paving the way for their fifth Super Bowl victory,[11] tying them with the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers for the second-most in NFL history, 1 behind the Pittsburgh Steelers with 6; the game was also the first Super Bowl to go into overtime.[12]\\r\\nThe Patriots became the first team to reach ten Super Bowls in the 2017ÿ18 playoffs but lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII, on February 4, 2018, at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota.[13]\\r\\nIn terms of number of games played, the Patriots have competed most against teams either currently or formerly from the AFC East division. This includes the current teams, the New York Jets, the Miami Dolphins, and the Buffalo Bills, as well as former divisional opponents the Indianapolis Colts. Among those, however, a few run deeper than others.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe closest geographically has been the rivalry with the New York Jets.[20] The Patriots and Jets have been in the same division (what is now the AFC East) since both teams' foundings in 1960, and have played each other at least twice a year since then.[21] The rivalry between the Jets and Patriots has escalated since 1996, when Patriots head coach Bill Parcells left the Patriots under controversy to become the head coach of the Jets; he was replaced by former Jets coach Pete Carroll.[21] Four years later Carroll was fired, and Parcells's assistant, Bill Belichick, resigned the day he was named the Jets' head coach to become the head coach of the Patriots.[22] Six years after that, Eric Mangini, an assistant under Belichick, became the head coach of the Jets.[23]\\r\\nBill Belichick achieved his 200th career head coaching win (regular season and playoffs) on November 22, 2012, defeating the Jets 49ÿ19; it was his 163rd such win as Patriots coach.[24] The Patriots defeated the Jets in Week seven of the 2015 season by a score of 30ÿ23, to give them a 6ÿ0 record to date. [25]\\r\\nThe Patriots rivalry with the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts ran through the two clubs' tenure together in the AFC East (1970ÿ2001). The two clubs clashed in several close games, such as on December 19, 1971, as a late Patriots touchdown decided a 21ÿ17 New England win; on September 18, 1978, the Colts rallied to defeat the Patriots 34ÿ27 on Monday Night Football on a virtual one-man scoring rampage by running back Joe Washington; on September 4, 1983, the Colts defeated the Patriots in overtime 29ÿ23 in their final season in Baltimore.[26] The Patriots defeated the Colts in back-to-back overtime games, 23ÿ17 on December 8, 1991, and 37ÿ34 on November 15, 1992.[26]\\r\\nEven though the two clubs were placed in separate divisions in the NFL's 2002 divisional realignment, their rivalry did not diminish. At that time, both teams were among the best in the AFC, and both were led by likely Hall of Fame quarterbacks, Peyton Manning (for the Colts) and Tom Brady (for the Patriots) The teams met three times in four years (2003, 2004, 2006) in the playoffs, with the winner going on to win that season's Super Bowl each time. The Manning portion of the rivalry began in Manning's rookie season, 1998; in 1999 Manning suffered a bitter 31ÿ28 loss in September as the Patriots behind Drew Bledsoe erased a 28ÿ7 Colts lead, then defeated the Patriots 20ÿ15 in Indianapolis on December 12. The BradyÿManning portion of the rivalry began on September 30, 2001, as Brady made his first NFL start in a 44ÿ13 Patriots win at Foxboro; on October 21 the Patriots defeated the Colts at the RCA Dome 38ÿ17.[26]\\r\\nAfter the Colts left the AFC East in 2002, they first met on November 30, 2003, in a 38ÿ34 Patriots win decided on a last-second goal line stand by the Patriots.[26] The Colts broke a six-game Patriot winning streak in the rivalry in November 2005,[26] then won twice in 2006;[26] in the AFC Championship Game the Colts erased a 21ÿ6 halftime lead; the game lead tied or changed seven times in the second half before a late touchdown led to a 38ÿ34 Colts win. The November 4, 2007, meeting involved both teams being unbeaten to that point; the 8ÿ0 Patriots and the 7ÿ0 Colts. The Patriots rallied to win 24ÿ20.[27] The Colts won again in 2008 and then erased a large Patriots lead in 2009's 4th and 2 game. Manning's final meeting with the Patriots as a Colt came in November 2010; a late interception sealed a 31ÿ28 Patriots win.[28] In 2012, the Patriots faced the Colts, quarterbacked now by Andrew Luck, on November 18; the Patriots defeated the Colts 59ÿ24.[29] The Patriots also beat the Colts on January 12, 2014, 43ÿ22.[30] The Patriots played the Colts in the playoffs again on January 18, 2015, in the AFC title game, winning 45ÿ7.[31]\\r\\nThe Patriots and the Bills were both charter members of the AFL, and even competed with each other in an AFL playoff game. They have remained divisional rivals since the NFL-AFL merger. Prior to the rise of Tom Brady, the two teams shared a mellow, yet occasionally competitive rivalry, featuring highlights from players such as O.J. Simpson, Steve Grogan, Joe Ferguson, Jim Kelly, and Drew Bledsoe. However, Brady has dominated the Bills ever since taking over as the Patriots' franchise quarterback, holding a 26-3 regular season record over them.[32] Though Patriots fans usually feel apathetic towards the Bills, Bills fans have come to despise the Patriots more than any other rival.[33] The rivalry has remained somewhat intense in recent years with multiple players having played for both teams, the Bills usually giving their all when playing the Patriots, and the presence of Rex Ryan, who coached both the Bills and Jets and was known for his trash-talk.[34]\\r\\nThe Patriots first played the Miami Dolphins in 1966 in the AFL, when Miami was one of two expansion teams to debut that year in that league. The Dolphins dominated the Patriots in the 1970s and 1990s, but the two teams remained competitive with each other for years before the rise of Tom Brady. Brady, however, struggled occasionally against the Dolphins in the 2000s before reasserting dominance in the 2010s. The Patriots and Dolphins are the only two teams in the Super Bowl era to post undefeated regular season records, with Miami going 14-0 in 1972 and the Patriots going 16-0 in 2007.[35] Notable moments between the clubs include the Snowplow Game, three playoff matchups, and the Dolphins revealing their Wildcat offense against the Patriots.[36]\\r\\nThe Ravens first met the New England Patriots in 1996,[37] but the rivalry truly started in 2007 when the Ravens suffered a bitter 27ÿ24 loss in the Patriots' quest for perfection.[38] The rivalry began to escalate in 2009 when the Ravens lost to the Patriots 27ÿ21 in a game that involved a confrontation between Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs.[39] Both players would go on to take verbal shots at each other through the media after the game. The Ravens defeated the Patriots in the 2009 AFC Wild Card playoff game, 33ÿ14.[40] This was the first time the Ravens had ever defeated the Patriots. The Ravens faced the Patriots in week six of the 2010 season. The Patriots ended up winning 23ÿ20 in overtime; the game caused controversy from a hit to the helmet of tight end Todd Heap by Patriots safety Brandon Meriweather.[41]\\r\\nThe Ravens played the Patriots for the third consecutive season in the 2012 AFC championship game, which the Ravens lost 23ÿ20.[42] The rivalry reached a new level of friction with this, the second career playoff game between the two clubs. The Ravens clawed to a 20ÿ16 lead in the fourth quarter, but Patriots quarterback Tom Brady dove into the end zone to make the score 23ÿ20 with around 11 minutes remaining; this proved to be the winning touchdown.[42] On the Ravens' last possession of the game, quarterback Joe Flacco threw a pass to wide receiver Lee Evans in the corner of the end zone which looked to be the game-winning touchdown, before a last-second strip by Sterling Moore forced the ball from the hands of Evans, forcing the game to be decided on a last-minute field goal by Ravens placekicker Billy Cundiff.[42] With 11 seconds remaining on the clock, the kicker missed the 32-yard field goal attempt, allowing the Patriots to kill the clock on their way to Super Bowl XLVI for a rematch with the New York Giants.[42]\\r\\nThe Ravens' first regular-season win over the Patriots came on September 23, 2012. The game was emotional as receiver Torrey Smith was competing following the death of his brother in a motorcycle accident just the night before.[43] Smith caught two touchdowns in a back and forth game; the Ravens erased a 13ÿ0 lead in the first half and led 14ÿ13, but the Patriots scored at the end of the second quarter for a 20ÿ14 lead. The lead changed twice in the third quarter and the Patriots led 30ÿ21 in the fourth, but the Ravens scored on Smith's second touchdown catch. The Ravens were stopped on fourth down but the Patriots had to punt; in the final two minutes a pass interference penalty on Devin McCourty put the ball at the Patriots 7-yard line; new Ravens kicker Justin Tucker booted a 27-yard field goal on the final play; the ball sailed directly over the upright and was ruled good; the quality of officiating by replacement referees caused controversy as Bill Belichick angrily reached for one of the referees as they were leaving the field, leading to a $50,000 fine later that week.[44][45]\\r\\nThe two teams met again on January 20, 2013, in the AFC Championship, where the Ravens won 28ÿ13.[46] The Patriots led at halftime, 13ÿ7, but the Ravens defense gave up no points in the 2nd half.[46] It was the first time ever that Tom Brady lost a game at home after leading at halftime, and the first time a road team beat the Patriots in the AFC Championship.[46]\\r\\nThe two teams met once again at Gillette Stadium in the playoffs on January 10, 2015. The Patriots trailed by as much as 14 twice, before beating the Ravens 35ÿ31 to advance to the AFC Championship.[47]\\r\\nDuring the 2015 AFC Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts, allegations arose that the Patriots were utilizing under-inflated footballs. It was even suggested that the Patriots' staff themselves deliberately deflated the footballs to give their team an unfair advantage during the playoffs. [48][49] A lengthy investigation and heated debate commenced shortly afterwards, with a full report being published in May 2015.[50][51] The Wells Report found that balls provided by the Patriots, who were the home team, indeed had less pressure on average than the balls provided by the Colts. Also notable was the findings of some suggestions of communication between Tom Brady and two Patriots locker room attendants, indicating Brady was likely \\"generally aware\\" of the situation and that the Patriots staff intentionally deflated the footballs.[51] A later study by the American Enterprise Institute called the evidence and methodology of the Wells report \\"deeply flawed\\" and \\"unreliable\\".[52]\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the incident, the NFL suspended Brady without pay for the first four games of the 2015 season, fined the Patriots $1 million, and forced them to forfeit their 2016 first round draft pick and 2017 fourth round draft pick. Brady appealed his suspension, which was eventually vacated by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, only for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reinstate it a year later for the 2016 NFL season.[53] Brady eventually agreed to serve the suspension in 2016, but led the Patriots to win Super Bowl LI in spite of it.[54]\\r\\nUnder head coach Bill Belichick, the Patriots have employed specific on-field and off-field strategies. On the field, the Patriots have typically utilized an \\"ErhardtÿPerkins\\" offense and a \\"FairbanksÿBullough\\" 3ÿ4 defense, referred to commonly as a two-gap 3ÿ4 defensive system.[55] Their philosophy in making personnel decisions and in game planning has focused on the \\"team\\" concept,[56] stressing preparation, strong work ethic, versatility,[57] and lack of individual ego.[58] This approach, which has led to five Super Bowl victories under Belichick, was analyzed in the 2004 book Patriot Reign.\\r\\nWhen owner Robert Kraft purchased the team in 1994, he did so for $175 million. Since then, the Patriots have sold out every home game in both Foxboro Stadium and Gillette Stadium.[6] By 2009, the value of the franchise had increased by over $1 billion, to a Forbes magazine estimated value of $1.361 billion, third highest in the NFL only behind the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins.[59][60][61] As of July?2015[update], the Patriots are the seventh most valuable sports franchise in the world according to Forbes magazine.[62]\\r\\nSince 2002, the Patriots' home stadium has been Gillette Stadium, a $350 million facility privately financed by Kraft. It houses all administrative offices for the team and its owning entity, The Kraft Group, as well as the Kraft-owned Major League Soccer team, the New England Revolution.[63] The field, which was originally natural grass, was replaced with a FieldTurf surface during the 2006 season.[64] The area around the stadium was developed, beginning in 2007, into a $375 million \\"lifestyle and entertainment center\\" called Patriot Place; among its largest structures is a multi-floor restaurant and bar called CBS Scene.[65]\\r\\nPrior to 2002, the Patriots played in Foxboro Stadium dating back to 1971, the team's second year in the NFL after the AFLÿNFL merger.[63] During the team's days in the American Football League, the Boston Patriots were hosted by a number of fields in or around Bostonthey played at Braves Field, Harvard Stadium, Fenway Park, and Alumni Stadium.[63]\\r\\nThe Patriots original helmet logo was a simple tricorne hat, used only for the 1960 season. From 1961 to 1992, the Patriots used a logo of a Revolutionary War minuteman hiking a football. The Patriots script logo during this time consisted of a western-style font. The minuteman logo became known as the \\"Pat Patriot\\" logo, which later became the name of the team's mascot.[67]\\r\\nIn 1979, the Patriots worked with NFL Properties to design a new, streamlined logo, to replace the complex Pat Patriot logo. The new logo featured the blue and white profile of a minuteman in a tricorne hat set against a flag showing three red stripes separated by two white stripes. Team owner Billy Sullivan decided to put the new logo up to a vote against Pat Patriot with the fans at the September 23rd home game against the San Diego Chargers, using a sound level meter to judge the crowd's reaction. The new logo was decidedly rejected by the crowd in favor of Pat, and the concept was shelved.[68]\\r\\nIn 1993, a new logo was unveiled involving the gray face of a minuteman wearing a red, white and blue hat that begins as a tricorne and transitions into a flowing banner-like design. The logo bears some superficial resemblance to the aborted 1979 logo. It became popularly known as the \\"Flying Elvis\\" due to many observing its resemblance to the profile of a young Elvis Presley.[67] In 2000, the blue color was darkened.[67]\\r\\nOn July 3, 2013, the Patriots unveiled a new wordmark logo.[66]\\r\\nThe Patriots originally wore red jerseys with white block numbering at home, and white jerseys with red block numbering on the road. Both uniforms used white pants and white helmets, first with the hat logo over the player's number, then with the \\"Pat Patriot\\" logo starting in 1961.[69] A blue stripe was added to the two red helmet stripes in 1964.[69] The numbers on both the home and away jerseys gained a blue outline in 1973.[69] In 1979, the Patriots began the first of many sporadic runs of wearing red pants with the white jerseys.[69] The red pants were dropped in 1981, but returned in 1984. After being dropped again in 1988, they were used again from 1990 to 1992.[69]\\r\\nThe Patriots underwent a complete identity overhaul before the 1993 season, starting with the introduction of the aforementioned \\"Flying Elvis\\" logo. The new uniforms consisted of a royal blue home jersey and a white away jersey.[67] The helmet was silver with the Flying Elvis logo and no additional striping.[67] Both uniforms used silver pants, originally with stripes designed to look like those flowing from the Flying Elvis, but these were changed to simple red and blue stripes after one season. When they debuted, both the home and away jerseys used red block numbers with a blue and white outline, but after one season the home uniforms switched to the now-familiar white with a red outline.[70]\\r\\nIn 1995, the Patriots switched the block numbers to a more modern rounded number font with a dropshadow.[70] The Patriots were one of the first adopters of custom numbers, a trend that would grow drastically over the next 20 years.[70]\\r\\nHowever, in 2000, the Patriots also became one of the only teams to drop the rounded numbers and switched back to block numbers.[70] Also that year, the shade of blue was darkened from royal to nautical blue.[70] The Patriots, unsatisfied with the white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce blue pants to be worn with the white jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the blue pants, the number on the white jersey was switched from red to blue.[70]\\r\\nIn 1994, the Patriots wore the \\"Pat Patriot\\" helmets and plain white striped pants from two seasons prior as alternates as part of the NFL's 75th anniversary celebration. In 2002, NFL teams were allowed to add a permanent third jersey to be worn in a maximum of two games. The Patriots reintroduced a red jersey as their alternate, complimented with the old-style \\"Pat Patriot\\" helmet.[67] In 2003, the Patriots changed their alternate to a silver jersey with blue pants. For this uniform, the \\"Flying Elvis\\" helmet was utilized.[67] The uniform was identical to the white jersey with any areas of white replaced by silver. These uniforms were dropped after 2007. No alternate uniform was used in 2008. In 2009, the red alternate was reintroduced, again accompanied by the \\"Pat Patriot\\" helmet. An alternate white road jersey was also worn with the older helmet for one game, using red numbers, in tribute to the 50th anniversary of the AFL. The red alternate gained a blue outline around the numbers in 2010 and this was worn through 2012. The Patriots retired their alternate red uniforms in 2013, thanks to a new NFL rule outlawing throwback alternate helmets.[71]\\r\\nIn 2016, the Patriots took part in the NFL Color Rush program, wearing monochrome navy uniforms on September 22 against the Houston Texans.[72]\\r\\nRunning backs\\r\\nWide receivers\\r\\nTight ends\\r\\nDefensive linemen\\r\\nDefensive backs\\r\\nSpecial teams\\r\\nUnrestricted FAs\\r\\nRestricted FAs\\r\\nExclusive-Rights FAs\\r\\nRoster updated February 13, 2018\\r\\nDepth chart ?

In 2007, in advance of the 2008 opening of The Hall at Patriot Place, the Patriots introduced a new nomination committee to select three candidates, with the winner of an Internet fan vote being enshrined in the hall of fame.[74] In order to be eligible, players and coaches must be retired for at least four years.[75] Beginning in 2011, and meeting every five years, a senior selection committee has the option of voting a player who has been retired for at least 25 seasons into the hall of fame.[76]\\r\\nFormer owner Billy Sullivan was inducted by owner Robert Kraft in March 2009, the Patriots' 50th season, as a contributor.[77]\\r\\nAdditionally, four of these Patriots players have also been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

During each game, about ten men dressed as minutemen line the back of each end zone. When the Patriots score a touchdown, field goal, point-after-touchdown or safety, the militia behind the opposite end zone fire a volley of blanks from flintlock muskets. Per an interview with the Loren & Wally Show on WROR 105.7 FM in and around the time of Super Bowl XLIX, said shots use double the load of black powder than a regular historical reenactor does, specifically 200 grains, in order to be heard throughout the stadium. ESPN writer Josh Pahigian named this one of the top ten celebrations in the league in 2007.[104]\\r\\nThe Patriots' flagship radio station is WBZ-FM 98.5 FM, owned by CBS Radio.[105] The larger radio network is called the New England Patriots Radio Network, whose 37 affiliate stations span seven states.[105] Gil Santos and Gino Cappelletti were the longtime announcing team until their retirement following the conclusion of the 2012 NFL season. Santos was replaced by Bob Socci.[105] Former Patriots QB Scott Zolak joined the radio team in the 2011 season as a sideline analyst, and in 2013, he replaced Cappelletti as color commentator.[105]\\r\\nAny preseason games not on national television are shown on CBS's O&O WBZ-TV, who also airs the bulk of Patriots regular season games by virtue of CBS having the rights to most AFC games; CBS also has a presence at the nearby Patriot Place with the \\"CBS Scene\\" bar/restaurant. During the regular season whenever the Patriots host an NFC team, the games are aired on Fox affiliate WFXT-TV, and NBC Sunday Night Football games are carried by the \\"NBC Boston\\" network of stations led by WBTS-LD.[105] Preseason games were broadcast on ABC affiliate WCVB-TV from 1995 until the change to WBZ in 2009.[105] Don Criqui was play-by-play announcer for the 1995ÿ2012 seasons, with Randy Cross as a color commentator and Mike Lynch as a sideline reporter.[105] Lynch was replaced by WBZ reporter Steve Burton in 2009.[105]","input":"What state is the new england patriots football team from?"},{"output":"Eielson Air Force Base","context":"Eielson Air Force Base (AFB) (IATA: EIL, ICAO: PAEI, FAA LID: EIL) is a United States Air Force base located approximately 26 miles (42?km) southeast of Fairbanks, Alaska and just southeast of Moose Creek, Alaska. It was established in 1943 as Mile 26 Satellite Field and taken off deployment in 2007. It has been a Superfund site since 1989.\\r\\nIts host unit is the 354th Fighter Wing (354 FW) assigned to the Eleventh Air Force of the Pacific Air Forces. The 354 FW's primary mission is to support Red Flag ÿ Alaska, a series of Pacific Air Forces commanderÿdirected field training exercises for U.S. Forces, joint offensive counter-air, interdiction, close-air support, and large force employment training in a simulated combat environment. These exercises are conducted on the Joint Pacific Alaskan Range complex with air operations flown out of the two bases.\\r\\nEielson AFB was named in honor of polar pilot Carl Ben Eielson.[3] The 354 FW is currently commanded by Colonel David A. Mineau.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEielson is home to the 354th Fighter Wing which is part of the Eleventh Air Force (11 AF) of Pacific Air Forces. The 354th Fighter Wing mission is \\"To train, deliver, maintain and support combat power across the globe while taking care of our people, their families and our infrastructure.\\" To accomplish that mission, the wing implements flying operations, mission support, maintenance and medical care functions and is host to 10 tenant units.\\r\\nOn 7 June 1943, the Western Defense Command ordered construction of a new airfield near present-day Fort Wainwright, then an Army airfield named after Major Arthur K. Ladd. Because of its hazard-free approaches and relatively flat terrain, surveyor reports indicated a site a little more than twenty-five miles southeast of Ladd Army Airfield to be the best in the vicinity for military aviation. The field became known as \\"Mile 26\\" because of its proximity to a US Army Signal Corps telegraph station and a Richardson Highway milepost marker using the same designation.\\r\\nA month later, contractors and civilian crews from Ladd Field started laying out the new airfield. Actual construction began on 25 August 1943. Crews built two parallel runways, 165 feet (50?m) across and 6,625 feet (2,019?m) long. Other facilities included an operations building, housing for 108 officer and 330 enlisted personnel, and a ten-bed dispensary. The garrison and airfield totaled about 600 acres (2.4?km2). Completed on 17 October 1944, the 14-month project cost about eight-million dollars.\\r\\nOperational uses of Mile 26 were few. Ladd Field served as the debarkation point for the Alaska-Siberia Ferry Route of the lend-lease program and was the hub of activity. Lend-lease aircraft would occasionally land at Mile 26, but there are no records to indicate any lend-lease aircraft ever used the airfield to take off for Russia. Mile 26 closed when the war ended.\\r\\nThe base reopened in September 1946, once again as a satellite of Ladd Field. The first USAAF operational unit assigned to Eielson was the 57th Fighter Group, equipped successively with P-38 Lightnings, P/F-51 Mustangs, F-80 Shooting Stars, and F-94 Starfire aircraft. The 57th FG was inactivated on 13 April 1953.\\r\\nOn 1 December 1947 Strategic Air Command B-29 Superfortress bombers arrived at Mile 26 Field with the deployment of the 97th Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy, from Smoky Hill AFB, Kansas. The wing reported to Fifteenth Air Force, Strategic Air Command (SAC), although the Yukon Sector of the Alaskan Air Command controlled its operations. At the end of the Alaskan deployment the wing returned to Kansas on 12 March 1948.\\r\\nA year later, however, Eielson moved from under the shadow of Ladd Field when the Alaskan Air Command assumed organizational control. Also in the fall of 1947, Colonel Jerome B. McCauley assumed duties as commander. The primary missions of Mile 26 were to support Arctic training for USAF tactical and strategic units, as well as defend the base itself.\\r\\nHeadquarters USAF General Order 2, dated 13 January 1948, redesignated Mile 26 as Eielson AFB. It was named for Carl Ben Eielson, an Alaska aviation pioneer who was killed, along with his mechanic Earl Borland, in the crash of their Hamilton aircraft in 1929. Eielson and Borland were attempting a rescue flight to an icebound ship in the Bering Sea when they were killed. On 1 April 1948, the Eielson AFB Wing (Base Complement) was formed. The host-unit subsequently would be dubbed the Eielson AFB Bomb Wing, and finally, in January 1949, the 5010th Wing. Colonel John L. Nedwed, the third commander of the base since it fell under Alaskan Air Command fifteen months before, became the first to head the 5010th.\\r\\nFor the next 34 years, the 5010th (alternately known as the Wing, Composite Wing, Air Base Wing, and lastly, Combat Support Group) served as host-unit at Eielson. Construction boomed at Eielson AFB during the 1950s. Many of the facilities still in use today were built at that time, including Amber Hall, the Thunderdome, Base Exchange, Gymnasium, Theater, some of the schools, and many of the dormitories.\\r\\nThe 720th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, equipped with F-86 Sabres, was deployed to Eielson during 1954ÿ55. The 720th was a part of the 450th Fighter-Bomber Wing stationed at Foster AFB, Texas. The 720th was replaced by the 455th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (323d FBW), stationed at Bunker Hill AFB, Indiana.\\r\\nThe Air Defense Command deployed interceptors to Eielson during the 1960s. Det. 3, 317th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron from Elmendorf AFB Alaska deployed F-102 Delta Daggers and F-106 Delta Darts to the base between 1960ÿ69.\\r\\nThe Cold War saw the use of Eielson's expansive reservation as a maneuver area for the U.S. Army. The 1960s 171st Infantry Brigade (separate) and 172nd Infantry Brigade (separate) both trained here, both on a regular and extensive basis, not to mention units of the Alaska National Guard. Later in the 70s mid 80s the 172nd Infantry Brigade (the 171st Infantry Brigade was inactivated on 13 November 1972), followed by the 6th Infantry Division when the 172nd Infantry Brigade itself was deactivated on 15 April 1986 (it was reactivated again in Alaska on 17 April 1998, only to yet again be inactivated in Iraq on 14 December 2006)\\r\\nToday the 1st Brigade 25th Infantry Division and the 4th Brigade 25th Infantry Division can be found training there. Several important large scale winter field programs have been conducted here over the years as well, seeing large numbers of not only U.S. Army ground combat units from the lower 48 states, but also U.S. Marine Corps units, and even Canadian troops.\\r\\nThe 375th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, from the 308th Bombardment Group at Tinker AFB Oklahoma, arrived at Eielson on 5 March 1949. The 308th flew WB-29 Superfortresses. The unit was redesignated the 58th Strategic Weather Squadron on 21 February 1951 as part of the 303d Bombardment Wing at Davis-Monthan AFB Arizona.\\r\\nThe 58th Weather Squadron remained at Eielson until 8 August 1958.\\r\\nIn July 1960, the Strategic Air Command stationed the 4157th Combat Support Group (later Strategic Wing) at Eielson. The 6th Strategic Wing (6 SW) replaced the 4157 SW on 25 March 1967, relocating from Walker Air Force Base, New Mexico after its closure.\\r\\nThe 6th SW flew RCÿ135 strategic reconnaissance missions with an assigned squadron, and, with KCÿ135s deployed to Eielson from SAC, AFRES, and the ANG, conducted Alaska Tanker Task Force (ATTF) missions to support reconnaissance and numerous exercises for the Air Force and Navy.\\r\\nThe 6th SW remained at Eielson AFB until 1992.\\r\\nA new chapter for the base began 1 October 1981 when the 343d Composite Wing replaced the 5010th as Eielson's host unit. Flying squadrons assigned to the new wing included the 25th Tactical Air Support Squadron (TASS) and the 18th Fighter Squadron (18 FS). The 25 TASS, at Eielson since 1971, flew O-2 Skymaster and OV-10 Bronco aircraft until its inactivation in 1989; the newly assigned 18 FS operated A-10 Thunderbolt IIs until it converted to F-16 Fighting Falcons in 1991.\\r\\nIn 1984, the 343d Composite Wing was redesignated a Tactical Fighter Wing. Seven years later, in 1991, it was redesignated as the 343d Wing. Also that year, the 343d gained a second flying unit, the 11th Tactical Air Support Squadron (11 TASS), which flew OA-10s.\\r\\nOn 20 August 1993, the 354 FW replaced the 343d Wing. No personnel or equipment were affected by the change. Prior to its shutdown, the 343d was the oldest surviving air combat unit in Alaska, with a lineage dating back to the Aleutian Campaign. The 18 FS, whose history also dated back to World War II, remained active, but the 355 FS replaced the 11th TASS.\\r\\nAnother change involved the 3rd Fighter Training Squadron, which was replaced by the 353rd Fighter Squadron (later redesignated as a Combat Training Squadron).\\r\\nWithin the first year of its arrival the 354 FW hosted an Arctic combat search and rescue exercise between the United States, Canada, and Russia. Ironically, these were the same countries that took part in the search and recovery efforts that followed the fatal crash of Carl Ben Eielson and his mechanic, Earl Borland, in 1930 as they were attempting to fly relief supplies to the Nanuk.\\r\\nNote: The 343d FW 3d Fighter Training Squadron was replaced by the 353d Fighter Training Squadron from the 354th FW. The 3d Fighter Training Squadron had its origins with the 3d Tactical Fighter Squadron at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, being formed in March 1973. The 3d TFS received its A-7D aircraft from the then deployed 353d Tactical Fighter Squadron of the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing, deployed to Korat from Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina.\\r\\n-\\r\\nEielson Air Force Base was proposed to be a Superfund site on 14 July 1989, and was officially designated as such on 21 November 1989.[5]\\r\\nThe groundwater contains lead and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like benzene, xylene, and toluene. Several areas of underground petroleum-contaminated soil and floating petroleum product are the sources of continuing groundwater contamination. Ingesting or coming into direct contact with contaminated groundwater or soil can pose a potential health threat. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated fish were also found in the area.[6] Construction of the superfund site was complete in 1998.[7]\\r\\nIn 2014, Eielson tested waters and soils for perfluorinated compounds around areas where \\"Aqueous Film Forming Foam\\" had been used for firefighting and training. In March 2015, the base changed its source of drinking water, because contamination had been found. In April 2015, wells near Moose Creek, Alaska, the community to the north, were tested and found contaminated.[8] In July 2015, water from 132 Moose Creek wells, which serve more than 200 residences, was found to contain perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) above the health advisory level of 0.2 micrograms per liter by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The highest reading in Moose Creek was 2.09 micrograms per liter, and the highest level on Eielson reached 2,000 micrograms per liter at the site of a KC-135 aircraft fire in 1989. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation said \\"contamination stretches 6.5 miles from the south of Eielson's runway to the north of Moose Creek and is found up to 100 feet deep\\". As of August 2015[update] the extent of contamination was unknown and if there was one large plume or multiple small ones. The Air Force has held meetings to discuss the type of water filtration systems for affected homes.[9] As of May 2016[update], between 145 and 150 homes had well water with PFOS above the EPA health advisory concentrations; with EPA's national water quality standard announced in May 2016, 15 more homes in the Moose Creek community were added.[10]\\r\\nEielson Air Force Base first appeared on the 1970 U.S. Census as an unincorporated area. In 1980, it was made a census-designated place (CDP).\\r\\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 5,400 people, 1,448 households, and 1,414 families residing on the base. The population density was 40.1/km2 (103.8/mi2). There were 1,531 housing units at an average density of 11.4/km2 (29.4/mi2). The racial makeup of the base was 81.7% White, 9.4% Black or African American, 0.6% Native American, 2.1% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 2.2% from other races, and 3.9% from two or more races, and 5.8% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.[12]\\r\\nThere were 1,448 households out of which 77.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 92.4% were married couples living together, 2.7% have a female householder with no husband present, and 2.3% were non-families. 2.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 0.0% had someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.52 and the average family size was 3.55. At the base the population was spread out with 40.8% under the age of 18, 16.6% from 18 to 24, 41.2% from 25 to 44, 1.2% from 45 to 64, and 0.2% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females there were 110.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 114.7 males.[12]\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the base was $35,938, and the median income for a family was $35,688. Males had a median income of $24,961 versus $21,432 for females. The per capita income for the base was $11,512. 6.0% of the population and 5.1% of families were below the poverty line. Of the total population, 7.5% under the age of 18 years and 0.0% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.[12]\\r\\nOn 13 May 2005, The Department of Defense proposed a major realignment of the base as part of the Base Realignment and Closure program.","input":"What air force base is in fairbanks alaska?"},{"output":"31 December 1687","context":"A large number of people of European heritage in South Africa are descended from Huguenots. Most of these originally settled in the Cape Colony, but were absorbed into the Afrikaner and Afrikaans population, because they had religious similarities to the Dutch colonists.\\r\\nEven before the large-scale arrival of the Huguenots at the Cape of Good Hope in the 17th century, a small number of individual Huguenot refugees settled there. They included Francois Villion, later known as Viljoen, and the Du Toit brothers. In fact, the first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope was Maria de la Quellerie, the wife of governor Jan van Riebeeck, who started the settlement at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652 on behalf of the Dutch East India Company; however, she and her husband left for Batavia after ten years. After a commissioner was sent out from the Cape Colony in 1685 to attract more settlers, a more dedicated group of immigrants began to arrive. A larger number of French refugees began to arrive in the Cape after leaving their country as a result of the Edict of Fontainebleau (1685), which revoked the Edict of Nantes (1598) that had granted religious toleration to Protestants.\\r\\nOn 31 December 1687 a group of Huguenots set sail from France as the first of the large scale emigration of Huguenots to the Cape of Good Hope, which took place during 1688 and 1689. In total some 180 Huguenots from France, and 18 Walloons from the present-day Belgium, eventually settled at the Cape of Good Hope. A notable example of this is the emigration of Huguenots from La Motte d'Aigues in Provence, France. After this large scale emigration, individual Huguenot immigrant families arrived at the Cape of Good Hope as late as the first quarter of the 18th century, and the state-subsidised emigration of Huguenots was stopped in 1706.\\r\\nThis small body of immigrants had a marked influence on the character of the Dutch settlers. They were purposely spread out and given farms amongst the Dutch farmers. Owing to the policy instituted in 1701 of the Dutch East India Company which dictated that schools should teach exclusively in Dutch, that all official correspondence had to be done in Dutch, and strict laws of assembly, the Huguenots ceased by the middle of the 18th century to maintain a distinct identity, and the knowledge of French diminished and eventually disappeared as a home language.[1] This assimilation into the colonial population was also due to the fact that many Huguenot descendants married individuals from the Dutch population.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of these settlers were allocated farms in an area later called Franschhoek, Dutch for \\"French corner\\", in the present-day Western Cape province of South Africa. The valley was originally known as Olifantshoek (\\"Elephant's Corner\\"), so named because of the vast herds of elephants that roamed the area. The name of the area soon changed to le Coin Fran?ais (\\"the French Corner\\"), and later to Franschhoek, with many of the settlers naming their new farms after the areas in France from which they came. La Motte, La Cotte, Cabriere, Provence, Chamonix, Dieu Donne and La Dauphine were among some of the first established farms-most of which still retain their original farm houses today.\\r\\nA large monument to commemorate the arrival of the Huguenots in South Africa was inaugurated on 17 April 1948 at Franschhoek. A museum dedicated to the Huguenot history in South Africa is located adjacent to the monument.\\r\\nA smaller monument commemorating the 300th anniversary of the arrival of the Huguenots is located in the Johannesburg Botanical Garden.\\r\\nFrench Huguenot descendants were also included in the exodus of frontier farmers that was called the Great Trek.[2]\\r\\nVoortrekker surnames who were of French Huguenot ancestry include:[3]-\\r\\n(Original french spelling in brackets)\\r\\nThere are many families, today mostly Afrikaans speaking, whose surnames bear witness to their Huguenot ancestry. A comprehensive list of these surnames can be seen on the Huguenot Memorial in the Johannesburg Botanical Garden.

It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact.\\r\\nBased on a mark in an interior chamber naming the work gang and a reference to fourth dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu, Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was built as a tomb over a 10 to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. Initially at 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years. Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface; what is seen today is the underlying core structure. Some of the casing stones that once covered the structure can still be seen around the base. There have been varying scientific and alternative theories about the Great Pyramid's construction techniques. Most accepted construction hypotheses are based on the idea that it was built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place.\\r\\nThere are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid. The lowest chamber is cut into the bedrock upon which the pyramid was built and was unfinished. The so-called[2] Queen's Chamber and King's Chamber are higher up within the pyramid structure. The main part of the Giza complex is a setting of buildings that included two mortuary temples in honour of Khufu (one close to the pyramid and one near the Nile), three smaller pyramids for Khufu's wives, an even smaller \\"satellite\\" pyramid, a raised causeway connecting the two temples, and small mastaba tombs surrounding the pyramid for nobles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is believed[by whom?] the pyramid was built as a tomb for Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu (often Hellenicised as \\"Cheops\\") and was constructed over a 20-year period. Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon), is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid.[3] It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian cubits tall (146.5 metres (480.6?ft)), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is 138.8 metres (455.4?ft). Each base side was 440?cubits, 230.4 metres (755.9?ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9?million tonnes. The volume, including an internal hillock, is roughly 2,500,000 cubic metres (88,000,000?cu?ft).[4]\\r\\nBased on these estimates, building the pyramid in 20 years would involve installing approximately 800 tonnes of stone every day. Additionally, since it consists of an estimated 2.3?million blocks, completing the building in 20 years would involve moving an average of more than 12 of the blocks into place each hour, day and night. The first precision measurements of the pyramid were made by Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie in 1880ÿ82 and published as The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh.[5] Almost all reports are based on his measurements. Many of the casing stones and inner chamber blocks of the Great Pyramid fit together with extremely high precision. Based on measurements taken on the northeastern casing stones, the mean opening of the joints is only 0.5 millimetre wide (1/50 of an inch).[6]\\r\\nThe pyramid remained the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years,[7] unsurpassed until the 160-metre-tall (520?ft) spire of Lincoln Cathedral was completed c.?1300. The accuracy of the pyramid's workmanship is such that the four sides of the base have an average error of only 58?millimetres in length.[8] The base is horizontal and flat to within I15?mm (0.6?in).[9] The sides of the square base are closely aligned to the four cardinal compass points (within four?minutes of arc)[10] based on true north, not magnetic north,[11] and the finished base was squared to a mean corner error of only 12 seconds of arc.[12]\\r\\nThe completed design dimensions, as suggested by Petrie's survey and subsequent studies, are estimated to have originally been 280 royal cubits high by 440 cubits long at each of the four sides of its base. The ratio of the perimeter to height of 1760/280 royal cubits equates to 2 to an accuracy of better than 0.05% (corresponding to the well-known approximation of  as 22/7). Some Egyptologists consider this to have been the result of deliberate design proportion. Verner wrote, \\"We can conclude that although the ancient Egyptians could not precisely define the value of , in practice they used it\\".[13] Petrie, author of Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh concluded: \\"but these relations of areas and of circular ratio are so systematic that we should grant that they were in the builder's design\\".[14] Others have argued that the Ancient Egyptians had no concept of pi and would not have thought to encode it in their monuments. They believe that the observed pyramid slope may be based on a simple seked slope choice alone, with no regard to the overall size and proportions of the finished building.[15] In 2013 rolls of papyrus called The diary of Merer were discovered written by some of those who delivered stone and other construction materials to Khufu's brother at Giza.[16]\\r\\nThe Great Pyramid consists of an estimated 2.3?million blocks which most believe to have been transported from nearby quarries. The Tura limestone used for the casing was quarried across the river. The largest granite stones in the pyramid, found in the \\"King's\\" chamber, weigh 25 to 80 tonnes and were transported from Aswan, more than 800?km (500?mi) away. Traditionally, ancient Egyptians cut stone blocks by hammering into them some wooden wedges, which were then soaked with water. As the water was absorbed, the wedges expanded, causing the rock to crack. Once they were cut, they were carried by boat either up or down the Nile River to the pyramid.[17] It is estimated that 5.5?million tonnes of limestone, 8,000 tonnes of granite (imported from Aswan), and 500,000 tonnes of mortar were used in the construction of the Great Pyramid.[18]\\r\\nAt completion, the Great Pyramid was surfaced by white \\"casing stones\\"?ÿ slant-faced, but flat-topped, blocks of highly polished white limestone. These were carefully cut to what is approximately a face slope with a seked of 5? palms to give the required dimensions. Visibly, all that remains is the underlying stepped core structure seen today. In AD?1303, a massive earthquake loosened many of the outer casing stones, which were then carted away by Bahri Sultan An-Nasir Nasir-ad-Din al-Hasan in 1356 to build mosques and fortresses in nearby Cairo. Many more casing stones were removed from the great pyramids by Muhammad Ali Pasha in the early 19th century to build the upper portion of his Alabaster Mosque in Cairo not far from Giza. These limestone casings can still be seen as parts of these structures. Later explorers reported massive piles of rubble at the base of the pyramids left over from the continuing collapse of the casing stones, which were subsequently cleared away during continuing excavations of the site.\\r\\nNevertheless, a few of the casing stones from the lowest course can be seen to this day in situ around the base of the Great Pyramid, and display the same workmanship and precision that has been reported for centuries. Petrie also found a different orientation in the core and in the casing measuring 193?centimetres I 25 centimetres. He suggested a redetermination of north was made after the construction of the core, but a mistake was made, and the casing was built with a different orientation.[5] Petrie related the precision of the casing stones as to being \\"equal to opticians' work of the present day, but on a scale of acres\\" and \\"to place such stones in exact contact would be careful work; but to do so with cement in the joints seems almost impossible\\".[20] It has been suggested it was the mortar (Petrie's \\"cement\\") that made this seemingly impossible task possible, providing a level bed, which enabled the masons to set the stones exactly.[21][22]\\r\\nMany alternative, often contradictory, theories have been proposed regarding the pyramid's construction techniques.[23] Many disagree on whether the blocks were dragged, lifted, or even rolled into place. The Greeks believed that slave labour was used, but modern discoveries made at nearby workers' camps associated with construction at Giza suggest that it was built instead by tens of thousands of skilled workers. Verner posited that the labour was organized into a hierarchy, consisting of two gangs of 100,000 men, divided into five zaa or phyle of 20,000 men each, which may have been further divided according to the skills of the workers.[24]\\r\\nOne mystery of the pyramid's construction is its planning. John Romer suggests that they used the same method that had been used for earlier and later constructions, laying out parts of the plan on the ground at a 1-to-1 scale. He writes that \\"such a working diagram would also serve to generate the architecture of the pyramid with precision unmatched by any other means\\".[25] He also argues for a 14-year time span for its construction.[26] A modern construction management study, in association with Mark Lehner and other Egyptologists, estimated that the total project required an average workforce of 14,567 people and a peak workforce of roughly 40,000. Without the use of pulleys, wheels, or iron tools, they used critical path analysis methods, which suggest that the Great Pyramid was completed from start to finish in approximately 10 years.[27]\\r\\nThe original entrance to the Great Pyramid is on the north, 17 metres (56?ft) vertically above ground level and 7.29 metres (23.9?ft) east of the centre line of the pyramid. From this original entrance, there is a Descending Passage 0.96 metres (3.1?ft) high and 1.04 metres (3.4?ft) wide, which goes down at an angle of 26 31'23\\" through the masonry of the pyramid and then into the bedrock beneath it. After 105.23 metres (345.2?ft), the passage becomes level and continues for an additional 8.84 metres (29.0?ft) to the lower Chamber, which appears not to have been finished. There is a continuation of the horizontal passage in the south wall of the lower chamber; there is also a pit dug in the floor of the chamber. Some Egyptologists suggest that this Lower Chamber was intended to be the original burial chamber, but Pharaoh Khufu later changed his mind and wanted it to be higher up in the pyramid.[28]\\r\\n28.2 metres (93?ft) from the entrance is a square hole in the roof of the Descending Passage. Originally concealed with a slab of stone, this is the beginning of the Ascending Passage. The Ascending Passage is 39.3 metres (129?ft) long, as wide and high as the Descending Passage and slopes up at almost precisely the same angle to reach the Grand Gallery. The lower end of the Ascending Passage is closed by three huge blocks of granite, each about 1.5 metres (4.9?ft) long. One must use the Robbers' Tunnel (see below) to access the Ascending Passage. At the start of the Grand Gallery on the right-hand side there is a hole cut in the wall. This is the start of a vertical shaft which follows an irregular path through the masonry of the pyramid to join the Descending Passage. Also at the start of the Grand Gallery there is the Horizontal Passage leading to the \\"Queen's Chamber\\". The passage is 1.1m (3'8\\") high for most of its length, but near the chamber there is a step in the floor, after which the passage is 1.73 metres (5.7?ft) high.\\r\\nThe \\"Queen's Chamber\\"[2] is exactly halfway between the north and south faces of the pyramid and measures 5.75 metres (18.9?ft) north to south, 5.23 metres (17.2?ft) east to west, and has a pointed roof with an apex 6.23 metres (20.4?ft) above the floor. At the eastern end of the chamber there is a niche 4.67 metres (15.3?ft) high. The original depth of the niche was 1.04 metres (3.4?ft), but has since been deepened by treasure hunters.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the north and south walls of the Queen's Chamber there are shafts, which unlike those in the King's Chamber that immediately slope upwards (see below), are horizontal for around 2?m (6.6?ft) before sloping upwards. The horizontal distance was cut in 1872 by a British engineer, Waynman Dixon, who believed a shaft similar to those in the King's Chamber must also exist. He was proved right, but because the shafts are not connected to the outer faces of the pyramid or the Queen's Chamber, their purpose is unknown. At the end of one of his shafts, Dixon discovered a ball of black diorite (a type of rock) and a bronze implement of unknown purpose. Both objects are currently in the British Museum.[29]\\r\\nThe shafts in the Queen's Chamber were explored in 1993 by the German engineer Rudolf Gantenbrink using a crawler robot he designed, Upuaut 2. After a climb of 65?m (213?ft),[30] he discovered that one of the shafts was blocked by limestone \\"doors\\" with two eroded copper \\"handles\\". Some years later the National Geographic Society created a similar robot which, in September 2002, drilled a small hole in the southern door, only to find another door behind it.[31] The northern passage, which was difficult to navigate because of twists and turns, was also found to be blocked by a door.[32]\\r\\nResearch continued in 2011 with the Djedi Project. Realizing the problem was that the National Geographic Society's camera was only able to see straight ahead of it, they instead used a fiber-optic \\"micro snake camera\\" that could see around corners. With this they were able to penetrate the first door of the southern shaft through the hole drilled in 2002, and view all the sides of the small chamber behind it. They discovered hieroglyphs written in red paint. They were also able to scrutinize the inside of the two copper \\"handles\\" embedded in the door, and they now believe them to be for decorative purposes. They also found the reverse side of the \\"door\\" to be finished and polished, which suggests that it was not put there just to block the shaft from debris, but rather for a more specific reason.[33]\\r\\nThe Grand Gallery continues the slope of the Ascending Passage, but is 8.6 metres (28?ft) high and 46.68 metres (153.1?ft) long. At the base it is 2.06 metres (6.8?ft) wide, but after 2.29 metres (7.5?ft) the blocks of stone in the walls are corbelled inwards by 7.6 centimetres (3.0?in) on each side. There are seven of these steps, so, at the top, the Grand Gallery is only 1.04 metres (3.4?ft) wide. It is roofed by slabs of stone laid at a slightly steeper angle than the floor of the gallery, so that each stone fits into a slot cut in the top of the gallery like the teeth of a ratchet. The purpose was to have each block supported by the wall of the Gallery rather than resting on the block beneath it, which would have resulted in an unacceptable cumulative pressure at the lower end of the Gallery.[citation needed]\\r\\nAt the upper end of the Gallery on the right-hand side there is a hole near the roof that opens into a short tunnel by which access can be gained to the lowest of the Relieving Chambers. The other Relieving Chambers were discovered in 1837-1838 by Colonel Howard Vyse and J. S. Perring, who dug tunnels upwards using blasting powder.\\r\\nThe floor of the Grand Gallery consists of a shelf or step on either side, 51 centimetres (20?in) wide, leaving a lower ramp 1.04 metres (3.4?ft) wide between them. In the shelves there are 54 slots, 27 on each side matched by vertical and horizontal slots in the walls of the Gallery. These form a cross shape that rises out of the slot in the shelf. The purpose of these slots is not known, but the central gutter in the floor of the Gallery, which is the same width as the Ascending Passage, has led to speculation that the blocking stones were stored in the Grand Gallery and the slots held wooden beams to restrain them from sliding down the passage.[34] This, in turn, has led to the proposal that originally many more than 3 blocking stones were intended, to completely fill the Ascending Passage.[citation needed]\\r\\nAt the top of the Grand Gallery, there is a step giving onto a horizontal passage some metres long and approximately 1.02 metres (3.3?ft) in height and width, in which can be detected four slots, three of which were probably intended to hold granite portcullises. Fragments of granite found by Petrie in the Descending Passage may have come from these now-vanished doors.\\r\\nThe \\"King's Chamber\\"[2] is 20 cubits or 10.47 metres (34.4?ft) from east to west and 10 cubits or 5.234 metres (17.17?ft) north to south. It has a flat roof 11 cubits and 5 digits or 5.852 metres (19 feet 2 inch) above the floor. 0.91?m (3.0?ft) above the floor there are two narrow shafts in the north and south walls (one is now filled by an extractor fan in an attempt to circulate air inside the pyramid). The purpose of these shafts is not clear: they appear to be aligned towards stars or areas of the northern and southern skies, yet one of them follows a dog-leg course through the masonry, indicating no intention to directly sight stars through them. They were long believed by Egyptologists to be \\"air shafts\\" for ventilation, but this idea has now been widely abandoned in favour of the shafts serving a ritualistic purpose associated with the ascension of the kings spirit to the heavens.[35]\\r\\nThe King's Chamber is entirely faced with granite. Above the roof, which is formed of nine slabs of stone weighing in total about 400 tons, are five compartments known as Relieving Chambers. The first four, like the King's Chamber, have flat roofs formed by the floor of the chamber above, but the final chamber has a pointed roof. Vyse suspected the presence of upper chambers when he found that he could push a long reed through a crack in the ceiling of the first chamber. From lower to upper, the chambers are known as \\"Davison's Chamber\\", \\"Wellington's Chamber\\", \\"Nelson's Chamber\\", \\"Lady Arbuthnot's Chamber\\", and \\"Campbell's Chamber\\". It is believed that the compartments were intended to safeguard the King's Chamber from the possibility of a roof collapsing under the weight of stone above the Chamber. As the chambers were not intended to be seen, they were not finished in any way and a few of the stones still retain masons' marks painted on them. One of the stones in Campbell's Chamber bears a mark, apparently the name of a work gang.[36][37]\\r\\nThe only object in the King's Chamber is a rectangular granite sarcophagus, one corner of which is broken. The sarcophagus is slightly larger than the Ascending Passage, which indicates that it must have been placed in the Chamber before the roof was put in place. Unlike the fine masonry of the walls of the Chamber, the sarcophagus is roughly finished, with saw marks visible in several places. This is in contrast with the finely finished and decorated sarcophagi found in other pyramids of the same period. Petrie suggested that such a sarcophagus was intended but was lost in the river on the way north from Aswan and a hurriedly made replacement was used instead.\\r\\nToday tourists enter the Great Pyramid via the Robbers' Tunnel, a tunnel purportedly created around AD 820 by Caliph al-Ma'mun's workmen using a battering ram.[38] The tunnel is cut straight through the masonry of the pyramid for approximately 27 metres (89?ft), then turns sharply left to encounter the blocking stones in the Ascending Passage. It is believed that their efforts dislodged the stone fitted in the ceiling of the Descending Passage to hide the entrance to the Ascending Passage and it was the noise of that stone falling and then sliding down the Descending Passage, which alerted them to the need to turn left. Unable to remove these stones, however, the workmen tunnelled up beside them through the softer limestone of the Pyramid until they reached the Ascending Passage. It is possible to enter the Descending Passage from this point, but access is usually forbidden.[39]\\r\\nThe Great Pyramid is surrounded by a complex of several buildings including small pyramids. The Pyramid Temple, which stood on the east side of the pyramid and measured 52.2 metres (171?ft) north to south and 40 metres (130?ft) east to west, has almost entirely disappeared apart from the black basalt paving. There are only a few remnants of the causeway which linked the pyramid with the valley and the Valley Temple. The Valley Temple is buried beneath the village of Nazlet el-Samman; basalt paving and limestone walls have been found but the site has not been excavated.[40][41] The basalt blocks show \\"clear evidence\\" of having been cut with some kind of saw with an estimated cutting blade of 15 feet (4.6?m) in length, capable of cutting at a rate of 1.5 inches (38?mm) per minute. John Romer suggests that this \\"super saw\\" may have had copper teeth and weighed up to 300 pounds (140?kg). He theorizes that such a saw could have been attached to a wooden trestle and possibly used in conjunction with vegetable oil, cutting sand, emery or pounded quartz to cut the blocks, which would have required the labour of at least a dozen men to operate it.[42]\\r\\nOn the south side are the subsidiary pyramids, popularly known as Queens' Pyramids. Three remain standing to nearly full height but the fourth was so ruined that its existence was not suspected until the recent discovery of the first course of stones and the remains of the capstone. Hidden beneath the paving around the pyramid was the tomb of Queen Hetepheres I, sister-wife of Sneferu and mother of Khufu. Discovered by accident by the Reisner expedition, the burial was intact, though the carefully sealed coffin proved to be empty.\\r\\nThe Giza pyramid complex, which includes among other structures the pyramids of Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure, is surrounded by a cyclopean stone wall, the Wall of the Crow. Mark Lehner has discovered a worker's town outside of the wall, otherwise known as \\"The Lost City\\", dated by pottery styles, seal impressions, and stratigraphy to have been constructed and occupied sometime during the reigns of Khafre (2520ÿ2494 BC) and Menkaure (2490ÿ2472 BC).[43][44] Recent discoveries by Mark Lehner and his team at the town and nearby, including what appears to have been a thriving port, suggest the town and associated living quarters consisting of barracks called \\"galleries\\" may not have been for the pyramid workers after all, but rather for the soldiers and sailors who utilized the port. In light of this new discovery, as to where then the pyramid workers may have lived Lehner now suggests the alternative possibility they may have camped on the ramps he believes were used to construct the pyramids or possibly at nearby quarries.[45]\\r\\nIn the early 1970s, the Australian archaeologist Karl Kromer excavated a mound in the South Field of the plateau. This mound contained artefacts including mudbrick seals of Khufu, which he identified with an artisans' settlement.[46] Mudbrick buildings just south of Khufu's Valley Temple contained mud sealings of Khufu and have been suggested to be a settlement serving the cult of Khufu after his death.[47] A worker's cemetery used at least between Khufu's reign and the end of the Fifth Dynasty was discovered south of the Wall of the Crow by Zahi Hawass in 1990.[48]\\r\\nThere are three boat-shaped pits around the pyramid, of a size and shape to have held complete boats, though so shallow that any superstructure, if there ever was one, must have been removed or disassembled. In May 1954, the Egyptian archaeologist Kamal el-Mallakh discovered a fourth pit, a long, narrow rectangle, still covered with slabs of stone weighing up to 15 tons. Inside were 1,224 pieces of wood, the longest 23 metres (75?ft) long, the shortest 10 centimetres (0.33?ft). These were entrusted to a boat builder, Haj Ahmed Yusuf, who worked out how the pieces fit together. The entire process, including conservation and straightening of the warped wood, took fourteen years.\\r\\nThe result is a cedar-wood boat 43.6 metres (143?ft) long, its timbers held together by ropes, which is currently housed in a special boat-shaped, air-conditioned museum beside the pyramid. During construction of this museum, which stands above the boat pit, a second sealed boat pit was discovered. It was deliberately left unopened until 2011 when excavation began on the boat.[49]\\r\\nAlthough succeeding pyramids were smaller, pyramid building continued until the end of the Middle Kingdom. However, as authors Briar and Hobbs claim, \\"all the pyramids were robbed\\" by the New Kingdom, when the construction of royal tombs in a desert valley, now known as the Valley of the Kings, began.[50][51] Joyce Tyldesley states that the Great Pyramid itself \\"is known to have been opened and emptied by the Middle Kingdom\\", before the Arab caliph Abdullah al-Mamun entered the pyramid around AD 820.[38]\\r\\nI. E. S. Edwards discusses Strabo's mention that the pyramid \\"a little way up one side has a stone that may be taken out, which being raised up there is a sloping passage to the foundations\\". Edwards suggested that the pyramid was entered by robbers after the end of the Old Kingdom and sealed and then reopened more than once until Strabo's door was added. He adds: \\"If this highly speculative surmise be correct, it is also necessary to assume either that the existence of the door was forgotten or that the entrance was again blocked with facing stones\\", in order to explain why al-Ma'mun could not find the entrance.[52]\\r\\nHe also discusses a story told by Herodotus. Herodotus visited Egypt in the 5th century BC and recounts a story that he was told concerning vaults under the pyramid built on an island where the body of Cheops lies. Edwards notes that the pyramid had \\"almost certainly been opened and its contents plundered long before the time of Herodotus\\" and that it might have been closed again during the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt when other monuments were restored. He suggests that the story told to Herodotus could have been the result of almost two centuries of telling and retelling by Pyramid guides.[53]","input":"How long did it take to build great pyramid of giza?"},{"output":"Mary Jo Kopechne","context":"Mary Jo Kopechne (/ko??p?kni/; July 26, 1940 ÿ July 18, 1969) was an American teacher, secretary, and political campaign specialist who died in a car accident at Chappaquiddick Island on July 18, 1969, while she was a passenger in a car being driven by U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKopechne was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,[3] although she is sometimes described as being from nearby Forty Fort, Pennsylvania.[4][5] She was an only child.[4] Her father, Joseph Kopechne, was an insurance salesman, and her mother, Gwen (ne Jennings), was a homemaker.[3][6] Kopechne was of part Polish heritage.[7] Two of her grandparents were coal miners from Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, and her family history in the Wyoming Valley area of northeastern Pennsylvania goes back 250 years.[5]\\r\\nWhen Kopechne was an infant, the family moved to Berkeley Heights, New Jersey.[3][8] Growing up, she attended parochial schools.[9] She graduated with a degree in business administration from Caldwell College for Women in 1962.[3][10]\\r\\nAfter graduation, Kopechne moved to Montgomery, Alabama, for a year at the Mission of St. Jude,[3] an activity that was part of the Civil Rights Movement.[11] She also taught at Montgomery Catholic High School.[12]\\r\\nBy 1963, Kopechne relocated to Washington, D.C., to work as secretary for Florida Senator George Smathers.[3] She joined New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy's secretarial staff following his election in November 1964.[3] For that office she worked as a secretary to the senator's speechwriters and as a legal secretary to one of his legal advisers.[3] Kopechne was a loyal worker. Once, during March 1967, she stayed up all night at Kennedy's Hickory Hill home to type a major speech against the Vietnam War, while the senator and his aides such as Ted Sorensen made last-minute changes to it.[9][13][14] She was also an enthusiastic participant on the Kennedy office softball team, playing catcher.[15]\\r\\nDuring the 1968 U.S. presidential election, Kopechne helped with the wording of Kennedy's March speech that announced his presidential candidacy.[9] During his campaign, she worked as one of the Boiler Room Girls. This was an affectionate nickname given to six young women whose office area was in a hot, loud, windowless location in Kennedy's Washington campaign headquarters.[7][9][13][16] They were vital in tracking and compiling data and intelligence on how Democratic delegates from various states were intending to vote; Kopechne's responsibilities included Pennsylvania.[13][16] Kopechne and the other staffers were knowledgeable politically,[16] and were chosen for their ability to work skillfully for long, hectic hours on sensitive matters.[7] They talked daily with field managers and also helped distribute policy statements to strategic newspapers.[16] She has been described as hero-worshiping the senator.[15]\\r\\nKopechne was devastated emotionally by the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968. After working briefly for the Kennedy proxy campaign of George McGovern, she stated she could not return to work on Capitol Hill, saying \\"I just feel Bobby's presence everywhere. I can't go back because it will never be the same again.\\"[7][13] In the fall election of 1968, Kopechne was the campaign strategist in Denver, Colorado for former Colorado Governor Stephen McNichols's run for the Senate against the incumbent Senator Peter H. Dominick.[citation needed] McNichols lost his run, and Kopechne went back to Washington, D.C. But as her father later said, \\"Politics was her life,\\"[13] and in December 1968 she used her experience to gain a job with Matt Reese Associates, a Washington, D.C., firm that helped establish campaign headquarters and field offices for politicians and was one of the first political consulting companies.[3][11][17] By mid-1969 she had completed work for the mayoral campaign of Thomas J. Whelan in Jersey City, New Jersey.[7] She was on her way to a successful professional career.[18]\\r\\nKopechne lived with three other women in the Washington neighborhood of Georgetown.[3] She was a fan of the Boston Red Sox and of fellow Polish-American Carl Yastrzemski.[7] She was a devout Roman Catholic with a demure, serious, \\"convent school\\" demeanor, rarely drank much, and had no reputation for sexual activities with men.[7][17][18]\\r\\nOn July 18, 1969, Kopechne attended a party on Chappaquiddick Island, off the east coast of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. The celebration was in honor of the dedicated work of the Boiler Room Girls and was the fourth such reunion of the Robert F. Kennedy campaign workers.[19] Robert's brother Ted Kennedy was there; Kopechne did not know him well.[15] Kopechne reportedly left the party with Kennedy at 11:15?p.m.; according to his account, he had offered to drive her to catch the last ferry back to Edgartown, where she was staying.[13] She did not tell her close friends at the party that she was leaving, and she left her purse and keys behind.[13] Kennedy drove the 1967 Oldsmobile Delmont 88[20] off a narrow, unlit bridge, which lacked guardrails and was not on the route to Edgartown.[13] The Oldsmobile landed on its roof in Poucha Pond. Kennedy extricated himself from the vehicle and survived, but Kopechne did not.[13] She died in the submerged vehicle, eight days shy of her 29th birthday.[13]\\r\\nKennedy failed to report the incident to the authorities until the car and Kopechne's body were discovered the next morning.[13] Kopechne's parents said that they learned of their daughter's death from Kennedy,[3] before he informed authorities of his involvement.[10] They learned Kennedy had been the driver from wire press releases some time later.[10]\\r\\nA private funeral for Kopechne was held at St. Vincent's Roman Catholic Church in Plymouth, Pennsylvania on July 22, 1969.[21][22] The service was attended by Kennedy, his wife Joan, his sister-in-law Ethel, and hundreds of onlookers.[21] Kopechne was buried in St. Vincent's Cemetery in Larksville, Pennsylvania,[1] in the parish cemetery on the side of Larksville Mountain.[5] She was among the fifth generation of her family interred in that cemetery.[5]\\r\\nA week after the incident, Kennedy pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident after causing injury. He received a two-month suspended sentence.[13] On a national television broadcast that night, Kennedy said that he had not been driving \\"under the influence of liquor\\" nor had he ever had a \\"private relationship\\" with Kopechne.[23] Massachusetts officials pressed for weeks to have Kopechne's body exhumed for an autopsy,[24] but in December 1969 a Pennsylvania judge sided with the parents' request not to disturb her burial site.[1]\\r\\nThe Chappaquiddick incident and Kopechne's death became the topic of at least 15 books, as well as a fictionalized treatment by Joyce Carol Oates.[25] Even among otherwise sympathetic, mainstream biographers, serious questions remained about Kennedy's timeline of events that night, specifically his actions following the incident.[26][25] The quality of the investigation has been scrutinized, particularly whether official deference was given to a powerful and influential politician and his family.[26] The events surrounding Kopechne's death damaged Kennedy's reputation and are regarded as a major reason why he was never able to mount a successful campaign for President of the United States.[27] Nonetheless Kennedy overcame this and some lesser personal scandals to have a very long career as a Senator with a lengthy list of major legislative accomplishments.[25] Kennedy expressed remorse over his role in her death in his posthumously-published memoir, True Compass.[28]\\r\\nBut the disparity of the outcomes remained; Kennedy biographer Peter Canellos has written of the aftermath, \\"Every day that he lived was one that Kopechne ÿ a talented woman with political interests of her own ÿ would not. It seemed cosmically unfair that he should have a second act when she couldn't even complete her first.\\"[25]\\r\\nKopechne's parents received a $141,000 settlement from Kennedy's insurance company.[4] They subsequently moved to Swiftwater, Pennsylvania.[4] On the 25th anniversary of the accident in 1994 they said that Kennedy had never apologized directly to them over his role in it, but that other members of the Kennedy family had written letters to them.[4] Their only child gone, they never felt that justice had really been done in the case.[5]\\r\\nKopechne's father died in a nursing home in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania in 2003.[4] Her mother died in a nursing home in Plains Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania in 2007.[4]\\r\\nIn 2015, two cousins of Kopechne's in Pennsylvania self-published the book Our Mary Jo, which sought to emphasize the impact of her life rather than discuss Kennedy or Chappaquiddick.[5] It also includes some of the hundreds of condolence letters that Kopechne's parents received.[29] Because Kopechne had been a great believer in education as well as her Catholic faith, the family members started a scholarship fund in Kopechne's name at nearby Misericordia University.[5][29]","input":"Who was the woman that died at chappaquiddick?"},{"output":"25 April 1785","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton (/?fr?dr?kt?n/; French pronunciation:??[f??d?ikt??]) is the capital of the Canadian province of New Brunswick. The city is situated in the west-central portion of the province along the Saint John River, which flows west to east as it bisects the city. The river is the dominant natural feature of the area. One of the main urban centres in New Brunswick, the city had a population of 56,224 in the 2011 census.[5] It is the third-largest city in the province after Moncton and Saint John.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn important cultural, artistic, and educational centre for the province, Fredericton is home to two universities, the New Brunswick College of Craft and Design, and cultural institutions such as the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, the Fredericton Region Museum, and The Playhouse, a performing arts venue. The city hosts the annual Harvest Jazz & Blues Festival, attracting regional and international jazz, blues, rock, and world artists. Fredericton is also an important and vibrant center point for the region's top visual artists; many of New Brunswick's notable artists live and work there today. Fredericton has also been home to some great historical Canadian painters as well, including Goodridge Roberts, and Molly and Bruno Bobak.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a provincial capital, its economy is tied to the public sector; however, the city also contains a growing IT and commercial sector. The city has the highest percentage of residents with a post-secondary education in the province and one of the highest per capita incomes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest known inhabitation of the area dates back 12,000 years, according to archaeologists, evidenced by recent finds.  Excavations unearthed a campsite with firepit and more than 600 artifacts including stone tool fragments and arrowheads.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area of the present-day city of Fredericton was first used for seasonal farming by the Maliseet peoples. Maliseet cultivated food plants including: beans, pumpkins, Jerusalem artichokes, ground nuts, and maize on the river banks and islands of the Saint John River.  In the mid-18th century their principal village of Aucpaque was located several kilometres upriver from the site of present-day Fredericton.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first European contact was by the French in the late 17th century. Joseph Robineau de Villebon received a land grant and was appointed  governor of Acadia. During King William's War, Villebon built Fort Nashwaak on the north side of the Saint John River, at the mouth of the Nashwaak River. For most of the war, Fort Nashwaak served as the capital of the French colony of Acadia; forces from here conducted numerous military raids on English settlers on the New England/ Acadia border.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench and English hostilities continued along the border. Within weeks of an attack of French and Indigenous forces launched from Fort Nashwaak on Pemaquid, Maine (present day Bristol, Maine), the New Englanders struck back. In 1696, an expedition under command of Major Benjamin Church set out to destroy Fort Nashwaak (present-day Fredericton). Commander Villebon had been alerted and prepared his defences. On 18 October, the British troops arrived near the fort, landed three cannons, and assembled earthworks on the south bank of the Nashwaak River.[8]  The siege of Fort Nashwaak last for two days gunfire was fiercely exchanged, with the advantage going to the better-sited Acadian guns. The New Englanders were defeated, with 8 soldiers killed and 17 wounded. The Acadians sustained losses of one killed and two wounded.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Villebon's death in 1700 and a devastating flood that destroyed several French farms in the area, the fort was abandoned. The Fredericton area was first permanently settled and named Pointe-Sainte-Anne (later often anglicized to \\"Ste. Anne's Point\\") in 1732 by Acadians fleeing Nova Scotia after the British took over the territory (1710). Their townsite was on the south side of the river, approximately a mile upriver from Fort Nashwaak.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British captured Ste. Anne's Point during the expulsion of the Acadians, burning the settlement to the ground in the St. John River Campaign (1759) during the French and Indian War, the North American front of their Seven Years' War in Europe against France.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1762 settlement attempt by the British was unsuccessful due to the hostility of local Acadian and Aboriginal populations. These settlers eventually erected a community downriver at what is today the town of Maugerville (pronounced \\"majorville\\"). However, three fur traders settled permanently here in 1768.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1783, United Empire Loyalists were settled in Ste. Anne's Point after the American Revolution, having left their properties in the United States. They were granted land in compensation in British North America by the Crown. Many died during the harsh and long first winter in Fredericton. The dead were buried in what became the Loyalist cemetery, which is still found on the south bank of the Saint John River. When spring came, more Loyalists left the new settlement to take up land grants in other areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen New Brunswick became a separate colony from Nova Scotia in 1784, Ste. Anne's Point became the provincial capital, winning out over Parrtown (present-day Saint John) due to its central inland location. This made it less prone to American attack from the sea. A street plan was laid out to the west of the original townsite, King's College (now the University of New Brunswick) was founded, and the locale was renamed \\"Frederick's Town\\", in honour of the second son of King George III of the United Kingdom, Prince Frederick Augustus, Duke of York. The name was shortened to Fredericton shortly after the city became the official provincial capital of New Brunswick on 25 April 1785.  Thus, in a period of less than three years, the area of Fredericton went from being a sparsely populated region to being the capital of the new colony of New Brunswick.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same attributes that made Fredericton the capital city also made it an ideal spot for a military installation. Many of the original military buildings downtown still stand, and are now tourist attractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building constructed to house the colonial-era legislative assembly in 1788 was destroyed by a fire in 1880. Two years later, the present Legislature Building was constructed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first major expansion of the city occurred on 1 July 1945 when it amalgamated with the town of Devon. Today the city of Fredericton comprises Fredericton proper, and the boroughs of Silverwood, Nashwaaksis, Barker's Point and Marysville, which were incorporated into the city in 1973.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commemorative brass cenotaph plaques were stolen in October 2015, and were replaced by replicas cast by an Amherst foundry called Liberty Enterprises.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the communities amalgamated into Fredericton in 1973, Marysville, has a unique and distinctive history of its own.  Marysville is located on the Nashwaak River,  a tributary of the Saint John River, just north of pre-1973 Fredericton.  The community is distinguished by its 19th-century mill and historic buildings, which include 19th-century company houses and buildings patterned after those of British industrial towns.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarysville can be described as a prime example of a 19th-century mill town. In the 1830s a sawmill was built on the site of Marysville by two local entrepreneurs. However, the mill frequently changed ownership and never showed a profit.  Alexander Gibson (popularly referred to as \\"Boss Gibson\\") turned this situation around and built a prosperous industrial town. In 1883, under the direction of Gibson, construction began of a cotton mill, which was state-of-the-art for its time. \\"Boss\\" Gibson named the company town that grew up around the mill Marysville in honour of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1908, having faced financial problems, Gibson sold the mill to a Montreal-based company which, in turn, sold it to Canadian Cottons Ltd. After World War II, foreign competition devastated the mill's business; jobs moved offshore and it ceased operations in 1954. There were numerous attempts to re-open the mill; however, in 1980, it closed its doors permanently. The mill was renovated and re-opened in 1985 for use as provincial government offices. The mill remains the dominant feature in the Marysville skyline.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 10, 2018, a mass shooting took place on Brookside Drive that left four people dead, including two police officers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Saint John River runs through Fredericton,  with most of the city's post-war suburban development occurring on the gently sloping hills on either side of the river (although the downtown core is flat and lies low to the river).\\r\\n\\r\\nAt an altitude of about 17 metres above sea level, Fredericton is nestled in the Pennsylvanian Basin. It differs markedly from the geologically older parts of the province. There are prominently two distinct areas in the region that are divided around the area of Wilsey Road, in the east end of the city. In the west side, the bedrock underneath the earth is topographically dominant, whereas the other is controlled by Pleistocene and recent deposits leading to the rivers (resulting in the area being shallow and wide). Fredericton and its surroundings are rich in water resources, which, coupled with highly arable soil, make the Fredericton region ideal for agriculture. The Saint John River and one of its major tributaries, the Nashwaak River, come together in Fredericton.  The uninhabited parts of the city are heavily forested.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton has a humid continental climate (K?ppen climate classification Dfb). The average January low temperature is -16?C, while the average high in July high is 26?C.[13] On average, Fredericton receives approximately 1100?mm of precipitation per year. Snowfall is common between late November and early April, and snow usually stays on the ground beginning in December. Flooding occurs during the spring of most years on area rivers and affects the city's low-lying neighbourhoods. Its climate is somewhat influenced by its inland position, with warmer summers and colder winter nights than expected for coastal areas of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Fredericton was 38.9?C (102?F) on 18 August 1935.[14] The coldest temperature ever recorded was ?38.9?C (?38?F) on 19 January 1925.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton has a mayor-council and non-partisan form of government, with the mayor and council serving fixed four-year terms (three years until 2004), and elections held in May. The current mayor is Mike O'Brien, who was elected in 2016.[4] The city is divided into twelve wards (six on each side of the Saint John River), with each ward electing one councillor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boyce Farmers Market, open on Saturday mornings, is a place where municipal, provincial and federal politicians frequently visit to mingle with their electorate - something which has evolved into a political tradition.\\r\\n\\r\\nProvincially, Fredericton elected Progressive Conservatives from 1952 until electoral sweep of the Liberal Party in 1987 when they won every seat in New Brunswick under Frank McKenna. Since then there has been greater political alteration in the provincial electoral landscape in Fredericton.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991, the right-wing Confederation of Regions Party won the riding of Fredericton North (along with several other nearby ridings). In 1999 Progressive Conservatives swept all three Fredericton area seats; however, in 2003, Fredericton-North and Fredericton-Fort Nashwaak returned to the Liberals.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nFederally, the city forms most of the riding of Fredericton. This riding was known as Fredericton-York-Sunbury but was redistributed prior to the 1997 general election.  From 1957 until 1993 Fredericton returned Progressive Conservatives. In the 2008 federal election, the candidate of the Conservative Party of Canada, former New Maryland MLA Keith Ashfield, won this seat with 42% of the popular vote.\\r\\n\\r\\nArchitecturally, Fredericton spans more than two centuries. The city features an eclectic mix of buildings and residences ranging from classical Victorian style to modern office buildings and architecture. Frederictons skyline is also distinguished by many historic churches.  There are 12 National Historic Sites of Canada in Fredericton.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nNeighbourhoods in Fredericton include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe City of Fredericton is bisected by the Saint John River. This has created two distinctive regions of the city characterized as the \\"Northside\\" and the \\"Southside\\". The Southside is characterized by a downtown core consisting of provincial government departments, historical buildings, and numerous business establishments, banks, and law firms.  Downtown also hosts many of the city's cultural attractions, such as The Playhouse, the Fredericton Region Museum (formerly the York-Sunbury Museum), the Beaverbrook Art Gallery and Science East, New Brunswick's science centre.  Many notable historical buildings are also located in or near downtown, including grand Victorian-era residences, the New Brunswick Legislative Building, and Christ Church Cathedral. South of downtown, the city's elevation rises along a sloping hill (part of the river valley feature of the city).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The Hill\\", as it is called, includes an area known as \\"College Hill\\", where the adjoining campuses of the University of New Brunswick and St. Thomas University are located, slightly southeast of the downtown area. Southwest of the universities on the crest of the hill, near the highway interchange between Route 8 and Route 7, is the Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital. East of the universities is the Skyline Acres/Southwood Park area, consisting of a core of older established suburbs, and newer, more affluent areas such as Poets Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccupying the hill southwest of downtown is Odell Park, a large preserved forest area. Its trails and wooded areas are a favourite for hiking, jogging, dog walking, and cross-country skiing for city residents. Odell Park borders on the Fredericton Botanic Garden. West of the park and garden is Hanwell Road, Golf Club Road, and Silverwood neighbourhoods consisting largely of suburban residences.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth of the \\"Hill Area\\", where it plateaus, is a sizeable shopping district consisting of the city's largest mall, the Regent Mall; two big-box retail complexes, Corbett Centre and Uptown Centre;  and numerous adjacent strip malls and restaurants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city's \\"Northside\\" consists of several boroughs which were, at one time, separate communities. These include Devon, Nashwaaksis, Marysville and Barker's Point. These communities are largely suburban neighbourhoods and retail outlets. Main Street (in Nashwaaksis) which becomes Union Street in Devon, runs along the northern bank of the Saint John River. It includes numerous retail outlets as well as an eclectic array of businesses including IT firms, law firms, and real estate agents.  Also located on the Northside is the Brookside Mall, a retail mall anchored by Sobeys, Alcool NB Liquor and a Lawtons Drugs store as well as government offices. A new retail \\"power centre\\" development including Canadian Tire/Marks Work Warehouse, Kent Building Supplies and a Wal-Mart, is located at Two-Nations Crossing. Willie O'Ree Place - a new multimillion-dollar hockey complex - opened in the same area in 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Northside is also home to the Saint Mary's First Nation Indian reserve, which includes a community centre and a shopping centre. During the Christmas season, the neighbourhood has some of the most spectacular and creative decorations in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the presence of the universities, Fredericton is more cosmopolitan than many cities its size.[citation needed]  This is reflected in cuisine offered by local ethnic restaurants (which include Caribbean, Chinese, Greek, Indian, Korean, Italian, Japanese, Lebanese, Mexican, Pakistani and Vietnamese foods). There are also several retail outlets that sell ethnic products and artifacts. The federal government named Fredericton the \\"Cultural Capital of Canada\\" for the year 2009.  Officers' Square is an outdoor public space located at the centre of the city. It serves as a venue for outdoor concerts during the summer, featuring a variety of local and national talent. During the winter, Officers' Square is transformed into an outdoor skating rink.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton is an important cultural centre of the region featuring art galleries, the New Brunswick College of Craft and Design, museums and theatres which promote local artistic and literary talent. The Beaverbrook Art Gallery is New Brunswick's provincial art gallery. It was established in 1959 by Lord Beaverbrook as a gift to his native province. Fredericton is also home to several commercial art galleries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Playhouse hosts plays and musicals throughout the year, as well as presenting visiting comedians and musical performances by both Canadian and international artists. The Playhouse is the main venue for Theatre New Brunswick (TNB). TNB was founded by prominent Canadian director Walter Learning in 1969, and is the provinces largest professional theatre company.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery fall Fredericton hosts the Harvest Jazz & Blues Festival. The week-long festival draws artists from all over North America. Since its inception in 1991, the event has grown into a large, diverse festival which has attracted artists from around the world including Buddy Guy, Warren Haynes, Oscar Peterson, and Parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton is home to the New Brunswick Summer Music Festival, which, each August, features professional chamber music by top local players and nationally renowned performers. Motion Ensemble, NBs contemporary music organization, is also based here. In addition, Symphony New Brunswick performs most of its season in Fredericton.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery November Fredericton hosts the Silver Wave Film Festival. Originally called the Tidal Wave Film Festival, it has been running since 2001. Each year attendance and interest in the festival has risen. Because of the its relationship with the Toronto International Film Festival, the Silver Wave Festival offers Frederictonians the opportunity to see films that would otherwise be overlooked in their smaller market. Films created by New Brunswickers are also screened at the festival. Many of the local films come from shorts created through the University of New Brunswick and the New Brunswick Filmmaker's Co-operative.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton has been called the Poets' Corner of Canada, because it was the birthplace of Bliss Carman, Charles G. D. Roberts and Francis Joseph Sherman. For many years, it was the home of the acclaimed Governor General's Award-winning poet, playwright, and journalist Alden Nowlan.\\r\\n\\r\\nProminent writers and poets living in Fredericton include Raymond Fraser, Robert Gibbs, M.T. Dohaney, Herb Curtis, Wayne Curtis, David Adams Richards, Robert Hawkes, Shari Andrews, Mark Anthony Jarman, Gerard Beirne and Joe Blades.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton contains many public parks featuring preserved forest lands - such as Odell Park and Reading Park. Odell Park is adjacent to the Fredericton Botanic Garden. Furthermore, Fredericton features tree-lined streets and elm trees in particular which have earned the city its nickname \\"The City of Stately Elms\\".  Fredericton's parks and public spaces include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are no professional sports teams in Fredericton, although both universities have extensive athletic programs. The UNB Varsity Reds and St. Thomas Tommies are rivals in most sports. When their men's hockey teams play (UNB has no women's hockey program in the AUS), the matches are called the \\"Battle of the Hill\\". The first National Champions ever produced at UNB was in the fall of 1980. The men's soccer team under the leadership of Coaches Gary Brown and Robin Hopper defeated Sir Wilfred Laurier 3-1 on a frigid day in November. The UNB Varsity Reds men hockey team has experienced recent success in national competition, winning the Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) championships in the 2008ÿ2009, 2010ÿ2011, 2015-2016, and 2016-2017 seasons.  They also finished in second place to the University of Alberta during the 2007ÿ2008 championship. Other varsity (AUS) sports at UNB include women's soccer and swimming, along with men's and women's cross country, track and field, basketball and volleyball. Club sports (non-varsity) include baseball, cheerleading, cricket, fencing, football, golf, rowing, wrestling and men's rugby.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt St. Thomas University, their men's and women's hockey and cross country teams compete in the AUS conference of the CIS, while their other sports teams (which include men's and women's soccer, rugby, golf, basketball, and volleyball) play in the Atlantic Collegiate Athletic Association (ACAA) conference of the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA). The Tommies men's volleyball team has won four ACAA titles, including in 2012, while the men's and women's basketball teams were both 2012 CCAA bronze medalists.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Hockey League was once represented in Fredericton, with the Fredericton Express playing between 1981 and 1988, and the Fredericton Canadiens between 1990 and 1999. \\r\\nFredericton has 5 permanent rink facilities which have a combined seven ice surfaces. On the Northside, the York Arena, opened in 1947, is the oldest arena still in use in the city. Also on the Northside is Willie O'Ree Place, the building is named after Fredericton-born Willie O'Ree, the first black player in the National Hockey League. The building, which serves as the home for the Leo Hayes High School Lions, opened in 2008. It houses two NHL-sized ice surfaces, as well as meeting facilities, an indoor track and a small YMCA workout centre, while outside in Scotiabank Park North there is a soccer field and beach volleyball courts.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Southside, the Lady Beaverbrook Rink (opened in 1954), the home the Fredericton High School Black Kats, and the Aitken University Centre (opened in 1976 and owned by the University of New Brunswick) were joined in 2012 by the new Grant-Harvey Centre, named after Fredericton-born NHL alumni Danny Grant and Buster Harvey, which is another two rink complex; one is NHL sized and the other Olympic. The Grant-Harvey Centre also houses a walking track and meeting facilities. Behind the arena is the new Abony Family Tennis Centre, a six court indoor tennis facility and to the South is Scotiabank Park South has an artificial turf soccer pitch as well as a two-acre, fenced dog park. As of  2012[update], the Grant-Harvey Centre replaced the Lady Beaverbrook Rink as the home of the St. Thomas Tommies.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton has a strong Rugby history with the Fredericton Loyalists RFC.  Each summer the Loyalists host the New Brunswick Black Spruce team which competes in the Rugby Canada Super League.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are healthy programs in both baseball and softball at all age levels around the city. The Fredericton U18 Twins hosted the Canadian U18 Softball Fast Pitch Championships in 2011 and 2012, while the Senior Twins hosted the National Senior Fast Pitch Championships in 2012. In baseball, the Fredericton Senior Royals celebrated their 100th anniversary in 2011 and their 11th (17th including when the team was the Marysville Royals) New Brunswick Senior Baseball League Championship in 2012. That same Royals program produced Matt Stairs, a Major League baseball player who played for Team Canada in the 1988 Summer Olympics and won the World Series with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton has several large parks, including Odell Park, Reading Park, Queen's Square, Officer's Square, Carleton Park and Wilmot Park. Killarney Lake and nearby Mactaquac Provincial Park have small beaches which are popular in the summer. These, along with the river, provide excellent venues for water sports. Skiing and snowboarding at nearby Crabbe Mountain are also common winter activities among city residents, as is skating on the outdoor rinks at Officer's and Queen's Squares. There are also several trails within the city which are used in the winter for cross-country skiing. Fredericton also boasts public and private facilities for archery, soccer, track and field, golf, football, fencing, rowing, sailing, swimming, curling, martial arts, bowling, paintball, and lawn bowling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe population of Fredericton is 56,224 (2011 Census). Along with Moncton and Halifax, Fredericton is one of three Maritime cities to register a population increase in recent years.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton's population is predominantly white.  However, a black minority has had a long presence in the city, primarily in the Barker's Point borough. Willie O'Ree, the first black player in the NHL, is from Fredericton. The largest non-white segment of Fredericton's population is made up of First Nations people, who live primarily on the Saint Mary's Reserve located in the city's north side.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, an influx of immigrants from Asia and the Middle East began, although their numbers remain small. Since 2000, the city's universities, Saint Thomas University and the University of New Brunswick, have seen a growing number of students from overseas attending. Visible minorities comprise 9.9% of the city's population. [23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2017, over 500 refugees from the Syrian Civil War have immigrated to the Fredericton area, more per capita than anywhere else in Canada, and equal to approximately 1% of the city's population.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile a predominantly Anglophone city, the civil service has seen an increase in the city's Francophone population.  This population is served by the Centre Communautaire Sainte-Anne (which includes K-12 schooling, a radio station, a public library, and cultural centre).  In addition, Fredericton is served by a Francophone church located on Regent Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe linguistic breakdown of Fredericton is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe residents of Fredericton are predominantly Christian, with Protestants forming the largest denomination. The city is notable for its many churches, a high number per capita in comparison to most other Canadian cities.[citation needed] The small Pentecostal Northeast Christian College is located on the city's north side. While the Roman Catholic population is not as large, the city does have the province's only Roman Catholic university, St. Thomas University.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton has a synagogue, a mosque, and a Hindu temple as well. The importance of these institutions has been growing in recent years warranting visits by prominent politicians in the area seeking election. On 9 October 2011, a swastika was scrawled on the front door of the community's synagogue, and was investigated as a potential hate crime.[25] A Unitarian fellowship has been serving Fredericton since 1960 as a place for people to find a liberal religious home.  Fredericton also hosts a Shambhala Buddhist meditation centre.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\n1 The 2011 data is from the National Household Survey[27] and so numbers are estimates.\\r\\n2Includes Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Catholic\\r\\n3 Includes persons who report only \\"Protestant\\" and those who report Christian, and those who report Apostolic, Born-again Christian and Evangelical and those who report from all Protestant denominations with less than 0.05% of the population including those who report \\"Christian Reformed Church and those who report \\"Methodist\\" and those who report \\"Mennonite\\" and those who report \\"Christian Missionary Alliance\\" and those who report \\"Brethren in Christ\\" and those who report \\"Evangelical Missionary Church\\"\\r\\n4 Includes persons who report \\"Orthodox\\".

Over the course of the 20th century, this industry declined and gave way to the provincial government and the universities becoming the primary employers in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe policies of centralizing provincial government functions during the 1960s under New Brunswick Premier Louis Robichaud - along with the expanded role of the public sector characteristic of the 1960s/70s - led to a sizeable expansion of the city's population. It was during these decades that the Hill area on the city's Southside was largely developed and bedroom communities such as New Maryland emerged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1960s also saw an expansion of the University of New Brunswick due to increased post-war university enrolment, as well as the construction of the Fredericton campus of Saint Thomas University. Also contributing to this expansion was the move of the Law School from Saint John to the Fredericton area. This expansion of the post-secondary sector also contributed to Fredericton's population growth during the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, the city's population has continued to grow though at a slower rate due to slower growth of the government sector, along with hiring freezes and in some cases layoffs, during the Frank McKenna and Bernard Lord governments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, increased student enrolment at the city's universities has led to greater demand for rental property. This has led to the construction of new university residences and apartment buildings in the city, and increased rates of rent, making them the highest rental rates in the province.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe predominance of the universities and government provide Fredericton with a measure of economic stability. The city has not been subject to the uncertainty and hardships faced by Atlantic Canadian cities dealing with mill shutdowns and the decline of the mining and fishing industries. For this reason, Fredericton is one of the few Atlantic Canadian cities that has actually reported a population increase in recent years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city has been investing actively in IT infrastructure. The City of Fredericton won the \\"Judges Innovation Award\\" at the 2004 Canadian Information Productivity Awards due to their \\"Fred-eZone\\" free municipality wide WiFi network initiative. This and other innovations by the city's utelco, e-Novations, led Intel to do a case study on their successes. Fred-eZone spans much of the citys downtown and parts of surrounding residential areas, as well as peripheral commercial areas such as Fredericton's Regent Mall. In 2008 and 2009 the Intelligent Community Forum selected Fredericton as a Top 7 Intelligent Community, based partly on the city's work in the IT sector.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greater Fredericton region has also established an investment attraction program called Invest Greater Fredericton. The purpose is to provide investors and site selectors with one central source for economic information such as real estate, demographics, key industries and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton's public schools are located in either the Anglophone West School District (formerly known as District 18, and prior to that, District 26) or the District Scolaire Francophone Sud (District 1). Fredericton is home to three public high schools, two operating in the English language and one in the French language. Fredericton High School, which was once the largest school in the Commonwealth of Nations, operates in English and primarily serves students living on Fredericton's south side. It is also one of the oldest public high schools in Canada, tracing its beginnings to 1785 ÿ having celebrated its bicentennial in 1985. Fredericton High School is home to several sports teams ÿ including basketball, hockey, soccer, and football ÿ which dominated New Brunswick provincial high school sports championships during much of the 1980s and 1990s. The school motto is \\"Palma Non Sine Pulvere\\", Latin for \\"No Reward Without Effort\\" (literally \\"no palm without dust\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nLeo Hayes High School, which opened in 1999, also operates in English and primarily serves students living on Fredericton's north side. The high school is a Public Private Partnership, known as a P3. Leo Hayes' current principal is Brad Sturgeon. The motto of the school is \\"Somnia Sunt Circuli Veritatis\\", Latin for \\"Dreams are the Seedlings of Reality\\". Leo Hayes High School places priority on both Arts and Athletics, in addition to Academia. In addition, there are four middle schools, fourteen elementary schools and three private schools in the city. A recent issue with middle schools in the city has been the location of George Street Middle School and Albert Street Middle School close to the city centre. This fails to account for the city's changing demographic which has seen the growth of suburban neighbourhoods. In 2009 Albert Street Middle School was replaced by Bliss Carman Middle School, located in the Kimble Road Park area of Skyline Acres. Albert Street Middle School has since been demolished, with a new YMCA having been erected in its place.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton is also served by cole Sainte-Anne (ESA), which provides French language education for grades 6-12, and cole des Batisseurs (opened in 2007) and cole Les claireurs (opened in 2015), which provide K-5 education on the north and south side, respectively. cole Sainte-Anne is in the same building as that used by the French community centre - the Centre communautaire Sainte-Anne, which also houses the French public library, the Dr. Margurite Michaud Library, and an amphitheatre.  The current principal of ESA is Gabrielle McLaughlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton is also home to a private Christian school, Fredericton Christian Academy, which is located on the Northside. Its current principal is Jonathan McAloon.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton's status as an educational centre is evident in the city's two degree-granting universities: the University of New Brunswick and St. Thomas University. The University of New Brunswick (UNB) was founded in 1785, making it the oldest public university in North America, compared to the oldest private university, Harvard University, in 1636. Built in 1826, UNB's Old Arts Building is the oldest university building still in use in Canada. UNB also houses Renaissance College, which is a leading leadership training institution in New Brunswick. UNB houses a Faculty of Law which is one of two Anglophone common-law schools in Atlantic Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Thomas University (STU) is the province's only Catholic university and has been located in Fredericton since 1964, when it moved from its Chatham, New Brunswick campus. It is a liberal arts university with programs in gerontology, criminology, journalism, social work, native studies, and education. STU offers an excellent program in Human Rights and is the home of the Atlantic Human Rights Research and Development Centre.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton is also home to several colleges and similar institutions. The New Brunswick College of Craft and Design houses the province's leading programs in photography and visual arts. The Fredericton location of the New Brunswick Community College is on the campus of the University of New Brunswick. The Maritime College of Forest Technology maintains its English-language campus in the city. MCFT is a small post-secondary school training students from across the Maritime provinces.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther institutions include 3D and 2D animation schools such as da Vinci College and the Gaming and Animation Institute of Fredericton. Located on the north side is a small Pentecostal College, the Northeast Christian College, which trains and certifies Pentecostal ministers.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlongside Fredericton's more established universities, the city also is home to several online for-profit universities. University of Fredericton (UFred) and Yorkville University are operational. The University of Fredericton was founded in 2006, making it the youngest private university in Canada. It is a degree-granting online university providing certificate and graduate degree programs in business leadership. UFred offers MBA and EMBA Programs under Section 3 of the Degree Granting Act of the Province of New Brunswick in Canada.[31] Yorkville offers graduate programs in counselling psychology and adult education. Meritus closed in 2012. These universities typically have offices downtown.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton hosts several major research centres - dealing with policy development, agriculture, forestry, and engineering. These research institutions are connected to the city's two universities as well as the provincial and federal governments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hugh John Flemming Forestry Centre (including Provincial and Federal Departments) is the leading forestry research centre in Atlantic Canada. This Centre carries out major research endeavours in forestry management and scientific research. The Centre closely collaborates with the Forestry Department at the University of New Brunswick which is one of the top Forestry Departments in Canada.  As well, research and development in agriculture and crop development is carried out at the Agricultural Research Station in Lincoln.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University of New Brunswick is the site of several major research centres in social science, forestry, geomatics and biomedical engineering, and policy development. These include the Centre for Conflict Studies, which carries out research on military and strategic issues and the Muriel McQueen Fergusson Centre for Family Violence Research, which carries out multi-disciplinary research on family violence issues. Furthermore, the Institute of Biomedical Engineering has completed groundbreaking work on prosthetic limbs to aid war amputees in developing countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well, the city's growing IT sector has been the basis for new research on IT and computer programming development, including the October 2002 opening of the National Research Council of Canada Institute for Information Technology ÿ e-Business facility, located on the University of New Brunswick campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton is also the home of New Brunswick's Provincial Research Organization (PRO), RPC. RPC specializes in applied research and technical services in support of New Brunswick industry.  Specializations include capabilities in aquaculture, mining, manufacturing, energy and the environment.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAir service is provided out of the Fredericton International Airport, located approximately 15 kilometres east of downtown in Lincoln. It is served by Air Canada Express, which operates direct flights to Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Halifax. Seasonal direct flights are also offered to Cuba and the Caribbean during the late winter and early spring months. As of May 2015, WestJet Encore provides daily Q400 Turboprop service to Toronto.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton Transit provides bus transit service to most areas of the city.  All city buses feature bike racks so that cyclists can take advantage of bus services as well. Fredericton is also served by several taxi companies. The major companies in alphabetical order are: ABC Car Services, Checker Cab, George's Skycab, Loyal Taxi, Standard Taxi and Trius Taxi.[citation needed] Fredericton started installing bicycle lanes in July 2008, with a plan to establish 45 kilometres of on-street painted bicycle lanes and 39 kilometres of signed bicycle routes by 2011.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no rail service into Fredericton. Passenger service started in 1869 and ended in the 1960s. Via Rail's \\"Atlantic\\" passenger train ran for many years between Saint John and Montreal, stopping at Fredericton Junction, about 28 kilometers south of Fredericton, and passing through Maine. The service was cancelled in the Via Rail cuts of 1981, but it was resumed in 1985. In 1994, Canadian Pacific announced that it would abandon its railway line through Maine and New Brunswick, thus leading to VIA Rail's decision to cancel the Atlantic train service. The last passenger train left Fredericton Junction in November 1994.[34] Freight service to Fredericton ended in 1996 and all railway tracks have been abandoned and removed. The city joined St. John's and Charlottetown as Canada's only provincial capitals without rail service. Since 1 December 2012, Fredericton has been served by Maritime Bus connections to points throughout Eastern Canada.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton is located on the Trans-Canada Highway, which passes along the southern municipal boundary. Routes 7 and 8 (the latter being a former alignment of the Trans-Canada) also pass through the city. Two highway bridges, the Westmorland Street Bridge and the Princess Margaret Bridge, cross the Saint John River. Those bridges feed into controlled-access roads (Routes 8 and 105 serving the city's north side.) The city's highway system is mostly complete, and traffic jams rarely occur.\\r\\n\\r\\nStreets in downtown follow a grid pattern. In residential areas of downtown, some neighbourhoods are traffic-calmed and include traffic circles at intersections to slow the speed of cars and discourage thoroughfare traffic. Northumberland Street and Odell Avenue have adopted speedbumps to slow fast moving traffic. The pattern of streets in the rest of the city varies including straight thoroughfares (such as Smythe Street, Prospect Street and Regent Street), to curved streets and cul-de-sacs in primarily residential areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredericton has a network of 25 trails totalling more than 85 kilometres (53?mi) on both sides of the Saint John and Nashwaak Rivers. Many of the city trails are rail trails that follow old railway lines. These include the Old Train Bridge that spans 0.6?km across the Saint John River, providing a panoramic view of downtown Fredericton. The rail trail system in Fredericton is part of the Sentier NB Trail system and some of these trails are also part of the larger Trans-Canada Trail network. Some sections of the trail system are being paved to make it more accessible to non-motorized vehicles such as bicycles and wheelchairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nRailway service through Fredericton was discontinued by CP Rail in fall 1993 and CN Rail in spring 1996. Following abandonment, both companies sold their right-of-ways to the provincial government which developed the trail network in partnership with the city and volunteer trail organizations. The trails are used by residents for walking, biking, and jogging and boast several scenic vistas along the Saint John and Nashwaak rivers as well as a mix of urban and wooded/natural scenery.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the south side of the city, CP Rail's Fredericton Subdivision enters the city from Rusagonis-Waasis to the south, following the Wilsey Road and Beaverbrook Street to the former railway yard where a Sobeys supermarket has been built along Regent Street. The former CP passenger station (York Street Railway Station) is located at the end of the Fredericton Subdivision and, after sitting abandoned for decades, was renovated into a winery and liquor store in 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the north side of the city, CP Rail's Gibson Subdivision enters the city from Douglas in the west, following the Saint John River through Nashwaaksis to South Devon. CP Rail's Minto Subdivision enters the city from Barker's Point in the east and follows the Saint John River to South Devon and crossing the Nashwaak River. CP Rail's Marysville Spur runs from Barker's Point to Marysville along the east bank of the Nashwaak River.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the south side, CN Rail's Oromocto Subdivision enters the city from Lincoln in the east and parallels the former CP line to the downtown rail yard and York Street Station. CN's former Centreville Subdivision continues beyond the station to Silverwood in the west; this rail line was abandoned west of the Hanwell Road after the Mactaquac Dam opened in 1968 and flooded the right-of-way through to Woodstock. CN Rail's Nashwaak Subdivision joined the Oromocto Subdivision at Una Junction, immediately north of Beaverbrook Street opposite the University of New Brunswick campus. The line proceeds north, crossing the Saint John River on the Fredericton Railway Bridge, to the former railway yard in South Devon where CP Rail's Gibson and Minto subdivisions join. The Nashwaak Subdivision continues up the Nashwaak River valley to McGivney.\\r\\n\\r\\nReading Park Trail (/?r?d??/?(?listen) RED-ing) is a 1.1?km forested trail going through Reading Park in Skyline Acres on the City's south side. Protected by trees, and constructed in a loop, Reading Park Trail is very popular with city residents for walking their dogs. It's also a destination for bird watchers, as the park's old-growth forest is one of the city's last remaining habitats for the pileated woodpecker.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 455700N 664000W? / ?45.95000N 66.66667W? / 45.95000; -66.66667?

The eruption (a VEI 5 event) was the only significant volcanic eruption to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states since the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak in California.[1] However, it has often been declared as the most disastrous volcanic eruption in United States history. The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes, caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on the mountain's north slope.\\r\\nAn earthquake at 8:32:17?a.m. PDT (UTC?7) on Sunday, May 18, 1980, caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, creating the largest landslide ever recorded. This allowed the partly molten, high-pressure gas- and steam-rich rock in the volcano to suddenly explode northwards toward Spirit Lake in a hot mix of lava and pulverized older rock, overtaking the avalanching face.\\r\\nAn eruption column rose 80,000 feet (24?km; 15?mi) into the atmosphere and deposited ash in 11 U.S. states.[2] At the same time, snow, ice and several entire glaciers on the volcano melted, forming a series of large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that reached as far as the Columbia River, nearly 50 miles (80?km) to the southwest. Less severe outbursts continued into the next day, only to be followed by other large, but not as destructive, eruptions later that year. Thermal energy released during the eruption was equal to 26 megatons. [3]\\r\\nApproximately 57 people were killed directly, including innkeeper Harry R. Truman, photographers Reid Blackburn and Robert Landsburg, and geologist David A. Johnston.[4] Hundreds of square miles were reduced to wasteland, causing over a billion U.S. dollars in damage ($3.03 billion in 2017 dollars[5]), thousands of animals were killed, and Mount St. Helens was left with a crater on its north side. At the time of the eruption, the summit of the volcano was owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad, but afterward the land passed to the United States Forest Service.[6] The area was later preserved, as it was, in the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMount St. Helens remained dormant from its last period of activity in the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980.[7] Several small earthquakes, apparently beginning on March 15, indicated that magma may have begun moving below the volcano.[8] On March 20, at 3:45?p.m. Pacific Standard Time (all times will be in PST or PDT), a shallow magnitude 4.2 earthquake (the initial reading was 4.1), centered below the volcano's north flank,[8] signaled the volcano's violent return from 123?years of hibernation.[9] A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels in the next two days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale.[10] A total of 174 shocks of magnitude?2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days.[11]\\r\\nShocks of magnitude?3.2 or greater occurred at a slightly increasing rate during April and May with five earthquakes of magnitude?4 or above per day in early April, and eight?per?day the week before May 18.[9] Initially there was no direct sign of eruption, but small earthquake-induced avalanches of snow and ice were reported from aerial observations.\\r\\nAt 12:36?p.m. on March 27, phreatic eruptions (explosions of steam caused by magma suddenly heating groundwater) ejected and smashed rock from within the old summit crater, excavating a new crater 250 feet (75?m) wide[9] and sending an ash column about 7,000 feet (2,100?m) into the air.[11] By this date a 16,000-foot-long (4,900?m) eastward-trending fracture system had also developed across the summit area.[12] This was followed by more earthquake swarms and a series of steam explosions that sent ash 10,000 to 11,000 feet (3,000 to 3,400?m) above their vent.[9] Most of this ash fell between 3 and 12 miles (5 and 19?km) from its vent, but some was carried 150 miles (240?km) south to Bend, Oregon, or 285 miles (459?km) east to Spokane, Washington.[13]\\r\\nA second, new crater and a blue flame were observed on March 29.[13][14] The flame was visibly emitted from both craters and was probably created by burning gases. Static electricity generated from ash clouds rolling down the volcano sent out lightning bolts that were up to 2 miles (3?km) long.[13] Ninety-three separate outbursts were reported on March 30,[13] and increasingly strong harmonic tremors were first detected on April 1, alarming geologists and prompting Governor Dixy Lee Ray to declare a state of emergency on April 3.[14] Governor Ray issued an executive order on April 30 creating a \\"red zone\\" around the volcano; anyone caught in this zone without a pass faced a $500 fine or six months in jail.[15] This precluded many cabin owners from visiting their property.\\r\\nBy April 7 the combined crater was 1,700 feet long by 1,200?ft wide and 500?ft deep (520G370G150?m).[16] A USGS team determined in the last week of April that a 1.5-mile-diameter (2.4?km) section of St. Helens' north face was displaced outward by at least 270 feet (82?m).[12] For the rest of April and early May this bulge grew by 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8?m) per day, and by mid-May it extended more than 400 feet (120?m) north.[12] As the bulge moved northward, the summit area behind it progressively sank, forming a complex, down-dropped block called a graben. Geologists announced on April 30 that sliding of the bulge area was the greatest immediate danger and that such a landslide might spark an eruption. These changes in the volcano's shape were related to the overall deformation that increased the volume of the volcano by 0.03 cubic miles (0.13?km3) by mid-May.[17] This volume increase presumably corresponded to the volume of magma that pushed into the volcano and deformed its surface. Because the intruded magma remained below ground and was not directly visible, it was called a cryptodome, in contrast to a true lava dome exposed at the surface.\\r\\nOn May 7, eruptions similar to those in March and April resumed, and over the next days the bulge approached its maximum size.[18] All activity had been confined to the 350-year-old summit dome and did not involve any new magma. A total of about 10,000 earthquakes were recorded prior to the May 18 event, with most concentrated in a small zone less than 1.6 miles (2.6?km) directly below the bulge.[17] Visible eruptions ceased on May 16, reducing public interest and consequently the number of spectators in the area.[19] Mounting public pressure then forced officials to allow 50 carloads of property owners to enter the danger zone on May 17 to gather whatever property they could carry.[19] Another trip was scheduled for 10?a.m. the next day.[19] Because that next day was Sunday, more than 300 loggers would not be working in the area. By the time of the climactic eruption, dacite magma intruding into the volcano had forced the north flank outward nearly 500 feet (150?m) and heated the volcano's groundwater system, causing many steam-driven explosions (phreatic eruptions).\\r\\nAs May 18 dawned, Mount St. Helens' activity did not show any change from the pattern of the preceding month. The rate of bulge movement, sulfur dioxide emission, and ground temperature readings did not reveal any changes indicating a catastrophic eruption. USGS volcanologist David A. Johnston was on duty at an observation post approximately 6 miles (10?km) north of the volcano: as of 6?a.m., Johnston's measurements did not indicate any unusual activity.[6]\\r\\nSuddenly, at 8:32?a.m., a magnitude?5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope triggered that part of the volcano to slide,[20] approximately 7ÿ20?seconds (about 10?seconds seems most reasonable) after the shock.[6] The landslide, the largest in recorded history, travelled at 110 to 155 miles per hour (177 to 249?km/h) and moved across Spirit Lake's west arm. Part of it hit a 1,150-foot-high (350?m) ridge about 6 miles (10?km) north.[6] Some of the slide spilled over the ridge, but most of it moved 13 miles (21?km) down the North Fork Toutle River, filling its valley up to 600 feet (180?m) deep with avalanche debris.[20] An area of about 24 square miles (62?km2) was covered, and the total volume of the deposit was about 0.7 cubic miles (2.9?km3).[6]\\r\\nScientists were able to reconstruct the motion of the landslide from a series of rapid photographs by Gary Rosenquist, who was camping 11 miles (18?km) away from the blast.[6] Rosenquist, his party and his photographs survived because the blast was deflected by local topography 1 mile (1.6?km) short of his location.[21]\\r\\nMost of St. Helens' former north side became a rubble deposit 17 miles (27?km) long, averaging 150 feet (46?m) thick; the slide was thickest at 1 mile (1.6?km) below Spirit Lake and thinnest at its western margin.[6] Thousands of trees were torn from the surrounding hillside after the lake was sloshed 800 feet (240?m) up the hillside. All the water in Spirit Lake was temporarily displaced by the landslide, sending 600-foot-high (180?m) waves crashing into a ridge north of the lake,[22] adding 295 feet (90?m) of new avalanche debris above the old lakebed, and raising its surface level by about 200 feet.[6] As the water moved back into its basin, it pulled with it thousands of trees felled by a super-heated wall of volcanic gas and searing ash and rock that had overtaken the landslide seconds before. More than three decades after the eruption, mats of floating dead trees remain on Spirit Lake and nearby St. Helens Lake; the mats change position with the wind.\\r\\nThe landslide exposed the dacite magma in St. Helens' neck to much lower pressure, causing the gas-charged, partially molten rock and high-pressure steam above it to explode a few seconds after the landslide started. Explosions burst through the trailing part of the landslide, blasting rock debris northward. The resulting blast laterally directed the pyroclastic flow of very hot volcanic gases, ash and pumice formed from new lava, while the pulverized old rock hugged the ground, initially moving at 220 miles per hour (350?km/h) but quickly accelerating to 670?mph (1,080?km/h), and it might have briefly passed the speed of sound.[6][20]\\r\\nPyroclastic flow material passed over the moving avalanche and spread outward, devastating a fan-shaped area 23 miles across by 19 miles long (37?km?G 31?km).[20] In total about 230 square miles (600?km2) of forest was knocked down,[20] and extreme heat killed trees miles beyond the blow-down zone. At its vent the lateral blast probably did not last longer than about 30?seconds, but the northward-radiating and expanding blast cloud continued for about another minute.\\r\\nSuperheated flow material flashed water in Spirit Lake and North Fork Toutle River to steam, creating a larger, secondary explosion that was heard as far away as British Columbia,[23] Montana, Idaho, and Northern California. Yet many areas closer to the eruption (Portland, Oregon, for example) did not hear the blast. This so-called \\"quiet zone\\" extended radially a few tens of miles from the volcano and was created by the complex response of the eruption's sound waves to differences in temperature and air motion of the atmospheric layers and, to a lesser extent, local topography.[6]\\r\\nLater studies indicated that one-third of the 0.045 cubic miles (0.19?km3) of material in the flow was new lava, and the rest was fragmented, older rock.[23]\\r\\nEveryone in the quiet zone could see the huge ash cloud that was sent skyward from St. Helens' northern foot. The near-supersonic lateral blast, loaded with volcanic debris, caused devastation as far as 19 miles (31?km) from the volcano. The area affected by the blast can be subdivided into three roughly concentric zones:[6]\\r\\nBy the time this pyroclastic flow hit its first human victims, it was still as hot as 360?C (680?F) and filled with suffocating gas and flying angular material.[23] Most of the 57 people known to have died in that day's eruption succumbed to asphyxiation while several died from burns.[6] Lodge owner Harry R. Truman was buried under hundreds of feet of avalanche material. Volcanologist David A. Johnston was one of those killed, as was Reid Blackburn, a National Geographic photographer. Robert Landsburg, another photographer, was killed by the ash cloud. He was able to protect his film with his body, and the surviving photos provided geologists with valuable documentation of the historic eruption.[24]\\r\\nSubsequent outpourings of pyroclastic material from the breach left by the landslide consisted mainly of new magmatic debris rather than fragments of preexisting volcanic rocks. The resulting deposits formed a fan-like pattern of overlapping sheets, tongues and lobes. At least 17 separate pyroclastic flows occurred during the May 18 eruption, and their aggregate volume was about 0.05 cubic miles (210,000,000?m3).[6]\\r\\nThe flow deposits were still at about 300 to 420?C (572 to 788?F) two weeks after they erupted.[6] Secondary steam-blast eruptions fed by this heat created pits on the northern margin of the pyroclastic-flow deposits, at the south shore of Spirit Lake, and along the upper part of the North Fork Toutle River. These steam-blast explosions continued sporadically for weeks or months after the emplacement of pyroclastic flows, and at least one occurred a year later, on May 16, 1981.[6]\\r\\nAs the avalanche and initial pyroclastic flow were still advancing, a huge ash column grew to a height of 12 miles (19?km) above the expanding crater in less than 10?minutes and spread tephra into the stratosphere for 10 straight hours.[23] Near the volcano, the swirling ash particles in the atmosphere generated lightning, which in turn started many forest fires. During this time, parts of the mushroom-shaped ash-cloud column collapsed, and fell back upon the earth. This fallout, mixed with magma, mud and steam, sent additional pyroclastic flows speeding down St. Helens' flanks. Later, slower flows came directly from the new north-facing crater and consisted of glowing pumice bombs and very hot pumiceous ash. Some of these hot flows covered ice or water which flashed to steam, creating craters up to 65 feet (20?m) in diameter and sending ash as much as 6,500 feet (2,000?m) into the air.[25]\\r\\nStrong high-altitude wind carried much of this material east-northeasterly from the volcano at an average speed of about 60 miles per hour (97?km/h). By 9:45?a.m. it had reached Yakima, Washington, 90 miles (140?km) away, and by 11:45?a.m. it was over Spokane, Washington.[6] A total of 4 to 5 inches (100 to 130?mm) of ash fell on Yakima, and areas as far east as Spokane were plunged into darkness by noon where visibility was reduced to 10 feet (3.0?m) and 0.5 inches (13?mm) of ash fell.[23] Continuing eastward, St. Helens' ash fell in the western part of Yellowstone National Park by 10:15?p.m. and was seen on the ground in Denver, Colorado, the next day.[23] In time, ash fall from this eruption was reported as far away as Minnesota and Oklahoma, and some of the ash drifted around the globe within about 2?weeks.\\r\\nDuring the nine hours of vigorous eruptive activity, about 540,000,000 tons of ash fell over an area of more than 22,000 square miles (57,000?km2).[6] The total volume of the ash before its compaction by rainfall was about 0.3 cubic miles (1.3?km3).[6] The volume of the uncompacted ash is equivalent to about 0.05 cubic miles (210,000,000?m3) of solid rock, or about 7% of the amount of material that slid off in the debris avalanche.[6] By around 5:30?p.m. on May 18, the vertical ash column declined in stature, but less severe outbursts continued through the next several days.[26]\\r\\nGenerally, given that the way airborne ash is deposited after an eruption is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions, a certain variation of the ash type will occur, as a function of distance to the volcano or time elapsed from eruption. The ash from Mount St. Helens is no exception, and hence the ash properties have large variations.[27]\\r\\nThe bulk chemical composition of the ash has been found to be approximately 65% silicon dioxide, 18% aluminium oxide, 5% ferric oxide, 4% each calcium oxide and sodium oxide and 2% magnesium oxide. Trace chemicals were also detected, their concentrations varying as shown: 0.05ÿ0.09% chlorine, 0.02ÿ0.03% fluorine, and 0.09ÿ0.3% sulphur.[27]\\r\\nThe index of refraction, a number used in physics to describe how light propagates through a particular substance, is an important property of volcanic ash. This number is complex having both real and imaginary parts, the real part indicating how light disperses and the imaginary part indicating how light is absorbed by the substance.\\r\\nIt is known that the silicate particles have a real index of refraction ranging between 1.5 and 1.6 for visible light. However, there is a spectrum of colors associated with samples of volcanic ash, from very light to dark gray. This makes for variations in the measured imaginary refractive index under visible light.[28]\\r\\nIn the case of Mount St. Helens, the ash settled in three main layers on the ground:[27]\\r\\nFor example, when comparing the imaginary part of the refractive index k of stratospheric ash from 15?km and 18?km from the volcano it has been discovered that they have similar values around 700?nm (around 0.009), while they differ significantly around 300?nm. Here, the 18?km (k was found to be around 0.009) sample was much more absorbent than the 15?km sample (k was found to be around 0.002).[28]\\r\\nThe hot, exploding material also broke apart and melted nearly all of the mountain's glaciers along with most of the overlying snow. As in many previous St. Helens' eruptions, this created huge lahars (volcanic mudflows) and muddy floods that affected three of the four stream drainage systems on the mountain,[25] and which started to move as early as 8:50?a.m.[22] Lahars travelled as fast as 90 miles per hour (140?km/h) while still high on the volcano but progressively slowed to about 3 miles per hour (4.8?km/h) on the flatter and wider parts of rivers.[6] Mudflows from the southern and eastern flanks had the consistency of wet concrete as they raced down Muddy River, Pine Creek and Smith Creek to their confluence at the Lewis River. Bridges were taken out at the mouth of Pine Creek and the head of Swift Reservoir, which rose 2.6 feet (0.79?m)[25] by noon to accommodate the nearly 18,000,000 cubic yards (14,000,000?m3) of additional water, mud and debris.[6]\\r\\nGlacier and snow melt mixed with tephra on the volcano's northeast slope to create much larger lahars. These mudflows traveled down the north and south forks of the Toutle River and joined at the confluence of the Toutle forks and the Cowlitz River near Castle Rock, Washington, at 1:00?p.m. Ninety minutes after the eruption, the first mudflow had moved 27 miles (43?km) upstream where observers at Weyerhaeuser's Camp Baker saw a 12-foot-high (4?m) wall of muddy water and debris pass.[22] Near the confluence of the Toutle's north and south forks at Silver Lake, a record flood stage of 23.5 feet (7.2?m) was recorded.[22]\\r\\nA large but slower-moving mudflow with a mortar-like consistency was mobilized in early afternoon at the head of the Toutle River north fork. By 2:30?p.m. the massive mudflow had destroyed Camp Baker,[22] and in the following hours seven bridges were carried away. Part of the flow backed up for 2.5 miles (4.0?km) soon after entering the Cowlitz River, but most continued downstream. After traveling 17 miles (27?km) further, an estimated 3,900,000 cubic yards (3,000,000?m3) of material were injected into the Columbia River, reducing the river's depth by 25 feet (8?m) for a 4-mile (6?km) stretch.[22] The resulting 13-foot (4.0?m) river depth temporarily closed the busy channel to ocean-going freighters, costing Portland, Oregon, an estimated five million US dollars.[26] Ultimately more than 65?million cubic yards (50?million cubic metres) of sediment were dumped along the lower Cowlitz and Columbia Rivers.[6]\\r\\nThe May 18, 1980, event was the most deadly and economically destructive volcanic eruption in the history of the United States.[6] Approximately fifty-seven people were killed directly from the blast and 200 houses, 47 bridges, 15 miles (24?km) of railways and 185 miles (298?km) of highway were destroyed; two people were killed indirectly in accidents that resulted from poor visibility, and two more suffered fatal heart attacks from shoveling ash.[29] U.S. President Jimmy Carter surveyed the damage and said it looked more desolate than a moonscape.[30][31] A film crew was dropped by helicopter on Mount St. Helens on May 23 to document the destruction. However, their compasses spun in circles and they quickly became lost.[32] A second eruption occurred the next day (see below), but the crew survived and were rescued two days after that. The eruption ejected more than 1 cubic mile (4.2?km3) of material.[33] A quarter of that volume was fresh lava in the form of ash, pumice and volcanic bombs while the rest was fragmented, older rock.[33] The removal of the north side of the mountain (13% of the cone's volume) reduced Mount St. Helens' height by about 1,280 feet (390?m) and left a crater 1 to 2 miles (2 to 3?km) wide and 2,100 feet (640?m) deep with its north end open in a huge breach.[33]\\r\\nMore than 4,000,000,000 board feet (9,400,000?m3) of timber was damaged or destroyed, mainly by the lateral blast.[6] At least 25% of the destroyed timber was salvaged after September 1980. Downwind of the volcano, in areas of thick ash accumulation, many agricultural crops, such as wheat, apples, potatoes and alfalfa, were destroyed. As many as 1,500 elk and 5,000 deer were killed, and an estimated 12 million[6] Chinook and Coho salmon fingerlings died when their hatcheries were destroyed. Another estimated 40,000 young salmon were lost when they swam through turbine blades of hydroelectric generators after reservoir levels were lowered along the Lewis River to accommodate possible mudflows and flood waters.[6]\\r\\nIn total Mount St. Helens released 24 megatons of thermal energy, 7 of which were a direct result of the blast. This is equivalent to 1,600 times the size of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.[34]\\r\\nThere is a minor controversy in regards to the exact death toll. The figure most commonly cited is fifty-seven. However, there are two points of dispute.\\r\\nThe first point regards two officially listed victims, Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer. They were reported missing after the explosion. In the aftermath, investigators were able to locate individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well. However, they were unable to determine who reported Hiatt missing, and the person who was listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she wasn't the one who had done so. Since the investigators could not thus verify that they were the same Hiatt and Thayer who were reported missing, the names remain listed among the presumed dead.[35][36]\\r\\nThe second point regards three missing people who are not officially listed as victims: Robert Ruffle, Steven Whitsett and Mark Melanson. Cowlitz County Emergency Services Management lists them as \\"Possibly Missing  Not on [the official] List\\". According to Melanson's brother, in October 1983, Cowlitz County officials told his family that Melanson \\"is believed [...] a victim of the May 18, 1980, eruption\\" and that after years of searching, the family eventually decided \\"he's buried in the ash\\".[36]\\r\\nTaking these two points of dispute into consideration, the direct death toll could be as low as fifty-five or as high as sixty. When combined with the four indirect victims mentioned earlier, those numbers range from fifty-nine to sixty-four.\\r\\nThe ash fall created some temporary major problems with transportation, sewage disposal, and water treatment systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane was closed for a week and a half.[6] Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures.[6] Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal-combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused short circuits in electrical transformers, which in turn caused power blackouts.\\r\\nRemoving and disposing of the ash was a monumental task for some Eastern Washington communities. State and federal agencies estimated that over 2,400,000 cubic yards (1,800,000?m3) of ash, equivalent to about 900,000 tons in weight, were removed from highways and airports in Washington.[6] The ash removal cost $2.2 million and took 10 weeks in Yakima.[6] The need to remove ash quickly from transport routes and civil works dictated the selection of some disposal sites. Some cities used old quarries and existing sanitary landfills; others created dump sites wherever expedient. To minimize wind reworking of ash dumps, the surfaces of some disposal sites were covered with topsoil and seeded with grass. In Portland, the mayor eventually threatened businesses with fines if they failed to remove the ash from their parking lots.[37]\\r\\nA refined estimate of $1.1?billion ($2.74 billion in 2007 dollars[38]) was determined in a study by the International Trade Commission at the request of the United States Congress.[6] A supplemental appropriation of $951?million for disaster relief was voted by Congress, of which the largest share went to the Small Business Administration, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.[6]\\r\\nThere were also indirect and intangible costs of the eruption. Unemployment in the immediate region of Mount St. Helens rose tenfold in the weeks immediately following the eruption, and then returned to near-normal levels once timber-salvaging and ash-cleanup operations were underway. Only a small percentage of residents left the region because of lost jobs owing to the eruption.[6] Several months after May 18, a few residents reported suffering stress and emotional problems, even though they had coped successfully during the crisis. Counties in the region requested funding for mental health programs to assist such people.[6]\\r\\nInitial public reaction to the May 18 eruption dealt a nearly crippling blow to tourism, an important industry in Washington. Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. HelensÿGifford Pinchot National Forest area, but conventions, meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring Oregon not affected by the eruption. The adverse effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained its appeal for tourists. The United States Forest Service and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano's devastation.[6]\\r\\nSt. Helens produced an additional five explosive eruptions between May and October 1980. Through early 1990 at least 21 periods of eruptive activity had occurred. The volcano remains active, with smaller, dome-building eruptions continuing into 2008.\\r\\nAn eruption occurred on May 25, 1980, at 2:30?a.m. that sent an ash column 9 miles (14?km) into the atmosphere.[33] The eruption was preceded by a sudden increase in earthquake activity and occurred during a rainstorm. Erratic wind from the storm carried ash from the eruption to the south and west, lightly dusting large parts of western Washington and Oregon. Pyroclastic flows exited the northern breach and covered avalanche debris, lahars and other pyroclastic flows deposited by the May 18 eruption.[33]\\r\\nAt 7:05?p.m. on June 12, a plume of ash billowed 2.5 miles (4.0?km) above the volcano. At 9:09?p.m. a much stronger explosion sent an ash column about 10 miles (16?km) skyward.[39] This event caused the Portland area, previously spared by wind direction, to be thinly coated with ash in the middle of the annual Rose Festival.[40] A dacite dome then oozed into existence on the crater floor, growing to a height of 200 feet (61?m) and a width of 1,200 feet (370?m) within a week.[39]\\r\\nA series of large explosions on July 22 broke more than a month of relative quiet. The July eruptive episode was preceded by several days of measurable expansion of the summit area, heightened earthquake activity, and changed emission rates of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. The first hit at 5:14?p.m. as an ash column shot 10 miles (16?km) and was followed by a faster blast at 6:25?p.m. that pushed the ash column above its previous maximum height in just 7.5?minutes.[39] The final explosion started at 7:01?p.m. and continued for over two hours.[39] When the relatively small amount of ash settled over eastern Washington, the dome built in June was gone.[41]\\r\\nSeismic activity and gas emission steadily increased in early August, and on August 7 at 4:26?p.m., an ash cloud slowly expanded 8 miles (13?km) into the sky.[41] Small pyroclastic flows came through the northern breach and a weaker outpouring of ash rose from the crater. This continued until 10:32?p.m. when a second large blast sent ash high into the air, proceeding due north.[41] A second dacite dome filled this vent a few days later.\\r\\nTwo months of repose were ended by an eruption lasting from October 16 to 18. This event obliterated the second dome, sent ash 10 miles (16?km) in the air and created small, red-hot pyroclastic flows.[41] A third dome began to form within 30?minutes after the final explosion on October 18, and within a few days, it was about 900 feet (270?m) wide and 130 feet (40?m) high. In spite of the dome growth next to it, a new glacier formed rapidly inside the crater.\\r\\nAll of the post-1980 eruptions were quiet dome-building events, beginning with the December 27, 1980, to January 3, 1981, episode. By 1987 the third dome had grown to be more than 3,000 feet (910?m) wide and 800 feet (240?m) high.[41]\\r\\nFurther eruptions occurred over a few months between 1989 and 1991.\\r\\nThe 2004ÿ08 volcanic activity of Mount St. Helens has been documented as a continuous eruption with a gradual extrusion of magma at the Mount St. Helens volcano. Starting in October 2004 there was a gradual building of a new lava dome. The new dome did not rise above the caldera created by the 1980 eruption. This activity lasted until January 2008.\\r\\nMay 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens\\r\\n?This article incorporates public domain material?from the?United States Geological Survey document:?\\"Eruptions of Mount St. Helens: Past, Present, and Future\\".

Autonomic functions include control of respiration, cardiac regulation (the cardiac control center), vasomotor activity (the vasomotor center), and certain reflex actions such as coughing, sneezing, swallowing and vomiting. Those are then subdivided into other areas and are also linked to ANS subsystems and nervous systems external to the brain. The hypothalamus, just above the brain stem, acts as an integrator for autonomic functions, receiving ANS regulatory input from the limbic system to do so.[3]\\r\\nThe autonomic nervous system has three branches: the sympathetic nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system and the enteric nervous system.[4][5][6][7] Some textbooks do not include the enteric nervous system as part of this system.[8] The sympathetic nervous system is often considered the \\"fight or flight\\" system, while the parasympathetic nervous system is often considered the \\"rest and digest\\" or \\"feed and breed\\" system. In many cases, both of these systems have \\"opposite\\" actions where one system activates a physiological response and the other inhibits it. An older simplification of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems as \\"excitory\\" and \\"inhibitory\\" was overturned due to the many exceptions found. A more modern characterization is that the sympathetic nervous system is a \\"quick response mobilizing system\\" and the parasympathetic is a \\"more slowly activated dampening system\\", but even this has exceptions, such as in sexual arousal and orgasm, wherein both play a role.[3]\\r\\nThere are inhibitory and excitatory synapses between neurons. Relatively recently, a third subsystem of neurons that have been named non-noradrenergic, non-cholinergic transmitters (because they use nitric oxide as a neurotransmitter) have been described and found to be integral in autonomic function, in particular in the gut and the lungs.[9]\\r\\nAlthough the ANS is also known as the visceral nervous system, the ANS is only connected with the motor side.[10] Most autonomous functions are involuntary but they can often work in conjunction with the somatic nervous system which provides voluntary control.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe autonomic nervous system is divided into the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic division emerges from the spinal cord in the thoracic and lumbar areas, terminating around L2-3. The parasympathetic division has craniosacral outflow, meaning that the neurons begin at the cranial nerves (specifically the oculomotor nerve, facial nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve) and sacral (S2-S4) spinal cord.\\r\\nThe autonomic nervous system is unique in that it requires a sequential two-neuron efferent pathway; the preganglionic neuron must first synapse onto a postganglionic neuron before innervating the target organ. The preganglionic, or first, neuron will begin at the outflow and will synapse at the postganglionic, or second, neurons cell body. The postganglionic neuron will then synapse at the target organ.\\r\\nThe sympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in the lateral grey column from T1 to L2/3. These cell bodies are \\"GVE\\" (general visceral efferent) neurons and are the preganglionic neurons. There are several locations upon which preganglionic neurons can synapse for their postganglionic neurons:\\r\\nThese ganglia provide the postganglionic neurons from which innervation of target organs follows. Examples of splanchnic (visceral) nerves are:\\r\\nThese all contain afferent (sensory) nerves as well, known as GVA (general visceral afferent) neurons.\\r\\nThe parasympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in one of two locations: the brainstem (Cranial Nerves III, VII, IX, X) or the sacral spinal cord (S2, S3, S4). These are the preganglionic neurons, which synapse with postganglionic neurons in these locations:\\r\\nThese ganglia provide the postganglionic neurons from which innervations of target organs follows. Examples are:\\r\\nThe sensory arm is composed of primary visceral sensory neurons found in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), in cranial sensory ganglia: the geniculate, petrosal and nodose ganglia, appended respectively to cranial nerves VII, IX and X. These sensory neurons monitor the levels of carbon dioxide, oxygen and sugar in the blood, arterial pressure and the chemical composition of the stomach and gut content. They also convey the sense of taste and smell, which, unlike most functions of the ANS, is a conscious perception. Blood oxygen and carbon dioxide are in fact directly sensed by the carotid body, a small collection of chemosensors at the bifurcation of the carotid artery, innervated by the petrosal (IXth) ganglion. Primary sensory neurons project (synapse) onto second order visceral sensory neurons located in the medulla oblongata, forming the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS), that integrates all visceral information. The nTS also receives input from a nearby chemosensory center, the area postrema, that detects toxins in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid and is essential for chemically induced vomiting or conditional taste aversion (the memory that ensures that an animal that has been poisoned by a food never touches it again). All this visceral sensory information constantly and unconsciously modulates the activity of the motor neurons of the ANS.\\r\\nAutonomic nerves travel to organs throughout the body. Most organs receive parasympathetic supply by the vagus nerve and sympathetic supply by splanchnic nerves. The sensory part of the latter reaches the spinal column at certain spinal segments. Pain in any internal organ is perceived as referred pain, more specifically as pain from the dermatome corresponding to the spinal segment.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nMotor neurons of the autonomic nervous system are found in autonomic ganglia. Those of the parasympathetic branch are located close to the target organ whilst the ganglia of the sympathetic branch are located close to the spinal cord.\\r\\nThe sympathetic ganglia here, are found in two chains: the pre-vertebral and pre-aortic chains. The activity of autonomic ganglionic neurons is modulated by preganglionic neurons located in the central nervous system. Preganglionic sympathetic neurons are located in the spinal cord, at the thorax and upper lumbar levels. Preganglionic parasympathetic neurons are found in the medulla oblongata where they form visceral motor nuclei; the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve; the nucleus ambiguus, the salivatory nuclei, and in the sacral region of the spinal cord.\\r\\nSympathetic and parasympathetic divisions typically function in opposition to each other. But this opposition is better termed complementary in nature rather than antagonistic. For an analogy, one may think of the sympathetic division as the accelerator and the parasympathetic division as the brake. The sympathetic division typically functions in actions requiring quick responses. The parasympathetic division functions with actions that do not require immediate reaction. The sympathetic system is often considered the \\"fight or flight\\" system, while the parasympathetic system is often considered the \\"rest and digest\\" or \\"feed and breed\\" system.\\r\\nHowever, many instances of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity cannot be ascribed to \\"fight\\" or \\"rest\\" situations. For example, standing up from a reclining or sitting position would entail an unsustainable drop in blood pressure if not for a compensatory increase in the arterial sympathetic tonus. Another example is the constant, second-to-second, modulation of heart rate by sympathetic and parasympathetic influences, as a function of the respiratory cycles. In general, these two systems should be seen as permanently modulating vital functions, in usually antagonistic fashion, to achieve homeostasis. Some typical actions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are listed below.\\r\\nPromotes a fight-or-flight response, corresponds with arousal and energy generation, and inhibits digestion\\r\\nThe parasympathetic nervous system has been said to promote a \\"rest and digest\\" response, promotes calming of the nerves return to regular function, and enhancing digestion. Functions of nerves within the parasympathetic nervous system include:[citation needed]\\r\\nThe enteric nervous system is the intrinsic nervous system of the gastrointestinal system. Its functions include:\\r\\nAt the effector organs, sympathetic ganglionic neurons release noradrenaline (norepinephrine), along with other cotransmitters such as ATP, to act on adrenergic receptors, with the exception of the sweat glands and the adrenal medulla:\\r\\nA full table is found at Table of neurotransmitter actions in the ANS.\\r\\nCaffeine is a bio-active ingredient found in commonly consumed beverages such as coffee, tea, and sodas. Short-term physiological effects of caffeine include increased blood pressure and sympathetic nerve outflow. Habitual consumption of caffeine may inhibit physiological short-term effects. Consumption of caffeinated espresso increases parasympathetic activity in habitual caffeine consumers; however, decaffeinated espresso inhibits parasympathetic activity in habitual caffeine consumers. It is possible other bio-active ingredients in decaffeinated espresso may also contribute to the inhibition of parasympathetic activity in habitual caffeine consumers.[14]\\r\\nCaffeine is capable of increasing work capacity while individuals perform strenuous tasks. In one study, caffeine provoked a greater maximum heart rate while a strenuous task was being performed compared to a placebo. This tendency is likely due to caffeine's ability to increase sympathetic nerve outflow. Furthermore, this study found that recovery after intense exercise was slower when caffeine was consumed prior to exercise. This finding is indicative of caffeine's tendency to inhibit parasympathetic activity in non-habitual consumers. The caffeine-stimulated increase in nerve activity is likely to evoke other physiological effects as the body attempts to maintain homeostasis.[15]\\r\\nThe effects of caffeine on parasympathetic activity may vary depending on the position of the individual when autonomic responses are measured. One study found that the seated position inhibited autonomic activity after caffeine consumption (75?mg); however, parasympathetic activity increased in the supine position. This finding may explain why some habitual caffeine consumers (75?mg or less) do not experience short-term effects of caffeine if their routine requires many hours in a seated position. It is important to note that the data supporting increased parasympathetic activity in the supine position was derived from an experiment involving participants between the ages of 25 and 30 who were considered healthy and sedentary. Caffeine may influence autonomic activity differently for individuals who are more active or elderly.[16]","input":"What part of brain controls autonomic nervous system?"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},P={class:"card-container"};function x(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",P,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const B=d(M,[["render",x]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/38.md","filePath":"qapage/38.md"}'),D={name:"qapage/38.md"},R=Object.assign(D,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(B)]))}});export{F as __pageData,R as default};
