Again on October 19 , 1960 ( almost two years after the Batista regime was deposed by the Cuban Revolution ) the U.S. placed an embargo on exports to Cuba except for food and medicine after Cuba nationalized American - owned Cuban oil refineries without compensation . On February 7 , 1962 the embargo was extended to include almost all imports . Currently , the Cuban embargo is enforced mainly through six statutes : the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 , the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 , the Cuban Assets Control Regulations of 1963 , the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 , the Helms -- Burton Act of 1996 , and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 . The stated purpose of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 is to maintain sanctions on Cuba so long as the Cuban government refuses to move toward \`\` democratization and greater respect for human rights '' . The Helms -- Burton Act further restricted United States citizens from doing business in or with Cuba , and mandated restrictions on giving public or private assistance to any successor government in Havana unless and until certain claims against the Cuban government were met . In 1999 , President Bill Clinton expanded the trade embargo by also disallowing foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies to trade with Cuba . In 2000 , Clinton authorized the sale of \`\` humanitarian '' U.S. products to Cuba ."},{"query":"who owns the great lakes canada or usa","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"places you can live with a uk passport","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"where was the location of the battle of hastings","short_answer":"approximately 7 miles ( 11 kilometres ) northwest of Hastings , close to the present - day town of Battle , East Sussex","abstract":"Coordinates : 50 ° 54 ′ 43 '' N 0 ° 29 ′ 15 '' E \uFEFF / \uFEFF 50.91194 ° N 0.48750 ° E \uFEFF / 50.91194 ; 0.48750"},{"query":"is a uk king the same as a us queen","short_answer":"","abstract":"Standard bed sizes are based on standard mattress sizes , which vary from country to country .

This effect arises from the gravitational gradient ( tidal force ) between the co-orbiting bodies , acting over a sufficiently long period of time . Once tidal locking is achieved for one of the bodies , there is no more net transfer of angular momentum between the two objects , although there can be some back and forth transfer over the course of an orbit . In the special case where the orbital eccentricity is nearly zero , tidal locking results in one hemisphere of the revolving object constantly facing its partner , an effect known as synchronous rotation . For example , the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth , although there is some libration because the Moon 's orbit is not perfectly circular . A tidally locked body in synchronous rotation takes just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around its partner ."},{"query":"who invented pen drive and in which year","short_answer":"","abstract":"Pua Khein - Seng ( Chinese : 潘健成 ; born 29 June 1974 , is arguably one of the inventors of USB flash drive .

Fatty acids are a family of molecules classified within the lipid macronutrient class . One role of fatty acids in animal metabolism is energy production , captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . When compared to other macronutrient classes ( carbohydrates and protein ) , fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis , when they are completely oxidized to CO and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle . Fatty acids ( mainly in the form of triglycerides ) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals , and to a lesser extent in plants . In addition , fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed ( the cell wall , and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells , such as the nucleus , the mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , and the Golgi apparatus ) . Fatty acids can also be cleaved , or partially cleaved , from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell , and local hormones in the immediate vicinity of the cell . The prostaglandins made from arachidonic acid stored in the cell membrane , are probably the most well known group of these local hormones ."},{"query":"when did the bmw 1 series change shape","short_answer":"2013","abstract":"The BMW 1 Series is a range of subcompact executive cars manufactured by BMW since 2004 .

Emperor Theodosius II called two synods in Ephesus , one in 431 and one in 449 , that addressed the teachings of Patriarch of Constantinople Nestorius and similar teachings . Nestorius had taught that Christ 's divine and human nature were distinct persons , and hence Mary was the mother of Christ but not the mother of God .
