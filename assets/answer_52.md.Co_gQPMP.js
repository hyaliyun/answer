Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement . The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy , while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state . The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system . Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily .

Thus , providing the basis for diagnosis and management . PTA is a subjective , behavioural measurement of hearing threshold , as it relies on patient response to pure tone stimuli . Therefore , PTA is used on adults and children old enough to cooperate with the test procedure . As with most clinical tests , calibration of the test environment , the equipment and the stimuli to ISO standards is needed before testing proceeds . PTA only measures audibility thresholds , rather than other aspects of hearing such as sound localization and speech recognition . However , there are benefits of using PTA over other forms of hearing test , such as click auditory brainstem response ( ABR ) . PTA provides ear specific thresholds , and uses frequency specific pure tones to give place specific responses , so that the configuration of a hearing loss can be identified . As PTA uses both air and bone conduction audiometry , the type of loss can also be identified via the air - bone gap . Although PTA has many clinical benefits , it is not perfect at identifying all losses , such as ' dead regions ' of the cochlea and neuropathies such as auditory processing disorder ( APD ) .

It is most often observed in plants , but can also occur in other organisms such as fungi . The cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a chemical called auxin that reacts when phototropism occurs . This causes the plant to have elongated cells on the farthest side from the light . Phototropism is one of the many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli . Growth towards a light source is called positive phototropism , while growth away from light is called negative phototropism ( skototropism ) . Most plant shoots exhibit positive phototropism , and rearrange their chloroplasts in the leaves to maximize photosynthetic energy and promote growth . Roots usually exhibit negative phototropism , although gravitropism may play a larger role in root behavior and growth . Some vine shoot tips exhibit negative phototropism , which allows them to grow towards dark , solid objects and climb them .

The higher the octane number , the more compression the fuel can withstand before detonating ( igniting ) . In broad terms , fuels with a higher octane rating are used in high performance gasoline engines that require higher compression ratios . In contrast , fuels with lower octane numbers ( but higher cetane numbers ) are ideal for diesel engines , because diesel engines ( also referred to as compression - ignition engines ) do not compress the fuel , but rather compress only air and then inject fuel into the air which was heated by compression . Gasoline engines rely on ignition of air and fuel compressed together as a mixture , which is ignited at the end of the compression stroke using spark plugs .

A thermoconforming organism , by contrast , simply adopts the surrounding temperature as its own body temperature , thus avoiding the need for internal thermoregulation . The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of homeostasis : a state of dynamic stability in an organism 's internal conditions , maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment ( the study of such processes in zoology has been called physiological ecology ) . If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal , a condition known as hyperthermia occurs . For humans , this occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately 55 ° C ( 131 ° F ) , and with prolonged exposure ( longer than a few hours ) at this temperature and up to around 75 ° C ( 167 ° F ) death is almost inevitable . Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is sustained above 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) for six hours . The opposite condition , when body temperature decreases below normal levels , is known as hypothermia . It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction , causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it . Normal body temperature is around 37 ° C ( 99 ° F ) , and hypothermia sets in when the core body temperature gets lower than 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) . Usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures , hypothermia is usually treated by methods that attempt to raise the body temperature back to a normal range ."},{"query":"where does the last name roman come from","short_answer":"","abstract":"Roman or Romans is the surname of :"},{"query":"is a pick up truck a commercial vehicle","short_answer":"","abstract":"A commercial vehicle is any type of motor vehicle used for transporting goods or paying passengers .

For example , beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron , or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron ( positron emission ) , thus changing the nuclide type . Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay , but are created in the decay process . By this process , unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons . The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy . The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or valley of stability . For either electron or positron emission to be energetically possible , the energy release ( see below ) or Q value must be positive ."},{"query":"what event marks the beginning of the great depression","short_answer":"the stock market crash of October 29 , 1929 ( known as Black Tuesday )","abstract":"The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression that took place mostly during the 1930s , originating in the United States .

Therefore , if the price of product B decreases , the demand curve for product A shifts to the right reflecting an increase in A 's demand , resulting in a negative value for the cross elasticity of demand .
