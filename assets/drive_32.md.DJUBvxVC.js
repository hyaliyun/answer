Non-probability sampling is a technique in which the probability of being selected for the sample is not known or equal for all members of the population, such as convenience sampling. Probability sampling is generally preferred because it leads to more representative and generalizable samples."},{"question":"Compare and contrast deductive and inductive coding in qualitative research.","answer":"Deductive coding is a process in which the researcher predefines and applies categories or themes to the data based on an existing theoretical framework. Inductive coding, on the other hand, is a process in which the researcher identifies and develops codes and themes from the raw data without a preconceived framework. Deductive coding is useful for testing hypotheses and confirming or disconfirming a priori theoretical perspectives, while inductive coding is useful for exploring unknown or unexpected phenomena."},{"question":"What is the difference between a t-test and an ANOVA?","answer":"A t-test is a statistical test used to compare the means of two groups on a single dependent variable, while an ANOVA is a statistical test used to compare the means of two or more groups on a single dependent variable.

In a double-blind study, both the participants and the researchers are unaware of the group assignments. Double-blind studies are used to reduce bias and the placebo effect."},{"question":"What is the difference between a main effect and an interaction effect?","answer":"A main effect is the overall effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable, averaged across all levels of other independent variables. An interaction effect occurs when the effect of one independent variable on a dependent variable changes depending on the level of another independent variable. An interaction effect indicates that the effect of one independent variable depends on the presence or absence of another independent variable."},{"question":"Where should the abstract be placed in an
