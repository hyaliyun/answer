The metal commonly used is steel, brass, or tungsten carbide.[2] It was conceived and developed as a cleaner and more reliable alternative to dip pens and fountain pens, and it is now the world's most-used writing instrument:[3] millions are manufactured and sold daily.[4] As a result, it has influenced art and graphic design and spawned an artwork genre.\\r\\nPen manufacturers produce designer ballpoint pens for the high-end and collectors' markets.\\r\\nThe Bic Cristal is a popular disposable type of ballpoint pen whose design is recognised by its place in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of using a ball point within a writing instrument as a method of applying ink to paper has existed since the late 19th century. In these inventions, the ink was placed in a thin tube whose end was blocked by a tiny ball, held so that it could not slip into the tube or fall out of the pen.\\r\\nThe first patent for a ballpoint pen[6][7] was issued on 30 October 1888, to John J. Loud,[8] who was attempting to make a writing instrument that would be able to write \\"on rough surfaces-such as wood, coarse wrapping-paper, and other articles\\"[9] which then-common fountain pens could not. Loud's pen had a small rotating steel ball, held in place by a socket. Although it could be used to mark rough surfaces such as leather, as Loud intended, it proved to be too coarse for letter-writing. With no commercial viability, its potential went unexploited[1] and the patent eventually lapsed.[10]\\r\\nThe manufacture of economical, reliable ballpoint pens as we know them arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision manufacturing capabilities of the early 20th century.[3] Patents filed worldwide during early development are testaments to failed attempts at making the pens commercially viable and widely available.[11] Early ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly; overflow and clogging were among the obstacles inventors faced toward developing reliable ballpoint pens.[4] If the ball socket was too tight, or the ink too thick, it would not reach the paper. If the socket was too loose, or the ink too thin, the pen would leak or the ink would smear.[4] Ink reservoirs pressurized by piston, spring, capillary action, and gravity would all serve as solutions to ink-delivery and flow problems.[12][13]\\r\\nLszl‹á Br‹á, a Hungarian newspaper editor frustrated by the amount of time that he wasted filling up fountain pens and cleaning up smudged pages, noticed that inks used in newspaper printing dried quickly, leaving the paper dry and smudge free. He decided to create a pen using the same type of ink.[4] Br‹á enlisted the help of his brother Gy?rgy, a chemist,[4] to develop viscous ink formulae for new ballpoint designs.[3]\\r\\nBr‹á's innovation successfully coupled ink-viscosity with a ball-socket mechanism which acted compatibly to prevent ink from drying inside the reservoir while allowing controlled flow.[4] Br‹á filed a British patent on 15 June 1938.[1][14]\\r\\nIn 1941, the Br‹á brothers and a friend, Juan Jorge Meyne, fled Germany and moved to Argentina, where they formed Br‹á Pens of Argentina and filed a new patent in 1943.[1] Their pen was sold in Argentina as the Birome (portmanteau of the names Br‹á and Meyne), which is how ballpoint pens are still known in that country.[1] This new design was licensed by the British, who produced ballpoint pens for RAF aircrew as the Biro. Ballpoint pens were found to be more versatile than fountain pens, especially at high altitudes, where fountain pens were prone to ink-leakage.[4]\\r\\nBr‹á's patent, and other early patents on ballpoint pens often used the term \\"ball-point fountain pen\\".[15][16][17][18][19][20]\\r\\nFollowing World War II, many companies vied to commercially produce their own ballpoint pen design. In post-war Argentina, success of the Birome ballpoint was limited, but in mid-1945, the Eversharp Co., a maker of mechanical pencils, teamed up with Eberhard Faber Co. to license the rights from Birome for sales in the United States.[1][10]\\r\\nDuring the same period, American entrepreneur Milton Reynolds came across a Birome ballpoint pen during a business trip to Buenos Aires, Argentina.[1][10] Recognizing commercial potential, he purchased several ballpoint samples, returned to the United States, and founded Reynolds International Pen Company. Reynolds bypassed the Birome patent with sufficient design alterations to obtain an American patent, beating Eversharp and other competitors to introduce the pen to the U.S. market.[1][10] Debuting at Gimbels department store in New York City on 29 October 1945,[10] for US$12.50 each (1945 US dollar value, about $166 in 2016 dollars),[10] Reynolds Rocket became the first commercially successful ballpoint pen.[1][4][21] Reynolds went to great extremes to market the pen, with great success; Gimbel's sold many thousands of pens within one week. In Britain, the Miles Martin pen company was producing the first commercially successful ballpoint pens there by the end of 1945.[1]\\r\\nNeither Reynolds' nor Eversharp's ballpoint lived up to consumer expectations in America. Ballpoint pen sales peaked in 1946, and consumer interest subsequently plunged due to market-saturation.[10] By the early 1950s the ballpoint boom had subsided and Reynolds' company folded.[1]\\r\\nPaper Mate pens, among the emerging ballpoint brands of the 1950s, bought the rights to distribute their own ballpoint pens in Canada.[22] Facing concerns about ink-reliability, Paper Mate pioneered new ink formulas and advertised them as \\"banker-approved\\".[10] In 1954, Parker Pens released The Jotterthe company's first ballpointboasting additional features and technological advances which also included the use of tungsten-carbide textured ball-bearings in their pens.[1] In less than a year, Parker sold several million pens at prices between three and nine dollars.[1] In the 1960s, the failing Eversharp Co. sold its pen division to Parker and ultimately folded.[1]\\r\\nMarcel Bich also introduced a ballpoint pen to the American marketplace in the 1950s, licensed from Br‹á and based on the Argentine designs.[3][23] Bich shortened his name to Bic in 1953, becoming the ballpoint brand now recognised globally.[4] Bic pens struggled until the company launched its \\"Writes The First Time, Every Time!\\" advertising campaign in the 1960s.[4] Competition during this era forced unit prices to drop considerably.[4]\\r\\nBallpoint pens are produced in both disposable and refillable models. Refills allow for the entire internal ink reservoir, including a ballpoint and socket, to be replaced. Such characteristics are usually associated with designer-type pens or those constructed of finer materials. The simplest types of ballpoint pens are disposable and have a cap to cover the tip when the pen is not in use, or a mechanism for retracting the tip,[3] which varies between manufacturers but is usually a spring- or screw-mechanism.\\r\\nRollerball pens employ the same ballpoint mechanics, but with the use of water-based inks instead of oil-based inks. Compared to oil-based ballpoints, rollerball pens are said to provide more fluid ink-flow, but the water-based inks will blot if held stationary against the writing surface. Water-based inks also remain wet longer when freshly applied and are thus prone to smearingposing problems to left-handed people (or right handed people writing right-to-left script)and running, should the writing surface become wet.\\r\\nBecause of a ballpoint pen's reliance on gravity to coat the ball with ink, most cannot be used to write upside-down. However, technology developed by Fisher pens in the United States resulted in the production of what came to be known as the \\"Fisher Space Pen\\". Space Pens combine a more viscous ink with a pressurised ink reservoir[4] that forces the ink toward the point. Unlike standard ballpoints, the rear end of a Space Pen's pressurized reservoir is sealed, eliminating evaporation and leakage,[4] thus allowing the pen to write upside-down, in zero-gravity environments, and reportedly underwater.[24] Astronauts have made use of these pens in outer space.[4]\\r\\nBallpoint pens with \\"erasable ink\\" were pioneered by the Paper Mate pen company.[25] The ink formulas of erasable ballpoints have properties similar to rubber cement, allowing the ink to be literally rubbed clean from the writing surface before drying and eventually becoming permanent.[25] Erasable ink is much thicker than standard ballpoint inks, requiring pressurised cartridges to facilitate inkflowmeaning they can also write upside-down. Though these pens are equipped with erasers, any eraser will suffice.[25]\\r\\nThe inexpensive, disposable Bic Cristal (also simply Bic pen or Biro) is reportedly the most widely sold pen in the world.[23][26] It was the Bic company's first product and is still synonymous with the company name.[27][28] The Bic Cristal is part of the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, acknowledged for its industrial design.[5][26] Its hexagonal barrel mimics that of a wooden pencil and is transparent, showing the ink level in the reservoir. Originally a sealed streamlined cap, the modern pen cap has a small hole at the top to meet safety standards, helping to prevent suffocation if children suck it into the throat.[29]\\r\\nMultipens are pens that feature multiple varying colored ballpoint refills. Sometimes ballpoint refills are combined with another non-ballpoint refill.\\r\\nBallpoint pens are sometimes provided free by businesses, such as hotels, as a form of advertisingprinted with a company's name; a ballpoint pen is a relatively low cost advertisement that is highly effective (customers will use, and therefore see, a pen daily). Businesses and charities include ballpoint pens in direct mail campaigns to increase a customer's interest in the mailing. Ballpoints have also been produced to commemorate events, such as a pen commemorating the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.[3]\\r\\nBallpoint pens have proven to be a versatile art medium for professional artists as well as amateur doodlers.[30] Low cost, availability, and portability are cited by practitioners as qualities which make this common writing tool a convenient, alternative art supply.[31] Some artists use them within mixed-media works, while others use them solely as their medium-of-choice.[32]\\r\\nEffects not generally associated with ballpoint pens can be achieved.[33] Traditional pen-and-ink techniques such as stippling and cross-hatching can be used to create half-tones[34] or the illusion of form and volume.[35] For artists whose interests necessitate precision line-work, ballpoints are an obvious attraction; ballpoint pens allow for sharp lines not as effectively executed using a brush.[36] Finely applied, the resulting imagery has been mistaken for airbrushed artwork[37] and photography,[38] causing reactions of disbelief which ballpoint artist Lennie Mace refers to as the Wow Factor.[36][37]\\r\\nFamous 20th-century artists such as Andy Warhol, among others, have utilised ballpoint pens to some extent during their careers.[39] Ballpoint pen artwork continues to attract interest in the 21st century, with contemporary artists gaining recognition for their specific use of ballpoint pens; for their technical proficiency, imagination, and innovation. Korean-American artist Il Lee has been creating large-scale, ballpoint-only abstract artwork since the late 1970s.[30] Since the 1980s, Lennie Mace creates imaginative, ballpoint-only artwork of varying content and complexity, applied to unconventional surfaces including wood and denim.[40] The artist coined terms such as PENtings and Media Graffiti to describe his varied output.[36] More recently, British artist James Mylne has been creating photo-realistic artwork using mostly black ballpoints, sometimes with minimal mixed-media color.[38] In the mid-2000s (decade), Juan Francisco Casas generated Internet attention for a series of large-scale, photo-realistic ballpoint duplications of his own snapshots of friends, utilising only blue pens.[41]\\r\\nUsing ballpoint pens to create artwork is not without limitations. Color availability and sensitivity of ink to light are among concerns of ballpoint pen artists.[42] Mistakes pose greater risks to ballpoint artists; once a line is drawn, it generally cannot be erased.[36] Additionally, \\"blobbing\\" of ink on the drawing surface and \\"skipping\\" of ink-flow require consideration when using ballpoint pens for artistic purposes.[32] Although the mechanics of ballpoint pens remain relatively unchanged, ink composition has evolved to solve certain problems over the years, resulting in unpredictable sensitivity to light and some extent of fading.[42]\\r\\nAlthough designs and construction vary between brands, basic components of all ballpoint pens are universal.[3] Standard components of a ballpoint tip include the freely rotating ball itself (distributing the ink on the writing surface), a socket holding the ball in place, small ink channels that provide ink to the ball through the socket, and a self-contained ink reservoir supplying ink to the ball.[4] In modern disposable pens, narrow plastic tubes contain the ink, which is compelled downward to the ball by gravity.[4] Brass, steel, or tungsten carbide are used to manufacture the ball bearing-like points,[4] then housed in a brass socket.[43]\\r\\nThe function of these components can be compared with the ball-applicator of roll-on antiperspirant; the same technology at a larger scale. The ball point tip delivers the ink to the writing surface while acting as a buffer between the ink in the reservoir and the air outside, preventing the quick-drying ink from drying inside the reservoir. Modern ballpoints are said to have a two-year shelf life, on average.[4]\\r\\nA ballpoint tip that can write comfortably for a long period of time is not easy to produce as it requires high-precision machinery and thin high grade steel alloy plates. China that currently (2017) produces about 80 percent of the world's ballpoint pens relied up to 2017 on imported ballpoint tips and metal alloys.[44]\\r\\nThe common ballpoint pen is a product of mass production, with components produced separately on assembly lines.[43] Basic steps in the manufacturing process include production of ink formulas, moulding of metal and plastic components, and assembly.[3] Marcel Bich was involved in developing the production of inexpensive ballpoint pens.[4]\\r\\nThe International Organization for Standardization has published standards for ball point and roller ball pens:\\r\\nThe world's largest functioning ballpoint pen was made by Acharya Makunuri Srinivasa in India. The pen measures 5.5 m (18 ft 0.53 in) long and weighs 37.23 kg (82.08 lb 1.24 oz).[50]","input":"Who patented the first commercially successful ballpoint pen?"},{"output":"Socialist","context":"France has the world's 6th largest economy[better?source?needed] by nominal figures and the 10th largest economy by PPP figures.

This programme of dirigisme, mostly implemented by governments between 1944 and 1983, involved the state control of certain industries such as transportation, energy and telecommunications as well as various incentives for private corporations to merge or engage in certain projects.\\r\\nThe 1981 election of president Fran?ois Mitterrand saw a short-lived increase in governmental control of the economy, nationalising many industries and private banks. This form of increased dirigisme, was criticised as early as 1982. By 1983, the government decided to renounce dirigisme and start an era of rigueur (\\"rigour\\") or corporatization. As a result, the government largely retreated from economic intervention; dirigisme has now essentially receded, though some of its traits remain. The French economy grew and changed under government direction and planning much more than in other European countries.\\r\\nDespite being a widely liberalized economy, the government continues to play a significant role in the economy: government spending, at 56% of GDP in 2014, is the second highest in the European Union. Labour conditions and wages are highly regulated. The government continues to own shares in corporations in a range of sectors, including banking, energy production and distribution, automobiles, transportation, and telecommunications. These differ from countries such as the US or UK where most of these companies have been privatized.\\r\\nIn April and May 2012, France held a presidential election in which the winner Fran?ois Hollande had opposed austerity measures, promising to eliminate France's budget deficit by 2017. The new government stated that it aimed to cancel recently enacted tax cuts and exemptions for the wealthy, raising the top tax bracket rate to 75% on incomes over a million euros, restoring the retirement age to 60 with a full pension for those who have worked 42 years, restoring 60,000 jobs recently cut from public education, regulating rent increases; and building additional public housing for the poor.\\r\\nIn June 2012, Hollande's Socialist Party won an overall majority in the legislative elections, giving it the capability to amend the French Constitution and allowing immediate enactment of the promised reforms. French government bond interest rates fell 30% to record lows,[24] less than 50 basis points above German government bond rates.[25]\\r\\nThe French government has run a budget deficit each year since the early 1970s. In mid-2012, French government debt levels reached ?1,833?billion.[26] This debt level was the equivalent of 91% of French GDP.[26]\\r\\nUnder European Union rules, member states are supposed to limit their debt to 60% of output or be reducing the ratio structurally towards this ceiling, and run public deficits of no more than 3.0% of GDP.[26]\\r\\nIn late 2012, credit-rating agencies warned that growing French government debt levels risked France's AAA credit rating, raising the possibility of a future credit downgrade and subsequent higher borrowing costs for the French government.[27]\\r\\nIn 2012 France was downgraded by ratings agencies Moody's, Standard&Poor's, and Fitch to the AA+ credit rating.[28][29]\\r\\nIn December 2014 France's credit rating was further downgraded by Fitch (and S&P) to the AA credit rating.[30]\\r\\n2006 electricity production of France\\r\\nThe leading industrial sectors in France are telecommunications (including communication satellites), aerospace and defense, ship building (naval and specialist ships), pharmaceuticals, construction and civil engineering, chemicals, textiles, and automobile production.\\r\\nResearch and development spending is also high in France at 2.26% of GDP, the fourth-highest in the OECD.[31]\\r\\nFrance is the world-leading country in nuclear energy, home of global energy giants Areva, EDF and GDF Suez: nuclear power now accounts for about 78% of the country's electricity production, up from only 8% in 1973, 24% in 1980, and 75% in 1990. Nuclear waste is stored on site at reprocessing facilities. Due to its heavy investment in nuclear power, France is the smallest emitter of carbon dioxide among the seven most industrialized countries in the world.[32]\\r\\nIn 2006 electricity generated in France amounted to 548.8 TWh, of which:[33]\\r\\nIn November 2004, EDF (which stands for Electricit de France), the world's largest utility company and France's largest electricity provider, was floated with huge success on the French stock market. Notwistanding, the French state still keeps 70% of the capital.\\r\\nOther electricity providers include Compagnie nationale du Rh?ne (CNR) and Endesa (through SNET).\\r\\nFrance is the world's sixth largest agricultural producer and EU's leading agricultural power, accounting for about one-third of all agricultural land within the EU.\\r\\nNorthern France is characterized by large wheat farms. Dairy products, pork, poultry, and apple production are concentrated in the western region. Beef production is located in central France, while the production of fruits, vegetables, and wine ranges from central to southern France. France is a large producer of many agricultural products and is currently expanding its forestry and fishery industries. The implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) have resulted in reforms in the agricultural sector of the economy.\\r\\nAs the world's second-largest agricultural exporter, France ranks just after the United States.[34] The destination of 49% of its exports is other EU members states. France also provide agricultural exports to many poor African countries (including its former colonies) which face serious food shortages. Wheat, beef, pork, poultry, and dairy products are the principal exports.\\r\\nExports from the United States face stiff competition from domestic production, other EU member states, and third-world countries in France. US agricultural exports to France, totaling some $600?million annually, consist primarily of soybeans and soybean products, feeds and fodders, seafood, and consumer products, especially snack foods and nuts. French exports to the United States are much more high-value products such as its cheese, processed products and its wine.\\r\\nThe French agricultural sector receives almost ?11?billion in EU subsidies. France's competitive advantage is mostly linked to the high quality and global renown of its produce, such as cheese and wine.\\r\\nFrance is the most popular tourist destination with more than 83.7?million foreign tourists in 2014,[7] ahead of Spain (58.5?million in 2006) and the United States (51.1?million in 2006). This figure excludes people staying less than 24 hours in France, such as northern Europeans crossing France on their way to Spain or Italy during the summer.\\r\\nFrance is home to cities of much cultural interest (Paris being the foremost), beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, and rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity. France also attracts many religious pilgrims to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes-Pyrnes dpartement, which hosts several million visitors a year.\\r\\nAccording to figures from 2003, some popular tourist sites include (in visitors per year):[35] Eiffel Tower (6.2?million), Louvre Museum (5.7?million), Palace of Versailles (2.8?million), Muse d'Orsay (2.1?million), Arc de Triomphe (1.2?million), Centre Pompidou (1.2?million), Mont-Saint-Michel (1?million), Chateau de Chambord (711,000), Sainte-Chapelle (683,000), Chateau du Haut-K?nigsbourg (549,000), Puy de D?me (500,000), Muse Picasso (441,000), Carcassonne (362,000).\\r\\nThe French arms industry's main customer, for whom they mainly build warships, guns, nuclear weapons and equipment, is the French government.\\r\\nRecord high defence expenditure (currently at ?35?billion), which was considerably increased under the government of Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, goes largely to the French arms industries.\\r\\nDuring the 2000√ø2015 period, France was the fourth largest weapons exporter in the world[36][37]\\r\\nFrench manufacturers export great quantities of weaponry to the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Greece, India, Pakistan, Taiwan, Singapore and many others.\\r\\nIt was reported that in 2015, French arms sales internationally amounted to 17.4?billion U.S. dollars,[38] more than double the figure of 2014.[39] Vice News explained that \\"While the United Kingdom has lapsed somewhat in this regard, France has maintained a high-level of production of military equipment for land, air, and sea defense √ø an expensive approach that relies on the export of arms and technology.\\"[40]\\r\\nTransportation in France relies on one of the densest networks in the world with 146?km of road and 6.2?km of rail lines per 100?km2. It is built as a web with Paris at its center.[41] The highly subsidised rail transport network makes up a relatively small portion of travel, most of which is done by car. However the high-speed TGV trains make up a large proportion of long-distance travel, partially because intercity buses were prevented from operating until 2015.\\r\\nFrance also boasts a number of seaports and harbours, including Bayonne, Bordeaux, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Brest, Calais, Cherbourg-Octeville, Dunkerque, Fos-sur-Mer, La Pallice, Le Havre, Lorient, Marseille, Nantes, Nice, Paris, Port-la-Nouvelle, Port-Vendres, Roscoff, Rouen, Saint-Nazaire, Saint-Malo, Ste, Strasbourg and Toulon. There are approximately 478 airports in France (1999 est.) and by a 2005 estimate, there are three heliports. 288 of the airports have paved runways, with the remaining 199 being unpaved. The national carrier of France is Air France, a full service global airline which flies to 20 domestic destinations and 150 international destinations in 83 countries (including Overseas departments and territories of France) across all 6 major continents.\\r\\nAccording to a 2011 report by the American Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), France's GDP per capita at purchasing power parity is similar to that of the UK, with just over US$35,000 per head.[42] To explain why French per capita GDP is lower than that of the United States, the economist Paul Krugman stated that \\"French workers are roughly as productive as US workers\\", but that the French have allegedly a lower workforce participation rate and \\"when they work, they work fewer hours\\". According to Krugman, the difference is due to the French making \\"different choices about retirement and leisure\\".[43]\\r\\nKeynesian economists sought out different solutions to the unemployment issue in France, and their theories led to the introduction of the 35-hour workweek law in 1999. Between 2004 and 2008, the government attempted to combat unemployment with supply-side reforms, but was met with fierce resistance;[44] the contrat nouvelle embauche and the contrat premire embauche (which allowed more flexible contracts) were of particular concern, and both were eventually repealed.[45] The Sarkozy government used the revenu de solidarit active (in-work benefits) to redress the allegedly negative effect of the revenu minimum d'insertion (unemployment benefits which do not depend on previous contributions, unlike normal unemployment benefits in France) on the incentive to accept even jobs which are insufficient to earn a living.[46]\\r\\nFrench employment rates for 15√ø64 years is one of the lowest of the OECD countries: in 2012, only 71% of the French population aged 15√ø64 years were in employment, compared to 74% in Japan, 77% in the UK, 73% in the US and 77% in Germany.[47] This gap is due to the low employment rate for 15√ø24 years old: 38% in 2012, compared to 47% in the OECD. Neoliberal economists attribute the low employment rate, particularly evident among young people, to allegedly high minimum wages that would prevent low productivity workers from easily entering the labour market.[48]\\r\\nA December 2012 New York Times article reported on an allegedly \\"floating generation\\" in France that formed part of the 14 million unemployed young Europeans documented by the Eurofound research agency.[49] In the same article, Anne Sonnet, a senior economist studying unemployment at the OECD claimed that nearly two million young people in France had given up looking for employment at that time, while French labour minister Michel Sapin said that 82 percent of people hired were only on temporary contracts. Sapin further explained that, in his opinion, the challenge at that time was to create a more flexible system, in which greater trust existed between unions and companies, and \\"partial unemployment\\" was accommodated during difficult periods. The so-called floating generation was attributed to an allegedly dysfunctional system: \\"an elitist educational tradition that does not integrate graduates into the work force, a rigid labour market that is hard to enter for newcomers, and a tax system that makes it expensive for companies to hire full-time employees and both difficult and expensive to lay them off\\".[50] In July 2013, the unemployment rate for France was 11%.[51]\\r\\nIn early April 2014, employers' federations and unions negotiated an agreement with technology and consultancy employers, as employees had been experiencing an extension of their work time through smartphone communication outside of official working hours. Under a new, legally binding labour agreement, around 250,000 employees will avoid handling work-related matters during their leisure time and their employers will, in turn, refrain from engaging with staff during this time.[52]\\r\\nEveryday, about 80,000 French citizens are commuting to work in neighbouring Luxembourg, making it the biggest cross-border workforce group in the whole of the European Union.[53] They are attracted by much higher wages for the different job groups than in their own country and the lack of skilled labour in the booming Luxembourgish economy.\\r\\nFrance is the second-largest trading nation in Europe (after Germany).[54] Its foreign trade balance for goods had been in surplus from 1992 until 2001, reaching $25.4 billion (25.4 G$) in 1998; however, the French balance of trade was hit by the economic downturn, and went into the red in 2000, reaching a US$15bn deficit in 2003. Total trade for 1998 amounted to $730?billion, or 50% of GDPimports plus exports of goods and services. Trade with European Union countries accounts for 60% of French trade.\\r\\nIn 1998, US√øFrance trade stood at about $47?billion √ø goods only.

Although once considered to be three separate species, it is now considered to be one, with nine recognised subspecies. A member of the Artamidae, the Australian magpie is placed in its own genus Gymnorhina and is most closely related to the black butcherbird (Melloria quoyi). It is not, however, closely related to the European magpie, which is a corvid.\\r\\nThe adult Australian magpie is a fairly robust bird ranging from 37 to 43?cm (14.5 to 17?in) in length, with distinctive black and white plumage, gold brown eyes and a solid wedge-shaped bluish-white and black bill. The male and female are similar in appearance, and can be distinguished by differences in back markings. The male has pure white feathers on the back of the head and the female has white blending to grey feathers on the back of the head. With its long legs, the Australian magpie walks rather than waddles or hops and spends much time on the ground.\\r\\nDescribed as one of Australia's most accomplished songbirds, the Australian magpie has an array of complex vocalisations. It is omnivorous, with the bulk of its varied diet made up of invertebrates. It is generally sedentary and territorial throughout its range. Common and widespread, it has adapted well to human habitation and is a familiar bird of parks, gardens and farmland in Australia and New Guinea. This species is commonly fed by households around the country, but in spring a small minority of breeding magpies (almost always males) become aggressive and swoop and attack those who approach their nests.\\r\\nOver 1000 Australian magpies were introduced into New Zealand from 1864 to 1874[2] but have subsequently been accused of displacing native birds and are now treated as a pest species.[3] Introductions also occurred in the Solomon Islands and Fiji, where the birds are not considered an invasive species. The Australian magpie is the mascot of several Australian sporting teams, most notably the Collingwood Magpies, the Western Suburbs Magpies and Port Adelaide Magpies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian magpie was first described by English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 as Coracias tibicen, the type collected in the Port Jackson region.[4][a] Its specific epithet derived from the Latin tibicen \\"flute-player\\" or \\"piper\\" in reference to the bird's melodious call.[6][7] An early recorded vernacular name is piping poller, written on a painting by Thomas Watling, one of a group known collectively as the Port Jackson Painter,[8] sometime between 1788 and 1792.[9] Tarra-won-nang,[8] or djarrawunang, wibung, and marriyang were names used by the local Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney Basin.[10] Booroogong and garoogong were Wiradjuri words, and carrak was a Jardwadjali term from Victoria.[11] Among the Kamilaroi, it is burrugaabu,[12] galalu, or guluu.[13] It was known as Warndurla among the Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara.[14] Other names used include piping crow-shrike, piper, maggie, flute-bird and organ-bird.[7] The term bell-magpie was proposed to help distinguish it from the European magpie but failed to gain wide acceptance.[15]\\r\\nThe bird was named for its similarity in colouration to the European magpie; it was a common practice for early settlers to name plants and animals after European counterparts.[9] However, the European magpie is a member of the Corvidae, while its Australian counterpart is placed in the family Artamidae (although both are members of a broad corvid lineage). The Australian magpie's affinities with butcherbirds and currawongs were recognised early on and the three genera were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by John Albert Leach after he had studied their musculature.[16] American ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between woodswallows and the butcherbirds in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini clade,[17] in the Artamidae.[18] The Australian magpie is placed in its own monotypic genus Gymnorhina which was introduced by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1840.[19][20] The name of the genus is from the Ancient Greek gumnos for \\"naked\\" or \\"bare\\" and rhis, rhinos \\"nostrils\\".[21] Some authorities such as Glen Storr in 1952 and Leslie Christidis and Walter Boles in their 2008 checklist, have placed the Australian magpie in the butcherbird genus Cracticus, arguing that its adaptation to ground-living is not enough to consider it a separate genus.[18][22] A molecular genetic study published in a 2013 showed that the Australian magpie is a sister taxon to the black butcherbird (Melloria quoyi) and that the two species are in turn sister to a clade that includes the other butcherbirds in the genus Cracticus. The ancestor to the two species is thought to have split from the other butcherbirds between 8.3 and 4.2 million years ago, during the late Miocene to early Pliocene, while the two species themselves diverged sometime during the Pliocene (5.8√ø3.0 million years ago).[23]\\r\\nThe Australian magpie was subdivided into three species in the literature for much of the twentieth centurythe black-backed magpie (G. tibicen), the white-backed magpie (G. hypoleuca), and the western magpie (G. dorsalis).[24] They were later noted to hybridise readily where their territories crossed, with hybrid grey or striped-backed magpies being quite common. This resulted in them being reclassified as one species by Julian Ford in 1969,[25] with most recent authors following suit.[18]\\r\\nThere are currently thought to be nine subspecies of the Australian magpie, although there are large zones of overlap with intermediate forms between the taxa. There is a tendency for birds to become larger with increasing latitude, the southern subspecies being larger than those further north, except the Tasmanian form which is small.[26] The original form, known as the black-backed magpie and classified as Gymnorhina tibicen, has been split into four black-backed races:\\r\\nThe white-backed magpie, originally described as Gymnorhina hypoleuca by John Gould in 1837, has also been split into races:\\r\\nThe adult magpie is a fairly solid, sturdy bird ranging from 37 to 43?cm (14.5 to 17?in) in length with a 65√ø85?cm (25.5√ø33.5?in) wingspan, and weighing 220√ø350?g (7.8√ø12.3?oz).[29] Its robust wedge-shaped bill is bluish-white bordered with black, with a small hook at the tip. The black legs are long and strong.[36] The plumage is pure glossy black and white; both sexes of all subspecies have black heads, wings and underparts with white shoulders. The tail has a black terminal band. The nape is white in the male and light greyish-white in the female. Mature magpies have dull red eyes, in contrast to the yellow eyes of currawongs and white eyes of Australian ravens and crows.[37] The main difference between the subspecies lies in the \\"saddle\\" markings on the back below the nape. Black-backed subspecies have a black saddle and white nape.[29] White-backed subspecies have a wholly white nape and saddle. The male Western Australian subspecies dorsalis is also white-backed, but the equivalent area in the female is scalloped black.[37]\\r\\nJuveniles have lighter greys and browns amidst the starker blacks and whites of their plumage;[38] two- or three-year-old birds of both sexes closely resemble and are difficult to distinguish from adult females.[36] Immature birds have dark brownish eyes until around two years of age.[36] Australian magpies generally live to around 25 years of age,[39] though ages of up to 30 years have been recorded.[40] The reported age of first breeding has varied according to area, but the average is between the ages of three and five years.[41]\\r\\nWell-known and easily recognisable, the Australian magpie is unlikely to be confused with any other species. The pied butcherbird has a similar build and plumage, but has white underparts unlike the former species' black underparts. The magpie-lark is a much smaller and more delicate bird with complex and very different banded black and white plumage. Currawong species have predominantly dark plumage and heavier bills.[37]\\r\\nOne of Australia's most highly regarded songbirds, the Australian magpie has a wide variety of calls, many of which are complex. Pitch may vary over up to four octaves,[42] and the bird can mimic over 35 species of native and introduced bird species, as well as dogs and horses.[43] Magpies have even been noted to mimic human speech when living in close proximity to humans.[44] Its complex, musical, warbling call is one of the most familiar Australian bird sounds. In Denis Glover's poem \\"The Magpies\\", the mature magpie's call is described as quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle,[45] one of the most famous lines in New Zealand poetry, and as waddle giggle gargle paddle poodle, in the children's book Waddle Giggle Gargle by Pamela Allen.[46]\\r\\nWhen alone, a magpie may make a quiet musical warbling; these complex melodious warbles or subsongs are pitched at 2√ø4 KHz and do not carry for long distances. These songs have been recorded up to 70 minutes in duration and are more frequent after the end of the breeding season.[47] Pairs of magpies often take up a loud musical calling known as carolling to advertise or defend their territory; one bird initiates the call with the second (and sometimes more) joining in.[48] Often preceded by warbling,[43] carolling is pitched between 6 and 8?kHz and has 4√ø5 elements with slurring indistinct noise in between.[49] Birds will adopt a specific posture by tilting their heads back, expanding their chests, and moving their wings backwards.[50] A group of magpies will sing a short repetitive version of carolling just before dawn (dawn song), and at twilight after sundown (dusk song), in winter and spring.[43]\\r\\nFledgling and juvenile magpies emit a repeated short and loud (80 dB), high-pitched (8?kHz) begging call.[51] Magpies may indulge in beak-clapping to warn other species of birds.[52] They employ several high pitched (8√ø10?kHz) alarm or rallying calls when intruders or threats are spotted. Distinct calls have been recorded for the approach of eagles and monitor lizards.[53]\\r\\nThe Australian magpie is found in the Trans-Fly region of southern New Guinea, between the Oriomo River and Muli Strait, and across most of Australia, bar the tip of Cape York,[54] the Gibson and Great Sandy Deserts, and southwest of Tasmania.[55] Birds taken mainly from Tasmania and Victoria were introduced into New Zealand by local Acclimatisation Societies of Otago and Canterbury in the 1860s, with the Wellington Acclimatisation Society releasing 260 birds in 1874. White-backed forms are spread on both the North and eastern South Island, while black-backed forms are found in the Hawke's Bay region.[56] Magpies were introduced into New Zealand to control agricultural pests, and were therefore a protected species until 1951.[57] They are thought to affect native New Zealand bird populations such as the tui and kerer, sometimes raiding nests for eggs and nestlings,[57] although studies by Waikato University have cast doubt on this,[58] and much blame on the magpie as a predator in the past has been anecdotal only.[59] Introductions also occurred in the Solomon Islands and Sri Lanka, although the species has failed to become established. It has become established in western Taveuni in Fiji, however.[56]\\r\\nThe Australian magpie prefers open areas such as grassland, fields and residential areas such as parks, gardens, golf courses, and streets, with scattered trees or forest nearby. Birds nest and shelter in trees but forage mainly on the ground in these open areas.[60] It has also been recorded in mature pine plantations; birds only occupy rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest in the vicinity of cleared areas.[54] In general, evidence suggests the range and population of the Australian magpie has increased with land-clearing, although local declines in Queensland due to a 1902 drought, and in Tasmania in the 1930s have been noted; the cause for the latter is unclear but rabbit baiting, pine tree removal, and spread of the masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) have been implicated.[61]\\r\\nThe Australian magpie is almost exclusively diurnal, although it may call into the night, like some other members of the Artamidae.[62] Natural predators of magpies include various species of monitor lizard and the barking owl.[63] Birds are often killed on roads or electrocuted by powerlines, or poisoned after killing and eating house sparrows or mice, rats or rabbits targeted with baiting.[64] The Australian raven may take nestlings left unattended.[65]\\r\\nOn the ground, the Australian magpie moves around by walking, and is the only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend to hop with legs parallel. The magpie has a short femur (thigh bone), and long lower leg below the knee, suited to walking rather than running, although birds can run in short bursts when hunting prey.[66]\\r\\nThe magpie is generally sedentary and territorial throughout its range, living in groups occupying a territory, or in flocks or fringe groups. A group may occupy and defend the same territory for many years.[64] Much energy is spent defending a territory from intruders, particularly other magpies, and different behaviours are seen with different opponents. The sight of a raptor results in a rallying call by sentinel birds and subsequent coordinated mobbing of the intruder. Magpies place themselves either side of the bird of prey so that it will be attacked from behind should it strike a defender, and harass and drive the raptor to some distance beyond the territory.[67] A group will use carolling as a signal to advertise ownership and warn off other magpies. In the negotiating display, the one or two dominant magpies parade along the border of the defended territory while the rest of the group stand back a little and look on. The leaders may fluff their feathers or caroll repeatedly. In a group strength display, employed if both the opposing and defending groups are of roughly equal numbers, all magpies will fly and form a row at the border of the territory.[68] The defending group may also resort to an aerial display where the dominant magpies, or sometimes the whole group, swoop and dive while calling to warn an intruding magpie's group.[69]\\r\\nA wide variety of displays are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones.[70] Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of submission.[71] The manus flutter is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter its primary feathers in its wings.[72] A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back and expose its underparts.[72] Birds may fluff up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack.[73] Young birds display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older birds often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or tugging at various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits of wire, and handing them to other birds. A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and flying off with it, with other birds pursuing and attempting to bring down the leader by latching onto its tail feathers. Birds may jump on each other and even engage in mock fighting. Play may even take place with other species such as blue-faced honeyeaters and Australasian pipits.[74]\\r\\nMagpies have a long breeding season which varies in different parts of the country; in northern parts of Australia they will breed between June and September, but not commence until August or September in cooler regions, and may continue until January in some alpine areas.[75] The nest is a bowl-shaped structure made of sticks and lined with softer material such as grass and bark. Near human habitation, synthetic material may be incorporated.[76] Nests are built exclusively by females and generally placed high up in a tree fork, often in an exposed position.[77] The trees used are most commonly eucalypts, although a variety of other native trees as well as introduced pine, Crataegus, and elm have been recorded.[78] Other bird species, such as the yellow-rumped thornbill (Acanthiza chrysorrhoa), willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys), southern whiteface (Aphelocephala leucopsis), and (less commonly) noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala), often nest in the same tree as the magpie. The first two species may even locate their nest directly beneath a magpie nest, while the diminutive striated pardalote (Pardalotus striatus) has been known to make a burrow for breeding into the base of the magpie nest itself. These incursions are all tolerated by the magpies.[79] The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) is a notable brood parasite in eastern Australia; magpies will raise cuckoo young, which eventually outcompete the magpie nestlings.[80]\\r\\nThe Australian magpie produces a clutch of two to five light blue or greenish eggs, which are oval in shape and about 30 by 40?mm (1.2 by 1.6?in).[81] The chicks hatch synchronously around 20 days after incubation begins; like all passerines, the chicks are altricialthey are born pink, naked, and blind with large feet, a short broad beak and a bright red throat. Their eyes are fully open at around 10 days. Chicks develop fine downy feathers on their head, back and wings in the first week, and pinfeathers in the second week. The black and white colouration is noticeable from an early stage.[82] Nestlings are fed exclusively by the female, though the male magpie will feed his partner.[83] The Australian magpie is known to engage in cooperative breeding, and helper birds will assist in feeding and raising young.[41] This does vary from region to region, and with the size of the groupthe behaviour is rare or nonexistent in pairs or small groups.[41]\\r\\nJuvenile magpies begin foraging on their own three weeks after leaving the nest, and mostly feeding themselves by six months old. Some birds continue begging for food until eight or nine months of age, but are usually ignored. Birds reach adult size by their first year.[84] The age at which young birds disperse varies across the country, and depends on the aggressiveness of the dominant adult of the corresponding sex; males are usually evicted at a younger age. Many leave at around a year old, but the age of departure may range from eight months to four years.[85]\\r\\nThe Australian magpie is omnivorous, eating various items located at or near ground level including invertebrates such as earthworms, millipedes, snails, spiders and scorpions as well as a wide variety of insectscockroaches, ants, beetles, cicadas, moths and caterpillars and other larvae. Insects, including large adult grasshoppers, may be seized mid-flight. Skinks, frogs, mice and other small animals as well as grain, tubers, figs and walnuts have also been noted as components of their diet.[86] It has even learnt to safely eat the poisonous cane toad by flipping it over and consuming the underparts.[87] Predominantly a ground feeder, the Australian magpie paces open areas methodically searching for insects and their larvae.[88] One study showed birds were able to find scarab beetle larvae by sound or vibration.[89] Birds use their bills to probe into the earth or otherwise overturn debris in search of food.[90] Smaller prey are swallowed whole, although magpies rub off the stingers of bees and wasps before swallowing.[91]\\r\\nMagpies are ubiquitous in urban areas all over Australia, and have become accustomed to people. A small percentage of birds become highly aggressive during breeding season from late August to early - mid October, and will swoop and sometimes attack passersby. The percentage has been difficult to estimate but is significantly less than 9%.[92] Almost all attacking birds (around 99%) are male,[93] and they are generally known to attack pedestrians at around 50?m (160?ft) from their nest, and cyclists at around 100?m (330?ft).[94] There appears to be some specificity in choice of attack targets, with the majority of individuals specializing on either pedestrians or cyclists.[95] Attacks begin as the eggs hatch, increase in frequency and severity as the chicks grow, and tail off as the chicks leave the nest.[96]\\r\\nThese magpies may engage in an escalating series of behaviours to drive off intruders. Least threatening are alarm calls and distant swoops, where birds fly within several metres from behind and perch nearby. Next in intensity are close swoops, where a magpie will swoop in from behind or the side and audibly \\"snap\\" their beaks or even peck or bite at the face, neck, ears or eyes. More rarely, a bird may dive-bomb and strike the intruder's (usually a cyclist's) head with its chest. A magpie may rarely attack by landing on the ground in front of a person and lurching up and landing on the victim's chest and pecking at the face and eyes.[97]\\r\\nMagpie attacks can cause injuries, typically wounds to the head,[98] and being unexpectedly swooped while cycling can result in loss of control of the bicycle, which may cause injury.[99][100][101]\\r\\nIf it is necessary to walk near the nest, wearing a broad-brimmed or legionnaire's hat or using an umbrella will deter attacking birds, but beanies and bicycle helmets are of little value as birds attack the sides of the head and neck.[102]\\r\\nMagpies prefer to swoop at the back of the head; therefore, keeping the magpie in sight at all times can discourage the bird. A basic disguise such as sunglasses worn on the back of the head may fool the magpie as to where a person is looking. Eyes painted on hats or helmets will deter attacks on pedestrians but not cyclists.[103]\\r\\nCyclists can deter attack by attaching a long pole with a flag to a bike,[104] and the use of cable ties on helmets has become common and appears to be effective.[105]\\r\\nMagpies are a protected native species in Australia, so it is illegal to kill or harm them. However, this protection is removed in some Australian states if a magpie attacks a human, allowing for the bird to be destroyed if it is considered particularly aggressive (such a provision is made, for example, in section 54 of the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act).[106] More commonly, an aggressive bird will be caught and relocated to an unpopulated area.[107] Magpies have to be moved some distance as almost all are able to find their way home from distances of less than 25?km (16?mi).[108] Removing the nest is of no use as birds will breed again and possibly be more aggressive the second time around.[109]\\r\\nSome claim that swooping can be prevented by hand-feeding magpies. Magpies will become accustomed to being fed by humans, and although they are wild, will return to the same place looking for handouts. The idea is that humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, there are reports of its success.[110]\\r\\nThe Australian magpie featured in aboriginal folklore around Australia. The Yindjibarndi people of the Pilbara in the northwest of the country used the bird as a signal for sunrise, frightening them awake with its call. They were also familiar with its highly territorial nature, and it features in a song in their Burndud, or songs of customs.[14] It was a totem bird of the people of the Illawarra region south of Sydney.[111]\\r\\nUnder the name piping shrike, the white-backed magpie was declared the official emblem of the Government of South Australia in 1901 by Governor Tennyson,[112] and has featured on the South Australian flag since 1904.[113] The magpie is a commonly used emblem of sporting teams in Australia, and its brash, cocky attitude has been likened to the Australian psyche.[114] Such teams tend to wear uniforms with black and white stripes. The Collingwood Football Club adopted the magpie from a visiting South Australian representative team in 1892.[115] The Port Adelaide Magpies would similarly adopt the black and white colours and Magpie name in 1902.[116] Other examples include Brisbane's Souths Logan Magpies,[114] and Sydney's Western Suburbs Magpies. Disputes over who has been the first club to adopt the magpie emblem have been heated at times.[117] Another club, Glenorchy Football Club of Tasmania, was forced to change uniform design when placed in the same league as another club (Claremont Magpies) with the same emblem.[118]\\r\\nIn New Zealand, the Hawke's Bay Rugby Union team, from Napier, New Zealand, is also known as the magpies.[119] One of the best-known New Zealand poems is \\"The Magpies\\" by Denis Glover, with its refrain \\"Quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle\\", imitating the sound of the bird √ø and the popular New Zealand comic Footrot Flats features a magpie character by the name of Pew.[120]\\r\\nAn online poll conducted by Guardian Australia and BirdLife Australia was held in late 2017 to choose the \\"Australian Bird of the Year\\". The Australian magpie won the contest with 19,926 votes (13.3%), narrowly ahead of the Australian white ibis.[121]","input":"What is a group of australian magpies called?"},{"output":"the Palais Garnier opera house","context":"The Phantom of the Opera (French: Le Fant?me de l'Opra) is a novel by French writer Gaston Leroux. It was first published as a serialization in Le Gaulois from 23 September 1909, to 8 January 1910. It was published in volume form in late March 1910 by Pierre Lafitte.[1]  The novel is partly inspired by historical events at the Paris Opera during the nineteenth century and an apocryphal tale concerning the use of a former ballet pupil's skeleton in Carl Maria von Weber's 1841 production of Der Freischtz.[2]  It has been successfully adapted into various stage and film adaptations, most notable of which are the 1925 film depiction featuring Lon Chaney, and Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1986 musical.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeroux first decided he would become a lawyer, but after he spent his inheritance gambling he became a reporter for LEcho de Paris. At the paper he was asked to write about and critique dramas, as well as being a courtroom reporter. With his job, he was able to travel frequently, but then he came back to Paris where he became a writer. Because of his fascination with both Edgar Allan Poe and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, he wrote a detective mystery entitled The Mystery of the Yellow Room in 1907, and four years later he published Le Fant?me de lOpra.[3] The novel was first published within newspapers before finally being published as a novel in 1911.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe setting of The Phantom of the Opera came from an actual Paris opera house that Leroux had heard the rumors about from the time the opera house was finished. The details about the Palais Garnier, and rumors surrounding it, are closely linked in Leroux's writing.  The underground water tank that he had written about is accurate to this opera house, and it is still used for training firefighters. The mysteries that Leroux uses in his novel about the phantom are still mysteries. [5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phantom of the Opera's origins came from Leroux's curiosity with the phantom being real. In the prologue he tells the readers about the phantom and the research that he did to prove the truth of the ghost. His findings connected the corpse from the opera house to the Persian phantom himself. [6] The claims from the prologue of his novel were ones that Leroux held onto even up until his death in 1927. [5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Paris in the 1880s, the Palais Garnier opera house is believed to be haunted by an entity known as the Phantom of the Opera, or simply the Opera Ghost. A stagehand named Joseph Buquet is found hanged and the rope around his neck goes missing.  At a gala performance for the retirement of the opera house's two managers, a young little-known Swedish soprano, Christine Daa, is called upon to sing in the place of the Opera's leading soprano, Carlotta, who is ill, and her performance is an astonishing success. The Vicomte Raoul de Chagny, who was present at the performance, recognizes her as his childhood playmate and recalls his love for her. He attempts to visit her backstage, where he hears a man complimenting her from inside her dressing room. He investigates the room once Christine leaves, only to find it empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Perros-Guirec, Christine meets with Raoul, who confronts her about the voice he heard in her room. Christine tells him she has been tutored by the Angel of Music, whom her father used to tell them about. When Raoul  suggests that she might be the victim of a prank, she storms off. Christine visits her father's grave one night, where a mysterious figure appears and plays the violin for her. Raoul attempts to confront it but is attacked and knocked out in the process.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack at the Palais Garnier, the new managers receive a letter from the Phantom demanding that they allow Christine to perform the lead role of Marguerite in Faust, and that box 5 be left empty for his use, lest they perform in a house with a curse on it. The managers ignore his demands as a prank, resulting in disastrous consequences: Carlotta ends up croaking like a toad, and the chandelier suddenly drops into the audience, killing a spectator. The Phantom, having abducted Christine from her dressing room, reveals himself as a deformed man called Erik.   Erik intends to keep her in his lair with him for a few days, but she causes him to change his plans when she unmasks him and, to the horror of both, beholds his noseless, lipless, sunken-eyed face, which resembles a skull dried up by the centuries, covered in yellowed dead flesh.\\r\\n\\r\\nFearing that she will leave him, he decides to keep her with him forever, but when Christine requests release after two weeks, he agrees on the condition that she wear his ring and be faithful to him. On the roof of the opera house, Christine tells Raoul about her abduction and makes Raoul promise to take her away to a place where Erik can never find her, even if she resists. Raoul tells Christine he will act on his promise the next day, to which she agrees. However, Christine sympathizes with Erik and decides to sing for him one last time as a means of saying goodbye. Unbeknownst to Christine and Raoul, Erik has been watching them and overheard their whole conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following night, the enraged and jealous Erik abducts Christine during a production of Faust and tries to force her to marry him. Raoul is led by a mysterious opera regular known as \\"The Persian\\" into Erik's secret lair deep in the bowels of the opera house, but they end up trapped in a mirrored room by Erik, who threatens that unless Christine agrees to marry him, he will kill them and everyone in the Opera House by using explosives.  Christine agrees to marry Erik. Erik initially tries to drown Raoul and the Persian, using the water which would have been used to douse the explosives, but Christine begs and offers to be his \\"living bride\\", promising him not to kill herself after becoming his bride, as she had both contemplated and attempted earlier in the book. Erik eventually releases Raoul and the Persian from his torture chamber.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Erik is alone with Christine, he lifts his mask to kiss her on her forehead and is given a kiss back. Erik reveals that he has never received a kiss, not even from his own mother, nor has been allowed to give one and is overcome with emotion. He and Christine then cry together and their tears \\"mingle\\". Erik later says that he has never felt so close to another human being. He allows the Persian and Raoul to escape, though not before making Christine promise that she will visit him on his death day, and return the gold ring he gave her. He also makes the Persian promise that afterward he will go to the newspaper and report his death, as he will die soon and will die \\"of love\\". Indeed, sometime later Christine returns to Erik's lair, buries him somewhere he will never be found (by Erik's request) and returns the gold ring. Afterward, a local newspaper runs the simple note: \\"Erik is dead\\".  Christine and Raoul (who finds out that Erik has killed his older brother) elope together, never to return.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassages narrated directly by the Persian and the final chapter piece together Erik's life: the son of a construction business owner deformed from birth, he ran away from his native Normandy to work in fairs and in caravans, schooling himself in the arts of the circus across Europe and Asia, and eventually building trick palaces in Persia and Turkey.  Eventually, he returned to France and, wearing a mask, started his own construction business.  After being subcontracted to work on the foundations of the Palais Garnier, Erik had discreetly built himself a lair to disappear in, complete with hidden passages and other tricks that allowed him to spy on the managers.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeroux uses the operatic setting in The Phantom of the Opera to use music as a device for foreshadowing.[7] Ribire makes note that Leroux was once a theatre critic and his brother was a musician, so he was knowledgeable about music and how to use it as a framing device. She uses the example of how Leroux introduces the song Danse Macabre which means \\"dance of death\\" in the gala scene which foreshadows the graveyard scene that comes later where the Phantom plays the fiddle for Christine and attacks Raoul when he tries to intervene. \\r\\n\\r\\nDrumright points out that music is evident throughout the novel in that it is the basis for Christine and Erik's relationship. Christine sees Erik as her Angel of Music that her father promised would come to her one day. The Phantom sees Christine as his musical protege, and he uses his passion for music to teach her everything he knows.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nStylistically, the novel is framed as a mystery novel as it is narrated through a detective pulling his information from various forms of research.[8] The mystery being uncovered is the Phantom who lurks through the opera house, seemingly appearing in places out of nowhere as if by magic.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his article, Fitzpatrick compares the Phantom to other monsters featured in Gothic horror novels such as Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll, Dorian Gray, and Dracula. The Phantom has a torture chamber where he kidnaps and kills people, and the walls of the chapel in the graveyard are lined with human bones.[9] Indeed, Drumright notes that The Phantom of the Opera checks off every trope necessary to have a Gothic novel according to the Encyclopedia of Literature's description which says, Such novels were expected to be dark and tempestuous and full of ghosts, madness, outrage,\\r\\nsuperstition, and revenge.[10] Although the Phantom is really just a disfigured man, he has ghost-like qualities in that no one can ever find him or his lair and he is seen as a monster. People are frightened by him because of his deformities and the  acts of violence he commits.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe novel features a love triangle between the Phantom, Christine, and Raoul. Raoul is seen as Christine's childhood love whom she is familiar with and has affection for. He is rich and therefore offers her security as well as a wholesome, Christian marriage. The Phantom, on the other hand, is not familiar. He is dark, ugly, and dangerous and therefore represents the forbidden love. However, Christine is drawn to him because she sees him as her Angel of Music, and she pities his existence of loneliness and darkness.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time Leroux published The Phantom of the Opera, he had already gained credibility as a crime mystery author in both French and English speaking countries. He had written six novels prior, two of which had garnered substantial popularity within their first year of publication called The Mystery of the Yellow Room and The Perfume of the Lady in Black.[7] Although previous commentators have asserted that The Phantom of the Opera did not attain as much success as these previous novels, being particularly unpopular in France where it was first published,[11] recent research into the novel's early reception and sales has indicated the contrary.[12] One book review from the New York Times expressed a disappointment in the way the phantom was portrayed, saying that the feeling of suspense and horror is lost once it is found out that the phantom is just a man and not a real ghost.[13]The majority of the notability that the novel acquired early on was due to its publication in a series of installments in French, American, and English newspapers. This serialized version of the story became important when it was read and sought out by Universal Pictures to be adapted into a movie in 1925.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the critical reviews of two modern day readers of the book, Sean Fitzpatrick and Cathleen Myers, the novel is praiseworthy for its drama, but overall it does not rise to the standards of great literature. Fitzpatrick claims that \\"The Phantom of the Opera is not a great book, but it is a great read.\\"[9] He digresses that even though the book is not good enough to be in the canon of great literature, there are many aspects of it that make it fun to read such as the drama of the \\"whodunnit\\" plot, the investigative styling of the book which pretends to pull from real life newspaper articles and interviews relating to the Paris Opera House, and the character Erik (the phantom) who fills the roles of the \\"mad genius\\", disfigured monster, and one of three in a love triangle all at once. Fitzpatrick argues that all of these elements make the book good for light reading.[9] Myers agrees that the novel makes for a good \\"airplane read\\", but says that it fails in terms of being a good mystery novel. She claims that one of the book's downfalls is that one of the important characters - the mysterious Persian - is introduced too late in the storyline. Another glaring omission that she sees in the book is that the Phantom is left unexplained. Myers also criticizes Christine's love for Raoul whom she claims is an idiot, saying he \\"makes Jonathon Harker and Lord Godalming in Dracula look like rocket scientists.\\"[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been many literary and other dramatic works based on Leroux's novel, ranging from stage musicals to films to children's books. Some well known stage and screen adaptations of the novel are the 1925 film and the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. In Webber's musical, he was focused on writing more of a romance piece and found the book and the musical took off from there. Leroux's novel was more than just a mystery and had romance and other genres, that would appeal to more audiences. [14] Webber used accounts from within the novel in the musical as well such as the real-life event of the chandelier falling. [15] This musical even after being produced in the mid-80s, has still remained popular with people today. The musical has received more than fifty awards and is seen by many as being the most popular musical on Broadway. [14]\\r\\n\\r\\nLerouxs novel was created into two silent films during the history and adaptations of the novel. The first production of the novel into a silent film was produced by German adaptation called, Das Gespenst im Opernhaus. This film though has no living proof left and is lost due to no pictures being taken or an actual copy of the film is preserved. The last living knowledge of the film is that it was made in 1916 and was directed by Ernest Matray. [16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next adaptation or silent film was made in 1925 by Universal Studios. This version starred Lon Chaney Sr. as the phantom. Due to tensions on the set, there was a switch in directors and Edward Sedgwick finished the film while changing the direction the movie was going to take. His take on the novel and making it a dark romantic movie with comedy wasnt popular by audiences. [16]Finally, the film was adapted one last time by Maurice Pivar and Louis Weber where they took out most of Sedgwicks adaptation and stuck to the original film. This time, the movie was a success with audiences in 1925. [16]","input":"Where did the phantom of the opera live?"},{"output":"Fourth class cadets","context":"Gyrfalcon\\r\\nThe United States Air Force Academy (also known as USAFA, the Air Force Academy, or the Academy), is a military academy for officer cadets of the United States Air Force. Its campus is located in the western United States in Colorado, immediately north of Colorado Springs in El Paso County.\\r\\nThe Academy's stated mission is \\"to educate, train, and inspire men and women to become leaders of character, motivated to lead the United States Air Force in service to our nation.\\"[7] It is the youngest of the five U.S. service academies, having graduated its first class 59 years ago in 1959, however it is the third in seniority.[8] Graduates of the Academy's four-year program receive a Bachelor of Science degree, and are commissioned as second lieutenants in the U.S. Air Force.[9] The Academy is also one of the largest tourist attractions in Colorado, attracting approximately a million visitors each year.[7]\\r\\nAdmission is extremely competitive, with nominations divided equally among Congressional districts. Recent incoming classes have had about 1,200 cadets; historically, just under 1,000 of those will graduate.[10] Tuition along with room and board are all paid for by the Air Force. Cadets receive a monthly stipend, but incur a commitment to serve a number of years of military service after graduation.[11]\\r\\nThe program at the Academy is guided by the Air Force's core values of \\"Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do\\",[7] and based on four \\"pillars of excellence\\": military training, academics, athletics and character development.[7] In addition to a rigorous military training regimen, cadets also take a broad academic course load with an extensive core curriculum in engineering, humanities, social sciences, basic sciences, military studies and physical education. All cadets participate in either intercollegiate or intramural athletics, and a thorough character development and leadership curriculum provides cadets a basis for future officership. Each of the components of the program is intended to give cadets the skills and knowledge that they will need for success as officers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the Academy's establishment, air power advocates had been pushing for a separate Air Force Academy for decades. As early as 1918, Lieutenant Colonel A.J. Hanlon wrote, \\"As the Military and Naval Academies are the backbone of the Army and Navy, so must the Aeronautical Academy be the backbone of the Air Service. No service can flourish without some such institution to inculcate into its embryonic officers love of country, proper conception of duty, and highest regard for honor.\\"[12] Other officials expressed similar sentiments. In 1919, Congressman Charles F. Curry introduced legislation providing for an Academy, but concerns about cost, curriculum and location led to its demise.[12] In 1925, air power pioneer General Billy Mitchell testified on Capitol Hill that it was necessary \\"to have an air academy to form a basis for the permanent backbone of your air service and to attend to the...organizational part of it, very much the same way that West Point does for the Army, or that Annapolis does for the Navy.\\"[12][13] Mitchell's arguments did not gain traction with legislators, and it was not until the late 1940s that the concept of the United States Air Force Academy began to take shape.[12]\\r\\nSupport for an air academy got a boost with the National Security Act of 1947, which provided for the establishment of a separate Air Force within the United States military. As an initial measure, Secretary of the Air Force W. Stuart Symington negotiated an agreement where up to 25% of West Point and Annapolis graduates could volunteer to receive their commissions in the newly established Air Force. This was only intended to be a short term fix, however, and disagreements between the services quickly led to the establishment of the Service Academy Board by Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. In January 1950, the Service Academy Board, headed by Dwight D. Eisenhower, then president of Columbia University, concluded that the needs of the Air Force could not be met by the two existing U.S. service academies and that an air force academy should be established.[12]\\r\\nFollowing the recommendation of the Board, Congress passed legislation in 1954 to begin the construction of the Air Force Academy, and President Eisenhower signed it into law on 1 April of that year.[14] The legislation established an advisory commission to determine the site of the new school. Among the panel members were Charles Lindbergh, General Carl Spaatz, and Lieutenant General Hubert R. Harmon, who later became the Academy's first superintendent. The original 582 sites considered were winnowed to three: Alton, Illinois; Lake Geneva, Wisconsin; and the ultimate site at Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Secretary of the Air Force, Harold E. Talbott, announced the winning site on 24 June 1954.[15][16] Meanwhile, Air Training Command (ATC) began developing a detailed curriculum for the Academy program.[12]\\r\\nThe early Air Force Academy leadership had the model of West Point and Annapolis in designing an appropriate curriculum, faculty, and campus. The Academy's permanent site had not yet been completed when the first class entered, so the 306?cadets from the Class of 1959 were sworn in at a temporary site at Lowry Air Force Base in Denver on 11 July 1955.[17] While at Lowry, they were housed in renovated World War II barracks.[18] There were no upper class cadets to train the new cadets, so the Air Force appointed a cadre of \\"Air Training Officers\\" (ATOs) to conduct training. The ATOs were junior officers, many of whom were graduates of West Point, Annapolis, and The Citadel. They acted as surrogate upper class cadets until the upper classes could be populated over the next several years.[12] The Academy's dedication ceremony took place on that first day and was broadcast live on national television, with Walter Cronkite covering the event.[12] Arnold W. Braswell, a native of Minden, Louisiana, was commander of the original four cadet squadrons at the academy 1955 to 1958.[19]\\r\\nIn developing a distinctive uniform for cadets, the Air Force turned to Hollywood. Famed director Cecil B. DeMille designed the cadet parade uniform; it is still worn by cadets today.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Class of 1959 established many other important traditions that continue until the present. The first class adopted the Cadet Honor Code, and chose the falcon as the Academy's mascot. On 29 August 1958, the wing of 1,145 cadets moved to the present site near Colorado Springs,[20] and less than a year later the Academy received accreditation. The first USAFA class graduated and was commissioned on 3 June 1959.[8][21]\\r\\nThe Vietnam War was the first war in which Academy graduates fought and died. As such, it had a profound effect on the development of the character of the Academy. Due to the need for more pilots, Academy enrollment grew significantly during this time. The size of the graduating classes went from 217 cadets in 1961 to 745 cadets in 1970.[22] Academy facilities were likewise expanded, and training was modified to better meet the needs of the wartime Air Force. The Jacks Valley field training area was added, the Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) program was expanded, and light aircraft training started in 1968.[22]\\r\\nMany Academy graduates of this era served with distinction in the Vietnam War. F-4 Phantom II pilot Steve Ritchie '64 and weapon systems officer Jeffrey Feinstein '68 each became aces by downing five enemy aircraft in combat.[23][24] One hundred forty-one graduates died in the conflict; thirty-two graduates became prisoners of war. Lance Sijan, '65, fell into both categories and became the first Academy graduate to be awarded the Medal of Honor due to his heroism while evading capture and in captivity.[25] Sijan Hall, one of the cadet dormitories, is named in his memory.\\r\\nThe effects of the anti-war movement were felt at the Academy as well. Because the Academy grounds are generally open to the public, the Academy often became a site for protests by anti-war demonstrators.[22] Regular demonstrations were held at the Cadet Chapel, and cadets often became the targets of protesters' insults. Other aggravating factors were the presence in the Cadet Wing of cadets motivated to attend the Academy for reasons of draft avoidance, and a number of highly publicized cheating scandals. Morale sometimes suffered as a consequence.[citation needed]\\r\\nOne of the most significant events in the history of the Academy was the admission of women.[26][27] On 7?October 1975, President Gerald R. Ford signed legislation permitting women to enter the United States service academies. On 26 June 1976, 157 women entered the Air Force Academy with the Class of 1980. Because there were no female upper class cadets, the Air Training Officer model used in the early years of the Academy was revived, and fifteen young female officers were brought in to help with the integration process. The female cadets were initially segregated from the rest of the Cadet Wing but were fully integrated into their assigned squadrons after their first semester. On 28?May 1980, 97 of the original female cadets completed the program and graduated from the Academyjust over 10% of the graduating class. Women have made up just over 20% of the most recent classes, with the class of 2016 having the highest proportion of any class, 25%.[10]\\r\\nMany of the women from those early classes went on to achieve success within the Cadet Wing and after graduation (see list of Academy graduates below). Despite these successes, integration issues were long apparent. Female cadets have had consistently higher dropout rates than men and have left the Air Force in higher numbers than men.[28]\\r\\nInitial proposals for the Air Force Academy location were between Prescott, Arizona; Linn, Wisconsin; Alton, Illinois and Colorado Springs, Colorado. The selection committee cut the final list to only Alton, Linn and Colorado Springs. Final selection was awarded to Colorado Springs.[29]\\r\\nThe campus of the Academy covers 18,500 acres (29?sq?mi; 75?km2) on the east side of the Rampart Range of the Rocky Mountains, just north of Colorado Springs. Its elevation is normally given as 7,258 feet (2,212?m) above sea level, which is at the cadet area. The Academy was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) and lead architect Walter Netsch. SOM partner John O. Merrill moved from Chicago to a Colorado Springs field office to oversee the construction and to act as a spokesman for the project.[30]\\r\\nThe most controversial aspect of the SOM-designed Air Force Academy was its chapel.[31] It was designed by SOM architect Walter Netsch, who at one point was prepared to abandon the design;[32] but the accordion-like structure is acknowledged as an iconic symbol of the academy campus.\\r\\nThe buildings in the Cadet Area were designed in a distinct, modernist style, and make extensive use of aluminum on building exteriors, suggesting the outer skin of aircraft or spacecraft.[33] On 1 April 2004, fifty years after Congress authorized the building of the Academy, the Cadet Area at the Academy was designated a National Historic Landmark.[34][35]\\r\\nThe main buildings in the Cadet Area are set around a large, square pavilion known as \\"the Terrazzo,\\" and the most recognizable is the 17-spired Cadet Chapel.[36] The subject of controversy when it was first built, it is now considered among the most prominent examples of modern American academic architecture. Other buildings on the Terrazzo include Vandenberg Hall and Sijan Hall, the two dormitories; Mitchell Hall, the cadet dining facility; and Fairchild Hall, the main academic building, which houses academic classrooms, laboratories, research facilities, faculty offices and the Robert F. McDermott Library.\\r\\nThe Aeronautics Research Center (also known as the \\"Aero Lab\\") contains numerous aeronautical research facilities, including transonic, subsonic, low speed, and cascade wind tunnels; engine and rocket test cells; and simulators.[37] The Consolidated Education and Training Facility (CETF) was built in 1997 as an annex to Fairchild Hall. It contains chemistry and biology classrooms and labs, medical and dental clinics, and civil engineering and astronautics laboratories. The Cadet Area also contains an observatory and a planetarium for academic use and navigation training.\\r\\nThe cadet social center is Arnold Hall, located just outside the Cadet Area, which houses a 3000-seat theater, a ballroom, a number of lounges, and dining and recreation facilities for cadets and visitors. Harmon Hall is the primary administration building, which houses the offices of the Superintendent and the Superintendent's staff.\\r\\nThe Cadet Area also contains extensive facilities for use by cadets participating in intercollegiate athletics, intramural athletics, physical education classes and other physical training. Set amid numerous outdoor athletic fields are the Cadet Gymnasium and the Cadet Fieldhouse. The Fieldhouse is the home to Clune Arena, the ice hockey rink and an indoor track, which doubles as an indoor practice facility for a number of sports. Falcon Stadium, located outside of the Cadet Area, is the football field and site of the graduation ceremonies.[7]\\r\\nMany displays around the Cadet Area commemorate heroes and air power pioneers, and serve as an inspiration to cadets. The War Memorial, a black marble wall located just under the flagpole on the Terrazzo, is etched with the names of Academy graduates who have been killed in combat. The Honor Wall, overlooking the Terrazzo, is inscribed with the Cadet Honor Code: \\"We will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate among us anyone who does.\\" Just under the Cadet Chapel, the Class Wall bears the crests of each of the Academy's graduating classes. The crest of the current first (senior) class is displayed in the center position. Another display often used as a symbol of the Academy, the Eagle and Fledglings Statue was given as a gift to the Academy in 1958 by the personnel of Air Training Command. It contains the inscription by Austin Dusty Miller, \\"Man's flight through life is sustained by the power of his knowledge.\\" Static air- and spacecraft displays on the Academy grounds include an F-4, F-15, F-16 and F-105 on the Terrazzo; a B-52 by the North Gate; a T-38 and A-10 at the airfield; an F-100 by the preparatory school; a SV-5J lifting body next to the aeronautics laboratory; and a Minuteman III missile in front of the Fieldhouse. The Minuteman III was removed 9 years ago in August 2008 due to rusting and other internal damage.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe \\"Core Values Ramp\\" (formerly known as the \\"Bring Me Men Ramp\\") leads down from the main Terrazzo level toward the parade field. On in-processing day, new cadets arrive at the base of the ramp and start their transition into military and Academy life by ascending the ramp to the Terrazzo. From 1964 to 2004, the portal at the base of the ramp was inscribed with the words \\"Bring me men... \\" taken from the poem, \\"The Coming American,\\" by Samuel Walter Foss. In a controversial move following the 2003 sexual assault scandal, the words \\"Bring me men...\\" were taken down and replaced with the Academy's (later adopted as the Air Force's) core values: \\"Integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do.\\"[7]\\r\\nWith an enrollment of over 1300, Air Academy High School is the only high school in the United States built on a military academy. It ranks in the top ten in the state in academic standards. Part of School District 20 (D20), its marching band regularly places in the top ten in state championships. D20 also maintains an elementary school on the academy grounds.\\r\\nOther locations on campus serve support roles for cadet training and other base functions. Doolittle Hall is the headquarters of the Academy's Association of Graduates and also serves as the initial reception point for new cadets arriving for Basic Cadet Training. It is named after General Jimmy Doolittle. The Goldwater Visitor Center, named after longtime proponent of the Academy United States Senator Barry Goldwater, is the focal point for family, friends and tourists visiting the Academy grounds. The Academy Airfield is used for training cadets in airmanship courses, including parachute training, soaring and powered flight. Interment at the Academy Cemetery is limited to Academy cadets and graduates, certain senior officers, certain Academy staff members, and certain other family members. Air power notables Carl Spaatz, Curtis E. LeMay and Robin Olds, are interred here.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe United States Air Force Academy Preparatory School (usually referred to as the \\"Prep School\\") is a program offered to selected individuals who were not able to obtain appointments directly to the Academy. The program involves intense academic preparation (particularly in English, math and science), along with athletic and military training, meant to prepare the students for appointment to the Academy. A high percentage of USAFA Preparatory School students (known as \\"Preppies\\") earn appointments to the Academy following their year at the Prep School.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Cadet Honor Code is the cornerstone of a cadet's professional training and development √ø the minimum standard of ethical conduct that cadets expect of themselves and their fellow cadets. The Honor Code was developed and adopted by the Class of 1959, the first class to graduate from the Academy and has been handed down to every subsequent class.[38][39] The Code itself is simple:\\r\\nIn 1984, the Cadet Wing voted to add an \\"Honor Oath,\\" which was to be taken by all cadets. The oath is administered to fourth class cadets (freshmen) when they are formally accepted into the Wing at the conclusion of Basic Cadet Training.[39] The oath remains unchanged since its adoption in 1984 and consists of a statement of the code, followed by a resolution to live honorably (the phrase \\"So help me God\\" is now optional):\\r\\nWe will not lie, steal or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does. Furthermore, I resolve to do my duty and to live honorably, (so help me God).\\r\\nCadets are considered the \\"guardians and stewards\\" of the Code. Cadet honor representatives are chosen by senior leadership, and oversee the honor system by conducting education classes and investigating suspected honor violations. Cadets throughout the Wing are expected to sit on Honor Boards as juries that determine whether their fellow cadets violated the code. Cadets also recommend sanctions for violations. The presumed sanction for an honor violation is disenrollment, but mitigating factors may result in the violator being placed in a probationary status for some period of time. This \\"honor probation\\" is usually only reserved for cadets in their first two years at the Academy.[citation needed]\\r\\nTo reinforce the importance of honor, character and integrity to future officers, cadets are given an extensive character and leadership curriculum. The Academy's Center for Character and Leadership Development provides classroom, seminar, workshop and experiential-based learning programs to all cadets, beginning when they enter Basic Cadet Training and continuing each year through their last semester at the Academy. The Center's programs, when coupled with the Honor Code and Honor System, establish a foundation for the \\"leaders of character\\" that the Academy aspires to produce.[40]\\r\\nThe Academy's organization is unusual in a number of respects. Because it is primarily a military unit, much of the Academy's structure is set up like that of any other Air Force Base. This is particularly true of the non-cadet unitsmost assigned to the 10th Air Base Wingthat provide base services such as security, communications, and engineering. Because the Academy is also a university, however, the organization of the faculty and the Cadet Wing have some aspects that are more similar to the faculty and student body at a civilian college.\\r\\nThe student body of the Academy is known as the Cadet Wing. The students, called \\"cadets\\", are divided into four classes, based on their year in school, much like a civilian college. They are not referred to as freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors, however, but as fourth-, third-, second- and first class cadets, respectively. Fourth class cadets (freshmen) are often referred to as \\"doolies,\\" a term derived from the Greek word —¥?? (\\"doulos\\") meaning \\"slave\\" or \\"servant.\\"[41] Members of the three lower classes are also referred to as \\"4 degrees,\\" \\"3 degrees\\" or \\"2 degrees\\" based on their class.[42] First-class cadets (seniors) are referred to as \\"firsties.\\" In the military structure of the Cadet Wing, first class cadets hold the positions of cadet officers, second class cadets act as the cadet non-commissioned officers and third class cadets represent the cadet junior non-commissioned officers.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Cadet Wing is divided into four groups, of ten cadet squadrons each. Each cadet squadron consists of about 110 cadets, roughly evenly distributed among the four classes. Selected first-, second- and third-class cadets hold leadership, operational and support jobs at the squadron, group and wing levels. Cadets live, march and eat meals with members of their squadrons. Military training and intramural athletics are conducted by squadron as well. Each cadet squadron and cadet group is supervised by a specially selected active duty officer called an Air Officer Commanding (AOC). In the case of a cadet squadron, the AOC is normally an active duty Air Force major. For a cadet group, the AOC is normally an active-duty lieutenant colonel. These officers have command authority over the cadets, counsel cadets on leadership and military career issues, oversee military training and serve as role models for the future officers.[citation needed] In addition to an AOC, cadet squadrons and groups are also supervised by an active duty non-commissioned officer known as an Academy Military Trainer (AMT), who fulfills a similar job as the AOC.\\r\\nThe Superintendent of the Academy is the commander and senior officer. The position of Superintendent is normally held by an active-duty lieutenant general. The superintendent's role is roughly similar to that of the president of a civilian university. As such, the Superintendent oversees all aspects of the Academy, including military training, academics, athletics, admissions and also functions as the installation commander of the Academy Reservation. The Academy is a Direct Reporting Unit within the Air Force, so the Superintendent reports directly to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force.[43]\\r\\nThose reporting to the Superintendent include the Dean of the Faculty and Commandant of Cadets, each of whom typically holds the rank of brigadier general, as well as the Director of Athletics, the Commander of the 10th Air Base Wing and the Commander of the Prep School, each of whom typically holds the rank of colonel. The 10th Air Base Wing provides all base support functions that exist at other air force bases, including civil engineering, communications, medical support, personnel, administration, security and base services. The Preparatory School provides an academic, athletic and military program for qualified young men and women who may need certain additional preparation prior to acceptance to the Academy. All flying programs at the Academy are run by the 306th Flying Training Group, which reports to the Air Education and Training Command, ensuring uniformity of flight training with the rest of the Air Force.[citation needed]\\r\\nCongressional oversight of the Academy is exercised through a Board of Visitors (BOV), established under Title 10, United States Code, Section 9355. The board inquires into the morale, discipline, curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs, academic methods and other matters relating to the Academy. The board meets at least four times per year and prepares semi-annual reports containing its views and recommendations submitted concurrently to the Secretary of Defense, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the House Armed Services Committee. The 15 members of the BOV are variously appointed by the President of the United States, the Vice President, the Senate and House Armed Services Committees and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Since 2006, the board has been required to include at least two Academy graduates. In July 2009, Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed Colorado Congressman Jared Polis to the BOV, the first openly gay person to serve on a service academys advisory board.[44]\\r\\nCadets' military training occurs throughout their time at the Academy, but is especially intense during their four summers. The first military experience for new cadets (called \\"basic cadets\\") occurs during the six weeks of Basic Cadet Training (BCT), in the summer before their fourth class (freshman) year. During BCT, also known as \\"beast,\\" cadets learn the fundamentals of military and Academy life under the leadership of a cadre of first and second class cadets.[45] Basic cadets learn military customs and courtesies, proper wear of the uniform, drill and ceremony, and study military knowledge and undergo a rigorous physical training program. During the second half of BCT, basic cadets march to Jacks Valley, where they complete the program in a field encampment environment. Upon completion of BCT, basic cadets receive their fourth-class shoulder boards, take the Honor Oath and are formally accepted as members of the Cadet Wing.[46]\\r\\nThe fourth-class (freshman) year is traditionally the most difficult at the Academy, militarily. In addition to their full academic course loads, heavy demands are placed on fourth class cadets outside of class. Fourth class cadets are expected to learn an extensive amount of military and Academy-related knowledge and have significant restrictions placed on their movement and actionstraversing the Cadet Area only by approved routes (including staying on the marble \\"strips\\" on the Terrazzo) and interacting with upper class cadets using a very specific decorum. The fourth class year ends with \\"Recognition,\\" a physically and mentally demanding several-day event which culminates in the award of the Prop and Wings insignia to the fourth class cadets, signifying their ascension to the ranks of upper class cadets. After Recognition, the stringent rules of the fourth class year are relaxed.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter the first year, cadets have more options for summer military training. Between their fourth and third class years, cadets undergo training in Air Force operations in a deployed environment (called Expeditionary Skills and Evasion Training [ESET]) and may participate in flying gliders, cyber-warfare training, satellite and space operations, unmanned systems, or free-fall parachute training. From the late 1960s until the mid-1990s, cadets also completed SERE training in the Jacks Valley complex between their fourth- and third-class years. This program was replaced with Combat Survival Training (CST) in 1995 and done away with entirely in 2005. In the summer of 2008, the CST program was reintroduced, but was cut again in 2011 and replaced with ESET for the summer of 2012 (the Class of 2015 was the first to participate in ESET). During their last two summers, cadets may serve as BCT cadre, travel to active duty Air Force bases and participate in a variety of other research, aviation and leadership programs. They may also be able to take courses offered by other military services, such as the U.S. Army's Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia, or the Air Assault School, at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. During the academic year, all cadets take formal classes in military theory, operations and leadership.\\r\\nThe Air Force Academy is an accredited four-year university offering bachelor's degrees in a variety of subjects. Active-duty Air Force officers make up approximately 70 percent of the faculty, with the balance long-term civilian professors, visiting professors from civilian universities and instructors from other U.S. and allied foreign military services. In recent years, civilians have become a growing portion of senior faculty.\\r\\nEvery Dean of the Faculty (equivalent to a Provost at most universities) has always been an active-duty brigadier general, although technically, a civilian may hold the position. The Dean, the Vice Dean, and each academic department chair hold the academic rank of Permanent Professor. Permanent Professors are nominated by the President of the United States and approved by the Senate, and can serve until age 64.\\r\\nAll graduates receive a Bachelor of Science degree, regardless of major, because of the technical content of the core requirements. Cadets may choose from a variety of majors, including engineering, the basic sciences, social sciences and humanities, as well as in a variety of divisional or inter-disciplinary subjects. The academic program has an extensive core curriculum, in which all cadets take required courses in the sciences, engineering, social sciences, humanities, military studies and physical education. Approximately sixty percent of a cadet's course load is mandated by the core curriculum. As a result, most of a cadet's first two years are spent in core classes. While core requirements remain significant during the third and fourth years, cadets have more flexibility to focus in their major areas of study, allowing them to participate in international and inter-service Academy exchange programs.\\r\\nTraditionally, the academic program at the Air Force Academy (as with military academies in general) has focused heavily on science and engineering, with the idea that many graduates would be expected to manage complex air, space and information technology systems. As a result, the Academy's engineering programs have traditionally been ranked highly. Over time, however, the Academy broadened its humanities offerings. About 55% of cadets typically select majors in non-technical disciplines.[citation needed] The academy's recent implementation of a computer and network security program may represent a return to form.[47]\\r\\nExternally funded research at the Air Force Academy has been a large and growing part of the technical majors. Air Force has ranked highest of all undergraduate-only universities in federally funded research as reported by the National Science Foundation, surpassing $60 million in 2010.[citation needed] Many cadets are involved in research via their major, coordinated in more than a dozen Academy research centers, including the Institute for Information Technology Applications, the Institute for National Security Studies, the Air Force Humanities Institute, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Studies, the Life Sciences Research Center, the Academy Center for Physics Education Research, among others.\\r\\nAll cadets at the Academy take part in the school's extensive athletic program. The program is designed to enhance the physical conditioning of all cadets, to develop the physical skills necessary for officership, to teach leadership in a competitive environment and to build character.[48] The primary elements of the athletic program are intercollegiate athletics, intramural athletics, physical education, and the physical fitness tests.\\r\\nCadets are required to take physical education courses in each of their four years at the Academy. The classes cover a wide range of activities: Swimming and water survival build confidence while teaching important survival skills. Combative sports such as boxing, wrestling, judo and unarmed combat build confidence, teach controlled aggression and develop physical fitness. Cadets also take classes in team sports such as basketball and soccer, in lifetime sports such as tennis and golf and on the physiology of exercise.[citation needed]\\r\\nEach semester, cadets must pass two athletic fitness tests: a 1.5?mi (2.4?km) run to measure aerobic fitness, and a 15-minute, 5-event, physical fitness test consisting of pull-ups, a standing long jump, sit-ups, push-ups and a 600?yd (550?m) sprint.[49] Failure to pass a fitness test usually results in the cadet being assigned to reconditioning until he can pass the test. Repeated failures can lead to disenrollment.[citation needed]\\r\\nAll cadets are required to compete in intramural athletics for their entire time at the Academy, unless they are on-season for intercollegiate athletics. Intramural sports put cadet squadrons against one another in many sports, including basketball, cross-country, flag football, ice hockey, racquetball, flickerball, rugby union, boxing, soccer, mountain biking, softball, team handball, tennis, Ultimate, wallyball and volleyball. Winning the Wing Championship in a given sport is a particular source of pride for a cadet squadron.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Academy's intercollegiate program has 17 men's and 10 women's NCAA sanctioned teams, nicknamed the Falcons.[48] Men's teams compete in football, baseball, basketball, ice hockey, cross-country, fencing, golf, gymnastics, indoor and outdoor track, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, water polo and wrestling. Women's teams include basketball, cross-country, fencing, gymnastics, indoor and outdoor track, swimming and diving, soccer, tennis and volleyball. The Academy fields a coeducational team in rifle. In addition, the Academy also sponsors two non-NCAA programs: cheerleading and boxing. The Academy also has several club sports, such as rugby, that compete intercollegiately.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe men's and women's programs compete in NCAA's Division I, with the football team competing in Division I FBS. Most teams are in the Mountain West Conference; however, the wrestling team competes in the Big 12 Conference, the gymnastics teams compete in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation; the men's soccer team competes in the Western Athletic Conference;[50] the men's hockey team competes in Atlantic Hockey, the water polo team competes in the Western Water Polo Association, the coeducational rifle team competes in the Patriot Rifle Conference, and the men's lacrosse team competes in the Southern Conference. The men's boxing team competes in the National Collegiate Boxing Association. For a number of years, only the men's teams competed in Division I. Women's teams competed in Division II and were once members of the Continental Divide Conference, then the Colorado Athletic Conference. With new NCAA legislation, beginning in 1996, women's teams also competed in Division I.[citation needed]\\r\\nAir Force has traditional service academy rivalries with Navy and Army. The three service academies compete for the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy in football each year. Air Force Falcons football has had the best showing of the three, winning the trophy 18 of its 34 years. The Academy also has an in-state rivalry with Colorado State University, which is located in Fort Collins and is a fellow member of the Mountain West Conference. [51][citation needed]\\r\\nThe boxing team, led for 31 years by Coach Ed Weichers, has won 18 national championships.[52] The Academy's men's and women's rugby teams have each won multiple national championships and the women's side recently had two players selected for the United States national team.[53] The football team has played in 17 bowl games and the basketball team has had strong showings in the last several years, qualifying for the NCAA tournament and, most recently, making the final four of the 2007 NIT Tournament.[54] The men's ice hockey team won the last two Atlantic Hockey conference tournaments, made the first ever appearance by a service academy in the NCAA hockey tournament in 2007, and made a repeat appearance in 2008. The Air Force Academy's Men's Hockey team recently lost in the \\"Elite Eight\\" of hockey in double overtime. This marked the farthest they had gone in the post-season in school history and the longest an Atlantic Hockey Association team has made it into the post-season.[55]\\r\\nIn 2014, Academy Superintendent Lt. Gen. Michelle Johnson responded to reports of allegations of sexual assault and drug use at a December 2011 party by calling for a review of the Athletic Department by the Inspector General.[56]\\r\\nCadets have the opportunity to take part in several airmanship activities to include soaring, parachuting, and powered flight. Airmanship activities at the Academy are primarily conducted by the 306th Flying Training Group.\\r\\nThe 94th Flying Training Squadron trains cadets in basic airmanship principles through several flights in TG-16A sailplanes. Each year, several soaring students are selected to become instructor pilots to teach new classes of soaring students. Some of these cadet instructor pilots also compete on the Soaring Racing Team or Acrobatics Team in national competitions.\\r\\nCadets also have the opportunity to take a parachuting course conducted by the 98th Flying Training Squadron. Each year, hundreds of cadets earn their Basic Parachutist Badge by completing five jumps in the program. A number of cadets are selected for further training and become members of The Wings of Blue, the U.S. Air Force Parachute Team.\\r\\nA powered flight program is conducted under the 557th Flying Training Squadron to expose cadets to the basics of powered flight. The program uses T-53A aircraft to offer cadets basic flight training and the opportunity to solo. The U.S. Air Force Academy Flying Team is composed of ~26 cadets selected to compete in National Intercollegiate Flying Association competitions. The Flying Team uses T-41D and T-51A aircraft to compete in precision landing, navigation, and message drop events.\\r\\nTo be eligible to enter the Academy, a candidate must:[57][58]\\r\\nIn addition to the normal application process, all candidates must secure a nomination to the Academy, normally from a U.S. Senator or U.S. Representative. Each member of Congress and the Vice President can have five appointees attending the Air Force Academy at any time. The process for obtaining a congressional nomination is not political and candidates do not have to know their senator or representative to secure a nomination. Additional nomination slots are available for children of career military personnel, children of disabled veterans or veterans who were killed in action, or children of Medal of Honor recipients. The admissions process is a lengthy one and applicants usually begin the paperwork during their junior year of high school.[60]\\r\\nThere were 306 cadets admitted for the first class (class of 1959).[12] By 1961, class size was down to 271, but due to the need for officers in the Vietnam War, grew to 745 admittees in 1970,[22] and peaking in 1974, with 1,620, and 1975, with 1,626, the largest number ever admitted.[61] After that class sizes shrank down to about 1,300.[62][63] Despite a peak of 1,350 (admitted 2004) and 1,418 (admitted 2005), from 1995 to 2005 class size averaged about 1,250 freshmen.[61] From 2005 to 2010 class sizes were slightly down from the 2005 peak. The 2013 class (beginning 2009) had 1,286[64] and the 2014 class (beginning Fall 2010) had 1,285.[65] Cutbacks were ordered in 2011, so by 2012, the entering class (class of 2016) was down to about 1,050.[65] The current class (class of 2019) began with 1,248 students.\\r\\nThe Prop and Wings insignia of the Air Service (1918√ø26), Air Corps (1926√ø41), and Army Air Forces (1941√ø47) became the insignia of upperclass cadets at the Air Force Academy beginning with the first class, 1959. The insignia is given to fourth class (freshmen) cadets at the Recognition Ceremony near the end of their first year rite of passage. The standard insignia uses the design of the Air Corps Prop and Wings, except that it is all silver instead of the gold wings and silver prop of the earlier design. Cadets who have ancestors who served in the Air Service, Air Corps, or Army Air Forces, or those who are direct descendants of Air Force Academy graduates, are eligible to wear a silver prop and gold wings set of prop and wings.\\r\\nThe Air Force Academy cadet sabre is carried by first class (senior) cadets in command positions in the Cadet Wing. All graduates are normally entitled to own no more than two sabres: one for personal use and one to be given as a gift. The Plaque and Sabre Award is the highest award given by the Cadet Wing to dignitaries and other honorees.\\r\\nThe American college tradition of the class ring began with the class of 1835 at the U.S. Military Academy. From there, it spread to the U.S. Naval Academy in the class of 1869.[66] The Air Force Academy continued the tradition, beginning with the first class, 1959, and so is the only service academy to have had class rings for every class since its founding. The Air Force ring is distinctive for being white gold instead of the yellow gold used at the other academies. Each class designs its own class crest; the only requirements being that each crest include all the elements on the Class of 1959's crest: the class number, the class year, the Polaris star, and the eagle. One side of the ring bears the academy crest, while the other side bears the class crest; the center bezel bears the words United States Air Force Academy. Cadets choose their own stones for the center of the ring. The rings are received at the Ring Dance at the beginning of the Graduation Week festivities for the class ahead of the ring recipients. The rings traditionally are placed in glasses of champagne and are caught in the teeth following a toast. During the cadet's first class (senior) year, the ring is worn with the class crest facing the wearer; following graduation, the ring is turned so that the class crest faces out. The rings of all the academies were originally designed to be worn on the left hand, so that the wearer reads the name of the academy on the bezel while a cadet or midshipman and others can read it after graduation, the rings are now worn on either hand. The Academy's Association of Graduates (AOG) accepts rings of deceased graduates which are melted down to form an ingot of white gold from which a portion of all future rings are made.[67] Both the academy's Association of Graduates and the Academy Library maintain displays of class rings.\\r\\nThe first Honor scandal broke in 1965, when a resigning cadet reported knowing of more than 100 cadets who had been involved in a cheating ring. One hundred and nine cadets were ultimately expelled. Cheating scandals plagued the Academy again in 1967, 1972, 1984, 2004,[68] 2007,[69] 2012, and 2014. Following each of these events, the Academy thoroughly examined the etiology of the mass cheating in addition to alleged excessive pressures that the academic system at the time placed on cadets and made changes in attempts to reduce the opportunities for future incidents\\r\\nThe sexual assault scandal that broke in 2003 forced the Academy to look more closely at how effectively women had been integrated into cadet life; concerns with sexual assault, hazing of male cadets, and the disciplinary process during this period were detailed in a 2010 book by a former cadet.[70] Following the scandal and rising concerns about sexual assault throughout the U.S. military, the Department of Defense established a task force to investigate sexual harassment and assault at each of the United States service academies. The report also revealed 92 incidents of reported sexual assault.[71] At the same time, the Academy implemented programs to combat sexual assault, harassment and gender bias. The new programs actively encourage prompt sexual assault reporting. The Academy's decisive actions of zero tolerance were praised by officials and experts.[72]\\r\\nFollowing the 2003 crisis, the Department of Defense directed its attention to the problem of sexual harassment and assault at the military academies. The Department of Defense claimed that the program was successful although during the school year 2010√ø11 there were increased reports of sexual assault at the academy; however, one goal of the program is increased reporting.[73] There have been several attempts to prosecute cadets for rape since 2003, but only three have been successful convictions, citing the confidential informant program that ran from 2011-2012. The informant program was led by former AFOSI agent Brandon Enos, AFOSI's most successful agent in Air Force Academy's history in combating sexual assault and drug use amongst cadets. After the confidential informant program was mysteriously disbanded in 2013 on orders from General Johnson, sexual assault reporting fell by half. On 5 January 2012 rape charges were preferred against cadets in three unrelated cases.[74] To help combat these problems, the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) created a system of cadet informants to hunt for misconduct among students.[75] According to The New York Times in Academic Year 2014, \\"after the informant program ended with no further convictions, reports fell by half.\\"[76]\\r\\nThe New York Times has cited a letter to Congress from former AFOSI Agent, Staff Sergeant Brandon Enos, who said that Lieutenant General Michael C. Gould, the superintendent from 2009 to 2013 and a former quarterback on the team, had repeatedly interfered in cases involving football players. In turn Gould said to the Times that the suggestion that he had interfered with the investigation preposterous.\\"[76] Gould was found guilty by a report from the Pentagon in June 2016 of interfering with AFOSI investigations from 2011-2012, including blocking an investigation into the football coaches. Gould was removed from the College Football Selection Committee but was able to retain his retirement pay.[citation needed]\\r\\nThese and other problems again rose to national prominence in the summer of 2014 when The Gazette broke an investigation into behavior by Academy cadets and faculty that included allegations of drug use, alcohol abuse, cheating, and sexual assault. This behavior, described as \\"so wild that AFOSI leaders canceled a planned 2012 sting out of concern that undercover agents and confidential informants at a party wouldn't be enough to protect women from rape,\\" prompted the Academy superintendent to call for an investigation of the Academy's athletic department.[77]\\r\\nIn 2005, allegations surfaced that some Evangelical Christian cadets and staff were effectively engaging in religious proselytizing at the Academy.[78] These allegations, along with concerns over how the Air Force handles other religious issues, prompted Academy graduate Michael L. Weinstein to file a lawsuit against the Air Force.[79][80] An Air Force panel investigated the accusations and issued a report on 22 June 2005.[81] The panel's investigation found a \\"religious climate that does not involve overt religious discrimination, but a failure to fully accommodate all members needs and a lack of awareness over where the line is drawn between permissible and impermissible expression of beliefs.\\" Evidence discovered during the investigation included antisemitic remarks, official sponsorship of a showing of the film The Passion of the Christ and a locker room banner that said academy athletes played for \\"Team Jesus.\\" In response to the panel's findings, the Air Force released new guidelines to discourage public prayers at official events or meetings and to facilitate worship by non-Christian religions.[82]\\r\\nIn 2010 the academy set up an outdoor worship area for cadets following Wicca, Neo-Druidism, or other earth-based religions to practice their faiths.[83][84]\\r\\nA 2010 survey found that 41 percent of academy cadets who identified themselves as non-Christian reported they were subjected to unwanted religious proselytizing at least once or twice last year at the school. The survey's results, however, showed that the number of cadets who felt pressured to join in religious activities had declined from previous years. Colorado congressman Mike Coffman criticized the academy for resisting calls to release details of the survey's results.[85][86]\\r\\nIn 2012, 66 House Republicans complained about policies set in place the last September to curtail requirements to attend religious events.[87]\\r\\nCoordinates: 3901N 10453W? / ?39.01N 104.89W? / 39.01; -104.89","input":"What are freshmen called at the air force academy?"},{"output":"the Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C.","context":"","input":"Where is the united states supreme court located?"},{"output":"1890.

Lee, J.E.B. Stuart, Jefferson Davis, Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, and Matthew Fontaine Maury. There is also a monument to Arthur Ashe, a Richmond native and international tennis star who was African-American. The first monument, a statue of Robert E. Lee, was erected in 1890. Between 1900 and 1925, Monument Avenue greatly expanded with architecturally significant houses, churches and apartment buildings.[4]\\r\\nMonument Avenue is the site of several annual events, particularly in the spring, including an annual Monument Avenue 10K race.[5] At various times (such as Robert E. Lee's birthday and Confederate History Month) the Sons of Confederate Veterans gather along Monument Avenue in period military costumes. Monument Avenue is also the site of \\"Easter on Parade,\\" [6] another spring tradition during which many Richmonders stroll the avenue wearing Easter bonnets and other finery.\\r\\n\\"Monument Avenue Historic District\\" includes the part of Monument Avenue begins at the termination of West Franklin Street at Stuart Circle in the east extending westward for some fourteen blocks to Roseneath Avenue in the west, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark District.[7] In 2007, the American Planning Association named Monument Avenue one of the 10 Great Streets in the country.[8] The APA said Monument Avenue was selected for its historic architecture, urban form, quality residential and religious architecture, diversity of land uses, public art and integration of multiple modes of transportation.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMonument Avenue was conceived during a site search for a memorial statue of General Robert E. Lee after Lee's death in 1870. Richmond citizens had been wanting to erect statues for three Virginians who had helped defend the city (two of whom were killed in the defense). City plans as early as 1887 show the proposed site, a circle of land, just past the end of West Franklin Street, a premier downtown residential avenue. The land was owned by a wealthy Richmonder, Otway C. Allen. The plan for the statue included building a grand avenue extending west lined with trees along a central grassy median. The plan shows building plots which Allen intended to sell to developers and those wishing to build houses on the new grand avenue.\\r\\nOn May 29, 1890, crowds were estimated at 100,000 to view the unveiling of the first monument, to Robert E. Lee.[10]\\r\\nIt would take about 10 years for wealthy Richmonders and speculative developers to start buying the lots and building houses along the avenue, but in the years between 1900 and 1925 Monument Avenue exploded with architecturally significant houses, churches and apartment buildings. The architects who built on Monument Avenue practiced in the region and nationally, and included the firms of John Russell Pope, William Bottomley, Duncan Lee, Marcellus Wright, Claude Howell, Henry Baskervill, D. Wiley Anderson and Albert Huntt. Speculative builders such as W. J. Payne, Harvey C. Brown and the Davis Brothers bought lots and built many houses to sell to those not designing with an architect.\\r\\nThe street was originally, and continues to be, a favored living area for Richmond's upper class. It (especially the Fan District section) is lined with enormous mansions from the end of the gilded age. The Museum District part of Monument Avenue includes a combination of such houses (especially in the 3100 block), apartment buildings and smaller single-family houses. West of Interstate 195, Monument Avenue becomes a more commonplace suburban avenue.\\r\\nThrough the decades the avenue has had its ups and downs. As early as 1910, but mostly during the 1950s and '60s, many of the large houses were subdivided into apartments, or interior rooms and carriage houses were let to boarders. A few houses were demolished to make way for parking lots or building expansions, and several modern additions were tucked between earlier existing buildings. But protections put in place by the city by designating Monument Avenue as an Old and Historic Neighborhood have helped maintain the integrity of the neighborhood. In 1969 a group was incorporated called The Residents and Associates for the Preservation of Monument Avenue, led by Zayde Rennolds Dotts (Mrs. Walter Dotts, Jr.),[11] granddaughter of Beulah and John Kerr Branch, who had commissioned a house on Monument Avenue in 1914 by the firm of John Russell Pope. In 1970 the group changed its name to the Monument Avenue Preservation Society (MAPS).\\r\\nIn August 2017, following violence linked to far right white supremacist groups in Charlottesville, VA, Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney announced that the city's Monument Avenue commission would include potential removal of the confederate statues as an option for dealing with the issues raised by statues glorifying the legacy of the south. [12]\\r\\nStarting from the east the first from downtown is traffic circle known as Stuart Circle after the termination of West Franklin Street and the beginning of Monument Avenue and cross street of Lombardy. In Stuart Circle is the J.E.B. Stuart Monument, an equestrian bronze statue sitting atop a granite base. The statue which was sculpted by Fred Moynihan of New York was the second monument unveiled on Monument Ave in 1907 and was inspired of the British General Outram sculpture in Calcutta. Stuart is turned in the saddle facing east while the horse faces north. The horses stance has been viewed as being awkward by many Virginians.[14]\\r\\nPlans for the sculpture was first discussed publicly as early as 1875, however the competition was not done held until 1903. Fitzhugh Lee again chaired the selection committee, as he had for the Lee Monument. The site location was chosen in 1904 as Stuart was one of the two whom died helping to defend the city that citizens had been wanting to memorialize in a house nearby. At the same time plans for the third Davis Monument was being planned further west at Monument Ave and Cedar Street. The dual unveiling drew large crowds even larger than the Lee unveiling. Crowds were estimated between 80,000 - 200,000 which included 18,000 veteran attendees who camped out for the week.[15]\\r\\nOne block west of Stuart Circle is the big traffic circle of Lee Circle. The Robert E. Lee Monument was the first and is the largest of the street's monuments.[16]\\r\\nFour blocks to the west of Lee Circle is a tall central column surrounded by a Doric colonnade of the impressive Davis Memorial unveiled in 1907. The United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) had been appealing to include a Jefferson Davis memorial and in 1904 the first addition to the plan was made. UDC chose the site as it had been the former location of Star Fort, the innermost westward protection for Richmond. The defenses is also marked by a cannon just to the east of Davis Memorial.\\r\\nThree blocks west of Davis Memorial is the equestrian statue of Stonewall Jackson located at corner of Monument Ave and Boulevard.\\r\\nThe \\"Pathfinder of the Seas\\" monument of Matthew Fontaine Maury is located on Monument Avenue at Belmont Avenue,[17] closest to the Arthur Ashe monument. The Maury monument is not a Confederate war monument per se, demonstrating little indication of his role in the Confederate war, which included serving as chief of sea coast, river and harbor defenses and acquiring ships and supplies for the Confederacy through his work in the Confederate Secret Service in Europe, mainly in Ireland, France and England. When the Sons of Confederate Veterans celebrate Confederate History Month or Lee-Jackson Day by parading in period military costumes from east to west on Monument Avenue, they make a turn before they get to the Maury monument, a further indication that Commander Maury's monument is not a Civil War monument. Most of the Confederate veterans were gone when Monument Avenue turned to the sciences with the 1929 statue to Maury.\\r\\nIn 1915 the Matthew Fontaine Maury Association was founded with the purpose of erecting a monument to Maury though serious fundraising did not happen until after the end of the First World War. Eventually the United Daughters of the Confederacy joined in the fundraising, the State Virginia and the City of Richmond each donated $1,000, and even President Wilson, a native Virginian, joined the Association.[18]\\r\\nThe committee selected Richmond sculptor Frederick William Sievers, the author of many Lost Cause memorials, to produce the work and he created the \\"most allegorical of Richmonds monuments. [19] The monument was unveiled as part of an Armistice Day celebration on November 11, 1929. [20]\\r\\nThe figure of Maury faces eastward, toward the Atlantic Ocean that the \\"Pathfinder of the Seas\\" charted. He holds in his left hand a pencil and compass and in his right hand a copy of his charts. Beside his left foot is his book, Physical Geography of the Sea, as well as a Bible, indicating the central role that faith played in Maury's life. A globe of the Earth is tilted slightly on its axis behind his head. It represents both land and sea, and the woman standing calmly is a representation of Mother Nature between the land and sea. Around the base of the globe are depictions of people clinging to a sinking boat in bad weather representing the dangers of the sea with a woman in the center, and on the right (north) side of the globe there is a farmer, boy and a dog representing Maury's work promoting land weather service, which dates back further than 1853. Maury attended the International Meteorological Organization in Brussels, Belgium on August 23, 1853, where Maury, leading the way for this conference with his ideas of land and sea weather predictions and representing the United States, promoted his ideas of safety on both land and at sea to many nations which agreed to follow his ideas. Every maritime nation had its ships reporting to Maury at the National (later Naval) Observatory in Washington D.C. These elements represent Maury's work with atmospheric science, to the benefit of all mankind and their enterprises on land and on the sea. Weather warnings and reports had been dreams of Maury during his lifetime up until when he died and he was successful in his work. He thought of the ships at sea as \\"a thousand temples of science for all of humanity\\" and believed these brought men and nations closer together in a common self-protection against storms and deaths. There are fish, dolphins, jellyfish and birds around the monument's perimeter.\\r\\nThe decision to place the statue of Arthur Ashe by Paul DiPasquale on Monument Avenue was controversial.[21] Detractors pointed to a lack of correlation between the Richmond native tennis star and Confederate leaders. Some residents thought the monument should be placed at the Arthur Ashe Athletic Center instead. The monument became a focal point of racial tensions in the city around the times of its commission and its unveiling. Many of the city's majority African American residents cited Ashe's distinguished place in the modern history of the city as a reason for inclusion, while some residents and other parties rejected it as inappropriate for Monument Avenue, which until 1996 contained only statues of men with a relationship to the Confederate States of America.\\r\\nThe controversy over the statue may have also been driven by design and placement choices. Ashe's statue is much smaller than those of most of the Confederate leaders and is the farthest from downtown Richmond, situated just outside the city's Fan district.","input":"When were the statues on monument avenue built?"},{"output":"November 1, 1952","context":"Ivy Mike was the codename given to the first test of a full-scale[1] thermonuclear device, in which part of the explosive yield comes from nuclear fusion. It was detonated on November 1, 1952 by the United States on the island of Elugelab in Enewetak Atoll, in the Pacific Ocean, as part of Operation Ivy. It was the first full test of the Teller√øUlam design, a staged fusion device.\\r\\nDue to its physical size and fusion fuel type (cryogenic liquid deuterium), the Mike device was not suitable for use as a deliverable weapon; it was intended as an extremely conservative proof of concept experiment to validate the concepts used for multi-megaton detonations. A simplified and lightened bomb version (the EC-16) was prepared and scheduled to be tested in operation Castle Yankee, as a backup in case the non-cryogenic \\"Shrimp\\" fusion device (tested in Castle Bravo) failed to work; that test was cancelled when the Bravo device was tested successfully, making the cryogenic designs obsolete.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 82-ton \\"Mike\\" device was essentially a building that resembled a factory rather than a weapon. It has been reported that Soviet engineers derisively referred to Mike as a \\"thermonuclear installation\\".[2] At its center, a very large cylindrical thermos flask or cryostat held the cryogenic deuterium fusion fuel. A regular fission bomb (the \\"primary\\") at one end was used to create the conditions needed to initiate the fusion reaction.\\r\\nThe device was designed by Richard Garwin, a student of Enrico Fermi, on the suggestion of Edward Teller. It had been decided that nothing other than a full-scale test would validate the idea of the Teller-Ulam design, and Garwin was instructed to use very conservative estimates when designing the test, and that it need not be small and light enough to be deployed by air.[3]\\r\\nThe primary stage was a TX-5 boosted fission bomb in a separate space atop the assembly (so it would not freeze, rendering it inoperable). The \\"secondary\\" fusion stage used liquid deuterium despite the difficulty of handling this material, because this fuel simplified the experiment, and made the results easier to analyze. Running down the center of the flask which held it, was a cylindrical rod of plutonium (the \\"sparkplug\\") to ignite the fusion reaction. Surrounding this assembly was a five-ton (4.5 tonne) natural uranium \\"tamper\\". The exterior of the tamper was lined with sheets of lead and polyethylene, which formed a radiation channel to conduct X-rays from the primary to secondary. The function of the X-rays was to compress the secondary; with tamper/pusher ablation, foam plasma pressure and radiation pressure. This process increases the density and temperature of the deuterium to the level needed to sustain a thermonuclear reaction, and compress the sparkplug to a supercritical mass - Inducing the sparkplug to undergo nuclear fission, to start a fusion reaction in the surrounding deuterium fuel. The outermost layer was a steel casing 10√ø12?inches (25√ø30?cm) thick. The entire assembly, nicknamed \\"Sausage\\", measured 80?inches (2.03 m) in diameter and 244?inches (6.19 m) in height and weighed about 54 tons.\\r\\nThe entire Mike device (including cryogenic equipment) weighed 82 short tons (73.8 metric tonnes), and was housed in a large corrugated-aluminium building called a \\"shot cab\\" which was set up on the Pacific island of Elugelab, part of the Enewetak atoll.\\r\\nA 9,000-foot (2.7?km) artificial causeway connected the islands of Elugelab, Teiter, Bogairikk, and Bogon. Atop this causeway was an aluminium-sheathed plywood tube (named a \\"Krause-Ogle box\\") filled with helium ballonets. This allowed gamma and neutron radiation to pass uninhibited to an unmanned detection station housed in a bunker on Bogon.\\r\\nIn total, 9,350 military and 2,300 civilian personnel were involved in the Mike shot. A large cryogenics plant was installed on Parry Island, at the South end of the Enewetak atoll, to produce the liquid hydrogen (used for cooling the device) and deuterium needed for the test.\\r\\nThe test was carried out on 1 November 1952 at 07:15 local time (19:15 on 31 October, Greenwich Mean Time). It produced a yield of 10.4 megatons of TNT.[4] However, 77% of the final yield came from fast fission of the uranium tamper, which produced large amounts of radioactive fallout.\\r\\nThe fireball created by the explosion had a maximum radius of 2.9 to 3.3?km (1.8 to 2.1?mi).[5][6][7] This maximum is reached a number of seconds after the detonation and during this time the hot fireball invariably rises due to buoyancy. While still relatively close to the ground, the fireball had yet to reach its maximum dimensions and was thus approximately 5.2?km (3.2?mi) wide. The mushroom cloud rose to an altitude of 17?km (56,000?ft) in less than 90 seconds. One minute later it had reached 33?km (108,000?ft), before stabilizing at 41?km (135,000?ft) with the top eventually spreading out to a diameter of 161?km (100?mi) with a stem 32?km (20?mi) wide.\\r\\nThe blast created a crater 1.9?km (6,230?ft) in diameter and 50?m (164?ft) deep where Elugelab had once been;[8] the blast and water waves from the explosion (some waves up to 6?m (20?ft) high) stripped the test islands clean of vegetation, as observed by a helicopter survey within 60 minutes after the test, by which time the mushroom cloud and steam were blown away. Radioactive coral debris fell upon ships positioned 56?km (35?mi), and the immediate area around the atoll was heavily contaminated for some time. Two new elements, einsteinium and fermium, were produced by intensely concentrated neutron flux about the detonation site.[9] One USAF pilot was lost when his F-86 Sabre crashed during a sampling mission.[10]\\r\\nClose to the fireball, lightning discharges were rapidly triggered.[11]\\r\\nThe entire shot was documented by the filmmakers of Lookout Mountain studios. A post production explosion sound was overdubbed over what was a completely silent detonation from the vantage point of the camera, with the blast wave sound only arriving a number of seconds later, as akin to thunder, with the exact time depending on its distance.[12] The film was also accompanied by powerful, Wagner-esque music featured on many test films of that period and was hosted by actor Reed Hadley. A private screening was given to President Dwight D. Eisenhower who had succeeded President Harry S. Truman in January 1953.[13] In 1954, the film was released to the public after censoring, and was shown on commercial television channels.[14]\\r\\nEdward Teller, perhaps the most ardent supporter of the development of the hydrogen bomb, was in Berkeley, California at the time of the shot. He was able to receive first notice that the test was successful by observing a seismometer, which picked up the shock wave that traveled through the earth from the Pacific Proving Grounds.[15] In his memoirs, Teller wrote that he immediately sent an unclassified telegram to Dr. Elizabeth \\"Diz\\" Graves, the head of the rump project remaining at Los Alamos during the shot. The unclassified telegram contained only the words \\"It's a boy.\\", which came hours earlier than any other word from Enewetak.[16][17]\\r\\nCoordinates: 11400N 1621113E? / ?11.66667N 162.18694E? / 11.66667; 162.18694","input":"When did the us detonate the first hydrogen bomb?"},{"output":"The Northwest Territories","context":"Obesity in Canada is a growing health concern, which is \\"expected to surpass smoking as the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality  and represents a burden of Can$3.96 (US$3.04/?2.75) billion on the Canadian economy each year.\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2017, research done by the Public Health Agency of Canada has reported that 64% of Canadian adults over the age of 18 are overweight or obese, and 30% of children aged 5-17 are overweight or obese.[2] An independent study in the same year by Renew Bariatrics, a bariatric center for obesity treatment in the United States and Canada, reports 650 million adults and 135 million children and adolescents as obese. [3] Studies suggest that if Canada invests $4.2 billion in treatment for obesity, the obesity rate could be significantly reduced to 29%.[4] In children, obesity has substantially increased between 1978 and 2017, with obesity rates in children increasing from  23% to 30%.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2016, 16% of British Columbians are obese, making it the province with the lowest rate of obesity in Canada.

Only 9 out of the 10 provinces in Canada, perform bariatric surgery, and only 114 surgeons and 33 centers provide this service. Making only 1 out of 183 Canadian adults eligible for it. Anti-Obesity medication is not available for more than 80% of Canadas population, because of the limited access to private drug benefit plans. In result of these limitations, support for cognitive behavioral therapy, and mental health support is also limited.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Public Health Agency of Canada, as of 2017, 30% of children aged, 5-17 are overweight or obese.[7] In 2016, 1 in 7 children in Canada were reported to be obese.[8] Making almost a third of youth overweight.[9] Since 1979, the rates of childhood obesity have tripled.[10] In result of this increase, children are at much higher risk of developing health problems, ranging from, asthma, type-2 diabetes, high blood pressure, depression, etc. Childhood obesity puts children at high risks of remaining obese throughout adulthood. In 2016, studies showed a declining rate in childhood obesity in Canada. The authors suggested this is in result of increased public awareness of obesity in children, or the body mass index (BMI) growth charts that were distributed to healthcare providers in 2000. They believe that these charts may have helped providers to educate children, and parents about this epidemic.[11] Research conducted by Angela Devlin, a researcher at University of British Columbia obesity researcher noted, children who were overweight were most likely growing into obese adults. In result, causing a decrease in childhood obesity, and contributing to the increase of adult obesity rates.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2004 study called the Canadian Community Health Survey, found 29% of Canadians 18 and older were obese and 41% more were overweight (as determined by body mass index).  In children and adolescents, 8% were obese and 18% overweight.  Rates of obesity varied significantly between the provinces, from an obesity rate of 19% in British Columbia to a rate of 34% in Newfoundland and Labrador.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, the prevalence of obesity in the three most populated provinces, Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec, matched those of about thirty US states, at a level between 20% and 25%. The study found people that live in cities (Census Metropolitan Areas) had significantly lower obesity rates in Nova Scotia, Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia.  In Quebec the relationship approached significance (p=0.08), while in Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan the rate of obesity did not vary significantly between CMAs and rural areas.[13] Obesity in such populated areas often attack on young adults, ages ranging from 16 to 21. Studies shows that an individual who's going through extensive learning often binges on food to help release stress. People dealing with stress usually find eating as method to help ease or cope with their problems, leading to obesity.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2005 report released by the Canadian government's Economics Division reported that \\"In 2004, approximately 6.8 million Canadian adults aged 20 to 64 were overweight, and an additional 4.5 million were obese.

He was originally enfeoffed as the Prince of Yan (t) in May 1370,[1] with the capital of his princedom at Beiping (modern Beijing). Amid the continuing struggle against the Mongols of the Northern Yuan dynasty, Zhu Di consolidated his own power and eliminated rivals such as the general Lan Yu. He initially accepted his father's appointment of his eldest brother Zhu Biao and then his nephew Zhu Yunwen as crown prince, but when Zhu Yunwen ascended the throne as the Jianwen Emperor and began executing and demoting his powerful uncles, Zhu Di found pretext for rising in rebellion against his nephew.[1] Assisted in large part by eunuchs mistreated by the Hongwu and Jianwen Emperors, who both favored the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats,[2] Zhu Di survived the initial attacks on his princedom and drove south to launch the Jingnan Campaign against the Jianwen Emperor in Nanjing. In 1402, he successfully overthrew his nephew and occupied the imperial capital, Nanjing, after which he was proclaimed Emperor and adopted the era name Yongle, which means \\"perpetual happiness\\".\\r\\nEager to establish his own legitimacy, Zhu Di voided the Jianwen Emperor's reign and established a wide-ranging effort to destroy or falsify records concerning his childhood and rebellion.[1] This included a massive purge of the Confucian scholars in Nanjing[1] and grants of extraordinary extralegal authority to the eunuch secret police.[2] One favorite was Zheng He, who employed his authority to launch major voyages of exploration into the South Pacific and Indian Oceans. The difficulties in Nanjing also led the Yongle Emperor to re-establish Beiping (present-day Beijing) as the new imperial capital. He repaired and reopened the Grand Canal and, between 1406 and 1420, directed the construction of the Forbidden City. He was also responsible for the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, considered one of the wonders of the world before its destruction by the Taiping rebels in 1856. As part of his continuing attempt to control the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats, the Yongle Emperor also greatly expanded the imperial examination system in place of his father's use of personal recommendation and appointment. These scholars completed the monumental Yongle Encyclopedia during his reign.\\r\\nThe Yongle Emperor died while personally leading a military campaign against the Mongols. He was buried in the Changling Tomb, the central and largest mausoleum of the Ming Dynasty Tombs located north of Beijing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Yongle Emperor was born Zhu Di (Gﬂß) on 2 May 1360, the fourth son of the new leader of the central Red Turbans, Zhu Yuanzhang. Zhu Yuanzhang would later rise to become the Hongwu Emperor, the first emperor of the Ming dynasty. According to surviving Ming historical records, Zhu Di's mother was the Hongwu Emperor's primary consort, Empress Ma, the view Zhu Di himself maintained. Some contemporaries maintained, however, that Zhu Di's mother was a non-Han Chinese concubine of his father's,[1][3] and that the official records were changed during his reign to list him as a son of the Empress Ma in order to sanction his succession on the \\"death\\" of the Jianwen Emperor.\\r\\nZhu Di grew up as a prince in a loving, caring environment.[citation needed] His father supplied nothing but the best education[citation needed] and, trusting them alone, reestablished the old feudal principalities for his many sons. Zhu Di was created Prince of Yan, a location important for being both the former capital of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and the frontline of battle against Northern Yuan dynasty, a successor state to the Yuan dynasty. When Zhu Di moved to Beiping, he found a city that had been devastated by famine and disease, but he worked with his father's general Xu Da √ø who was also his own father-in-law √ø to continue the pacification of the region. The official Ming histories portray a Zhu Di who impressed his father with his energy, daring, and leadership amid numerous successes; nonetheless, the Ming dynasty suffered numerous reverses during his tenure and the great victory at Buir Lake was won not by Zhu Di but by his brother's partisan Lan Yu. Similarly, when the Hongwu Emperor sent large forces to the north, they were not placed under Zhu Di's command.\\r\\nThe Hongwu Emperor was long-lived and survived his first heir, Zhu Biao, the Crown Prince. He worried about his succession and issued a series of dynastic instructions for his family, the Huang Ming Zu Xun. These instructions made it clear that the rule would pass only to children from the emperor's primary consort, excluding the Prince of Yan in favour of Zhu Yunwen, Zhu Biao's son.[1] When the Hongwu Emperor died on 24 June 1398, Zhu Yunwen succeeded his grandfather as the Jianwen Emperor. In direct violation of the dynastic instructions, the Prince of Yan attempted to mourn his father in Nanjing, bringing a large armed guard with him. The imperial army was able to block him at Huai'an and, given that three of his sons were serving as hostages in the capital, the prince withdrew in disgrace.[1]\\r\\nThe Jianwen Emperor's harsh campaign against his weaker uncles (dubbed ns, lit. \\"Weakening the Marcher Lords\\") made accommodation much more difficult, however: Zhu Di's full brother, Zhu Su (G??), was arrested and exiled to Yunnan; the Prince of Dai Zhu Gui (G) was reduced to a commoner; the Prince of Xiang Zhu Bai (G) committed suicide under duress; the Princes of Qi and Min, Zhu Fu (G?_) and Zhu Bian (G?F) respectively, were demoted all within the later half of 1398 and the first half of 1399. Faced with certain hostility, Zhu Di pretended to fall ill and then \\"went mad\\" for a number of months before achieving his aim of freeing his sons from captivity to visit him in the north in June 1399. On 5 August, Zhu Di declared that the Jianwen Emperor had fallen victim to \\"evil counselors\\" (??) and that the Hongwu Emperor's dynastic instructions obliged him to rise in arms to remove them, a conflict known as the Jingnan Campaign.[1]\\r\\nIn the first year, Zhu Di survived the initial assaults by superior forces under Geng Bingwen (Ôóö\`) and Li Jinglong (??) thanks to superior tactics and capable Mongol auxiliaries. He also issued numerous justifications for his rebellion, including questionable claims to have been the son of Empress Ma and bold-faced lies that his father had attempted to name him as the rightful heir, only to be thwarted by bureaucrats scheming to empower Zhu Biao's son. Whether because of this propaganda or for personal motives, Zhu Di began to receive a steady stream of turncoat eunuchs and generals who provided him with invaluable intelligence allowing a hit-and-run campaign against the imperial supply depots along the Grand Canal. By 1402, he knew enough to be able to avoid the main hosts of the imperial army while sacking Xuzhou, Suzhou, and Yangzhou. The betrayal of Chen Xuan gave him the imperial army's Yangtze River fleet; the betrayal of Li Jinglong and the prince's half-brother Zhu Hui (G?B) opened the gates of Nanjing on 13 July. Amid the disorder, the imperial palace quickly caught fire: Zhu Di enabled his own succession by claiming three bodies √ø charred beyond recognition √ø as the Jianwen emperor, his consort, and their son but rumours circulated for decades that the Jianwen Emperor had escaped in disguise as a Buddhist monk.[1][4][5]\\r\\nHaving captured the capital, Zhu Di now left aside his former arguments about rescuing his nephew from evil counsel and voided the Jianwen Emperor's entire reign, taking 1402 as the 35th year of the Hongwu era.[1] His own brother Zhu Biao, whom the Jianwen Emperor had posthumously elevated to emperor, was now posthumously demoted; Zhu Biao's surviving two sons were demoted to commoners and placed under house arrest; and the Jianwen Emperor's surviving younger son was imprisoned and hidden for the next 55 years. After a brief show of humility where he repeatedly refused offers to take the throne, Zhu Di accepted and proclaimed that the next year would be the first year of the Yongle era. On 17 July 1402, after a brief visit to his father's tomb, Zhu Di was crowned[clarification needed] emperor of the Ming Empire at the age of 42. He would spend most of his early years suppressing rumours and outlaws.\\r\\nWith many scholar-bureaucrats in Nanjing refusing to recognise the legitimacy of his claim to the throne, the Yongle Emperor began a thorough purge of them and their families, including women and children. Other supporters of the Jianwen Emperor's regime were extirpated throughout the country, while a reign of terror was seen due to eunuchs settling scores with the two prior administrations.[2]\\r\\nChinese law had long allowed for the execution of families along with principals: The Classic of History records insubordinate officers being threatened with it as far back as the Shang dynasty. The Hongwu Emperor had fully restored the practice, punishing rebels and traitors with death by a thousand cuts as well as the death of their grandparents, parents, uncles and aunts, siblings by birth or by bond, children, nephews and nieces, grandchildren, and all cohabitants of whatever family,[6][7] although children were sometimes spared and women were sometimes permitted to choose slavery instead. Four of the purged scholars became known as the Four Martyrs, the most famous of whom was Fang Xiaoru, the former tutor to the Jianwen Emperor: threatened with execution of all nine degrees of his kinship, he fatuously replied \\"Never mind nine! Go with ten!\\" and √ø alone in Chinese history √ø he was sentenced to execution of 10 degrees of kinship: along with his entire family, every former student or peer of Fang Xiaoru that the Yongle Emperor's agents could find was also killed. It was said that as he died, cut in half at the waist, Fang used his own blood to write the character  (\\"usurper\\") on the floor and that 872 other people were executed in the ordeal.\\r\\nThe Yongle Emperor followed traditional rituals closely and held many popular beliefs. He did not overindulge in the luxuries of palace life, but still used Buddhism and Buddhist festivals to help calm civil unrest. He stopped the warring between the various Chinese tribes and reorganised the provinces to best provide peace within the Ming Empire. The Yongle Emperor was said to be an \\"ardent Buddhist\\" by Ernst Faber.[8]\\r\\nDue to the stress and overwhelming amount of thinking involved in running a post-rebellion empire, the Yongle Emperor searched for scholars to serve in his government. He had many of the best scholars chosen as candidates and took great care in choosing them, even creating terms by which he hired people. He was also concerned about the degeneration of Buddhism in China.\\r\\nTibetan Buddhism was patronised by Yongle.[9][10]\\r\\nIn 1403, the Yongle Emperor sent messages, gifts, and envoys to Tibet inviting Deshin Shekpa, the fifth Gyalwa Karmapa of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, to visit the imperial capital √ø apparently after having a vision of the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara. After a long journey, Deshin Shekpa arrived in Nanjing on 10 April 1407 riding on an elephant towards the imperial palace, where tens of thousands of monks greeted him.\\r\\nDeshin Shekpa convinced the Yongle Emperor that there were different religions for different people, which does not mean that one is better than the others. The Karmapa was very well received during his visit and a number of miraculous occurrences were reported. He also performed ceremonies for the imperial family. The emperor presented him with 700 measures of silver objects and bestowed the title of 'Precious Religious King, Great Loving One of the West, Mighty Buddha of Peace'.[11]\\r\\nAside from the religious matter, the Yongle Emperor wished to establish an alliance with the Karmapa similar to the one the 13th- and 14th-century Yuan khans had established with the Sakyapa.[12] He apparently offered to send armies to unify Tibet under the Karmapa but Deshin Shekpa demurred, as parts of Tibet were still firmly controlled by partisans of the former Yuan dynasty.[13]\\r\\nDeshin Shekpa left Nanjing on 17 May 1408.[14] In 1410, he returned to Tsurphu where he had his monastery rebuilt following severe damage from an earthquake.\\r\\nWhen it was time for him to choose an heir, the Yongle Emperor wanted to choose his second son, Zhu Gaoxu. Zhu Gaoxu had an athletic-warrior personality which contrasted sharply with his elder brother's intellectual and humanitarian nature. Despite much counsel from his advisers, the Yongle Emperor chose his older son, Zhu Gaozhi (the future Hongxi Emperor), as his heir apparent mainly due to advice from Xie Jin. As a result, Zhu Gaoxu became infuriated and refused to give up jockeying for his father's favour and refusing to move to Yunnan Province, where his princedom was located. He even went so far as to undermine Xie Jin's counsel and eventually killed him.\\r\\nAfter the Yongle Emperor's overthrow of the Jianwen Emperor, China's countryside was devastated. The fragile new economy had to deal with low production and depopulation. The Yongle Emperor laid out a long and extensive plan to strengthen and stabilise the new economy, but first he had to silence dissension. He created an elaborate system of censors to remove corrupt officials from office that spread such rumors. The emperor dispatched some of his most trusted officers to reveal or destroy secret societies, bandits, and loyalists to his other relatives. To strengthen the economy, he fought population decline by reclaiming land, using the most he could from the existing labour force, and maximising textile and agricultural production.\\r\\nThe Yongle Emperor also worked to reclaim production rich regions such as the Lower Yangtze Delta and called for a massive reconstruction of the Grand Canal. During his reign, the Grand Canal was almost completely rebuilt and was eventually moving imported goods from all over the world. The Yongle Emperor's short-term goal was to revitalise northern urban centres, especially his new capital at Beijing. Before the Grand Canal was rebuilt, grain was transferred to Beijing in two ways; one route was simply via the East China Sea, from the port of Liujiagang (near Suzhou); the other was a far more laborious process of transferring the grain from large to small shallow barges (after passing the Huai River and having to cross southwestern Shandong), then transferred back to large river barges on the Yellow River before finally reaching Beijing.[15] With the necessary tribute grain shipments of four million shi (one shi equal to 107 liters) to the north each year, both processes became incredibly inefficient.[15] It was a magistrate of Jining, Shandong who sent a memorandum to the Yongle Emperor protesting the current method of grain shipment, a request that the emperor ultimately granted.[16]\\r\\nThe Yongle Emperor ambitiously planned to move his capital to Beijing. According to a popular legend, the capital was moved when the emperor's advisers brought the emperor to the hills surrounding Nanjing and pointed out the emperor's palace showing the vulnerability of the palace to artillery attack.\\r\\nThe emperor planned to build a massive network of structures in Beijing in which government offices, officials, and the imperial family resided. After a painfully long construction time (1407√ø1420), the Forbidden City was finally completed and became the imperial capital for the next 500 years.\\r\\nThe Yongle Emperor finalised the architectural ensemble of his father's Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum in Nanjing by erecting a monumental \\"Square Pavilion\\" (Sifangcheng) with an eight-metre-tall tortoise-borne stele, extolling the merits and virtues of the Hongwu Emperor. In fact, the Yongle Emperor's original idea for the memorial was to erect an unprecedented stele 73 metres tall. However, due to the impossibility of moving or erecting the giant parts of that monuments, they have been left unfinished in Yangshan Quarry, where they remain to this day.[17]\\r\\nEven though the Hongwu Emperor may have meant for his descendants to be buried near his own Xiaoling Mausoleum (this was how the Hongwu Emperor's heir apparent, Zhu Biao was buried), the Yongle Emperor's relocation of the capital to Beijing necessitated the creation of a new imperial burial ground. On the advice of fengshui experts, the Yongle Emperor chose a site north of Beijing, where he and his successors were to be buried. Over the next two centuries, thirteen emperors in total were laid to rest in the Ming Dynasty Tombs.\\r\\nThe Yongle Emperor sponsored and created many cultural traditions. He promoted Confucianism and kept traditional ritual ceremonies with a rich cultural theme. His respect for classical culture was apparent. He commissioned his Grand Secretary, Xie Jin, to write a compilation of every subject and every known book of the Chinese. The massive project's goal was to preserve Chinese culture and literature in writing. The initial copy took 17 months to transcribe and another copy was transcribed in 1557. The book, named the Yongle Encyclopedia, is still considered one of the most marvellous human achievements in history, despite it being gradually lost by time.\\r\\nThe Yongle Emperor's tolerance of Chinese ideas that did not agree with his own philosophies was well known. He treated Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism equally (though he favoured Confucianism). Strict Confucianists considered him hypocritical, but his even-handed approach helped him win the support of the people and unify China. His love for Chinese culture sparked a sincere hatred for Mongol culture. He considered it rotten and forbade the use of popular Mongol names, habits, language, and clothing. Great lengths were taken by the Yongle Emperor to eradicate Mongol culture from China.[citation needed]\\r\\n The Yongle Emperor called for the construction and repair of Islamic mosques during his reign. Two mosques were built by him, one in Nanjing and the other in Xi'an and they still stand today. Repairs were encouraged and the mosques were not allowed to be converted to any other use.[18][19]\\r\\nMongol invaders were still causing many problems for the Ming Empire. The Yongle Emperor prepared to eliminate this threat. He mounted five military expeditions into the Mongol steppes and crushed the remnants of the Yuan dynasty that had fled north after being defeated by the Hongwu Emperor. He repaired the northern defences and forged buffer alliances to keep the Mongols at bay in order to build an army. His strategy was to force the Mongols into economic dependence on the Chinese and to launch periodic initiatives into Mongolia to cripple their offensive power. He attempted to compel Mongolia to become a Chinese tributary, with all the tribes submitting and proclaiming themselves vassals of the Ming Empire, and wanted to contain and isolate the Mongols. Through fighting, the Yongle Emperor learned to appreciate the importance of cavalry in battle and eventually began spending much of his resources to keep horses in good supply. The emperor spent his entire life fighting the Mongols. Failures and successes came and went, but it should be noted that after the emperor's second personal campaign against the Mongols, the Ming Empire was at peace for over seven years.\\r\\nTang Taizong was cited by Yongle as his model for being familiar with both China and the steppe people.[20]\\r\\nThe \\"Heavenly Qaghan\\" Tang Emperor Taizong was imitated by Yongle as was the Tang's multi-ethnic nature.[21]\\r\\nVietnam was a significant source of difficulties during the Yongle Emperor's reign. In 1406, the emperor responded to several formal petitions from members of the Tr?n dynasty, however on arrival to Vietnam, both the Tr?n prince and the accompanying Chinese ambassador were ambushed and killed. In response to this insult, the Yongle Emperor sent two armies led by Zhang Fu and Mu Sheng to conquer Vietnam. As the Ho royal family were all executed,[22]:112√ø113 Vietnam was integrated as a province of China, just as it had been up until 939. With the Ho monarch defeated in 1407, the Chinese began a serious and sustained effort to sinicise the population. On 2 December 1407, the Yongle Emperor gave orders to Zhang Fu that innocent Vietnamese were not to be harmed, ordering family members of rebels to be spared such as young males if they themselves were not involved in rebellion.[23] Unfortunately for the Chinese, while their efforts to make Vietnam into a normal province was accepted by the Vietnamese in the Red River delta, it was met with resistance from the frontier population among the Trai (Muong) peoples. Several revolts started against the Chinese rulers. In early 1418, L L?i, who founded the L dynasty, started a major rebellion against Ming rule. By the time the Yongle Emperor died in 1424, the Vietnamese rebels under L L?i's leadership had captured nearly the entire province. By 1427, the Xuande Emperor gave up the effort started by his grandfather and formally acknowledged Vietnam's independence on condition they accept vassal status.\\r\\nAs part of his desire to expand Chinese influence throughout the known world, the Yongle Emperor sponsored the massive and long term treasure voyages led by admiral Zheng He. While Chinese ships continued travelling to Japan, Ryukyu, and many locations in Southeast Asia before and after the Yongle Emperor's reign, Zheng He's expeditions were China's only major sea-going explorations of the world (although the Chinese may have been sailing to Arabia, East Africa, and Egypt since the Tang dynasty[25] or earlier). The first expedition was launched in 1405 (18 years before Henry the Navigator began Portugal's voyages of discovery). The expeditions were under the command of Zheng He and his associates (Wang Jinghong, Hong Bao, etc.). Seven expeditions were launched between 1405 and 1433, reaching major trade centres of Asia (as far as Tenavarai (Dondra Head), Hormuz and Aden) and northeastern Africa (Malindi). Some of the ships used were apparently the largest sail-powered wooden ships in human history.[26]\\r\\nThe Chinese expeditions were a remarkable technical and logistical achievement. The Yongle Emperor's successors, the Hongxi and Xuande Emperors, felt that the costly expeditions were harmful to the Ming Empire. The Hongxi Emperor ended further expeditions and the descendants of the Xuande Emperor suppressed much of the information about Zheng He's treasure voyages.\\r\\nOn 30 January 1406, the Yongle Emperor expressed horror when the Ryukyuans castrated some of their own children to become eunuchs to serve in the Ming imperial palace. The emperor said that the boys who were castrated were innocent and did not deserve castration, and he returned the boys to Ryukyu and instructed them not to send eunuchs again.[27]\\r\\nIn 1411, a smaller fleet, built in Jilin and commanded by another eunuch Yishiha, who was a Jurchen, sailed down the Sungari and Amur Rivers. The expedition established a Nurgan Regional Military Commission in the region, headquartered at the place the Chinese called Telin (›õ; now the village of Tyr, Russia). The local Nivkh or Tungusic chiefs were granted ranks in the imperial administration. Yishiha's expeditions returned to the lower Amur several more times during the reigns of the Yongle and Xuande Emperors, the last one visiting the region in the 1430s.[28][29][30]\\r\\nAfter the death of Timur, who intended to invade China, relations between the Ming Empire and Shakhrukh's state in Persia and Transoxania state considerably improved, and the states exchanged large official delegations on a number of occasions. Both the Ming Empire's envoy to Samarkand and Herat, Chen Cheng, and his counterpart, Ghiyasu'd-Din Naqqah, recorded detailed accounts of their visits to each other's states.\\r\\nOne of the Yongle Emperor's consorts was a Jurchen princess, which resulted in many of the eunuchs serving him being of Jurchen origin, notably Yishiha.[31][32]\\r\\nThe Yongle Emperor instituted a Ming governor on Luzon during Zheng He's voyages and appointed Ko-ch'a-lao (›∑; Xu Chailao) to that position in 1405.[33][34] China also had vassals among the leaders in the archipelago.[35][36] China attained ascendancy in trade with the area in the Yongle Emperor's reign.[37] The local rulers on Luzon were \\"confirmed\\" by the governor or \\"high officer\\" appointed by the Yongle Emperor.[38]\\r\\nStates in Luzon,[39][40] Sulu,[38][41] Sumatra,[42] and Brunei[43][44] all established diplomatic relations with the Ming Empire and exchanged envoys and sent tribute to the Yongle Emperor.\\r\\nThe Yongle Emperor exchanged ambassadors with Shahrukh Mirza, sending Chen Cheng to Samarkand and Herat, and Shahrukh sent Ghiyth al-dÿên Naqqsh to Beijing.\\r\\nOn 1 April 1424, the Yongle Emperor launched a large campaign into the Gobi Desert to chase an army of fleeing Oirats. Frustrated at his inability to catch up with his swift opponents, Yongle fell into a deep depression and then into illness, possibly owing to a series of minor strokes.[citation needed] On 12 August 1424, the Yongle Emperor died. He was entombed in Changling (@), a location northwest of Beijing.\\r\\nMany have seen the Yongle Emperor as in a lifelong pursuit of power, prestige, and glory. He respected and worked hard to preserve Chinese culture by designing monuments such as the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, while undermining and expelling from Chinese society people from foreign cultures. He deeply admired and wished to save his father's accomplishments and spent a lot of time proving his claim to the throne. His military accomplishments and leadership are rivaled by only a handful of people in world history. His reign was a mixed blessing for the Chinese populace. The Yongle Emperor's economic, educational, and military reforms provided unprecedented benefits for the people[citation needed], but his despotic style of government set up a spy agency. Despite these negatives, he is considered an architect and keeper of Chinese culture, history, and statecraft and an influential ruler in Chinese history.\\r\\nThe Yongle Emperor may have suffered from undisclosed impotence in his later life. He is remembered very much for his cruelty, just like his father. He killed most of the Jianwen Emperor's palace servants, tortured many of his nephew's loyalists to death, killed or by other means badly treated their relatives.[45][46][47][48] His successor freed most of the survivors.","input":"Who was the third emperor of the ming dynasty?"},{"output":"August 2, 1956","context":"Albert Henry Woolson (February 11, 1850 √ø August 2, 1956) was the last surviving member of the Union Army who served in the American Civil War.

The forage sources for honey bees are an important consideration for beekeepers. In order to determine where to locate hives for maximum honey production and brood one must consider the off-season. If there are no honey flows the bees may have to be fed. Bees that are used for pollination are usually fed in the holding yards. Forage is also significant for pollination management with other bee species. Nectar contains sugars that are the primary source of energy for the bees' wing muscles and for heat for honey bee colonies for winter. Pollen provides the protein and trace minerals that are mostly fed to the brood in order to replace bees lost in the normal course of life cycle and colony activity.\\r\\nAs a rule of thumb the foraging area around a beehive extends for two miles (3?km), although bees have been observed foraging twice and three times this distance from the hive. Experiments have shown that beehives within 4 miles of a food source will gain weight, but beyond that the energy expended is greater than that gained during the foraging flight.[1] Foraging at extreme distances wears out the wings of individual bees, reduces the life expectancy of foraging bees and therefore the efficiency of the colony. The minimum temperature for active honeybee foraging is approximately 55 F (13 C). Full foraging activity is not achieved until the temperature rises to 66 F (19 C). There are small differences in the races of the Western honey bees at what temperature they will start foraging.\\r\\nThe main nectar source and main pollen source differ widely with the latitude, region, season and type of vegetation. Bees are able to communicate direction and distance of a food source by means of the round dance, waggle dance and shaking signals.\\r\\nIn addition to nectar and pollen, honey bees may forage for a honeydew source in certain coniferous trees and on oaks.

The base covers 463,128 acres (1,874.2?km2 / 723.6 sqm).[5]\\r\\nEglin is also one of the few military air bases in the U.S. to have scheduled passenger airline service as the Destin√øFort Walton Beach Airport (VPS) is co-located on the base property.\\r\\nSquadron attached to the 53d Wing but located at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana)\\r\\nThe squadron plans, executes and reports ACC's weapon system evaluation programs for bombers (B-52, B-1 and B-2) and nuclear-capable fighters (F-15E Strike Eagle and F-16). These evaluations include operational effectiveness and suitability, command and control, performance of aircraft hardware and software systems, employment tactics, and accuracy and reliability of associated precision weapons. These weapons include air-launched cruise missiles, standoff missiles, and gravity bombs. Results and conclusions support acquisition decisions and development of war plans. The unit also performs operational testing on new systems and tactics development for the B-52.\\r\\nTenant units at an Air Force installation are units which have a mission that is significantly different than that of the host unit, and rely heavily upon the host unit for day-to-day operations (sewer, power, security, recreation).\\r\\nEglin AFB Auxiliary Field No. 6 (Biancur Field) is the site of Camp James E. Rudder and the home of the U.S. Armys 6th Ranger Training Battalion. The 6th RTB conducts the final phase of the U.S. Army Ranger Course. The entire course is 61 days long and is divided into three phases. Each phase is conducted at different geographical and environmental locations. Its mission at Eglin is to expose Ranger students to a fast-paced field training exercise during an 18-day cycle at Eglin.\\r\\nThe mission of the 20 SCS is to detect, track, identify, and report near earth and deep space objects in earths orbit, and provide space object identification data in support of United States Strategic Commands space control mission. A unit of the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), the men and women of the 20th SCS operate and maintain the AN/FPS-85 radar, the Air Forces only phased-array radar dedicated to tracking earth-orbiting objects.\\r\\nRoyal Netherlands Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation squadron, operates 2 F-35A\\r\\nThis unit, which is apparently not a test squadron at all, operates Boeing C-32Bs in discrete missions for the United States Department of State's Foreign Emergency Support Team.\\r\\nThe 919 SOW, located about five miles (8 kilometers) south of Crestview and 20 miles (32?km) from Eglin main at Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field No. 3 (Duke Field) and is the only special operations wing in the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). In wartime or a contingency, the 919 SOW reports to Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) at Hurlburt Field, Florida, its gaining major command.\\r\\nThe Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center stood up Detachment 2 at Eglin to meet the growing demand to provide realistic operational testing for new and modified weapon systems. Since then, Detachment 2 has partnered with the warfighter and the developmental test community to provide the most thorough and rigorous operational test programs found anywhere in the world.\\r\\nDirectorate of the Joint Staff, JDAT conducts field analysis of C2 information systems and procedures producing decision-quality data to improve Joint C2 integration and interoperability.[8]\\r\\nMuch of the base was part of a National Forest until the outbreak of war in Europe when a proving ground for aircraft armament was established at Eglin. The U.S. Forest Service ceded over 340,000 acres of the Choctawhatchee National Forest to the War Department on 18 October 1940.\\r\\nEglin Air Force Base evolved from the 1933 creation of the Valparaiso Airport, when an arrowhead-shaped parcel of 137 acres (0.55?km2) was cleared for use as an airdrome.[9]\\r\\nIn 1931, personnel of the Air Corps Tactical School, newly relocated to Maxwell Field, Alabama, sought a location for a bombing and gunnery range. They saw the potential of the sparsely populated forested areas surrounding Valparaiso and the vast expanse of the adjacent Gulf of Mexico.\\r\\nFrom October 1941 to October 1945, an AAF Fixed Gunnery School operated at the base, supervised by the 75th Flying Training Wing.\\r\\nAt its peak during World War II, the base employed more than 1,000 officers, 10,000 enlisted personnel and 4,000 civilians.[10]\\r\\nAfter the war, Eglin became a pioneer in developing the techniques for missile launching and handling; and the development of drone or pilotless aircraft beginning with the Republic-Ford JB-2 Loon, an American copy of the V-1. The 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group was activated at Eglin Field, Florida, on 6 February 1946, operating out of Auxiliary Field 3. By March 1950, the 550th Guided Missiles Wing, comprising the 1st and 2nd Guided Missile Squadrons, had replaced the 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group. The 2nd Guided Missile Squadron, SSM, had 62 pilots manning 14 B-17s, three B-29s, and four F-80 Shooting Stars, yellow-tailed drone aircraft used in the role of testing guided missiles.\\r\\nIn December 1955, the Air Munitions Development Laboratory was reassigned from the Wright Air Development Center at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, to the Air Force Armament Center at Eglin by Headquarters Air Research and Development Command. The responsibility for development of guns, bombs, rockets, fuses, guided missile warheads and other related equipment in the armament field was transferred from the Dayton, Ohio facility at this time. Work on nuclear weapons was not included in this mission.[11]\\r\\nThe USAF Special Air Warfare Center was activated 27 April 1962,[12] with the 1st Combat Applications Group (CAG) organized as a combat systems development and test agency under the SAWC. The 1st CAG concentrated on testing and evaluation of primarily short-term projects which might improve Air Force counter-insurgency (COIN) operations. The Special Air Warfare Center, located at Hurlburt Field, undertook to develop tactical air doctrine while training crews for special air warfare in places like Southeast Asia. By mid-1963, SAW groups were in Vietnam and Panama.[13]\\r\\nThe USAF Tactical Air Warfare Center was activated on 1 November 1963. It would be re-designated as the USAF Air Warfare Center on 1 October 1991.[14]\\r\\nWith the increasing U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia in the 1960s, the need for increased emphasis on conventional weapons development made Eglin's mission even more important. On 1 August 1968, the Air Proving Ground Center was redesignated the Armament Development and Test Center to centralize responsibility for research, development, test and evaluation, and initial acquisition of non-nuclear munitions for the Air Force. On 1 October 1979, the Center was given division status. The Armament Division, redesignated Munitions Systems Division on 15 March 1989, placed into production the precision-guided munitions for the laser, television, and infrared guided bombs; two anti-armor weapon systems; and an improved hard target weapon, the GBU-28, used in Operation Desert Storm during the Persian Gulf War. The Division was also responsible for developing the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), an Air Force-led joint project with the U.S. Navy.\\r\\nThe Air Force Armament Museum was founded on base in 1975. In 1981 the original building housing the museum was condemned and the facility closed until 1984.\\r\\nSelected on 27 April 1975, the installation served as one of four main U.S. Vietnamese Refugee Processing Centers operated by the Interagency Task Force for Indochina Refugees, where base personnel housed and processed more than 10,000 Southeast Asian refugees, the first 374 of which arrived on board a Northwest Orient Boeing 747 on 4 May 1975.[15]\\r\\nIn 1978, the USAF Tactical Air Warfare Center assumed responsibility for the USAF Air Ground Operations School. In the same year, the Electronic Warfare Evaluation Program became another one of the USAFTAWC's weapons system evaluation programs, and resulted in the activation of the 4487th Electronic Warfare Aggressor Squadron in 1990.[14]\\r\\nConstruction began in 1984 on the Bob Hope Village, the only retirement facility that caters to enlisted military, opening in February 1985. Residents pay below market value for the 256 independent apartments. Col. Bob Gates, Bob Hope's USO pilot, was key in getting the comedian's support for the undertaking, as well as lending his name and prestige to the project. He was named an honorary board member of the foundation in 1978 and held benefit concerts for nearly two decades.[16][17]\\r\\nDuring a 1992 reorganization, the Air Force disestablished Eglin's parent major command, Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) and merged its functions with the former Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC). The newly created major command from this merger, Air Force Material Command (AFMC), remains Eglin's parent command to this day. The Development Test Center, Eglin's host unit, became part of AFMC on 30 June 1992.[18] The 46th Test Wing replaced the 3246th Test Wing in October 1992.\\r\\nOn 10 August 1994 construction began on the All Conflicts' Veterans War Memorial on the site of the old POW/MIA memorial on the western end of Eglin Boulevard. The memorial was dedicated on 15 August 1995.[19]\\r\\nAs part of the military drawdown in the 1990s, the Air Force inactivated the 33d Fighter Wing's 59th Fighter Squadron on 15 April 1999. The wing lost six aircraft and consolidated the remaining aircraft into the 58th and 60th Fighter Squadrons. Originally selected for inactivation in 1997, Air Force officials delayed the decision in recognition of the Nomads' connection with Khobar Towers. The 59th reactivated as the 59th Test and Evaluation Squadron on 3 December 2004, at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. The 59th falls under the 53rd Test Management Group at Eglin.[20]\\r\\nIn July 2012 the Air Armament Center (AAC) was inactivated. The center had planned, directed and conducted test and evaluation of U.S. and allied air armament, navigation and guidance systems, and commanded and controlled systems. It operated two Air Force installations, providing host support not only to Eglin, but also Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. It had included the Armament Product Directorate (Eglin AFB, FL), the 46th Test Wing (Eglin AFB, FL), the 96th Air Base Wing (Eglin AFB, FL), and the 377th Air Base Wing (Kirtland AFB, NM).\\r\\nInitial construction of a railroad line into the region had been discussed as early as 1927 as part of the Choctawhatchee and Northern Railroad, though military-use proposals didn't come forward until 1941. German POWs were used in clearing and grading the alignment during World War II. There was one commercial customer served by the line, a lumber pulp yard at Niceville which is now community athletic fields. The line was later abandoned in the late 1970s and the southern end, west of State Road 285, lifted by the mid-1980s.\\r\\n** Discontinued 8 March 1946. Not related to later AAF Proving Ground Command[21]\\r\\nA number of auxiliary fields were constructed on the Eglin reservation during World War II, many of which are still in service in various roles, either in support of flight operations or special test activities.\\r\\nEglin employs more than 8,500 civilians and approximately 4,500 military, with an additional 2,200 jobs due to move to Eglin under the 2005 BRAC.\\r\\nAs of the census[39] of 2000, there were 8,082 people, 2,302 households, and 2,262 families residing on the base. The population density was 2,640.1 people per square mile (1,019.8/km2). There were 2,320 housing units at an average density of 757.9/sq?mi (292.7/km2). The racial makeup of the base was 71.8% White, 14.8% Black or African American, 0.5% Native American, 3.0% Asian, 0.4% Pacific Islander, 4.2% from other races, and 5.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 11.2% of the population.\\r\\nThere were 2,302 households out of which 79.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 89.8% were married couples living together, 5.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 1.7% were non-families. 1.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 0.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.50 and the average family size was 3.51.\\r\\nOn the base the population was spread out with 43.5% under the age of 18, 15.2% from 18 to 24, 39.6% from 25 to 44, 1.6% from 45 to 64, and 0.1% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females there were 100.6 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household on the base was $31,951, and the median income for a family was $31,859. Males had a median income of $25,409 versus $19,176 for females. The per capita income for the base was $10,670. About 4.5% of families and 4.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.5% of those under the age of 18 and none of those 65 and older.\\r\\nThere are two U.S. National Historic Landmark Districts with connections to the base: Camp Pinchot and Eglin Field.\\r\\nOn 6 October 1997, the McKinley Climatic Laboratory was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\\r\\nWarm, subtropical weather lasts longer than the average summer. The annual precipitation ranges from 25 inches (640?mm) to 60 inches (1,500?mm). Year-round, the average temperatures run:\\r\\nJanuary √ø March: 60√ø69 High and 42√ø51 Low\\r\\nApril √ø June: 76√ø88 High and 58√ø72 Low\\r\\nJuly √ø September: 86√ø98 High and 70√ø77 Low\\r\\nOctober √ø December: 63√ø79 High and 44√ø69 Low\\r\\nThe area gets only 50 to 60 days of annual precipitation or more rainfall. There are few days without sunshine, which allows year-round outdoor activities.\\r\\nThe forests and shores of Eglin Air Force Base are at the center of one of the most biodiverse locations in North America. Over 50 species threatened in Florida are found on the base, including sea turtles that nest on its white-sand beaches and red-cockaded woodpeckers that thrive in its longleaf pine forests. The base has a natural resources management team that constantly monitors important species within the base with the goal of balancing their national defense mission with environmental stewardship.[41] Longleaf pine forest, a forest type reduced to 5% of its former range in the last few centuries, covers 200,000 acres (810?km2) of the base. Part of this forest, 6,795 acres (27.50?km2), is old growth, making the base home to one of the most extensive old-growth longleaf pine forests in the world.[42]\\r\\nIn order to deal with the high noise levels of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, officials from Santa Rosa, Okaloosa and Walton counties are studying which homes, businesses and public buildings will require additional noise protection.[43]\\r\\nEglin Air Force Base was also a launch site for civil rockets of NASA. There are three launch pads: one at 29.6700 N, 85.3700 W at Cape San Blas; and two on Santa Rosa Island at 30.3800 N, 86.7400 W and 30.3800 N, 86.8170 W. Rockets launched here have included Arcas, Nike Cajun, Nike Apaches, and Nike Iroquois.[44] This site was formerly operated by the 4751st ADMS with CIM-10 Bomarcs, which inactivated in 1979. In the 1940s, captured V-1 flying bombs and American copies, Republic-Ford JB-2 LOONs, were launched out over the Gulf of Mexico from these sites. Two concrete launch ramps were placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. A rusting Loon launch ramp still exists at Auxiliary Field 1, Wagner Field.\\r\\nEglin is known to have been used for 441 launches from 1959 to 1980, reaching up to 686 kilometers altitude.[45]\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from the Air Force Historical Research Agency website http://www.afhra.af.mil/.","input":"Where is eglin air force base located in florida?"},{"output":"18 to 20 January 1788","context":"The First Fleet was the 11 ships that departed from Portsmouth, England, on 13 May 1787 to found the penal colony that became the first European settlement in Australia. The Fleet consisted of two Royal Navy vessels, three store ships and six convict transports, carrying between 1,000 and 1,500 convicts, marines, seamen, civil officers and free people (accounts differ on the numbers), and a large quantity of stores. From England, the Fleet sailed southwest to Rio de Janeiro, then east to Cape Town and via the Great Southern Ocean to Botany Bay, arriving over the period of 18 to 20 January 1788, taking 250 to 252 days from departure to final arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConvicts were originally transported to the Thirteen Colonies in North America, but after the American War of Independence ended in 1783, the newly formed United States refused to accept further convicts.[1] On 6 December 1785, Orders in Council were issued in London for the establishment of a penal colony in New South Wales, on land claimed for Britain by explorer James Cook in his first voyage to the Pacific in 1770.[2][3]\\r\\nThe First Fleet was commanded by Commodore Arthur Phillip, who was given instructions authorising him to make regulations and land grants in the colony.[4] The ships arrived at Botany Bay between 18 January and 20 January 1788:[5] HMS Supply arrived on 18 January, Alexander, Scarborough and Friendship arrived on 19 January, and the remaining ships on 20 January.[6][7]\\r\\nThe cost to Britain of outfitting and despatching the Fleet was S84,000[8] (about S9.6 million as of 2015).[9]\\r\\nThe First Fleet included two Royal Navy escort ships, the ten-gun sixth-rate vessel HMS?Sirius under the command of Captain John Hunter, and the armed tender HMS?Supply commanded by Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball.\\r\\nRopes, crockery, agricultural equipment and a miscellany of other stores were needed. Items transported included tools, agricultural implements, seeds, spirits, medical supplies, bandages, surgical instruments, handcuffs, leg irons and a prefabricated wooden frame for the colony's first Government House.[12] The party had to rely on its own provisions to survive until it could make use of local materials, assuming suitable supplies existed, and grow its own food and raise livestock.\\r\\nScale models of all the ships are on display at the Museum of Sydney. The models were built by ship makers Lynne and Laurie Hadley, after researching the original plans, drawings and British archives. The replicas of the Supply, Charlotte, Scarborough, Friendship, Prince of Wales, Lady Penrhyn, Borrowdale, Alexander, Sirius?(1786), Fishburn and Golden Grove are made from Western Red or Syrian Cedar.[13]\\r\\nNine Sydney harbour ferries built in the mid-1980s are named after First Fleet vessels. The unused names are Lady Penrhyn and Prince of Wales.\\r\\nThe people of the fleet included seamen, marines and their families, government officials, and a large number of convicts, including women and children. The majority were British, but there were also African, American and French convicts on board.[14][15] The convicts had committed a variety of crimes, including theft, perjury, fraud, assault, and robbery, for which they had variously been sentenced to penal transportation for 7 years, 14 years, or the term of their natural life.[16][17]\\r\\nThe six convict transports each had a detachment of marines on board. Most of the families of the marines traveled aboard the Prince of Wales.[18] A number of people on the First Fleet kept diaries and journals of their experiences, including the surgeons. There are twelve known journals in existence as well as some letters.[19]\\r\\nThe exact number of people directly associated with the First Fleet will likely never be established, as accounts of the event vary slightly. A total of 1,420 people have been identified as embarking on the First Fleet in 1787, and 1,373 are believed to have landed at Sydney Cove in January 1788. In her biographical dictionary of the First Fleet, Mollie Gillen gives the following statistics:[20]\\r\\nWhile the names of all crew members of Sirius and Supply are known, the six transports and three storeships may have carried as many as 110 more seamen than have been identified √ø no complete musters have survived for these ships. The total number of persons embarking on the First Fleet would, therefore, be approximately 1,530 with about 1,483 reaching Sydney Cove.\\r\\nOther sources indicate that the passengers consisted of 10 civil officers, 212 marines, including officers, 28 wives and 17 children of the marines, 81 free people, 504 male convicts and 192 female convicts; making the total number of free people 348 and the total number of prisoners 696, coming to a grand total of 1,044 people.\\r\\nAccording to the first census of 1788 as reported by Governor Phillip to Lord Sydney, the white population of the colony was 1,030 and the colony also consisted of 7 horses, 29 sheep, 74 swine, 6 rabbits, and 7 cattle.[21]\\r\\nThe following statistics were provided by Governor Phillip:[22]\\r\\nDavid Collins' book An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales gives the following details:[23]\\r\\nThe Alexander, of 453 tons, had on board 192 male convicts; 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 29 privates, with 1 assistant surgeon to the colony.\\r\\nThe Scarborough, of 418 tons, had on board 205 male convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 26 privates, with 1 assistant surgeon to the colony.\\r\\nThe Charlotte, of 346 tons, had on board 89 male and 20 female convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 3 corporals, 1 drummer, and 35 privates, with the principal surgeon of the colony.\\r\\nThe Lady Penrhyn, of 338 tons, had on board 101 female convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, and 3 privates, with a person acting as a surgeon's mate.\\r\\nThe Prince of Wales, of 334 tons, had on board 2 male and 50 female convicts; 2 lieutenants, 3 sergeants, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 24 privates, with the surveyor-general of the colony.\\r\\nThe Friendship,  of 228 tons, had on board 76 male and 21 female convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 3 corporals, 1 drummer, and 36 privates, with 1 assistant surgeon to the colony.\\r\\nThere were on board, beside these, 28 women, 8 male and 6 female children, belonging to the soldiers of the detachment, together with 6 male and 7 female children belonging to the convicts.\\r\\nThe Fishburn store-ship was of 378 tons; the Borrowdale of 272 tons; and the Golden Grove of 331 tons. Golden Grove carried the chaplain for the colony, with his wife and a servant.\\r\\nNot only these store-ships, but the men of war and transports were laden with provisions, implements of agriculture, camp equipage, clothing for the convicts, baggage, etc.\\r\\nThe Sirius carried as supernumeraries, the major commandant of the corps of marines embarked in the transports* [*This officer was also lieutenant-governor of the colony], the adjutant and quarter-master, the judge-advocate of the settlement, and the commissary; with one sergeant, three drummers, seven privates, four women, and a few artificers.\\r\\nThe chief surgeon for the First Fleet, John White, reported a total of 48 deaths and 28 births during the voyage. The deaths during the voyage included one marine, one marine's wife, one marine's child, 36 male convicts, four female convicts, and five children of convicts.[24]\\r\\nThe First Fleet left Portsmouth, England on 13 May 1787.[25] The journey began with fine weather, and thus the convicts were allowed on deck.[26] The Fleet was accompanied by the armed frigate Hyena until it left English waters.[27] On 20 May 1787, one convict on the Scarborough reported a planned mutiny; those allegedly involved were flogged and two were transferred to Prince of Wales.[27] In general, however, most accounts of the voyage agree that the convicts were well behaved.[27] On 3 June 1787, the fleet anchored at Santa Cruz at Tenerife.[25] Here, fresh water, vegetables and meat were brought on board. Phillip and the chief officers were entertained by the local governor, while one convict tried unsuccessfully to escape.[28] On 10 June they set sail to cross the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro,[25] taking advantage of favourable trade winds and ocean currents.\\r\\nThe weather became increasingly hot and humid as the Fleet sailed through the tropics. Vermin, such as rats, and parasites such as bedbugs, lice, cockroaches and fleas, tormented the convicts, officers and marines. Bilges became foul and the smell, especially below the closed hatches, was over-powering.[29] While Phillip gave orders that the bilge-water was to be pumped out daily and the bilges cleaned, these orders were not followed on the Alexander and a number of convicts fell sick and died.[29] Tropical rainstorms meant that the convicts could not exercise on deck as they had no change of clothes and no method of drying wet clothing.[29] Consequently, they were kept below in the foul, cramped holds. On the female transports, promiscuity between the convicts, the crew and marines was rampant, despite punishments for some of the men involved.[29] In the doldrums, Phillip was forced to ration the water to three pints a day.[29]\\r\\nThe Fleet reached Rio de Janeiro on 5 August and stayed for a month.[25] The ships were cleaned and water taken on board, repairs were made, and Phillip ordered large quantities of food.[26] The women convicts' clothing had become infested with lice and was burnt. As additional clothing for the female convicts had not arrived before the Fleet left England,[26] the women were issued with new clothes made from rice sacks. While the convicts remained below deck, the officers explored the city and were entertained by its inhabitants.[30] A convict and a marine were punished for passing forged quarter-dollars made from old buckles and pewter spoons.\\r\\nThe Fleet left Rio de Janeiro on 4 September to run before the westerlies to the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa, which it reached on 13 October.[31] This was the last port of call, so the main task was to stock up on plants, seeds and livestock for their arrival in Australia.[32] The livestock taken on board from the Cape of Good Hope destined for the new colony included two bulls, seven cows, one stallion, three mares, 44 sheep, 32 pigs, four goats and \\"a very large quantity of poultry of every kind\\".[33] Women convicts on the Friendship were moved to other transports to make room for livestock purchased there. The convicts were provided with fresh beef and mutton, bread and vegetables, to build up their strength for the journey and maintain their health.[32] The Dutch colony of Cape Town was the last outpost of European settlement which the fleet members would see for years, perhaps for the rest of their lives. \\"Before them stretched the awesome, lonely void of the Indian and Southern Oceans, and beyond that lay nothing they could imagine.\\"[34]\\r\\nAssisted by the gales in the \\"Roaring Forties\\" latitudes below the 40th parallel, the heavily laden transports surged through the violent seas. In the last two months of the voyage, the Fleet faced challenging conditions, spending some days becalmed and on others covering significant distances; the Friendship travelled 166 miles one day, while a seaman was blown from the Prince of Wales at night and drowned.[35] Water was rationed as supplies ran low, and the supply of other goods including wine ran out altogether on some vessels.[35] Van Diemen's Land was sighted from the Friendship on 4 January 1788.[35] A freak storm struck as they began to head north around the island, damaging the sails and masts of some of the ships.\\r\\nOn 25 November, Phillip had transferred to the Supply. With Alexander, Friendship and Scarborough, the fastest ships in the Fleet, which were carrying most of the male convicts, the Supply hastened ahead to prepare for the arrival of the rest. Phillip intended to select a suitable location, find good water, clear the ground, and perhaps even have some huts and other structures built before the others arrived. This was a planned move, discussed by the Home Office and the Admiralty prior to the Fleet's departure.[36] However, this \\"flying squadron\\" reached Botany Bay only hours before the rest of the Fleet, so no preparatory work was possible.[37] Supply reached Botany Bay on 18 January 1788; the three fastest transports in the advance group arrived on 19 January; slower ships, including Sirius, arrived on 20 January.[38]\\r\\nThis was one of the world's greatest sea voyages √ø eleven vessels carrying about 1,487 people and stores[33] had travelled for 252 days for more than 15,000 miles (24,000?km) without losing a ship. Forty-eight people died on the journey, a death rate of just over three per cent.\\r\\nIt was soon realised that Botany Bay did not live up to the glowing account that the explorer Captain James Cook had provided.[39] The bay was open and unprotected, the water was too shallow to allow the ships to anchor close to the shore, fresh water was scarce, and the soil was poor.[40] First contact was made with the local indigenous people, the Eora, who seemed curious but suspicious of the newcomers. The area was studded with enormously strong trees. When the convicts tried to cut them down, their tools broke and the tree trunks had to be blasted out of the ground with gunpowder. The primitive huts built for the officers and officials quickly collapsed in rainstorms. The marines had a habit of getting drunk and not guarding the convicts properly, whilst their commander, Major Robert Ross, drove Phillip to despair with his arrogant and lazy attitude. Crucially, Phillip worried that his fledgling colony was exposed to attack from Aborigines or foreign powers. Although his initial instructions were to establish the colony at Botany Bay, he was authorised to establish the colony elsewhere if necessary.[41]\\r\\nOn 21 January, Phillip and a party which included John Hunter, departed the Bay in three small boats to explore other bays to the north.[43] Phillip discovered that Port Jackson, about 12 kilometres to the north, was an excellent site for a colony with sheltered anchorages, fresh water and fertile soil.[43] Cook had seen and named the harbour, but had not entered it.[43] Phillip's impressions of the harbour were recorded in a letter he sent to England later: \\"the finest harbour in the world, in which a thousand sail of the line may ride in the most perfect security ...\\". The party returned to Botany Bay on 23 January.[43]\\r\\nOn the morning of 24 January, the party was startled when two French ships were seen just outside Botany Bay. This was a scientific expedition led by Jean-Fran?ois de La Prouse. The French had expected to find a thriving colony where they could repair ships and restock supplies, not a newly arrived fleet of convicts considerably more poorly provisioned than themselves.[44] There was some cordial contact between the French and British officers, but Phillip and La Prouse never met. The French ships remained until 10 March before setting sail on their return voyage. They were not seen again and were later discovered to have been shipwrecked off the coast of Vanikoro in the present-day Solomon Islands.[45]\\r\\nOn 26 January 1788, the Fleet weighed anchor and sailed to Port Jackson.[25] The site selected for the anchorage had deep water close to the shore, was sheltered, and had a small stream flowing into it. Phillip named it Sydney Cove, after Lord Sydney the British Home Secretary.[43] This date is celebrated as Australia Day, marking the beginning of British settlement.[46] The British flag was planted and formal possession taken. This was done by Phillip and some officers and marines from the Supply, with the remainder of Supply's crew and the convicts observing from on board ship. The remaining ships of the Fleet did not arrive at Sydney Cove until later that day.[47]\\r\\nThe First Fleet encountered indigenous Australians when they landed at Botany Bay. The Cadigal people of the Botany Bay area witnessed the Fleet arrive and six days later the two ships of French explorer La Prouse sailed into the bay.[48] When the Fleet moved to Sydney Cove seeking better conditions for establishing the colony, they encountered the Eora people, including the Bidjigal clan. A number of the First Fleet journals record encounters with Aboriginal people.[49]\\r\\nAlthough the official policy of the British Government was to establish friendly relations with Aboriginal people,[41] and Arthur Phillip ordered that the Aboriginal people should be well treated, it was not long before conflict began. The colonists did not sign treaties with the original inhabitants of the land.[50] Between 1790 and 1810, Pemulwuy of the Bidjigal clan led the local people in a series of attacks against the British colonisers.[51]\\r\\nThe ships of the First Fleet mostly did not remain in the colony. Some returned to England, while others left for other ports. Some remained at the service of the Governor of the colony for some months: some of these were sent to Norfolk Island where a second penal colony was established.\\r\\n1788\\r\\n1789\\r\\n1790:\\r\\nOn 26 January 1842, the Colonial Government in Sydney awarded a life pension of 1 shilling a day to three surviving members of the First Fleet. The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser reported, on Saturday 29 January 1842: \\"The Government have ordered a pension of one shilling per diem to be paid to the survivors of those who came by the first vessel into the Colony. The number of these really 'old hands' is now reduced to three, of whom, two are now in the Benevolent Asylum, and the other is a fine hale old fellow, who can do a day's work with more spirit than many of the young fellows lately arrived in the Colony.\\"[71] The names of the three recipients are not given.\\r\\nWilliam Hubbard: Hubbard was convicted in the Kingston Assizes in Surrey, England, on 24 March 1784 for theft.[72] He was transported to Australia on the Scarborough in the First Fleet. He married Mary Goulding on 19 December 1790 in Rose Hill. In 1803 he received a land grant of 70 acres at Mulgrave Place. He died on 18 May 1843 at the Sydney Benevolent Asylum. His age was given as 76 when he was buried at Christ Church St. Lawrence, Sydney on 22 May 1843.\\r\\nJohn McCarthy: McCarthy was a Marine who sailed on the Friendship.[73] McCarthy was born in Killarney, County Kerry, Ireland, circa Christmas 1745. He first served in the colony of New South Wales, then at Norfolk Island where he took up a land grant of 60 acres (Lot 110). He married the first fleet convict Ann Beardsley on Norfolk Island in November 1791 after his discharge a month earlier. In 1808, on the close of Norfolk Island settlement, he resettled in Van Diemen's Land and later took a land grant (80 acres at Melville) in lieu of the one forfeited on Norfolk Island. The last few years of his life were spent at the home of his granddaughter and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. William H. Budd, at a place called Kinlochewe Inn near Donnybrook, Victoria. McCarthy died on 24 July 1846,[74] six months past his 100 birthday.\\r\\nJohn Limeburner: The South Australian Register reported, in an article dated Wednesday 3 November 1847: \\"John Limeburner, the oldest colonist in Sydney, died in September last, at the advanced age of 104 years. He helped to pitch the first tent in Sydney, and remembered the first display of the British flag there, which was hoisted on a swamp oak-tree, then growing on a spot now occupied as the Water-Police Court. He was the last of those called the 'first-fleeters' (arrivals by the first convict ships) and, notwithstanding his great age, retained his faculties to the last.\\"[75] John Limeburner was a convict on the Charlotte. He was convicted on 9 July 1785 at New Sarum, Wiltshire of theft of a waistcoat, a shirt and stockings.[76] He married Elizabeth Ireland in 1790 at Rosehill and together they establish a 50-acre farm at Prospect.[77] He died at Ashfield in September 1847 and is buried at St John's, Ashfield.\\r\\nJohn Jones: Jones was a Marine on the First Fleet and sailed on the Alexander. He is listed in the N.S.W. 1828 Census as aged 82 and living at the Sydney Benevolent Asylum.[78] He is said to have died at the Benevolent Asylum in 1848.[79]\\r\\nSamuel King: King was a scribbler (a worker in a scribbling mill[80]) before he became a Marine. He was a Marine with the First Fleet on board the flagship Sirius?(1786).[81] He shipped to Norfolk Island on Golden Grove in September 1788, where he lived with Mary Rolt, a convict who arrived with the First Fleet on the Prince of Wales. He received a grant of 60 acres (Lot No. 13) at Cascade Stream in 1791. Mary Rolt returned to England on the Britannia in October 1796. King was resettled in Van Diemen's Land, boarding the City of Edinburgh on 3 September 1808, and landed in Hobart on 3 October.[82] He married Elizabeth Thackery on 28 January 1810. He died on 21 October 1849 at 86 years of age and was buried in the Wesleyan cemetery at Lawitta Road, Back River.\\r\\nJohn Small: Convicted 14 March 1785 at the Devon Lent Assizes held at Exeter for Robbery King's Highway. Sentenced to hang, reprieved to 7 years transportation. Arrived on the Charlotte in First Fleet 1788. Certificate of freedom 1792. Land Grant 1794, 30 acre \\"Small's Farm\\" at Eastern Farms (Ryde). Married October 1788 Mary Parker also a First Fleet convict who arrived on Lady Penrhyn. John Small died on 2 October 1850 at age of 90 years.[83][84]\\r\\nElizabeth Thackery: Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" King (ne Thackery) was tried and convicted of theft on 4 May 1786 at Manchester Quarter Sessions, and sentenced to seven years transportation. She sailed on the Friendship, but was transferred to the Charlotte at the Cape of Good Hope. She was shipped to Norfolk Island on the Sirius?(1786) in 1790 and lived there with James Dodding. In August 1800 she bought 10 acres of land from Samuel King at Cascade Stream. Elizabeth and James were relocated to Van Diemen's Land in December 1807[85] but parted company sometime afterwards. On 28 January 1810 Elizabeth married \\"First Fleeter\\" Private Samuel King (above) and lived with him until his death in 1849. Betty King died in New Norfolk, Tasmania on 7 August 1856, aged 89 years. She is buried in the churchyard of the Methodist Chapel, Lawitta Road, Back River, next to her husband, and the marked grave bears a First Fleet plaque. She was one of the first British women to land in Australia and was the last \\"First Fleeter\\" to die.\\r\\nHistorians have disagreed over whether those aboard the First Fleet were responsible for introducing smallpox to Australia's indigenous population, and if so, whether this was the consequence of deliberate action.\\r\\nIn 1914, J.?H.?L. Cumpston, director of the Australian Quarantine Service put forward the hypothesis that smallpox arrived with British settlers.[86] Some researchers have argued that any such release may have been a deliberate attempt to decimate the indigenous population.[87][88] Others have suggested that live smallpox virus may have been introduced accidentally, when Aboriginal people came into contact with variolous matter brought by the First Fleet for use in anti-smallpox inoculations.[89][90][91] Hypothetical scenarios for such an action might have included: an act of revenge by an aggrieved individual, a response to attacks by indigenous people,[92] or part of an orchestrated assault by the New South Wales Marine Corps, intended to clear the path for colonial expansion.[93][94]\\r\\nOther historians have disputed the idea that there was a deliberate release of smallpox virus and/or suggest that it arrived with visitors to Australia other than the First Fleet.[95][96][97][98][99] In 2002, historian Judy Campbell suggested that smallpox had arrived in Australia through contact with fishermen from Makassar in Indonesia, where smallpox was endemic.[97][100] In 2011, Macknight stated: The overwhelming probability must be that it [smallpox] was introduced, like the later epidemics, by [Indonesian] trepangers ... and spread across the continent to arrive in Sydney quite independently of the new settlement there.[101]\\r\\nThere is a third theory, that the 1789 epidemic was not smallpox but chickenpox √ø to which indigenous Australians also had no inherited resistance √ø that happened to be affecting, or was carried by, members of the First Fleet.[102][103] This theory has also been disputed.[104][105]\\r\\nAfter Ray Collins, a stonemason, completed years of research into the First Fleet, he sought approval from about nine councils to construct a commemorative garden in recognition of these immigrants. Liverpool Plains Shire Council was ultimately the only council to accept his offer to supply the materials and construct the garden free of charge. The site chosen was a disused caravan park on the banks of Quirindi Creek at Wallabadah, New South Wales. In September 2002 Collins commenced work on the project. Additional support was later provided by Neil McGarry in the form of some signs and the council contributed $28,000 for pathways and fencing. Collins hand-chiseled the names of all those who came to Australia on the eleven ships in 1788 on stone tablets along the garden pathways. The stories of those who arrived on the ships, their life, and first encounters with the Australian country are presented throughout the garden.[106] On 26 January 2005, the First Fleet Garden was opened as the major memorial to the First Fleet immigrants. Previously the only other specific memorial to the First Fleeters was an obelisk at Brighton-Le-Sands, New South Wales.[107] The surrounding area has a barbecue, tables, and amenities.","input":"When did the first fleet get to australia?"},{"output":"strategic value","context":"This is a United States territorial acquisitions  and conquests list, beginning with American independence. Note that this list primarily concerns land the United States of America acquired from other nation-states. Early American expansion was tied to a national concept of manifest destiny. \\r\\n\\r\\nControl over North America (1750√ø2008)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1783 Treaty of Paris with Great Britain defined the original borders of the United States. It generally stretched from the Eastern Seaboard to the Mississippi River in the west.  There were ambiguities in the treaty regarding the exact border with Canada to the north that led to disputes that were resolved by the Webster√øAshburton Treaty in 1842.[1]  Beginning in the late 18th century, the new nation organized areas west of the Original thirteen states into several United States territories, setting a template for future expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Louisiana Purchase in 1803, was negotiated with Napoleon during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson; the territory was acquired from France for $15 million (equivalent to $245?million in present-day terms). A small portion of this land was ceded to Britain in 1818 in exchange for the Red River Basin. More of this land was ceded to Spain in 1819 with the Florida Purchase, but was later reacquired through Texas annexation and Mexican Cession.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nWest Florida was declared to be a U.S. possession in 1810 by President James Madison after the territory had declared its independence from Spain.[3] Madison ordered the U.S. Army to take control. Six weeks later, the army entered and occupied the capital, St. Francisville, putting an end to the republic after 74 days of independence. Spain did not relinquish its claim to sovereignty (see West Florida Controversy) until ratification of the Adams√øOns Treaty. General Andrew Jackson personally accepted the delivery of West Florida from its Spanish governor on July 17, 1821.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parts of Rupert's Land and the Red River Colony south of the 49th parallel in the basin of the Red River of the North were acquired in 1818 from Britain under the Anglo-American Convention of 1818.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Adams√øOns Treaty of 1819 with Spain resulted in Spain's cession of East Florida and the Sabine Free State and Spain's surrender of any claims to the Oregon Country. Article III of the treaty, when properly surveyed, resulted in the acquisition of a small part of central Colorado.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nWebster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 with Britain split the disputed territory in Maine and New Brunswick and finalized the border with Canada,[6] including the disputed Indian Stream territory. In 1850 Britain ceded to the U.S. less than one acre of underwater rock (Horseshoe Reef) in Lake Erie near Buffalo for a lighthouse.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nTexas Annexation of 1845: The independent Republic of Texas long sought to join the U.S., despite Mexican claims and the warning by Mexican leader Antonio L‹ápez de Santa Anna that this would be \\"equivalent to a declaration of war against the Mexican Republic.\\" Congress approved the annexation of Texas on February 28, 1845. On December 29, 1845, Texas became the 28th state. Texas had claimed New Mexico east of the Rio Grande but had only made one unsuccessful attempt to occupy it; New Mexico was captured by the U.S. Army in August 1846 and then administered separately from Texas. Mexico acknowledged the loss of territory in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848. Santa Ana (the mexican army leader) had an army of 5,000, while Davy Crockett (the texan army leader) had about 186 people. in the middle of the fight, they ran out of ammo, so they used their guns as clubs. in the end, two children and two women survived.\\r\\n\\r\\nOregon Country, the territory of North America west of the Rockies to the Pacific, was jointly controlled by the U.S. and Britain following the Anglo-American Convention of 1818 until June 15, 1846 when the Oregon Treaty divided the territory at the 49th parallel (see Oregon boundary dispute). The San Juan Islands were claimed and jointly occupied by the U.S. and the U.K. from 1846√ø72 due to ambiguities in the treaty (see Northwestern Boundary Dispute). Arbitration led to the sole U.S. possession of the San Juan Islands since 1872.\\r\\n\\r\\nMexican Cession lands were captured in the Mexican√øAmerican War in 1846√ø48, and ceded by Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, where Mexico agreed to the present Mexico√øUnited States border except for the later Gadsden Purchase. The United States paid $15 million (equivalent to $394?million in present-day terms) and agreed to pay claims made by American citizens against Mexico which amounted to more than $3 million (equivalent to $79?million today).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Gadsden Purchase of 1853, the United States purchased a strip of land along the Mexico√øUnited States border for $10 million (equivalent to $294?million in present-day terms), now in New Mexico and Arizona. The territory was also bought as Americans were passing through the land west to California.  After the American Mexican War, over the dispute of border claims, American bought the land to prevent future conflict.  Few historians would argue the territory was intended for a southern transcontinental railroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlaska Purchase from the Russian Empire for $7.2 million (2 cents per acre)[8] on March 30, 1867 (equivalent to $126?million in present-day terms), as a vital refueling station for ships trading with Asia.

In 1893 business leaders overthrew the Queen of Hawaii and sought annexation. President Grover Cleveland strongly disapproved, so Hawaii set up an independent republic, the Republic of Hawaii. Southern Democrats in Congress strongly opposed a non-white addition. President William McKinley, a Republican, secured a Congressional resolution in 1898, and the small republic joined the U.S. All its citizens became full U.S. citizens. One factor was the need for advanced naval bases to fend off Japanese ambitions.[citation needed] The Hawaiian Islands officially became an incorporated territory of the U.S. in 1900. Following 94% voter approval of the Admission of Hawaii Act, on August 21, 1959 the Territory of Hawaii became the state of Hawaii, the 50th state.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Hawaii came two remote coral atolls: the Palmyra Atoll which had been annexed by the U.S. in 1859, abandoned, then claimed in 1862 by the Kingdom of Hawaii, and the Stewart Islands, which had joined the Kingdom a few years before Palmyra.  At Hawaiian statehood in 1959, Palmyra and arguably the Stewarts were excluded from the new state.  Palmyra remained an incorporated U.S. territory, while the Stewarts were claimed and are now controlled by the Solomon Islands.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nPuerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines (for which the United States compensated Spain $20 million, equivalent to $588?million in present-day terms), were ceded by Spain after the Spanish√øAmerican War in the 1898 Treaty of Paris. Spain relinquished all claim of sovereignty over Cuba, but did not cede it to the United States, so it became a protectorate. All four of these areas were under United States Military Government (USMG) for extended periods. Cuba became an independent nation in 1902, and the Philippines became an independent nation in 1946.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis era also saw the first scattered protests against American imperialism. Noted Americans such as Mark Twain spoke out forcefully against these ventures. Opponents of the war, including Twain and Andrew Carnegie, organized themselves into the American Anti-Imperialist League.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this same period the American people continued to strongly chastise the European powers for their imperialism. The Second Boer War was especially unpopular in the United States and soured Anglo-American relations. The anti-imperialist press would often draw parallels between the U.S. in the Philippines and the British in the Second Boer War.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the 1898 Treaty of Paris, Spain relinquished all claim of sovereignty over and title to Cuba, with the island to be occupied by the United States. Under the Teller Amendment Congress had already decided against annexation. Cuba gained formal independence on 20 May 1902. Under the new Cuban constitution, however, the U.S. retained the right to intervene in Cuban affairs and to supervise its finances and foreign relations through the Platt Amendment;[11] this, however, was later renounced as part of Franklin Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy.[11] Under the Platt Amendment (1901), Cuba also agreed to lease to the U.S. the naval base at Guantnamo Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe naval base occupies land which the United States leased from Cuba in 1903 \\"...?for the time required for the purposes of coaling and naval stations.\\"  The two governments later agreed that, \\"So long as the United States of America shall not abandon the said naval station of Guantanamo or the two Governments shall not agree to a modification of its present limits, the station shall continue to have the territorial area that it now has, with the limits that it has on the date of the signature of the present Treaty.\\"[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 25, 1898, during the Spanish√øAmerican War, Puerto Rico was invaded by the United States with a landing at Gunica. As an outcome of the war, the Jones√øShafroth Act granted all the inhabitants of Puerto Rico U.S. citizenship in 1917. The U.S. granted Puerto Ricans the right to democratically elect their own governor in 1948. In 1950, the Truman Administration allowed for a democratic referendum in Puerto Rico to determine whether Puerto Ricans desired to draft their own local constitution without affecting the unincorporated territory status with the U.S.[14] A local constitution was approved by a Constitutional Convention on February 6, 1952, ratified by the U.S. Congress, approved by President Truman on July 3 of that year, and proclaimed by Gov. Mu?oz Marn on July 25, 1952, the anniversary of the 1898 arrival of U.S. troops. Puerto Rico adopted the name of Estado Libre Asociado (literally translated as \\"Free Associated State\\"), officially translated into English as Commonwealth, for its body politic.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Guam, settlement by foreign ethnic groups was small at first. After World War II showed the strategic value of the island, construction of a huge military base began along with a large influx of people from other parts of the world. Guam today has a very mixed population of 164,000. The indigenous Chamorros make up 37% of the population. The rest of the population consists mostly of white Americans and Filipinos, with smaller groups of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Micronesians, Vietnamese and Indians. Guam today is almost totally Americanized. The situation is somewhat similar to that in Hawaii, but attempts to change Guam's status as an 'unincorporated' U.S. territory have yet to meet with success.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Philippine Revolution against Spain began in April 1896. The Spanish√øAmerican War came to the Philippines on May 1, 1898, when the United States Navy's Asiatic Squadron, commanded by Commodore George Dewey, defeated the Spanish Pacific Squadron under Admiral Patricio Montojo y Pasar‹án during the Battle of Manila Bay. On June 12, Philippine revolutionaries declared independence and establishment of the First Philippine Republic. On December 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris which ended the Spanish√øAmerican War was signed. The treaty transferred control of the Philippines from Spain to the United States. This agreement was not recognized by the Philippine revolutionaries, who declared war against the United States on June 2, 1899.[17] The Philippine√øAmerican War ensued. In 1901, Emilio Aguinaldo, president of the Malolos Republic, was captured and pledged his allegiance to the American government.[18] The U.S. unilaterally declared an end to the conflict in 1902. Scattered fighting continued, however, until 1913.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Philippine Organic Act of 1902 provided for the establishment of a bicameral legislature composed of an upper house consisting of the Philippine Commission, an appointed body with both American and Filipino members. and a popularly elected lower house, the Philippine Assembly. The Philippines became a U.S. colony in the fashion of Europe's New Imperialism,[citation needed] with benevolent colonial practices. English joined Spanish as an official language, and English language education was made compulsory. In 1916, the United States passed the Philippine Autonomy Act and committed itself to granting independence to the Philippines \\"as soon as a stable government can be established therein.\\"[19] As a step to full independence in 1946, partial autonomy as a Commonwealth was granted in 1935.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreparation for a fully sovereign state was interrupted by the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II. The United States suffered a total of 62,514 casualties, including 13,973 deaths in its attempt to liberate the Philippines from Imperial Japanese rule during the hard-fought Philippines campaign from 1944√ø1945. Full independence came with the recognition of Philippine sovereignty by the U.S. in 1946.\\r\\n\\r\\nWake Island was annexed as empty territory by the United States in 1899 (the claim is currently disputed by the Marshall Islands).\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany, the United States, and Britain colonized the Samoan Islands. The nations came into conflict in the Second Samoan Civil War and the nations resolved their issues, establishing American Samoa as per the Treaty of Berlin, 1899. The U.S. took control of its allotted region on June 7, 1900, with the Deed of Cession. Tutuila Island and Aunuu Island were ceded by their chiefs in 1900, then added to American Samoa.  Manua was annexed in 1904, then added to American Samoa.  Swains Island was annexed in 1925 (occupied since 1856), then added to American Samoa. (The claim is currently disputed by Tokelau, a colonial territory of New Zealand.)  American Samoa was under the control of the U.S. Navy from 1900 to 1951. American Samoa was made a formal territory in 1929. From 1951 until 1977, Territorial Governors were appointed by the Secretary of the Interior. Immigration of Americans was never as strong as it was, for instance, in Hawaii; indigenous Samoans make up 89% of the population. The islands have been reluctant to separate from the U.S. in any manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Annexation of Santo Domingo was an attempted treaty during the later Reconstruction Era, initiated by United States President Ulysses S. Grant in 1869, to annex \\"Santo Domingo\\" (as the Dominican Republic was then commonly known) as a United States territory, with the promise of eventual statehood. President Grant feared some European power would take the island in violation of the Monroe Doctrine. He privately thought annexation would be a safety valve for African Americans who were suffering persecution in the US, but he did not include this in his official messages. Grant speculated that the acquisition of Santo Domingo would help bring about the end of slavery in Cuba and elsewhere. Militarily he wanted a US naval port in the Dominican Republic which would also serve as protection for a projected canal across Nicaragua.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 10, 1870 President Grant formally submitted Sec. Fish's Dominican Republic annexation treaty to the U.S. Senate. The treaty was stalled in the Senate until Sen. Sumner's Foreign Relations Committee started hearings in mid February, 1870. On 19 February, a referendum was held in the Dominican Republic, in which nearly 99% of the votes cast were in favor of the annexation. Sec. Fish noted that the Senate was reluctant to pass any measures initiated by the Executive Branch. Sen. Sumner allowed the treaty to be debated openly on the Committee without giving his own opinion. However, on March 15, Senator Sumner's Foreign Relations Committee in a closed session voted to oppose the treaty 5 to 2. On March 24, in another closed session, Sen. Sumner came out strongly against the treaty. Sen. Sumner opposed the treaty believing annexation would be expensive, launch an American empire in the Caribbean, and would diminish independent Afro-Hispanic and African creole republics in the Western Hemisphere. Grant met with many Senators on Capitol Hill hoping to rally support for the Treaty, however, to no avail. Grant refused the suggestion that the treaty drop the Dominican statehood clause. Finally on June 30, 1870 the Senate defeated the Dominican Republic Annexation treaty by a vote of 28 to 28. Eighteen Senators had joined Sen. Sumner to defeat the Dominican annexation treaty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first United States occupation of the Dominican Republic lasted from 1916 to 1924. It was one of the many interventions in Latin America undertaken by the military forces of the United States. On May 13, 1916, Rear Admiral William B. Caperton forced the Dominican Republic's Secretary of War Desiderio Arias, who had seized power from Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra, to leave Santo Domingo by threatening the city with naval bombardment.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the start of the intervention until the US Marines withdrew in 1924, they were in almost continuous actions on both the squad and platoon levels, fighting numerous small-unit actions with elusive guerilla forces. Despite the ability of the Marines to bring a large amount of firepower to bear against the guerillas from both the ground and the air, the occupation troops had their share of problems as well. Sometimes the enemy would successfully ambush a lone Marine patrol, killing all or most of its members, and would scatter before reinforcements arrived on the scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Panama Canal Zone was an unorganized US territory located within the Republic of Panama. It was established under the Hay√øBunau-Varilla Treaty in 1903 and disestablished in 1979 under the Torrijos√øCarter Treaties. Panama gained full control over the Panama Canal in 1999.\\r\\n\\r\\nA referendum on transferring ownership from Denmark to the United States was held on 9 January 1868 on the islands of Sankt Jan and Sankt Thomas, two of three main islands in the Danish West Indies. Of the votes cast, 98% were in favor of the transfer, but it never materialized. A second referendum was held in all three islands on 17 August 1916, once again with overwhelming support for the transfer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1917, the United States purchased the former Danish colony of St. Croix, St. John and St. Thomas, which is now the U.S. Virgin Islands. The United Stateswhich had made an earlier approach in 1902purchased these islands because they feared that the islands might be seized as a submarine base during World War I. After several months of secret negotiations, a sales price of $25 million was agreed. A non-binding referendum in Denmark held in late 1916 confirmed the decision to sell by a wide margin. The U.S. took possession of the islands on March 31, 1917 a few days before the U.S entered the war. The deal was ratified and finalized on January 17, 1917, when the United States and Denmark exchanged their respective treaty ratifications. The territory was renamed the U.S. Virgin Islands.[20] U.S. citizenship was granted to the inhabitants of the islands in 1927.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) was a United Nations trust territory in Micronesia (western Pacific) administered by the United States from July 18, 1947, comprising the former League of Nations Mandate administered by Japan and taken by the U.S. in 1944. The various island groupings in the Trust Territory were later divided up. The Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia achieved independence on October 21, 1986.

The decision to declare war was made by Adolf Hitler, apparently offhand, almost without consultation. Later that day, the United States declared war on Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe course of relations between Germany and the United States had deteriorated since the beginning of World War II, inevitably so given the increasing cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom. The Destroyers for Bases Agreement, Lend-Lease, the Atlantic Charter, the hand-over of military control of Iceland from the United Kingdom to the United States, the extension of the Pan-American Security Zone, and many other results of the special relationship which had developed between the two countries had put a strain on relations between the US, still technically a neutral country, and Nazi Germany. US destroyers escorting American supply vessels bound for the UK were already engaged in a de facto war with German U-Boats.[1] Roosevelt's desire to help the UK, despite the objections of the influential US isolationist lobby, and legal impediments imposed by Congress which prevented direct involvement in the war, brought the US to push hard against the traditional boundaries of neutrality.\\r\\nOn December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched an attack on the US naval and army base on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, beginning a war between Japan and the United States. Japan had not informed its ally, Germany, in advance of the attack, although the Japanese ambassador had informed the German Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, at the beginning of December that relations between the US and the Japanese Empire were at a breaking point, and that war was imminent. He was instructed to ask Germany for commitment to declare war under the terms of the Tripartite Pact should that occur. Hitler and Ribbentrop had been urging Japan to attack and take over Singapore from the British, on the theory that doing so would not only hurt the UK, but would also serve to help keep the US out of the war.[2]\\r\\nAccording to the terms of their agreements, Germany was obliged to come to the aid of Japan if a third country attacked Japan, but not if Japan attacked a third country. Ribbentrop reminded Hitler of this, and pointed out that to declare war against the US would add to the number of enemies Germany was fighting against, but Hitler dismissed this concern as not being important,[2] and, almost entirely without consultation, chose to declare war against the US, wanting to do so before, he thought, Roosevelt would declare war on Germany.[3][4][5]\\r\\nIn fact, Hitler's declaration of war came as a great relief to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who feared the possibility of two parallel but disconnected wars √ø the UK and Soviet Union versus Germany in Europe, and the US and the British Empire versus Japan in the Far East and the Pacific. With Nazi Germany's declaration against the United States in effect, American assistance for Britain in both theaters of war as a full ally was assured. It also simplified matters for the American government, as John Kenneth Galbraith recalled:\\r\\nWhen Pearl Harbor happened, we [Roosevelt's advisors] were desperate. ... We were all in agony. The mood of the American people was obvious √ø they were determined that the Japanese had to be punished. We could have been forced to concentrate all our efforts on the Pacific, unable from then on to give more than purely peripheral help to Britain. It was truly astounding when Hitler declared war on us three days later. I cannot tell you our feelings of triumph. It was a totally irrational thing for him to do, and I think it saved Europe.\\"[6]\\r\\nHitler's reasons for declaring war against the US when he was not obligated to were numerous. One was an emotional response: the Japanese tactic of using a surprise attack without making a declaration of war appealed to him √ø he had done the same thing when he attacked the Soviet Union with Operation Barbarossa in June 1941; indeed, he told the Japanese ambassador \\"[O]ne should strike √ø as hard as possible √ø and not waste time declaring war.\\"[2] Also, the prospect of a worldwide war fed Hitler's tendency towards grandiose thinking, and reinforced his feeling that he was a world-historical figure of destiny. As he said in his declaration speech to the Reichstag:\\r\\nI can only be grateful to Providence that it entrusted me with the leadership in this historic struggle which, for the next five hundred or a thousand years, will be described as decisive, not only for the history of Germany, but for the whole of Europe and indeed the whole world.[2]\\r\\nHitler's lack of knowledge about the US and its industrial and demographic capacity for mounting a war on two fronts also entered into his decision.[2] As early as mid-March 1941 √ø nine months before the Japanese attack √ø President Roosevelt was acutely aware of Hitler's hostility towards the United States, and the destructive potential it presented. Due to this attitude within the White House, and the rapidly progressing efforts of the Americans' industrial capacity before and through 1941 to start providing its armed forces with the ordnance, combat aircraft and ships that would be required to defeat the Axis as a whole, the US was already well on its way towards the full-scale wartime economy which would make it the \\"arsenal of democracy\\" for itself and its allies.\\r\\nFinally, Hitler's deeply-held racial prejudices made him see the US as a decadent bourgeois democracy filled with people of mixed race, a population heavily under the influence of Jews and \\"Negroes\\", with no history of authoritarian discipline to control and direct them, interested only in luxury and living the \\"good life\\" while dancing, drinking and enjoying \\"negrofied\\" music. Such a country, in Hitler's mind, would never be willing to make the economic and human sacrifices necessary to threaten National Socialist Germany[2]  and thus set the stage for a dangerously inaccurate view of the very nation that Hitler had stated in his unpublished Zweites Buch (Second Book, 1928) would be the Third Reich's most serious challenge beyond his intended defeat of the Soviet Union.[7]\\r\\nThe economic potential and racial composition of America had implications for Hitler ideological construct, indeed, how he saw Germanys current problems and future hopes. His central ideas of 'living space' and race held the key to his image of the United States. In the United States' country, with a white 'Nordic' racial core, to which he attributed its economic success and standard of living, he saw a model for his vision of German 'living space' in Europe.[8]\\r\\nThe one advantage of the declaration of war against the US provided for Hitler was as a propaganda diversion for the German public, to distract them from the state of the war against the Soviet Union, in which Germany had suffered severe setbacks and an unexpectedly prolonged engagement. Hitler had assured the German people that the Soviet Union would be crushed well before the onset of winter, but that, in fact, did not happen, and there was little in the way of good news. The timing of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor enabled Hitler to angle his planned speech to the Reichstag in a more positive fashion, squeezing as much propaganda value out of it as possible. Hitler, in fact, put off the speech √ø and the declaration of war √ø for several days, trying to arrive at the proper psychological moment to make the announcement.[9] Still, the propaganda motive was hardly sufficient to justify declaring war on the US, especially considering that doing so would create an otherwise \\"unnatural alliance\\" between two disparate and heretofore antagonistic polities, the United States and the Soviet Union. Joachim C. Fest, one of Hitler's biographers, has argued that Hitler's decision was \\"really no longer an act of his own volition, but a gesture governed by a sudden awareness of his own impotence. That gesture was Hitler's last strategic initiative of any importance.\\"[4]\\r\\nRegardless of Hitler's reasons for the declaration, the decision is generally seen as an enormous strategic blunder on his part, as it allowed the United States to enter the European war in support of the United Kingdom and the Allies without much public opposition, while still facing the Japanese threat in the Pacific. Hitler had, in fact, committed Germany to fight the US while in the midst of a war of extermination against Russia, and without having first defeated the UK, instead of taking the option of putting off a conflict with the US for as long as possible, forcing it to concentrate on the war in the Pacific against Japan, and making it much more difficult for it to become involved in the European war. At least to some extent he had held in his hands the power to control the timing of the intervention of the US, and instead, by declaring war against America, he freed Roosevelt and Churchill to act as they saw fit.[1][4][5][10][11][12][13]\\r\\nFrom the point of view of Hitler and much of the German political and military elite, declaring war against the U.S. in response to the Pearl Harbor attack was a calculated risk in fighting the U.S. before they were prepared to effectively defend themselves. By that time, the German leadership believed that the United States was effectively acting as a belligerent in the conflict, given actions such as Lend-Lease of supplies to Britain to sustain their war effort, President Roosevelt's public statements, the deployment of American soldiers and Marines to Iceland, and U.S. Navy escorts of convoys across the Atlantic, which sometimes came into contact with U-boats; these acts, as well as America's previous intervention in World War I, led to the assumption that war between them was inevitable. As such, the decision was made to use the attack as a rationale for an official declaration of war in order to drive Britain out of the conflict by widening submarine operations and directly attacking U.S. commercial shipping. While Hitler's declaration of war against the United States eventually led to his downfall, initially it seemed successful in its objective of more effectively cutting Britain's supply lines, as the U.S. military's lack of tactics, equipment, and procedures for fighting U-boats caused 1942 to be the most devastating year of the war for shipping losses;[14] the war declaration made the Second Happy Time possible for U-boats.[15]\\r\\nAccording to Hitler's Naval Adjutant, Admiral von Puttkamer, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor actually buoyed Hitler's assurance in winning the war, and improved morale among the high leadership of the armed forces. Peter Padfield writes:\\r\\nThe news [of Pearl Harbor] came as a surprise to Hitler although he knew of their intention to attack somewhere at some time and had made up his mind to support them if they attacked the United States. Now frivolously disregarding the huge financial and productive power of America and, according to ... von Puttkamer, blind to the realization that this power could be projected across the Atlantic, he gained renewed confidence in a victorious outcome to the war. His generals suffered from the same land-locked hallucination: his entire headquarters staff gave themselves up to 'an ecstasy of rejoicing'; the few who saw further 'became even lonelier'. Naval officers saw no more clearly than the generals.[16]\\r\\nOn December 11, 1941, American Charg d'Affaires Leland B. Morris, the highest ranking American diplomat in Germany, was summoned to Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop's office where Ribbentrop read Morris the formal declaration.[17] The text was:\\r\\nMR. CHARGE D'AFFAIRES:\\r\\nThe Government of the United States having violated in the most flagrant manner and in ever increasing measure all rules of neutrality in favor of the adversaries of Germany and having continually been guilty of the most severe provocations toward Germany ever since the outbreak of the European war, provoked by the British declaration of war against Germany on September 3, 1939, has finally resorted to open military acts of aggression.\\r\\nOn September 11, 1941, the President of the United States publicly declared that he had ordered the American Navy and Air Force to shoot on sight at any German war vessel. In his speech of October 27, 1941, he once more expressly affirmed that this order was in force. Acting under this order, vessels of the American Navy, since early September 1941, have systematically attacked German naval forces. Thus, American destroyers, as for instance the Greer, the Kearney and the Reuben James, have opened fire on German submarines according to plan. The Secretary of the American Navy, Mr. Knox, himself confirmed that-American destroyers attacked German submarines.\\r\\nFurthermore, the naval forces of the United States, under order of their Government and contrary to international law have treated and seized German merchant vessels on the high seas as enemy ships.\\r\\nThe German Government therefore establishes the following facts:\\r\\nAlthough Germany on her part has strictly adhered to the rules of international law in her relations with the United States during every period of the present war, the Government of the United States from initial violations of neutrality has finally proceeded to open acts of war against Germany. The Government of the United States has thereby virtually created a state of war.\\r\\nThe German Government, consequently, discontinues diplomatic relations with the United States of America and declares that under these circumstances brought about by President Roosevelt Germany too, as from today, considers herself as being in a state of war with the United States of America.\\r\\nAccept, Mr. Charge d'Affaires, the expression of my high consideration.\\r\\nDecember 11, 1941.\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nBibliography","input":"When did us declare war on germany ww2?"},{"output":"in 1999","context":"","input":"When was the word internet of things coined?"},{"output":"The Great Galveston Hurricane","context":"The Great Galveston Hurricane[1], known regionally as the Great Storm of 1900 [2][3][4], was a Category 4 storm, with winds of up to 145?mph (233?km/h), which made landfall on September 8, 1900, in Galveston, Texas, in the United States. It killed 6,000 to 12,000 people, making it the deadliest hurricane and natural disaster in U.S. history.\\r\\nThe hurricane appears to have started as an atmospheric trough from West Africa, causing unsettled weather in the Caribbean, and emerging into the Florida Straits as a tropical storm on September 5. Owing to contradictory forecasts, the people of Galveston felt no alarm until the official hurricane warning of September 7. The next morning, a storm surge of 15?ft (4.6?m) washed over the long, flat island-city, which was only 8?ft (2.4?m) above sea level, knocking buildings off their foundations and destroying over 3,600 homes.\\r\\nThe disaster ended the Golden Era of Galveston, as the hurricane alarmed potential investors, who turned to Houston instead. The Gulf of Mexico shoreline of Galveston island was subsequently raised by 17?ft (5.2?m) and a 10?mi (16?km) seawall erected.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hurricane of 1900 made landfall on September 8, 1900, in Galveston, Texas, in the United States.[6] It had estimated winds of 145 miles per hour (233?km/h) at landfall, making it a Category 4 storm on the Saffir√øSimpson Hurricane Scale. It was the deadliest hurricane in US history, and the second costliest hurricane in U.S. history based on the dollar's 2005 value (to compare costs with those of Hurricane Katrina and others).\\r\\nThe hurricane caused great loss of life with a death toll of between 6,000 and 12,000?people;[7] the number most cited in official reports is 8,000, giving the storm the third-highest number of deaths or injuries of all Atlantic hurricanes, after the Great Hurricane of 1780 and 1998's Hurricane Mitch. The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 is one of the deadliest natural disasters ever to strike the United States. This loss of life can be attributed to the fact that officials for the Weather Bureau in Galveston brushed off the reports because the city had \\"weathered them all\\" and they didn't realize the threat.[8] The second-deadliest storm to strike the United States, the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane, caused more than 2,500?deaths, and the deadliest storm of recent times, Hurricane Katrina, claimed the lives of approximately 1,800?people.\\r\\nThe hurricane occurred before the practice of assigning official code names to tropical storms was instituted, and thus it is commonly referred to under a variety of descriptive names. Typical names for the storm include the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, the Great Galveston Hurricane, and, especially in older documents, the Galveston Flood. It is often referred to by Galveston locals as the Great Storm or the 1900 Storm.\\r\\nThe storm's origins are unclear, because of the limited observation ability at the end of the 19th century. Ship reports were the only reliable tool for observing hurricanes at sea, and because wireless telegraphy was in its infancy, these reports were not available until the ships put in at a harbor. The 1900 storm, like many powerful Atlantic hurricanes, is believed to have begun as a Cape Verde√øtype hurricanea tropical wave moving off the western coast of Africa. The first formal sighting of the hurricane's precursor occurred on August 27, about 1,000 miles (1,600?km) east of the Windward Islands, when a ship recorded an area of \\"unsettled weather\\". The storm passed through the Leeward Islands on August 30, probably as a tropical depression as indicated by barometric pressure reports from Antigua.[9]\\r\\nThree days later, Antigua reported a severe thunderstorm passing over, followed by the hot, humid calmness that often occurs after the passage of a tropical cyclone. By September 1, U.S. Weather Bureau observers were reporting on a \\"storm of moderate intensity (not a hurricane)\\" southeast of Cuba. Continuing westward, the storm made landfall on southwest Cuba on September 3, dropping heavy rains. On September 5, it emerged into the Florida Straits as a tropical storm or a weak hurricane.[9] The Weather Bureau ignored reports from Cuban meteorologists because they expected the storm to curve northeast along the coast of North America: \\"Assumption became fact as the official government reports stated, wrongly, that the storm was traveling northeast in the Atlantic.\\" However, a region of high pressure had pushed the storm to the west into the Gulf of Mexico.[10]\\r\\nThe storm was reported to be north of Key West on September 6,[11] and in the early morning hours of Friday, September 7, the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans, Louisiana, issued a report of heavy damage along the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts. Details of the storm were not widespread; damage to telegraph lines limited communication.[12] The Weather Bureau's central office in Washington, D.C., ordered storm warnings raised from Pensacola, Florida, to Galveston. By the afternoon of September 7, large swells from the southeast were observed on the Gulf, and clouds at all altitudes began moving in from the northeast. Both of these observations are consistent with a hurricane approaching from the east. The Galveston Weather Bureau office raised its double square flags; a hurricane warning was in effect. The ship Louisiana encountered the hurricane at 1?p.m. that day after departing New Orleans. Captain Halsey estimated wind speeds of 100?mph (160?km/h). These winds correspond to a Category?2 hurricane in the modern-day Saffir√øSimpson Hurricane Scale.[9]\\r\\nBy early afternoon on Saturday, September 8, a steady northeastern wind had picked up. By 5?p.m., the Bureau office was recording sustained hurricane-force winds. That night, the wind direction shifted to the east, and then to the southeast as the hurricane's eye began to pass over the island just west of the city. By 11?p.m., the wind was southerly and diminishing. On Sunday morning, clear skies and a 20?mph (30?km/h) breeze off the Gulf of Mexico greeted the Galveston survivors.[9] The storm continued on, and later tracked into Oklahoma. From there, it continued over the Great Lakes while still sustaining winds of almost 40?mph (as recorded over Milwaukee, Wisconsin) and passed north of Halifax, Nova Scotia, on September 12, 1900.[13] From there it traveled into the North Atlantic where it disappeared from observations,[7] after decimating a schooner fleet fishing off the coast of Newfoundland.\\r\\nAt the end of the 19th century, the city of Galveston, Texas, was a booming town with a population of 36,000?residents.[14] Its position on the natural harbor of Galveston Bay along the Gulf of Mexico made it the center of trade and one of the biggest cities in the state of Texas. With this prosperity came a sense of complacency.[12]\\r\\nA quarter of a century earlier, the nearby town of Indianola on Matagorda Bay was undergoing its own boom and was second to Galveston among Texas port cities. Then in 1875, a powerful hurricane blew through, nearly destroying the town. Indianola was rebuilt, though a second hurricane in 1886 caused residents to simply give up and move elsewhere.[15] Many Galveston residents took the destruction of Indianola as an object lesson on the threat posed by hurricanes. Galveston is built on a low, flat island, little more than a large sandbar along the Gulf Coast. These residents proposed a seawall be constructed to protect the city, but their concerns were dismissed by the majority of the population and the city's government.[16]\\r\\nSince its formal founding in 1839, the city of Galveston had weathered numerous storms, all of which the city survived with ease. Residents believed any future storms would be no worse than previous events.[17] In order to provide an official meteorological statement on the threat of hurricanes, Galveston Weather Bureau section director Isaac Cline wrote an 1891 article in the Galveston Daily News in which he argued not only that a seawall was not needed to protect the city, but also that it would be impossible for a hurricane of significant strength to strike the island.[18] The seawall was not built, and development activities on the island actively increased its vulnerability to storms. Sand dunes along the shore were cut down to fill low areas in the city, removing what little barrier there was to the Gulf of Mexico.[19]\\r\\nOn September 4, the Galveston office of the National Weather Bureau (as it was then called) began receiving warnings from the Bureau's central office in Washington, D.C., that a \\"tropical storm\\" had moved northward over Cuba. The Weather Bureau forecasters had no way of knowing where the storm was or where it was going. At the time, they discouraged the use of terms such as tornado or hurricane to avoid panicking residents in the path of any storm event. Conditions in the Gulf of Mexico were ripe for further strengthening of the storm. The Gulf had seen little cloud cover for several weeks, and the seas were as warm as bathwater, according to one report. For a storm system that feeds off moisture, the Gulf of Mexico was enough to boost the storm from a tropical storm to a hurricane in a matter of days, with further strengthening likely.[9]\\r\\nWeather Bureau forecasters believed the storm would travel northeast and affect the mid-Atlantic coast. \\"To them, the storm appeared to have begun a long turn or 'recurve' that would take it first into Florida, then drive it northeast toward an eventual exit into the Atlantic.\\"[20] Cuban forecasters adamantly disagreed, saying the hurricane would continue west. One Cuban forecaster predicted the hurricane would continue into central Texas near San Antonio. Early the next morning, the swells continued despite only partly cloudy skies. Largely because of the unremarkable weather, few residents heeded the warning. Few people evacuated across Galveston's bridges to the mainland, and the majority of the population was unconcerned by the rain clouds that began rolling in by midmorning.\\r\\nIsaac Cline claimed that he took it upon himself to travel along the beach and other low-lying areas warning people personally of the storm's approach.[21] These reports by Cline and his brother, Galveston meteorologist Joseph L. Cline,[22] have been called into question in recent years, as no other survivors corroborated these accounts. In fact, Cline's role in the disaster is the subject of some controversy. Supporters point to Cline's issuing a hurricane warning without permission from the Bureau's central office;[23] detractors (including author Erik Larson) point to Cline's earlier insistence that a seawall was unnecessary and his belief that an intense hurricane could not strike the island.\\r\\nThe first train to reach Galveston left Houston on the morning of September 8 at 9:45?a.m. It found the tracks washed out, and passengers were forced to transfer to a relief train on parallel tracks to complete their journey. Even then, debris on the track slowed the train's progress to a crawl. The 95 travelers on the train from Beaumont found themselves at the Bolivar Peninsula waiting for the ferry that would carry them, train and all, to the island. When it arrived, the high seas forced the ferry captain to give up on his attempt to dock. The train crew attempted to return the way they had come, but rising water blocked the train's path.[25]\\r\\nTen refugees from the Beaumont train sought shelter at the Point Bolivar lighthouse with 200 residents of Port Bolivar who were already there. The 85 who stayed with the train died when the storm surge overran the tops of the cars.[26]\\r\\nAt the time of the 1900 storm the highest point in the city of Galveston was only 8.7 feet (2.7?m) above sea level.[18] The hurricane brought with it a storm surge of over 15 feet (4.6?m)[28] that washed over the entire island. The surge knocked buildings off their foundations and the surf pounded them to pieces. Over 3,600?homes were destroyed[28] and a wall of debris faced the ocean.[21] The few buildings that survived, mostly solidly built mansions and houses along the Strand District, are today maintained as tourist attractions.\\r\\nThe highest measured wind speed was 100 miles per hour (160?km/h) just after 6?p.m., but the Weather Bureau's anemometer was blown off the building shortly after that measurement was recorded.[18] The eye passed over the city around 8?p.m. Maximum winds were estimated at 120?mph (190?km/h) at the time, though later estimates placed the hurricane at the higher Category?4 classification on the Saffir√øSimpson Hurricane Scale.[29] The lowest recorded barometric pressure was 28.48?inHg (964.4?hPa), considered at the time to be so low as to be obviously in error.[7] Modern estimates later placed the storm's central pressure at 27.49?inHg (930.9?hPa), but this was subsequently adjusted to the storm's official lowest measured central pressure of 27.63?inHg (935.7?hPa).[30]\\r\\nAs severe as the damage to the city's buildings was, the human toll was even greater. Because of the destruction of the bridges to the mainland and the telegraph lines, no word of the city's destruction was able to reach the mainland.[31] At 11?a.m. on September 9, one of the few ships at the Galveston wharfs to survive the storm, the Pherabe, arrived in Texas City on the western side of Galveston Bay. It carried six messengers from the city. When they reached the telegraph office in Houston at 3?a.m. on September 10, a short message was sent to Texas Governor Joseph D. Sayers and U.S. President William McKinley: \\"I have been deputized by the mayor and Citizen's Committee of Galveston to inform you that the city of Galveston is in ruins.\\" The messengers reported an estimated five hundred dead; this was considered to be an exaggeration at the time.[32]\\r\\nThe citizens of Houston knew a powerful storm had blown through and had made ready to provide assistance. Workers set out by rail and ship for the island almost immediately. Rescuers arrived to find the city completely destroyed. It is believed 8,000?people20% of the island's populationhad lost their lives.[33] Estimates range from 6,000 to 12,000.[7] Most had drowned or been crushed as the waves pounded the debris that had been their homes hours earlier. Many survived the storm itself but died after several days being trapped under the wreckage of the city, with rescuers unable to reach them. The rescuers could hear the screams of the survivors as they walked on the debris trying to rescue those they could. A further 30,000 were left homeless.[34]\\r\\nThe dead bodies were so numerous that burying all of them was impossible. The dead were initially weighted down on barges and dumped at sea, but when the gulf currents washed many of the bodies back onto the beach, a new solution was needed.[35] Funeral pyres were set up on the beaches, or wherever dead bodies were found, and burned day and night for several weeks after the storm. The authorities passed out free whiskey to sustain the distraught men conscripted for the gruesome work of collecting and burning the dead.[26] More people were killed in this single storm than the total of those killed in all the tropical cyclones that have struck the United States since. This count is greater than 300 cyclones, as of 2009. The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 remains the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history.[36]\\r\\nThe storm maintained tropical characteristics and Saffir√øSimpson tropical storm-force winds (39√ø50?mph) when it crossed the Upper Midwest, with more than 4 inches (100?mm) of rain being reported over most of the southern third of Wisconsin. Wind created problems all over, including over Lake Michigan, and other areas in the path of the storm had similar problems. (Tropical storms reach Wisconsin and surrounding areas to the east, west, and south once every 50 years on average with others in the 19th century, 1961, and (subject to debate) Hurricane Ike in 2008; tropical depressions hit twice to three times every two years; and subtropical storms and depressions hit equally or more rarely than their tropical counterparts.)[citation needed]\\r\\nThe rapidly moving storm was still exhibiting winds of 65?mph (105?km/h) by the time it reached New York City on September 12, 1900.[37] The New York Times reported that pedestrian-walking became difficult and that one death was attributed to the storm. A sign pole, snapped by wind, landed on a 23-year-old man, crushing his skull and killing him instantly, while two others were knocked unconscious. Awnings and signs on many buildings broke and the canvas roofing at the Fire Department headquarters was blown off.[38]\\r\\nCloser to the waterfront, along the Battery seawall, waves and tides were reported to be some of the highest in recent memory of the fishermen and sailors. Spray and debris were thrown over the wall, making working along the waterfront dangerous. Small craft in New York Harbor were thrown off course and tides and currents in the Hudson River made navigation difficult. In Brooklyn, The New York Times reported that trees were uprooted, signs and similar structures were blown down, and yachts were torn from moorings with some suffering severe damage. Because of the direction of the wind, Coney Island escaped the fury of the storm, though a bathing pavilion at Bath Beach suffered damage from wind and waves.[38]\\r\\nFrom September 12√ø14, the extratropical remnants of the Galveston hurricane affected six Canadian provinces, resulting in severe damage and extensive loss of life. Peak winds reached 50√ø80?mph (80√ø125?km/h) in Toronto. During the storm, a fire broke out at a flour mill in Paris, Ontario, resulting in $350,000 in damage to the mill and 50 other stores and offices. Total crop damage in Ontario alone amounted to $1?million (1900 USD). Maximum rainfall reached 3.9?inches (100?mm) in Perc, Quebec. The majority of loss of life occurred due to numerous shipwrecks off the coast of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island. The overall death toll in Canada is estimated to be between 52 and 232, making this at least the eighth deadliest hurricane to affect Canada. The large discrepancy between the fatality figures is due to the fact that many people were reported missing in Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and later presumed to be dead.[39]\\r\\nIn less than 24 hours the city of Galveston was effectively obliterated. The final death toll is not known with certainty but the most conservative estimate is around 6,000. Most historians believe the loss of life to be in the area of 8,000 with some suggesting as many as 12,000 perished. With the city in ruins and rail lines to the mainland destroyed, the survivors had little to live on until relief arrived.[43]\\r\\nSurvivors set up temporary shelters in surplus U.S. Army tents along the shore. They were so numerous that observers began referring to Galveston as the \\"White City on the Beach\\". Others constructed so-called \\"storm lumber\\" homes, using salvageable material from the debris to build shelter.[44]\\r\\nReporter Winifred Bonfils, a young journalist working for William Randolph Hearst, was the first reporter on the line at the flood's aftermath. She delivered an exclusive set of reports and Hearst sent relief supplies by train.[45]\\r\\nBy September 12, Galveston received its first post-storm mail. The next day, basic water service was restored, and Western Union began providing minimal telegraph service. Within three weeks, cotton was again being shipped out of the port.[28]\\r\\nBefore the Hurricane of 1900, Galveston was considered to be a beautiful and prestigious city and was known as the \\"Ellis Island of the West\\" and the \\"Wall Street of the Southwest\\".[46] However, after the storm, development shifted north to Houston, which was enjoying the benefits of the oil boom. The dredging of the Houston Ship Channel in 1909 and 1914 ended Galveston's hopes of regaining its former status as a major commercial center.[47]\\r\\nTo prevent future storms from causing destruction like that of the 1900 hurricane, many improvements to the island were made. The first 3 miles (4.8?km) of the Galveston Seawall, 17-foot (5?m) high, were built beginning in 1902 under the direction of Henry Martyn Robert. An all-weather bridge was constructed to the mainland to replace the ones destroyed in the storm.\\r\\nThe most dramatic effort to protect the city was its raising. Dredged sand was used to raise the city of Galveston by as much as 17 feet (5.2?m) above its previous elevation. Over 2,100?buildings were raised in the process by the process of pumping sand underneath,[21] including the 3,000-ton St. Patrick's Church. The seawall and raising of the island were jointly named a National Historical Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2001.\\r\\nIn 1915, a storm similar in strength and track to the 1900 hurricane struck Galveston. The 1915 storm brought a 12-ft (4-m) storm surge that tested the new seawall. Although 53?people on Galveston Island lost their lives in the 1915 storm, this was a great reduction from the thousands who died in 1900.[48]\\r\\nThe Galveston city government was reorganized into a commission government, a newly devised structure wherein the government is made of a small group of commissioners, each responsible for one aspect of governance. This was prompted by fears that the existing city council would be unable to handle the problem of rebuilding the city.\\r\\nToday, Galveston is home to a cruise port, two universities, and a major insurance corporation. Homes and other buildings that survived the hurricane have been preserved, and give much of the city a Victorian look. The seawall, since extended to 10 miles (16?km), is now an attraction itself, as hotels and tourist attractions have been built along its length in seeming defiance of future storms.\\r\\nThe last reported survivor of the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, Mrs. Maude Conic of Wharton, Texas, died November 14, 2004, at the claimed age of 116,[49] although the 1910 census and other records indicate she was younger than that.[50]\\r\\nIn historiography, the hurricane and the rebuilding afterward divide what is known as the Golden Era (1875√ø1900) from the Open Era (1920√ø1957) of Galveston. The most important long-term impact of the hurricane was to confirm fears that Galveston was a dangerous place to make major investments in shipping and manufacturing operations; the economy of the Golden Era was no longer possible as investors fled. In 1920, Prohibition and tax law enforcement opened up new opportunities for criminal enterprises related to gambling and bootlegging in the city. Galveston rapidly became a prime resort destination enabled by the open vice businesses on the island. This new entertainment-based economy brought decades-long prosperity to the island.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Galveston Historical Foundation maintains the Texas Seaport Museum at Pier 21 in the port of Galveston. Included in the museum is a documentary titled The Great Storm, that gives a recounting of the 1900 hurricane.[51][52]\\r\\nI remember now that it seemed as if we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea. As we stood there in the sandy street, my mother and I, I wanted to take my mother's hand and hurry her away. I felt as if the sea was going to break over the edge of the bowl and come puring down upon us.","input":"What was the deadliest hurricane in american history?"},{"output":"June 1935","context":"The cane toad in Australia is regarded as an exemplary case of a \\"feral species\\"others being rabbits, foxes, cats, dogs and giant mimosa. Australia's relative isolation prior to European colonisation and the industrial revolutionboth of which dramatically increased traffic and importation of novel speciesallowed development of a complex, interdepending system of ecology, but one which provided no natural predators for many of the species subsequently introduced. The recent, sudden inundation of foreign species has led to severe breakdowns in Australian ecology, after overwhelming proliferation of a number of introduced species for which the continent has no efficient natural predator or parasite, and which displace native speciesin some cases these species are physically destructive to habitat as well. Cane toads have been very successful as an invasive species, having become established in more than 15 countries [1] within the past 150 years. In the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the Australian Government listed the impacts of the cane toad as a \\"key threatening process\\".[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNative to South and mainland Middle America, cane toads were introduced to Australia from Hawaii in June 1935 by the Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations, now the Sugar Research Australia, in an attempt to control the native grey-backed cane beetle (Dermolepida albohirtum) and Frenchi beetle (Lepidiota frenchi).[3] These beetles are native to Australia and they are detrimental to sugar cane crops, which are a major source of income for Australia. Adult cane beetles eat the crop's leaves, but the main problem is the larvae, who feed on the roots. Adult cane beetles have a heavy exoskeleton and their eggs and larva are often buried underground, making them difficult to exterminate. Furthermore, conventional methods of pest control, such as pesticide use, would eradicate harmless species of insects as well, making it an unsatisfactory method.[4] Cane toads were to replace the use of pesticides like arsenic, pitch and copper. The success of using the moth Cactoblastis cactorum in controlling prickly pears in Australia also contributed to hopes for the cane toad.[5]\\r\\nThe cane toads bred immediately in captivity, and by August 1935 more than 102 young toads were released in areas around Cairns, Gordonvale and Innisfail in northern Queensland. More toads were released around Ingham, Ayr, Mackay and Bundaberg. Releases were temporarily limited because of environmental concerns but resumed in other areas after September 1936. Since their release, toads have rapidly multiplied in population and now number over 200 million and have been known to spread diseases affecting local biodiversity.[6] Unfortunately, the introduction of the toads has not only caused large environmental detriment, but there is no evidence that they have affected the cane beetles they were introduced to predate. The toads have steadily expanded their range through Queensland, reaching the border with New South Wales in 1978 and the Northern Territory in 1984. The toads on the western frontier of their advance have evolved larger legs;[7] this is thought to be related to their ability to travel farther. As a consequence of their longer legs, larger bodies, and faster movement, about 10% of the leading edge cane toads have also developed arthritis.[8] It was estimated that cane toads migrate at an average of 40 kilometres (25?miles) per year as of 1994,[9] but new research in 2014 indicated that the migration rate had increased to 60?km per year on the western front.[10]\\r\\nThe long-term effects of toads on the Australian environment are difficult to determine, however some effects include \\"the depletion of native species that die eating cane toads; the poisoning of pets and humans; depletion of native fauna preyed on by cane toads; and reduced prey populations for native insectivores, such as skinks.\\" [11]\\r\\nPrecipitous declines in populations of the northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) have been observed after toads have invaded an area. There are a number of reports of declines in goanna and snake populations after the arrival of toads.[12] For example, local populations of Varanus panoptes dropped by up to 90% when their habitat was invaded by cane toads.[13] The preliminary risk assessment of cane toads in Kakadu National Park stated that the predation of the cane toad by native wildlife is the greatest risk to biodiversity. Other factors, such as competition with native wildlife for resources, and the predation of the cane toad on native wildlife, were considered much lower risk factors[14] but requiring further study.[15] In the Northern Territory, goanna predation on cane toads has been linked to a rise in the amount of undamaged salt water crocodile eggs.[16] Cane toads were present within a few days of the crocodiles hatching in April 2007.[17]\\r\\nNumerous native species have been reported as successfully preying on toads. Some birds, such as the black kite (Milvus migrans),[18] have learned to attack the toad's belly, avoiding the poison-producing glands on the back of the head. Anecdotal reports in the Northern Territory suggest that a native frog, Dahl's aquatic frog (Litoria dahlii), is able to eat the tadpoles and live young of the toad without being affected by the poison that often kills other predators.[19] This may account for slower than expected infestations of toads in certain areas of the Northern Territory, although later research carried out jointly by several Australian Universities casts doubt on these reports.[20] Some snakes species have been reported to have adapted smaller jaws so that they are unable to swallow large cane toads which have large quantities of poison.[21]\\r\\nAnother study, however, notes that the cane toad is adapting to a wider environmental range and may in the future be spreading into habitats currently not available.[22]\\r\\nIn 2009 it was found that the native meat ant is immune to the toad's poison and can successfully prey upon young cane toads. Whereas native frogs and toads have natural reflexes to avoid the meat ants, the cane toads do not tend to try to escape the ants, rather standing still when attacked waiting for the toxin to kill the attacker.[23]\\r\\nNew research has indicated that cane toads predate dung beetles by nestling in cowpats and waiting for the beetles, eating up to 150 in one meal. In areas where cane toads have free access to water in dams, there are 9.6 times fewer dung beetles. This indicates that the cane toad has the potential to economically affect the cattle industry through increased disease in cattle.[24]\\r\\nPredators in Australia are not adapted to their toxin, which is the toad's main defense mechanism. Because of this, toads do not tend to hide and are usually targeted by predators, who then expose themselves to the toxic effects.[25] One study suggests Australian reptiles are greatly threatened by invasion of the cane toad, more so than any other group.[1] Seventy-five species of crocodiles and freshwater turtles were found to be at risk of invasion, and all species studied were found capable of eating a toad large enough to kill them.[1] All freshwater turtles and crocodiles are predicted to share part of their future distribution with the invasive species by 2030.[1] Australias varanids and agamids are also at a great risk.[1] It is reported that one native freshwater turtle species, Myuchelys latisternum (saw-shelled turtle), which ranges along rivers and streams from Cape York Peninsula to northern New South Wales, is one of the few native animals which is a successful predator of cane toads.[26] The larger the animal, or predator, is the better chance they have of survival, as their body weight effectively dilutes the concentration of the toxin in their body. One native species, the Torresian crow, has learned how to kill and eat cane toads without ingesting the poison by flipping it onto its back and using its powerful bill to deliver a lethal blow to the throat where the toad's skin is thinner, giving the crow access to the toad's non-toxic innards.[27] In 2014 researchers found evidence that the Australian dwarf crocodile had learned to eat just the hind legs of cane toads.[28]\\r\\nThere is evidence for native predator species adapting to the presence of the cane toad, through learning or evolutionary selection. However, the initial drop in population is often steep and can reduce biodiversity on a population level. One proposed solution is to use \\"teacher toads\\", or smaller toads which are less likely to kill predators. These toads would allow predators to learn not to eat the toads while mitigating mortality. Some have even proposed adding some chemical to make the toads distasteful to further discourage predation. These efforts have shown some promising results so far.[25]\\r\\nA study to be published in the Ecology journal states that the invasion of cane toads in a case study area caused a trophic cascade over a period of five years. The resident predators, the monitor lizards, ate the cane toads and died, which resulted in a boom in the population of the lizards' typical prey, the crimson finches.[29]\\r\\nRichard Shine is using behavioural conditioning techniques to teach the northern quoll to avoid cane toads.[30]\\r\\nCurrently, most attempts to curtail the invasion of cane toads have been unsuccessful. Many of these strategies involve the physical trapping of toads, but these methods also capture unintended native species.[25] Since the largest selective pressure on cane toads currently is intraspecies competition, these physical removals often only improve the conditions for untrapped toads. Also, since migration is high, any area purged of toads would most likely be reinvaded quickly.\\r\\nMany new ideas have been proposed to control the cane toad population. Some have suggested introducing a native viral or bacterial pest of the toads, but this has potential to once again invade native species. Two similar strategies have been proposed, both of which focus on fecundity. One involves the release of sterile males into the population. These males would compete for resources with other males, while themselves not being able to reproduce. A second strategy would be to insert a gene in female toads which would allow them to only create male offspring. In theory, this would limit the reproductive rates and control the population. It is difficult to determine the efficacy and dangers of these approaches, as these methods have never been attempted, especially on a large scale.[25] In the 1950s, cane toads were used in pregnancy tests.[31]\\r\\nOn 13 June 2012 news reports cited a new research breakthrough regarding cane toad control. Research has confirmed that cane toad tadpoles are attracted to the toxin produced by adults and spawn. Tadpoles are believed to cannibalize toad spawn as a food source. Researchers used cane toad toxin to successfully lure cane toad tadpoles, implying that in controlled areas tadpoles could be captured and eradicated.[32]\\r\\nNew research has indicated that in semi-arid areas where water is scarce the construction of toad proof fences around dams can severely affect toad survival rates by denying their access to water.[33]\\r\\nThe RSPCA has guidelines[34] for the humane culling of cane toads. Inhumane ways include spraying with Dettol, Phenyl and using golf clubs and cricket bats to bludgeon them to death[35], but these are illegal in most states and territories (for NT, QLD and NSW there are no laws against inhumane ways just recommendations).[citation needed] Due to concerns over potential harm to other Australian wildlife species, the use of Dettol as pest control was banned in Western Australia by the Department of Environment and Conservation in 2011.[36]\\r\\nLarge predators like the yellow-spotted monitors and sand goannas are being fed young, small, cane toads by researchers to create a \\"food poisoning\\"-like experience for the predators, in the hope that they will avoid eating adult toads which might kill them.[37]\\r\\nPoisonous sausages containing toad meat are being trialed in the Kimberley (Western Australia) to try to protect native animals from cane toads' deadly impact. The Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation has been working with the University of Sydney to develop baits to train native animals not to eat the toads. By blending bits of toad with a nausea-inducing chemical, the baits train the animals to stay away from the amphibians. Researcher David Pearson says trials run in laboratories and in remote parts of the Kimberley region of WA are looking promising, although the baits will not solve the cane toad problem altogether.[38]\\r\\nThe introduction and subsequent migration of the cane toad in Australia was popularised by the film Cane Toads: An Unnatural History (1988), which tells the tale with a humorous edge and is often shown in Environmental Science courses. Don Spencer, a popular children's entertainer, sang the song \\"Warts 'n' All\\", which was used in the documentary. A longer sequel, Cane Toads: The Conquest, by the same filmmaker, was made in 2010.\\r\\nAttempts have been made to make use of dead cane toads, which can number in the thousands and cause hygiene problems. This includes processing the carcasses into liquid fertilisers.[39] Their skin can be made into leather, and novelty cane-toad purses made of the fore-body and abdomen are sometimes seen (e.g. see accompanying photo).\\r\\nIn Australian states where the cane toad is common, some \\"sports\\" have developed, such as cane toad golf and cane toad cricket, where cane toads are used as balls. In April 2005, Dave Tollner, a Northern Territory Member of Parliament, called for legalisation of attacks on cane toads. This was criticised by many animal and conservation groups who claim freezing is a more humane way to kill cane toads than hitting them with cricket bats.[40] The short film Cane Toad - What happened to Baz? displays an Australian attitude towards the cane toad. This film won the \\"Best Comedy\\" award at the 2003 St Kilda Film Festival.\\r\\nA controversial commercial for Tooheys beer company showed people from New South Wales standing at the New South Wales-Queensland Border with golf clubs and lights, attracting cane toads just so they could hit them back across the border with the golf clubs.[41][42]\\r\\nThe cane toad has been listed by the National Trust of Queensland as a state icon of Queensland, alongside the Great Barrier Reef, and past icons, the Royal Flying Doctor Service and the backyard mango tree (also an introduced species).[43]\\r\\n\\"Cane toad\\" is also a colloquial term for an inhabitant of Queensland, particularly the state's State of Origin rugby league team members and supporters.[44]\\r\\nThe Cane Toad Times was a satirical humour magazine based in Brisbane, Queensland.\\r\\nCane toad races are popular in some towns and pubs. Toads are given humorous names and punters can bid or buy a toad or bet on them like horse racing. It is common for entrants or the winner to have to kiss their toad.[45][46]\\r\\nThe invasive nature of cane toads was referenced in The Simpsons episode \\"Bart vs. Australia\\".[47] It was also parodied in the episode \\"Bart the Mother\\" [48] in which after killing a bird, Bart incubates its eggs, only to discover that they were actually from an invasive lizard which replaces the bird eggs with its own. Concerned about the invasive species, the townspeople try to kill the lizards, but Bart helps them escape. The town realizes that the lizards are the solution to their pigeon problem and thank Bart. When Lisa asks what they will do about their new lizard problem, Principal Skinner tells her that they will deal with that by releasing Chinese needle snakes to kill the lizards, and then snake-eating gorillas to eat the snakes, and finally, the gorillas will freeze to death during the winter.\\r\\nIn the video game Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue, cane toads appear as enemies. They wear spiked collars, have poisonous tongues (in contrast to real world cane toads), are about the size of medium-sized dogs, and will chase Ty down upon seeing him.\\r\\nIn Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn video game, there's a quest titled \\"You Call That a Toad\\", the player has to kill a group of enemies called \\"Cane Toad\\" after local wheat farmers brought these toads from foreign continent to devour the locusts but the cane toads have no natural predators on the new land and have taken over the region, leaving the farmers with no choice but to slay them all.\\r\\nTownsville holds an annual \\"Toad Day Out\\" where the community learn about and catch cane toads, with prizes for the largest toad caught, and the heaviest weight of toads caught. In 2015, 143.6 kilograms of toads were caught.[49] In 2016, a drier year, 92 kilograms of toads were caught.[50]","input":"Where were cane toads first introduced in australia?"},{"output":"March 25, 1983","context":"The moonwalk is a dance move in which the dancer moves backwards while seemingly walking forwards.[1] A popping move, it became popular around the world after Michael Jackson performed the dance move during a performance of \\"Billie Jean\\" on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever on March 25, 1983. This special was broadcast May 16, 1983.[2] It subsequently became his signature move.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn illusion is involved in creating the appearance of the dancer gliding backwards. Initially, the front foot is held flat on the ground, while the back foot is in a tiptoe position. The flat front foot remains on the ground but is slid lightly and smoothly backward past the tip-toe back foot. What is now the front foot is lowered flat, while the back foot is raised into the tiptoe position. These steps are repeated over and over creating the illusion that the dancer is being pulled backwards by an unseen force while trying to walk forward. Variations of this move allow moonwalking to appear to glide forward, sideways, or even in a circle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many recorded instances of the moonwalk; similar steps are reported as far back as 1932, used by Cab Calloway.[5] In 1985, Calloway said that the move was called \\"The Buzz\\" when he and others performed it in the 1930s.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1944, Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien featured something like the move in their performance of \\"Under the Bamboo Tree\\" in Meet Me in St. Louis, though their performance lacks the illusion created by the genuine moonwalk.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1950s, Dick Van Dyke performed a similar variation of the moonwalk and camel walk in his comedy routine called \\"Mailing A Letter On A Windy Corner\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1955, it was recorded in a performance by tap dancer Bill Bailey.

Another early moonwalker was popper and singer Jeffrey Daniel, who moonwalked in a performance of Shalamar's \\"A Night To Remember\\" on Top of the Pops in the UK in 1982[16] and was known to perform backslides in public performances (including weekly Soul Train episodes) as far back as 1974.

India is one of the ten most forest-rich countries of the world along with Russia, Brazil, Canada, United States of America, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Australia, Indonesia and Sudan. Together, India and these countries account for 67 percent of total forest area of the world.[1] India's forest cover grew at 0.20% annually over 1990-2000,[2] and has grown at the rate of 0.7% per year over 2000-2010,[2] after decades where forest degradation was a matter of serious concern.[3]\\r\\nAs of 2010, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates India's forest cover to be about 68 million hectares, or 22% of the country's area[4][5] and by 2015 FAO Global assessment observers the forest cover increasing to 70.68 million hectares occupying 23.8% of the total land area of the country.[6] The 2013 Forest Survey of India states its forest cover increased to 69.8 million hectares by 2012, per satellite measurements; this represents an increase of 5,871 square kilometers of forest cover in 2 years.[7] However, the gains were primarily in northern, central and southern Indian states, while northeastern states witnessed a net loss in forest cover over 2010 to 2012.\\r\\nIn 2002, forestry industry contributed 1.7% to India's GDP.[3] In 2010, the contribution to GDP dropped to 0.9%, largely because of rapid growth of the economy in other sectors and the government's decision to reform and reduce import tariffs to let imports satisfy the growing Indian demand for wood products. India produces a range of processed forest (wood and non-wood) products ranging from wood panel products and wood pulp to make bronze, rattazikistan ware and pern resin. India's paper industry produces over 3,000 metric tonnes annually from more than 400 mills.[3] The furniture and craft industry is another consumer of wood. India's wood-based processing industries consumed about 30 million cubic metres of industrial wood in 2002.[3] India annually consumes an additional 270 million tonnes of fuelwood, 2800 million tonnes of fodder, and about 102 million cubic meter of forest products - valued at about ?27,500 crore (US$4.2?billion) a year. India is one of the world's largest consumer of fuel-wood.[3] India's consumption of fuel-wood is about five times higher than what can be sustainably removed from forests.[3] However, a large percentage of this fuel-wood is grown as biomass remaining from agriculture, and is managed outside forests. Fuel-wood meets about 40% of the energy needs of the country.[3] Around 80% of rural people and 48% of urban people use fuel-wood.[3] Unless India makes major, rapid and sustained effort to expand electricity generation and power plants, the rural and urban poor in India will continue to meet their energy needs through unsustainable destruction of forests and fuel wood consumption. India's dependence on fuel-wood and forestry products as a primary energy source is not only environmentally unsustainable, it is a primary cause of India's near-permanent haze and air pollution.[8][9]\\r\\nForestry in India is more than just about wood and fuel. India has a thriving non-wood forest products industry, which produces latex, gums, resins, essential oils, flavours, fragrances and aroma chemicals, incense sticks, handicrafts, thatching materials and medicinal plants. About 60% of non-wood forest products production is consumed locally. About 50% of the total revenue from the forestry industry in India is in non-wood forest products category.[3] In 2002, non-wood forest products were a source of significant supplemental income to over 400 million people in India, mostly rural.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1840, the British colonial administration promulgated an ordinance called Crown Land (Encroachment) Ordinance. This ordinance targeted forests in Britain's Asian colonies, and vested all forests, wastes, unoccupied and uncultivated lands to the crown. The Imperial Forest Department was established in India in 1864.[10] The British state monopoly over Indian forests was first asserted through the Indian Forest Act of 1865. This law simply established the governments claims over forests. The British colonial administration then enacted a further far-reaching Forest Act of 1878, thereby acquiring the sovereignty of all wastelands which in its definition included all forests. This Act also enabled the administration to demarcate reserved and protected forests. In the former, all local rights were abolished while in the latter some existing rights were accepted as a privilege offered by the British government to the local people which can be taken away if necessary. These colonial laws brought the forests under the centralised sovereignty of the state. Sir Dietrich Brandis, the Inspector General of Forests in India from 1864 to 1883, is regarded as the father not only of modern scientific forestry in India, but also as the \\"father of tropical forestry.\\"[11]\\r\\nAn FAO report claims it was believed in colonial times that the forest is a national resource which should be utilised for the interests of the government. Like coal and gold mines, it was believed that forests belonged to the state for exploitation. Forest areas became a source of revenue. For example, teak was extensively exploited by the British colonial government for ship construction, sal and pine in India for railway sleepers and so on. Forest contracts, such as that of biri pata (leaves of Diospyros melanoxylon), earned so much revenue that it was often used by the people involved in this business as a leverage for political power. These contracts also created forest zamindars (government recognised forest landowners). Additionally, as in Africa, some forests in India were earmarked by the government officials and the rulers with the sole purpose of using them for hunting and sport for the royalty and the colonial officials.[12]\\r\\nIn 1952, the government nationalised the forests which were earlier with the zamindars. India also nationalised most of the forest wood industry and non-wood forest products industry. Over the years, many rules and regulations were introduced by India. In 1980, the Conservation Act was passed, which stipulated that the central permission is required to practice sustainable agro-forestry in a forest area. Violations or lack of permits was made a criminal offense. These nationalisation wave and laws intended to limit deforestation, conserve biodiversity, and save wildlife. However, the intent of these regulations was not matched by reality that followed. Neither investment aimed at sustainable forestry nor knowledge transfer followed once India had nationalised and heavily regulated forestry. Deforestation increased, biodiversity diminished and wildlife dwindled. India's rural population and impoverished families continued to ignore the laws passed in Delhi, and use the forests near them for sustenance.[13]\\r\\nIndia launched its National Forest Policy in 1988. This led to a programme named Joint Forest Management, which proposed that specific villages in association with the forest department will manage specific forest blocks. In particular, the protection of the forests would be the responsibility of the people. By 1992, seventeen states of India participated in Joint Forest Management, bringing about 2 million hectares of forests under protection. The effect of this initiative has been claimed to be positive. The growth rates have been slow through these years.[citation needed]\\r\\nSince 1991, India has reversed the deforestation trend. Specialists of the United Nations report India's forest as well as woodland cover has increased. A 2010 study by the Food and Agriculture Organisation ranks India amongst the 10 countries with the largest forest area coverage in the world (the other nine being Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, United States of America, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Australia, Indonesia and Sudan).[14] India is also one of the top 10 countries with the largest primary forest coverage in the world, according to this study.\\r\\nFrom 1990 to 2000, FAO finds India was the fifth largest gainer in forest coverage in the world; while from 2000 to 2010, FAO considers India as the third largest gainer in forest coverage.[14]\\r\\nSome 500,000 square kilometres, about 17% of India's land area, were regarded as Forest Area in the early 1990s. In FY 1987, however, actual forest cover was 640,000 square kilometres. Some claim, that because more than 50% of this land was barren or bushland, the area under productive forest was actually less than 350,000 square kilometres, or approximately 10% of the country's land area.\\r\\nIndia's 0.6% average annual rate of deforestation for agricultural and non-lumbering land uses in the decade beginning in 1981 was one of the lowest in the world and on a par with Brazil.\\r\\nIndia is a large and diverse country. Its land area includes regions with some of the world's highest rainfall to very dry deserts, coast line to alpine regions, river deltas to tropical islands. The variety and distribution of forest vegetation is large: there are 600 species of hardwoods, including sal (Shorea robusta). India is one of the 17 mega biodiverse regions of the world.[15]\\r\\nIndian forests types include tropical evergreens, tropical deciduous, swamps, mangroves, sub-tropical, montane, scrub, sub-alpine and alpine forests. These forests support a variety of ecosystems with diverse flora and fauna.\\r\\nPrior to the 1980s, India deployed a bureaucratic method to estimate forest coverage. A land was notified as covered under Indian Forest Act, and then officials deemed this land area as recorded forest even if it was devoid of vegetation. By this forest-in-name-only method, the total amount of recorded forest, per official Indian records, was 71.8 million hectares.[16] Any comparison of forest coverage number of a year before 1987 for India, to current forest coverage in India, is thus meaningless; it is just bureaucratic record keeping, with no relation to reality or meaningful comparison.\\r\\nIn the 1980s, space satellites were deployed for remote sensing of real forest cover. Standards were introduced to classify India's forests into the following categories:\\r\\nThe first satellite recorded forest coverage data for India became available in 1987. India and the United States cooperated in 2001, using Landsat MSS with spatial resolution of 80 metres, to get accurate forest distribution data. India thereafter switched to digital image and advanced satellites with 23 metres resolution and software processing of images to get more refined data on forest quantity and forest quality. India now assesses its forest distribution data biennially.\\r\\nThe 2015 forest census data thus obtained and published by the Government of India suggests the five states with largest area under forest cover as the following:[16]\\r\\nAccording to India's 2013 forest survey report, the forest cover in top five states has increased, with the exception of Arunachal Pradesh:[17]\\r\\nIn the 1970s, India declared its long-term strategy for forestry development to compose of three major objectives: to reduce soil erosion and flooding; to supply the growing needs of the domestic wood products industries; and to supply the needs of the rural population for fuelwood, fodder, small timber, and miscellaneous forest produce. To achieve these objectives, the National Commission on Agriculture in 1976 recommended the reorganisation of state forestry departments and advocated the concept of social forestry. The commission itself worked on the first two objectives, emphasising traditional forestry and wildlife activities; in pursuit of the third objective, the commission recommended the establishment of a new kind of unit to develop community forests. Following the leads of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, a number of other states also established community-based forestry agencies that emphasized programmes on farm forestry, timber management, extension forestry, reforestation of degraded forests, and use of forests for recreational purposes.\\r\\nIn the 1980s, such socially responsible forestry was encouraged by state community forestry agencies. They emphasized such projects as planting wood lots on denuded communal cattle-grazing grounds to make villages self-sufficient in fuelwood, to supply timber needed for the construction of village houses, and to provide the wood needed for the repair of farm implements. Both individual farmers and tribal communities were also encouraged to grow trees for profit. For example, in Gujarat, one of the more aggressive states in developing programmes of socioeconomic importance, the forestry department distributed 200 million tree seedlings in 1983. The fast-growing eucalyptus is the main species being planted nationwide, followed by pine and poplar.\\r\\nIn 2002, India set up a National Forest Commission to review and assess India's policy and law, its effect on India's forests, its impact of local forest communities, and to make recommendations to achieve sustainable forest and ecological security in India.[18] The report made over 300 recommendations including the following:\\r\\nIndia's national forest policy expects to invest US$26.7 billion by 2020, to pursue nationwide afforestation coupled with forest conservation, with the goal of increasing India's forest cover from 20% to 33%.[19]\\r\\nDue to faster tribal population growth in forest / tribal areas, naturally available forest resources (NTFP) in a sustainable manner are becoming inadequate for their basic livelihood. Many tribal are giving up their traditional livelihood and taking up farming and cattle rearing in the forest areas causing irreparable damage to forests. The erstwhile protectors of forests are slowly turning into the bane of forests and its wildlife. The government should devise schemes to avert this process and save the dwindling forest area and its flora and fauna. Tribal people have extraordinary understanding of forest flora and fauna which can be productively utilized. All the tribal peoples shall be employed by the government in the expansion and protection of forests and its wildlife till their descendants get educated and diversify into industrial and service sectors.[20]\\r\\nSignificant forest products of India include paper, plywood, sawnwood, timber, poles, pulp and matchwood, fuelwood, sal seeds, tendu leaves, gums and resins, cane and rattan, bamboo, grass and fodder, drugs, spices and condiments, herbs, cosmetics, tannins.\\r\\nIndia is a significant importer of forest products. Logs account for 67% of all wood and wood products imported into India due to local preference for unprocessed wood. This preference is explained by the availability of inexpensive labor and the large number of productive sawmills. In trade year 2008-2009, India imported logs worth $1.14 billion, an increase of about 70% in just 4 years.[21]\\r\\nIndian market for unprocessed wood is mostly fulfilled with imports from Malaysia, Myanmar, C?te d'Ivoire, China and New Zealand.[citation needed]\\r\\nIndia is growing market for partially finished and ready-to-assemble furniture. China and Malaysia account for 60% of this imported furniture market in India followed by Italy, Germany, Singapore, Sri Lanka, the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Indian market is accustomed to teak and other hardwoods that are perceived to be more resistant to termites, decay and are able to withstand the tropical climate. Teak wood is typically seen as a benchmark with respect to grade and prices of other wood species. Major imported wood species are tropical woods such as mahogany, garjan, marianti, and sapeli. Plantation timber includes teak, eucalyptus, and poplar, as well as spruce, pine, and fir. India imports small quantities of temperate hardwoods such as ash, maple, cherry, oak, walnut, beech, etc. as squared logs or as lumber. India is the world's third largest hardwood log importer.\\r\\nIn 2009, India imported 332 million cubic metres of roundwood mostly for fuel wood application, 17.3 million cubic metres of sawnwood and wood-based panels, 7.6 million metric tonnes of paper and paperboard and about 4.5 million metric tonnes of wood and fiber pulp.\\r\\nIndian forests are more than trees and an economic resource. They are home to some of earth's unique flora and fauna.\\r\\nIndian forests represent one of the 12 mega biodiverse regions of the world. India's Western Ghats and Eastern Himalayas are amongst the 32 biodiversity hotspots on earth.\\r\\nIndia is home to 12% of world's recorded flora, some 47000 species of flowering and non-flowering plants.[22] Over 59000 species of insects, 2500 species of fishes, 17000 species of angiosperms live in Indian forests. About 90000 animal species, representing over 7% of earth's recorded faunal species have been found in Indian forests. Over 4000 mammal species are found here. India has one of the richest variety of bird species on earth, hosting about 12.5% of known species of birds. Many of these flora and fauna species are endemic to India.\\r\\nIndian forests and wetlands serve as temporary home to many migrant birds.\\r\\nIndia was, until 1991, one of the largest exporters of wild birds to international bird markets. Most of the birds traded were parakeets and munias. Most of these birds were exported to countries in Europe and the Middle East.[23]\\r\\nIn 1991, India passed a law that banned all trade and trapping of indigenous birds in the country. The passage of the law stopped the legal exports, but illegal trafficking has continued. In 2001, for example, an attempt to smuggle some 10,000 wild birds was discovered, and these birds were confiscated at the Mumbai international airport.\\r\\nAccording to a WWF-India published report, trapping and trading of some 300 species of birds continues in India, representing 25% of known species in the country. Tens of thousands of birds are trapped from the forests of India, and traded every month to serve the demand for bird pets. Another market driver for bird trapping and trade is the segment of Indians who on certain religious occasions, buy birds in captivity and free them as an act of kindness to all living beings of the world. Trappers and traders know of the need for piety in these people, and ensure a reliable supply of wild birds so that they can satisfy their urge to do good.\\r\\nThe trappers, a detailed survey and investigation reveals are primarily tribal communities. The trappers lead a life of poverty and migrate over time. Their primary motivation was economics and the need to financially support their families.[24][25]\\r\\nTrapping and transport of trapped birds from India's forests has high injury and losses, as in other parts of the world. For every bird that reaches the market for a sale, many more die.\\r\\nAbrar Ahmed, the WWF-India and TRAFFIC-India ornithologist, suggests the following as potentially effective means of stopping the harm caused by illegal trading of wild birds in India:[24]\\r\\nThe role of forests in the national economy and in ecology was further emphasized in the 1988 National Forest Policy, which focused on ensuring environmental stability, restoring the ecological balance, and preserving the remaining forests. Other objectives of the policy were meeting the need for fuelwood, fodder, and small timber for rural and tribal people while recognising the need to actively involve local people in the management of forest resources. Also in 1988, the Forest Conservation Act, 1980[26] was amended to facilitate stricter conservation measures. A new target was to increase the forest cover to 33% of India's land area from the then-official estimate of 23%. In June 1990, the central government adopted resolutions that combined forest science with social forestry, that is, taking the sociocultural traditions of the local people into. The cumulative area afforested during the 1951-91 period was nearly 179,000 square kilometres. However, despite large-scale tree planting programmes, forestry is one arena in which India has actually regressed since independence. Annual fellings at about four times the growth rate are a major cause. Widespread pilfering by villagers for firewood and fodder also represents a major decrement. In addition, the 1988 National Forest Policy noted, the forested area has been shrinking as a result of land cleared for farming and development programmes.\\r\\nBetween 1990 and 2010, as evidenced by satellite data, India has reversed the deforestation trend. FAO reports India's rate of forest addition has increased in recent years, and as of 2010, it is the third fastest in the world in increasing forest cover.\\r\\nThe 2009 Indian national forest policy document emphasizes the need to combine India's effort at forest conservation with sustainable forest management.[27] India defines forest management as one where the economic needs of local communities are not ignored, rather forests are sustained while meeting nation's economic needs and local issues through scientific forestry.[19]\\r\\nChipko movement in India started in the 1970s around a dispute on how and who should have a right to harvest forest resources. Although the Chipko movement is now practically non-existent in Uttarakhand, the Indian state of its origin, it remains one of the most frequently deployed examples of an environmental and a people's movement in developing countries such as India. What caused Chipko is now a subject of debate; some neopopulists theorise Chipko as an environmental movement and an attempt to save forests, while others suggest that Chipko movement had nothing to do with eco-conservation, but was driven primarily to demand equal rights to harvest forests by local communities.\\r\\nAccording to one set of writers: Since the early 1970s, as they realised that deforestation threatened not only the ecology but their livelihood in a variety of ways, people have become more interested and involved in conservation. The best known popular activist movement is the Chipko Movement, in which local women under the leadership of Chandi Prasad Bhatt and Sunderlal Bahuguna, decided to fight the government and the vested interests to save trees. The residents declared that they would embraceliterally \\"to stick to\\" (chipkna in Hindi)--trees to prevent cutting of ash trees in their district.[citation needed]\\r\\nAccording to those[28] who critique the ecological awareness and similar theories, Chipko had nothing to do with protecting forests, rather it was an economic struggle using the traditional Indian way of non-violence. These scientists point out that very little is left of the Chipko movements today in its region of origin save for its memory, even though the quality of forests and its use remains a critical issue for India. To explain the cause of Chipko movement, they find that government officials had ignored the subsistence issues of the local communities, who depended on forests for fuel, fodder, fertiliser and sustenance resources. These researchers claim that local interviews and fact finding confirms that local communities had filed complaints requesting the right to commercially exploit the forests around them. Their requests were denied, while permits to fell trees and exploit those same forests were granted to government-favoured non-resident contractors including a sporting company named Symonds. A protest that became Chipko movement followed. The movement grew and Indian government responded by imposing a 15-year ban on felling all trees above 1000 metres in the region directly as a result of the Chipko agitations. This legislation was deeply resented by many communities supporting Chipko because, the regulation further excluded the local people from the forest around them. Opposition to the legislation resulted in so-called 'Ped Katao Andolan' in the same region, a movement to cut the trees down in order to defy the new legislation. The people behind Chipko movement felt that the government did not understand or care about their economic situation.[28]\\r\\nChipko movement, at the very least, suggests that forests in India are an important and integral resource for communities that live within these forests, or survive near the fringes of these forests.\\r\\nA major threat to forests of India are in its northeastern states. From ancient times, the locals have practiced slash-and-burn shifting cultivation to grow food. Locally called Jhum, it supports about 450,000 families in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Assam and Meghalaya.[7] Approximately 15,000 square kilometers of forest land is under jhum cultivation, and just a sixth of this land is actually producing any crop at any given year. The tribal people consider it a tradition, and economic ecosystem. However, the slash and burn causes damage to a dense forest, to soil, to flora and fauna, as well as pollution. The crop yields are very poor with jhum cultivation. Between 2010 and 2012, satellite studies confirmed a net loss of forest cover over these northeastern states.[7] The lost forest includes primary dense forests. There is a concerted effort by the state government officials to educate, incentivize and train jhum dependent families to horticulture and other high value crops, along with an offer of food supply security. Bamboo-based textiles and value added forest products industries are also being encouraged by the local officials.[29] States such as Arunachal Pradesh reported reduction in Jhum cultivation practice in 2013.[30]\\r\\nA 1999 publication claimed that protected forest areas in several parts of India, such as Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Jharkhand, were vulnerable to illegal logging by timber mafias that have coopted or intimidated forestry officials, local politicians, businesses and citizenry.[31][32]\\r\\nDespite these local criminal and corruption issues, satellite data analysis and a 2010 FAO report finds India has added over 4 million hectares of forest cover, a 7% increase, between 1990 and 2010.[14]\\r\\nIn 1969, forestry in India underwent a major change with the passage of the Forest Rights Act, a new legislation that sought to address the needs of forest dwelling communities that resulted from the failure to record their rights over forest land and resources. It also sought to bring in new forms of community conservation.[citation needed]\\r\\nIndian peafowl spotted at Kambalakonda Wildlife Sanctuary in Visakhapatnam\\r\\nChestnut headed bee-eaters, found in Himalayan forests of India\\r\\nHinglajgarh Forest in Madhya Pradesh\\r\\nForest cover of Aravalli range in Rajasthan\\r\\nMahua seeds, a forest product, are a rich oil source, used for skin care, to make soap, veggie butter and fuel oil.\\r\\nTendu leaf, used to make rural cigarettes\\r\\nForests of Kerala near Athirappalli Waterfalls\\r\\nDry Forests in Andhra Pradesh\\r\\nMangrove forests of West Bengal\\r\\nTea plantations of Munnar Kerala amidst its forests\\r\\nForest cover in Lakshadweep\\r\\nforest","input":"How much area is covered by forest in india?"},{"output":"the forms of slavery","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crisis of the Roman Republic refers to an extended period of political instability and social unrest that culminated in the demise of the Roman Republic and the advent of the Roman Empire, from about 134 BC to 44 BC.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact dates of the Crisis are unclear because \\"Rome teetered between normality and crisis\\" for many decades.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nLikewise, the causes and attributes of the crises changed throughout the decades, including the forms of slavery, brigandage, wars internal and external, land reform, the invention of excruciating new punishments,[2] the expansion of Roman citizenship, and even the changing composition of the Roman army.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern scholars also disagree about the nature of the crisis.  Traditionally, the expansion of citizenship (with all its rights, privileges, and duties) was looked upon negatively by Sallust, Gibbon, and others of their schools, because it caused internal dissension, disputes with Rome's Italian allies, slave revolts, and riots.[4]  However, other scholars have argued that as the Republic was meant to be res publicathe essential thing of the peoplethe poor and disenfranchised can not be blamed for trying to redress their legitimate and legal grievances.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor centuries, historians have argued about the start, specific crises involved, and end date for the Crisis of the Roman Republic.  As a culture (or \\"web of institutions\\"), Florence Dupont and Christopher Woodall wrote, \\"no distinction is made between different periods.\\"[5]  However, without question, the Romans lost liberty through plunder, by \\"their morally undermining consequences.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nHarriet I. Flower and Jurgen Von Ungern-Sternberg argue for an exact start date of 10 December 134 BC, with the inauguration of Tiberius Gracchus as tribune,[7] or alternately, when he first issued his proposal for land reform in 133 BC.[8] Appian of Alexandria wrote that this political crisis was \\"the preface to?... the Roman civil wars\\".[9] Velleius commented that it was Gracchus' unprecedented standing for re-election as tribune in 133 BC, and the riots and controversy it engendered, which started the crisis:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the beginning of civil bloodshed and of the free reign [sic] of swords in the city of Rome.  From then on justice was overthrown by force and the strongest was preeminent. \\r\\nIn any case, the assassination of Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC marked \\"a turning point in Roman history and the beginning of the crisis of the Roman Republic.\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbette S. Spaeth specifically refers to \\"the Gracchan crisis at the beginning of the Late Roman Republic?...\\".[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nNic Fields, in his popular history of Spartacus, argues for a start date of 135 BC with the beginning of the First Servile War in Sicily.[13]  Fields asserts:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rebellion of the slaves in Italy under Spartacus may have been the best organized, but it was not the first of its kind.  There had been other rebellions of slaves that afflicted Rome, and we may assume that Spartacus was wise enough to profit by their mistakes.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe start of the Social War (91√ø88 BC), when Rome's nearby Italian allies rebelled against her rule, may be thought of as the beginning of the end of the Republic.[15][16]  Fields also suggests that things got much worse with the Samnite engagement at the Battle of the Colline Gate in 82 BC, the climax of the war between Sulla and the supporters of Gaius Marius.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nBarry Strauss argues that the crisis really started with \\"The Spartacus War\\" in 73 BC, adding that, because the dangers were unappreciated, \\"Rome faced the crisis with mediocrities\\".[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThornton Wilder, in his novel, The Ides of March, focuses on the period c. 69 BC to 44 BC as the Crisis.  Pollio and Ronald Syme date the Crisis only from the time of Julius Caesar in 60 BC.[19]  Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon river, the northern boundary of Roman Italy, with his army in 49 BC, a flagrant violation of Roman law, has become the clichd point of no return for the Republic, as noted in many books, including Tom Holland's Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end of the Crisis can likewise either be dated from the assassination of Julius Caesar on 15 March 44 BC, after he and Sulla had done so much \\"to dismantle the government of the Republic,\\"[21] or alternately when Octavian was granted the title of Augustus by the Senate in 27 BC, marking the beginning of the Roman Empire.[22]  The end could also be dated earlier, to the time of the constitutional reforms of Julius Caesar in 49 BC.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nTiberius Gracchus took office as a tribune of the plebs in late 134 BC while \\"everything in the Roman Republic seemed to be in fine working order.\\"[23]  There were a few apparently minor problems, such as \\"the annoyance of a slave revolt in Sicily\\"[24] (the First Servile War).\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, Roman society was a highly stratified class system whose divisions were bubbling below the surface. This system consisted of noble families of the senatorial rank, the knight or equestrian class, citizens (grouped into two or three classes depending on the time period - self-governing allies of Rome, landowners, and plebs or tenant freemen), non-citizens who lived outside of southwestern Italy, and at the bottom, slaves.  By law, only men who were citizens could vote in certain assemblies, and only those men who owned a certain amount of real property could serve in the military, which would gain them social prestige and additional benefits of citizenship.[25]  The government owned large tracts of farmland (ager publicus) that it had gained through conquest or escheat (acquisition from owners who had died without heirs); this it rented out to large landholders who used their slaves to till it or who sub-leased it to small tenant farmers.[26]  There was some social mobility and limited suffrage.[27]  The plebs (or plebeians) were a socio-economic class, but also had possible origins as an ethnic group with its own cult to the goddess Ceres, and ultimately, were a political party during much of the Roman Republic.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 133 BC, Gracchus tried to redress the grievances of displaced smallholders. He bypassed the Roman senate and used the plebeian assembly to pass a law limiting the amount of land belonging to the state that any individual could farm.[29]  This would have resulted in the breakup of the large plantations maintained by the rich on public land and worked by slaves.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nGracchus' moderate plan of agrarian reform was motivated \\"to increase the number of Roman citizens who owned land and consequently the number who would qualify as soldiers according to their census rating.\\"[29]  The plan included a method to quiet title, and had a goal of increasing the efficiency of farmland, while doling out small parcels of land to tenant farmers, his populist constituency.[29]  Gracchus used  a law that had been in place for over a century, the lex Hortensia of 287 BC, which allowed the assembly of plebs to bypass the Senate.[29]  However, another tribune, Marcus Octavius, used his veto to scuttle the plan. It was widely believed that the rich Senators had bribed Octavius to veto the proposal.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crisis escalated: Gracchus pushed the assembly to impeach and remove Octavius; the Senate denied funds to the commission needed for land reform; Gracchus then tried to use money out of a trust fund left by Attalus III of Pergamum; and the Senate blocked that, too.[30]  At one point, Gracchus had \\"one of his freedmen... drag Octavius from the speaker's platform.\\"[31]  This assault violated the Lex sacrata, which prohibited people of lower status from violating the person of a person of higher class.[31]  Rome's unwritten constitution hampered reform.[29]  So Gracchus sought re-election to his one-year term, which was unprecedented in an era of strict term limits.[32]  The oligarchic nobles responded by murdering Gracchus.[33][34] Because Gracchus had been highly popular with the poor, and he had been murdered while working on their behalf, mass riots broke out in the city in reaction to the assassination.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbette Stanley Spaeth asserts that Ceres' roles as (a) patron and protector of plebeian laws, rights and Tribunes and (b) \\"normative/liminal\\" crimes, continued throughout the Republican era.[12]  These roles were \\"exploited for the purposes of political propaganda during the Gracchan crisis....\\"[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nCeres' Aventine Temple served the plebeians as cult centre, legal archive, treasury, and court of law, founded contemporaneously with the passage of the Lex sacrata;[12] the lives and property of those who violated this law were forfeit to Ceres, whose judgment was expressed by her aediles.[36]  The official decrees of the Senate (senatus consulta) were placed in her Temple, under her guardianship; Livy bluntly states this was done so that the consuls could no longer arbitrarily tamper with the laws of Rome.[37] The Temple might also have offered asylum for those threatened with arbitrary arrest by patrician magistrates.[38]  Ceres was thus the patron goddess of Rome's written laws; the poet Vergil later calls her legifera Ceres (Law-bearing Ceres), a translation of Demeter's Greek epithet, thesmophoros.[39]  Those who approved the murder of Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC justified his death as punishment for his offense against the Lex sacrata of the goddess Ceres: those who deplored this as murder appealed to Gracchus' sacrosanct status as tribune under Ceres' protection.[12] In 70 BC, Cicero refers to this killing in connection with Ceres' laws and cults.[12][40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpaeth believed that he was killed because:\\r\\n\\r\\nTiberius Gracchus had transgressed the laws that protected the equilibrium of the social and political order, the laws on the tribunician sacrosanctitas and attempted tyranny, and hence was subject to the punishment they prescribed, consecration of his goods and person [to Ceres].\\r\\nRather than attempting to atone for the murder, the Senate used a mission to Ceres' temple at Henna (in Sicily) to justify his execution.[42]\\r\\nThe agrarian reforms were only partially implemented by the commission; yet Gracchi colonies were set up both Italy and Carthage.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout nine years later Tiberius's younger brother, Gaius, passed more radical reforms. In addition to settling the poor in colonies on land conquered by Rome, he passed the lex frumentaria, which gave the poor the right to buy grain at subsidized prices.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past, the senate eliminated political rivals either by establishing special judicial commissions or by passing a senatus consultum ultimum (\\"ultimate decree of the senate\\").[45][46] Both devices allowed the senate to bypass the ordinary due process rights that all citizens had.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of Gaius' followers caused the death of a man, many historians contend they were attacked and were acting in self-defense. In any case, the death was used by Gaius Gracchus's political rival, Lucius Opimius, to suspend the constitution again with another senatus consultum ultimum.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nGaius fled, but he was also probably murdered by the oligarchs.[33]  According to one ancient source, Gaius was not killed directly by them, but ordered his slave Philocrates to do the deed in a murder-suicide.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next major reformer of the time was Gaius Marius, who like the Gracchi, was a populist.[4]  Unlike them, he was also a general.[4][50]  He abolished the property requirement for becoming a soldier.[4][50]  The poor enlisted in large numbers.[4][50]  This opening of the Army's ranks to the capite censii enfranchised the plebs, thus creating an esprit de corps in the enlarged army.[4][51]  Some elites complained that the army now became unruly due to the commoners in its ranks, but this is without good cause:[4][51]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarius stands accused of paving the way for the so-called lawless, greedy soldiery whose activities were thought to have contributed largely to the decline and fall of the Republic a few generations later.  Yet we should not lose sight of the fact that Marius was not the first to enrol the capite censi.  Rome was ruled by an aristocratic oligarchy embedded in the Senate. Thus at times of extreme crisis in the past the Senate had impressed them, along with convicts and slaves, for service as legionaries.\\r\\nMarius employed his soldiers to defeat an invasion by the Germanic Cimbri and Teutons.[50] His political influence and military leadership allowed him to obtain six terms as consul in 107, and 103 to 99 BC, an unprecedented honour.[50] However, on 10 December 100 BC the senate declared another senatus consultum ultimum, this time in order to bring down Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, a radical tribune in the mould of the Gracchi who had been inciting violence in Rome on behalf of Marius' interests. The Senate ordered Marius to put down Saturninus and his supporters, who had taken defensive positions on the Capitol. Marius proceeded to do this, but imprisoned Saturninus inside the Curia Hostilia, intending it seems to keep him alive. However, a senatorial mob lynched the tribune regardless, by climbing atop the Senate House and throwing dislodged roof tiles down onto Saturninus and his supporters below.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nSulla, who was appointed as Marius' quaestor in 107, later contested with Marius for supreme power. In 88, the senate awarded Sulla the lucrative and powerful post of commander in the war against Mithridates over Marius. However, Marius managed to secure the position anyway, through political deal-making with Publius Sulpicius Rufus. Sulla initially went along, but finding support among his troops, seized power in Rome and marched to Asia Minor with his soldiers anyway. There, he fought a largely successful military campaign and was not persecuted by the senate. Marius himself launched a coup with Cinna in Sulla's absence and put to death some of his enemies. He instituted a populist regime, but died soon after.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nSulla made peace with Rome's enemies in the east and began to arrange for his return to Rome. Cinna, Marius's populist successor, was killed by his own men as they moved to meet Sulla on foreign soil. When Sulla heard of this, he ceased negotiations with Rome and openly rebelled in 84. Invading the peninsula, he was joined by many aristocrats including Crassus and Pompey and defeated all major opposition within a year. He began a dictatorship and purged the state of many populists through proscription. A reign of terror followed in which some innocents were denounced just so their property could be seized for the benefit of Sulla's followers. Sulla's coup resulted in a major victory for the oligarchs. He reversed the reforms of the Gracchi and other populists, stripped the tribunes of the people of much of their power and returned authority over the courts to the senators.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nPompey the Great, the next major leader who aggravated the crisis, was born Gnaeus Pompeius, but took his own cognomen of Magnus (\\"the Great\\").[54] Pompey as a young man was allied to Sulla,[55] but in the consular elections of 78 BC, he supported Lepidus against Sulla's wishes.[citation needed]  When Sulla died later that year, Lepidus revolted, and Pompey suppressed him on behalf of the senate.[citation needed] Then he asked for proconsular imperium in Hispania, to deal with the populares general Quintus Sertorius, who had held out for the past three years against Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius, one of Sulla's most able generals.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nPompey's career seems to have been driven by desire for military glory and disregard for traditional political constraints.[57] Pompey served next to Crassus and Julius Caesar as part of the first triumvirate of Rome, however, before this, the Roman aristocracy turned him down as they were beginning to fear the young, popular and successful general. Pompey refused to disband his legions until his request was granted.[58] The senate acceded, reluctantly granted him the title of proconsul and powers equal to those of Metellus, and sent him to Hispania.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nPompey infamously wiped out what remained of Spartacus' troops in 71 BC, who had been pinned down by Marcus Crassus.[60]  He received Rome's highest honor, the triumph, while Crassus only received the honorable mention of an ovation, which hurt Crassus' pride.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 69 BC, he conquered Syria, defeated King Tigranes of Armenia, and replaced one puppet king, Seleucus VII Philometor with his brother Antiochus XIII Asiaticus.[54] Four years later, he deposed the monarchy, replacing it with a governor.[54]  This not only finished off the Seleucids,[62]  but brought in thousands of slaves and strange peoples, including the Judeans, to Rome, thus creating the Jewish diaspora.[55] This generated swarms of refugees, which can only have created its own discord.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile many of Pompey's reckless actions ultimately increased discord in Rome, his unlucky alliance with Crassus and Caesar is cited as being especially dangerous to the Republic.[19] In January 49 B.C., Caesar led his legions across the Rubicon River from Cisalpine Gaul to Italy, thus declaring war against Pompey and his forces. In August 48 B.C., with Pompey in pursuit, Caesar paused near Pharsalus, setting up camp at a strategic location.[63] When Pompeys senatorial forces fell upon Caesars smaller army, they were entirely routed, and Pompey fled to Egypt. Pompey hoped that King Ptolemy, his former client, would assist him, but the Egyptian king feared offending the victorious Caesar. On September 28, Pompey was invited to leave his ships and come ashore at Pelusium. As he prepared to step onto Egyptian soil, he was treacherously struck down and killed by an officer of Ptolemy.[63]","input":"What caused the collapse of the roman republic?"},{"output":"Earth's atmosphere","context":"The nitrogen cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which nitrogen is converted into multiple chemical forms as it circulates among the atmosphere, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems. The conversion of nitrogen can be carried out through both biological and physical processes. Important processes in the nitrogen cycle include fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. The majority of Earth's atmosphere (78%) is nitrogen,[1] making it the largest source of nitrogen. However, atmospheric nitrogen has limited availability for biological use, leading to a scarcity of usable nitrogen in many types of ecosystems. The nitrogen cycle is of particular interest to ecologists because nitrogen availability can affect the rate of key ecosystem processes, including primary production and decomposition. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, use of artificial nitrogen fertilizers, and release of nitrogen in wastewater have dramatically altered the global nitrogen cycle.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNitrogen is present in the environment in a wide variety of chemical forms including organic nitrogen, ammonium (NH+\\r\\n4), nitrite (NO?\\r\\n2), nitrate (NO?\\r\\n3), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) or inorganic nitrogen gas (N2). Organic nitrogen may be in the form of a living organism, humus or in the intermediate products of organic matter decomposition. The processes of the nitrogen cycle transform nitrogen from one form to another. Many of those processes are carried out by microbes, either in their effort to harvest energy or to accumulate nitrogen in a form needed for their growth. For example, the nitrogenous wastes in animal urine are broken down by nitrifying bacteria in the soil to be used as new. The diagram besides shows how these processes fit together to form the nitrogen cycle.\\r\\nConversion of nitrogen into nitrates and nitrites through atmospheric, industrial and biological processes is called as nitrogen fixation. Atmospheric nitrogen must be processed, or \\"fixed\\", in a usable form to be taken up by plants. Between 5x1012 and 10x1012 g per year are fixed by lightning strikes, but most fixation is done by free-living or symbiotic bacteria known as diazotrophs. These bacteria have the nitrogenase enzyme that combines gaseous nitrogen with hydrogen to produce ammonia, which is converted by the bacteria into other organic compounds. Most biological nitrogen fixation occurs by the activity of Mo-nitrogenase, found in a wide variety of bacteria and some Archaea. Mo-nitrogenase is a complex two-component enzyme that has multiple metal-containing prosthetic groups.[4] An example of free-living bacteria is Azotobacter. Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as Rhizobium usually live in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, alfalfa, and locust trees). Here they form a mutualistic relationship with the plant, producing ammonia in exchange for carbohydrates. Because of this relationship, legumes will often increase the nitrogen content of nitrogen-poor soils. A few non-legumes can also form such symbioses. Today, about 30% of the total fixed nitrogen is produced industrially using the Haber-Bosch process,[5] which uses high temperatures and pressures to convert nitrogen gas and a hydrogen source (natural gas or petroleum) into ammonia.[6]\\r\\nPlants can absorb nitrate or ammonium from the soil via their root hairs. If nitrate is absorbed, it is first reduced to nitrite ions and then ammonium ions for incorporation into amino acids, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll.[6] In plants that have a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia, some nitrogen is assimilated in the form of ammonium ions directly from the nodules. It is now known that there is a more complex cycling of amino acids between Rhizobia bacteroids and plants. The plant provides amino acids to the bacteroids so ammonia assimilation is not required and the bacteroids pass amino acids (with the newly fixed nitrogen) back to the plant, thus forming an interdependent relationship.[7] While many animals, fungi, and other heterotrophic organisms obtain nitrogen by ingestion of amino acids, nucleotides, and other small organic molecules, other heterotrophs (including many bacteria) are able to utilize inorganic compounds, such as ammonium as sole N sources. Utilization of various N sources is carefully regulated in all organisms.\\r\\nWhen a plant or animal dies or an animal expels waste, the initial form of nitrogen is organic. Bacteria or fungi convert the organic nitrogen within the remains back into ammonium (NH+\\r\\n4), a process called ammonification or mineralization. Enzymes involved are:\\r\\nThe conversion of ammonium to nitrate is performed primarily by soil-living bacteria and other nitrifying bacteria. In the primary stage of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium (NH+\\r\\n4) is performed by bacteria such as the Nitrosomonas species, which converts ammonia to nitrites (NO?\\r\\n2). Other bacterial species such as Nitrobacter, are responsible for the oxidation of the nitrites (NO?\\r\\n2) into nitrates (NO?\\r\\n3).[6] It is important for the ammonia (NH\\r\\n3) to be converted to nitrates or nitrites because ammonia gas is toxic to plants.\\r\\nDue to their very high solubility and because soils are highly unable to retain anions, nitrates can enter groundwater. Elevated nitrate in groundwater is a concern for drinking water use because nitrate can interfere with blood-oxygen levels in infants and cause methemoglobinemia or blue-baby syndrome.[10][11] Where groundwater recharges stream flow, nitrate-enriched groundwater can contribute to eutrophication, a process that leads to high algal population and growth, especially blue-green algal populations. While not directly toxic to fish life, like ammonia, nitrate can have indirect effects on fish if it contributes to this eutrophication. Nitrogen has contributed to severe eutrophication problems in some water bodies. Since 2006, the application of nitrogen fertilizer has been increasingly controlled in Britain and the United States. This is occurring along the same lines as control of phosphorus fertilizer, restriction of which is normally considered essential to the recovery of eutrophied waterbodies.\\r\\nDenitrification is the reduction of nitrates back into nitrogen gas (N2), completing the nitrogen cycle. This process is performed by bacterial species such as Pseudomonas and Clostridium in anaerobic conditions.[6] They use the nitrate as an electron acceptor in the place of oxygen during respiration. These facultatively anaerobic bacteria can also live in aerobic conditions. Denitrification happens in anaerobic conditions e.g. waterlogged soils. The denitrifying bacteria use nitrates in the soil to carry out respiration and consequently produce nitrogen gas, which is inert and unavailable to plants.\\r\\nDissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium?(DNRA), or nitrate/nitrite ammonification, is an anaerobic respiration?process.?Microbes which undertake DNRA oxidise organic matter and use nitrate as an electron acceptor, reducing it to?nitrite, then?ammonium?(NO3?LNO2?LNH4+).[12] Both denitrifying and nitrate ammonification bacteria will be competing for nitrate in the environment, although DNRA acts to conserve bioavailable nitrogen as soluble ammonium rather than producing dinitrogen gas.[13]\\r\\nIn this biological process, nitrite and ammonia are converted directly into molecular nitrogen (N2) gas. This process makes up a major proportion of nitrogen conversion in the oceans. The balanced formula for this \\"anammox\\" chemical reaction is: NH+\\r\\n4 + NO?\\r\\n2 => N2 + 2H2O (G = -357 kJ mol-1).[14]\\r\\nThough nitrogen fixation is the primary source of plant-available nitrogen in most ecosystems, in areas with nitrogen-rich bedrock, the breakdown of this rock also serves as a nitrogen source.[15][16][17]\\r\\nThe nitrogen cycle is an important process in the ocean as well. While the overall cycle is similar, there are different players and modes of transfer for nitrogen in the ocean. Nitrogen enters the water through the precipitation, runoff, or as N2 from the atmosphere. Nitrogen cannot be utilized by phytoplankton as N2 so it must undergo nitrogen fixation which is performed predominately by cyanobacteria.[18] Without supplies of fixed nitrogen entering the marine cycle, the fixed nitrogen would be used up in about 2000 years.[19] Phytoplankton need nitrogen in biologically available forms for the initial synthesis of organic matter. Ammonia and urea are released into the water by excretion from plankton. Nitrogen sources are removed from the euphotic zone by the downward movement of the organic matter. This can occur from sinking of phytoplankton, vertical mixing, or sinking of waste of vertical migrators. The sinking results in ammonia being introduced at lower depths below the euphotic zone. Bacteria are able to convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate but they are inhibited by light so this must occur below the euphotic zone.[20] Ammonification or Mineralization is performed by bacteria to convert organic nitrogen to ammonia. Nitrification can then occur to convert the ammonium to nitrite and nitrate.[21] Nitrate can be returned to the euphotic zone by vertical mixing and upwelling where it can be taken up by phytoplankton to continue the cycle. N2 can be returned to the atmosphere through denitrification.\\r\\nAmmonium is thought to be the preferred source of fixed nitrogen for phytoplankton because its assimilation does not involve a redox reaction and therefore requires little energy. Nitrate requires a redox reaction for assimilation but is more abundant so most phytoplankton have adapted to have the enzymes necessary to undertake this reduction (nitrate reductase). There are a few notable and well-known exceptions that include Prochlorococcus and some Synechococcus.[19] These species can only take up nitrogen as ammonium.\\r\\nThe nutrients in the ocean are not uniformly distributed. Areas of upwelling provide supplies of nitrogen from below the euphotic zone. Coastal zones provide nitrogen from runoff and upwelling occurs readily along the coast. However, the rate at which nitrogen can be taken up by phytoplankton is decreased in oligotrophic waters year-round and temperate water in the summer resulting in lower primary production.[22] The distribution of the different forms of nitrogen varies throughout the oceans as well.\\r\\nNitrate is depleted in near-surface water except in upwelling regions. Coastal upwelling regions usually have high nitrate and chlorophyll levels as a result of the increased production. However, there are regions of high surface nitrate but low chlorophyll that are referred to as HNLC (high nitrogen, low chlorophyll) regions. The best explanation for HNLC regions relates to iron scarcity in the ocean, which may play an important part in ocean dynamics and nutrient cycles. The input of iron varies by region and is delivered to the ocean by dust (from dust storms) and leached out of rocks. Iron is under consideration as the true limiting element to ecosystem productivity in the ocean.\\r\\nAmmonium and nitrite show a maximum concentration at 50√ø80 m (lower end of the euphotic zone) with decreasing concentration below that depth. This distribution can be accounted for by the fact that nitrite and ammonium are intermediate species. They are both rapidly produced and consumed through the water column.[19] The amount of ammonium in the ocean is about 3 orders of magnitude less than nitrate.[19] Between ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate, nitrite has the fastest turnover rate. It can be produced during nitrate assimilation, nitrification, and denitrification; however, it is immediately consumed again.\\r\\nNitrogen entering the euphotic zone is referred to as new nitrogen because it is newly arrived from outside the productive layer.[18] The new nitrogen can come from below the euphotic zone or from outside sources. Outside sources are upwelling from deep water and nitrogen fixation. If the organic matter is eaten, respired, delivered to the water as ammonia, and re-incorporated into organic matter by phytoplankton it is considered recycled/regenerated production.\\r\\nNew production is an important component of the marine environment. One reason is that only continual input of new nitrogen can determine the total capacity of the ocean to produce a sustainable fish harvest.[23] Harvesting fish from regenerated nitrogen areas will lead to a decrease in nitrogen and therefore a decrease in primary production. This will have a negative effect on the system. However, if fish are harvested from areas of new nitrogen the nitrogen will be replenished.\\r\\nAs a result of extensive cultivation of legumes (particularly soy, alfalfa, and clover), growing use of the Haber√øBosch process in the creation of chemical fertilizers, and pollution emitted by vehicles and industrial plants, human beings have more than doubled the annual transfer of nitrogen into biologically available forms.[11] In addition, humans have significantly contributed to the transfer of nitrogen trace gases from Earth to the atmosphere and from the land to aquatic systems. Human alterations to the global nitrogen cycle are most intense in developed countries and in Asia, where vehicle emissions and industrial agriculture are highest.[24]\\r\\nNitrous oxide (N2O) has risen in the atmosphere as a result of agricultural fertilization, biomass burning, cattle and feedlots, and industrial sources.[25] N2O has deleterious effects in the stratosphere, where it breaks down and acts as a catalyst in the destruction of atmospheric ozone. Nitrous oxide is also a greenhouse gas and is currently the third largest contributor to global warming, after carbon dioxide and methane. While not as abundant in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, it is, for an equivalent mass, nearly 300 times more potent in its ability to warm the planet.[26]\\r\\nAmmonia (NH3) in the atmosphere has tripled as the result of human activities. It is a reactant in the atmosphere, where it acts as an aerosol, decreasing air quality and clinging to water droplets, eventually resulting in nitric acid (HNO3) that produces acid rain. Atmospheric ammonia and nitric acid also damage respiratory systems.\\r\\nThe very high temperature of lightning naturally produces small amounts of NOx, NH3, and HNO3, but high-temperature combustion has contributed to a 6- or 7-fold increase in the flux of NOx to the atmosphere. Its production is a function of combustion temperature - the higher the temperature, the more NOx is produced. Fossil fuel combustion is a primary contributor, but so are biofuels and even the burning of hydrogen. However, the rate that hydrogen is directly injected into the combustion chambers of internal combustion engines can be controlled to prevent the higher combustion temperatures that produce NOx.\\r\\nAmmonia and nitrous oxides actively alter atmospheric chemistry. They are precursors of tropospheric (lower atmosphere) ozone production, which contributes to smog and acid rain, damages plants and increases nitrogen inputs to ecosystems.[27] Ecosystem processes can increase with nitrogen fertilization, but anthropogenic input can also result in nitrogen saturation, which weakens productivity and can damage the health of plants, animals, fish, and humans.[11]\\r\\nDecreases in biodiversity can also result if higher nitrogen availability increases nitrogen-demanding grasses, causing a degradation of nitrogen-poor, species-diverse heathlands.[28]\\r\\nAdditional risks posed by increased availability of inorganic nitrogen in aquatic ecosystems include water acidification; eutrophication of fresh and saltwater systems; and toxicity issues for animals, including humans.[29] Eutrophication often leads to lower dissolved oxygen levels in the water column, including hypoxic and anoxic conditions, which can cause death of aquatic fauna. Relatively sessile benthos, or bottom-dwelling creatures, are particularly vulnerable because of their lack of mobility, though large fish kills are not uncommon. Oceanic dead zones near the mouth of the Mississippi in the Gulf of Mexico are a well-known example of algal bloom-induced hypoxia.[30][31] The New York Adirondack Lakes, Catskills, Hudson Highlands, Rensselaer Plateau and parts of Long Island display the impact of nitric acid rain deposition, resulting in the killing of fish and many other aquatic species.[32]\\r\\nAmmonia (NH3) is highly toxic to fish and the level of ammonia discharged from wastewater treatment facilities must be closely monitored. To prevent fish deaths, nitrification via aeration prior to discharge is often desirable. Land application can be an attractive alternative to the aeration.","input":"What is the largest source of nitrogen on earth?"},{"output":"precipitation from the atmosphere, in the form of mist, rain and snow","context":"Fresh water is naturally occurring water on Earth's surface in ice sheets, ice caps, glaciers, icebergs, bogs, ponds, lakes, rivers and streams, and underground as groundwater in aquifers and underground streams. Fresh water is generally characterized by having low concentrations of dissolved salts and other total dissolved solids. The term specifically excludes seawater and brackish water although it does include mineral-rich waters such as chalybeate springs. The term \\"sweet water\\" (from Spanish \\"agua dulce\\") has been used to describe fresh water in contrast to salt water. The term \\"fresh water\\" does not have the same meaning as potable water. Much of the surface fresh water and ground water is unsuitable for drinking without some form of purification because of the presence of chemical or biological contaminants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh water habitats are divided into lentic systems, which are the stillwaters including ponds, lakes, swamps and mires; lotic, or running-water systems; and groundwater which flows in rocks and aquifers. There is, in addition, a zone which bridges between groundwater and lotic systems, which is the hyporheic zone, which underlies many larger rivers and can contain substantially more water than is seen in the open channel. It may also be in direct contact with the underlying underground water. The majority of fresh water on Earth is in ice caps.\\r\\nThe source of almost all fresh water is precipitation from the atmosphere, in the form of mist, rain and snow. Fresh water falling as mist, rain or snow contains materials dissolved from the atmosphere and material from the sea and land over which the rain bearing clouds have traveled. In industrialized areas rain is typically acidic because of dissolved oxides of sulfur and nitrogen formed from burning of fossil fuels in cars, factories, trains and aircraft and from the atmospheric emissions of industry. In some cases this acid rain results in pollution of lakes and rivers.\\r\\nIn coastal areas fresh water may contain significant concentrations of salts derived from the sea if windy conditions have lifted drops of seawater into the rain-bearing clouds. This can give rise to elevated concentrations of sodium, chloride, magnesium and sulfate as well as many other compounds in smaller concentrations.\\r\\nIn desert areas, or areas with impoverished or dusty soils, rain-bearing winds can pick up sand and dust and this can be deposited elsewhere in precipitation and causing the freshwater flow to be measurably contaminated both by insoluble solids but also by the soluble components of those soils. Significant quantities of iron may be transported in this way including the well-documented transfer of iron-rich rainfall falling in Brazil derived from sand-storms in the Sahara in north Africa.\\r\\nWater is a critical issue for the survival of all living organisms. Some can use salt water but many organisms including the great majority of higher plants and most mammals must have access to fresh water to live. Some terrestrial mammals, especially desert rodents appear to survive without drinking but they do generate water through the metabolism of cereal seeds and they also have mechanisms to conserve water to the maximum degree.\\r\\nOut of all the water on Earth, saline water in oceans, seas and saline groundwater make up about 97% of it. Only 2.5√ø2.75% is fresh water, including 1.75√ø2% frozen in glaciers, ice and snow, 0.5√ø0.75% as fresh groundwater and soil moisture, and less than 0.01% of it as surface water in lakes, swamps and rivers.[2][3] Freshwater lakes contain about 87% of this fresh surface water, including 29% in the African Great Lakes, 22% in Lake Baikal in Russia, 21% in the North American Great Lakes, and 14% in other lakes. Swamps have most of the balance with only a small amount in rivers, most notably the Amazon River. The atmosphere contains 0.04% water.[4] In areas with no fresh water on the ground surface, fresh water derived from precipitation may, because of its lower density, overlie saline ground water in lenses or layers. Most of the world's fresh water is frozen in ice sheets. Many areas suffer from lack of distribution of fresh water, such as deserts.\\r\\nFresh water can be defined as water with less than 500 parts per million (ppm) of dissolved salts.[5]\\r\\nOther sources give higher upper salinity limits for fresh water, e.g. 1000 ppm[6] or 3000 ppm.[7]\\r\\nFresh water creates a hypotonic environment for aquatic organisms. This is problematic for some organisms with pervious skins or with gill membranes, whose cell membranes may burst if excess water is not excreted. Some protists accomplish this using contractile vacuoles, while freshwater fish excrete excess water via the kidney.[8] Although most aquatic organisms have a limited ability to regulate their osmotic balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity, diadromous fish have the ability to migrate between fresh water and saline water bodies. During these migrations they undergo changes to adapt to the surroundings of the changed salinities; these processes are hormonally controlled. The eel (Anguilla anguilla) uses the hormone prolactin,[9] while in salmon (Salmo salar) the hormone cortisol plays a key role during this process.[10]\\r\\nMany sea birds have special glands at the base of the bill through which excess salt is excreted. Similarly the marine iguanas on the Galpagos Islands excrete excess salt through a nasal gland and they sneeze out a very salty excretion.\\r\\nAn important concern for hydrological ecosystems is securing minimum streamflow, especially preserving and restoring instream water allocations.[11] Fresh water is an important natural resource necessary for the survival of all ecosystems. The use of water by humans for activities such as irrigation and industrial applications can have adverse impacts on down-stream ecosystems. Chemical contamination of fresh water can also seriously damage eco-systems.\\r\\nPollution from human activity, including oil spills and also presents a problem for freshwater resources. The largest petroleum spill that has ever occurred in fresh water was caused by a Royal Dutch Shell tank ship in Magdalena, Argentina, on 15 January 1999, polluting the environment, drinkable water, plants and animals.[12]\\r\\nFresh and unpolluted water accounts for 0.003% of total water available globally.[13]\\r\\nChanging landscape for the use of agriculture has a great effect on the flow of fresh water. Changes in landscape by the removal of trees and soils changes the flow of fresh water in the local environment and also affects the cycle of fresh water. As a result, more fresh water is stored in the soil which benefits agriculture. However, since agriculture is the human activity that consumes the most fresh water,[14] this can put a severe strain on local freshwater resources resulting in the destruction of local ecosystems. In Australia, over-abstraction of fresh water for intensive irrigation activities has caused 33% of the land area to be at risk of salination.[14] With regards to agriculture, the World Bank targets food production and water management as an increasingly global issue that will foster debate.[15]\\r\\nFresh water is a renewable and variable, but finite natural resource. Fresh water can only be replenished through the process of the water cycle, in which water from seas, lakes, forests, land, rivers, and reservoirs evaporates, forms clouds, and returns as precipitation. Locally however, if more fresh water is consumed through human activities than is naturally restored, this may result in reduced fresh water availability from surface and underground sources and can cause serious damage to surrounding and associated environments.\\r\\nFresh water withdrawal is the quantity of water removed from available sources for use in any purpose, excluding evaporation losses. Water drawn off is not necessarily entirely consumed and some portion may be returned for further use downstream.\\r\\nThe increase in the world population and the increase in per capita water use puts increasing strains on the finite resources avialability of clean fresh water The World Bank adds that the response by freshwater ecosystems to a changing climate can be described in terms of three interrelated components: water quality, water quantity or volume, and water timing. A change in one often leads to shifts in the others as well.[16] Water pollution and subsequent eutrophication also reduces the availability of fresh water.[17]\\r\\nMany areas of the world are already experiencing stress on water availability. Due to the accelerated pace of population growth and an increase in the amount of water a single person uses, it is expected that this situation will continue to get worse. A shortage of water in the future would be detrimental to the human population as it would affect everything from sanitation, to overall health and the production of grain.[18]\\r\\nWith one in eight people in the world not having access to safe water[19] it is important to use this resource in a prudent manner. Making the best use of water on a local basis probably provides the best solution. Local communities need to plan their use of fresh water and should be made aware of how certain crops and animals use water.\\r\\nAs a guide the following tables provide some indicators.\\r\\nTable 1 Recommended basic water requirements for human needs (per person) [20]\\r\\nTable 2. Water Requirements of different classes of livestock [21]\\r\\nTable 3 Approximate values of seasonal crop water needs [22]","input":"What is the most abundant source of freshwater in earth?"},{"output":"2,430","context":"The Major League Baseball (MLB) season schedule consists of 162 games for each of the 30 teams in the American League (AL) and National League (NL), played over approximately six monthsa total of 2,430 games, plus the postseason. The regular season runs from late March/early April to late September/early October, followed by the postseason which can run to early November.  The season begins with the official Opening Day, and, as of 2018, runs 26? weeks through the last Sunday of September or first Sunday of October. One or more International Opener games may be scheduled outside the United States before the official Opening Day.[1] It is possible for a given team to play a maximum of 20 games in the postseason in a given year, provided the team is a wild card and advances to each of the Division Series, Championship Series, and World Series with each series going the distance (5 games in the Division Series, 7 games each in the League Championship Series/World Series).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe regular season is constructed from series.  Due to travel concerns and the sheer number of games, pairs of teams are never scheduled to play single games against each other (except in the instance of making up a postponed game); instead they play games on several consecutive days in the same ballpark.  Most often the series are of three or four games, but two-game series are also scheduled.  Teams play one mid-week series and one weekend series per week. Depending on the length of the series, mid-week series games are usually scheduled between Monday and Thursday, while weekend games are scheduled between Thursday and Monday.  Beginning in 2018, teams start and end their season on a weekend for a total of 26? weeks. Due to the mid-week all-star break in July, teams are scheduled to play 27 weekend series and 25 mid-week series for a total of 52 series (24 divisional series, 20 inter-divisional series, 8 inter-league series).  A team's road games are usually grouped into a multi-series road trip; home series are grouped into homestands.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that rainouts and other cancellations are often rescheduled ad hoc during the season, sometimes as doubleheaders.  However, if two teams are scheduled to meet for the final time in the last two weeks of the season, and the game is cancelled, it may not be rescheduled if there is no impact on the divisional or wild card races.  For example, in 2016, the September 29 game between the Cleveland Indians and Detroit Tigers was cancelled due to rain because the teams were unable to reschedule a make-up date before the end of the season on October 2, and it did not affect the divisional race.  In contrast, a 2008 AL Central division game between Detroit and the Chicago White Sox needed to be made up following the last day of the regular season because it affected a division race involving the White Sox and the Minnesota Twins.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis account gives the length of the major league \\"championship season\\" schedule by league and year. It does not cover the curtailment of play by war (1918) or by strikes and lockouts (1972, 1981, 1994). The schedules for 1995 were revised and shortened from 162 to 144 games, after late resolution of the strike that had begun in 1994 required a delay in the season to accommodate limited spring training.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe listed years are those in which the league revised its schedule.

Clubs paid a $10 entry fee, later $20, to enter the Association for one season, and thereby declare for that year's national championship. Without continuing membership or heavy investment, there was little to deter a team from breaking a commitment, and though it happened, it was mainly due to clubs going out of business.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National League organized for 1876 on a different basis, granting exclusive memberships to eight clubs that would continue from year to year  it was generally expected, if only because membership would be profitable. But the new league followed its predecessor in merely agreeing that each club would play a certain number of matches to a decision (excluding ties) by a certain date.  Boston played 70 games with its quota of ten decisions against every rival. The others achieved 56 to 68 decisions, 64 to 66 for the four western teams as the teams from New York and Philadelphia (eastern) abandoned their schedule-concluding road trips.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all six early seasons, prior to the first league schedule in 1877, member clubs scheduled their own matches by mutual arrangement, including championship games necessarily with member clubs, other games with members, and games with non-member clubs.

Each team plays 162 games, 81 as the \\"home\\" team, 81 as the \\"visitor\\". (This is true even on the rare occasion when a game is played at a ballpark not home to either team.)  Occasionally, the advance schedule is subsequently altered due to a game postponement or a one-game tie-breaker to determine which team will play in the postseason.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore 2013 the schedule included 252 \\"interleague games\\" that matched one team from the American League and one from the National League; the other 2178 games matched a pair from within one league. About half of the latter matched teams from within one division and about half matched teams from different divisions in one league. In the Central Division of the National League, which alone had six teams, every pair of division rivals played 15 or 16 games. Within the other, smaller divisions every pair of teams played 18 or 19 games.\\r\\n\\r\\nDivision games (1091). There are 61 pairs of teams from within one division.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther intraleague games (1087). There are 150 pairs of teams from two different divisions within one league.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe schedule for interleague play comprised 84 three-game series in each season from 1998 to 2012, divided as six series (18 games) for each of fourteen AL teams and as many as six for each of sixteen NL teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the 224 interleague pairs of teams, 11 played six games every year, which were scheduled in two three-game series \\"home and home\\", or one at each home ballpark. Five of these 11 special arrangements matched two teams in the same city or in neighboring cities, where they wholly or partly share territorial rights. Six were regional matches at greater distance, four of which were in the same state.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese special local and regional series accounted for 66 interleague games annually from 1998-2012, and the other 186 games were determined by rotation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2001 season was suspended for one week due to the September 11 terrorist attacks and resulting disruptions in travel, resulting in games scheduled for September 11√ø16 being rescheduled to the first week of October and the playoffs and World Series being rescheduled one week later than their originally planned dates, which resulted in the World Series continuing into early November.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchedule changes for 2013, precipitated by realignment that created two equal-sized leagues of 15 teams each, gave every team 20 interleague games.[2] Sixteen of which were determined by a match of divisions, one from each league; all teams in a given division play all teams in a given division from the other league. (Each plays a three-game series against four teams from the designated division and two two-game series against the remaining team.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe matched divisions rotate annually:\\r\\n\\r\\nEach team played its four other interleague games against a designated \\"natural rival\\", with two games in each club's city. Thus all 30 teams, rather than 22 of 30 as previously, were deemed to have a natural rival in the other league.  In 2013 the natural rivalry games were all scheduled for May 27 to May 30 (Memorial Day weekend) but in 2014 their scheduled dates range from May to August.\\r\\n\\r\\nTen of the natural rivalries from 2012 and earlier continued, while the Houston√øTexas \\"Lone Star\\" rivalry had been transformed into an intra-division one with 19 games played. Five of the special arrangements were new in 2013 , including one each for Houston and Texas.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 2014, four (4) of the five (5) new rivalries have been revised (?), all except Detroit and Pittsburgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery team now plays 19 games against each of 4 opponents within its division (76 games), and 6 or 7 games against each of 10 opponents from other divisions within its own league (66 games).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen corresponding divisions (i.e. NL East vs. AL East) play each other, a slight adjustment was made to the interleague games. Teams now play 6 games against their rival and 4 games (home and home) against two opponents plus one home and one away 3 game series (14 total) against the other four teams in the opposing division.  This was done in 2015, and will next occur in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the new collective bargaining agreement reached in December 2016, several changes were done to the scheduling pattern for the 2018 season. The overall length of the season has been extended to 187 days with the addition of four off-days for all teams. All teams will play on Opening Day, which for 2018 will be held on March 29. Sunday Night Baseball will no longer be played on the final Sunday before the All-Star Game, in order to ease travel time for those who are participating in the Home Run Derby. A single, nationally televised afternoon game will be played the following Thursday, with all other teams returning to play on Friday.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nStart of Major League Baseball games depends on days of the week, game number in series, holidays, and other factors. Most games start at 7pm in the local time zone, so there are more night games than day games even though baseball is traditionally played during the day. The reason why there are more night baseball games is to attract more fans to ballparks as well as viewers from home because most fans would be at work or school during the day. On Mondays (excluding Opening Day and holidays), Tuesdays, and Fridays, games are almost exclusively played at night except for Cubs home games. Getaway days, days on which teams play their last game of the series before departing for another series in another city the next day, are usually day games, mainly Sundays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. On Sundays, usually all but one are day games, with the final game reserved for ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout half of Saturday games are day games (1, 2 or 4pm ET).  In some markets, Saturday night start an hour earlier than usual night start times, but other cities start Saturday night games at the same time as weeknight games. In conclusion, weekday games are only played at night except for getaway days while many weekend games are played during the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial pitch typically occurs 5 or 10 minutes after the hour, in order to allow time for pre-game ceremonies.","input":"How many games in a professional baseball season?"},{"output":"February 15, 1965","context":"The flag of Canada, often referred to as the Canadian flag, or unofficially as the Maple Leaf and l'Unifoli (French for \\"the one-leafed\\"), is a national flag consisting of a red field with a white square at its centre in the ratio of 1:2:1, in the middle of which is featured a stylized, red, 11-pointed maple leaf charged in the centre.[1] It is the first specified by law for use as the country's national flag.\\r\\nIn 1964, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson formed a committee to resolve the ongoing issue of the lack of an official Canadian flag, sparking a serious debate about a flag change to replace the Union Flag. Out of three choices, the maple leaf design by George Stanley,[2] based on the flag of the Royal Military College of Canada, was selected. The flag made its first official appearance on February 15, 1965; the date is now celebrated annually as National Flag of Canada Day.\\r\\nThe Canadian Red Ensign was unofficially used since the 1890s and approved by a 1945 Order in Council for use \\"wherever place or occasion may make it desirable to fly a distinctive Canadian flag\\".[3][4] Also, the Royal Union Flag remains an official flag in Canada. There is no law dictating how the national flag is to be treated, but there are conventions and protocols to guide how it is to be displayed and its place in the order of precedence of flags, which gives it primacy over the aforementioned and most other flags.\\r\\nMany different flags created for use by Canadian officials, government bodies, and military forces contain the maple leaf motif in some fashion, either by having the Canadian flag charged in the canton, or by including maple leaves in the design.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag is horizontally symmetric and therefore the obverse and reverse sides appear identical. The width of the Maple Leaf flag is twice the height. The white field is a Canadian pale (a square central band in a vertical triband flag, named after this flag); each bordering red field is exactly half its size[5] and it bears a stylized red maple leaf at its centre. In heraldic terminology, the flag's blazon as outlined on the original royal proclamation is \\"gules on a Canadian pale argent a maple leaf of the first\\".[6][8]\\r\\nThe maple leaf has been used as a Canadian emblem since the 18th century.[9] It was first used as a national symbol in 1868 when it appeared on the coat of arms of both Ontario and Quebec.[10] In 1867, Alexander Muir composed the patriotic song \\"The Maple Leaf Forever\\", which became an unofficial anthem in English-speaking Canada.[11] The maple leaf was later added to the Canadian coat of arms in 1921.[10] From 1876 until 1901, the leaf appeared on all Canadian coins and remained on the penny after 1901.[12] The use of the maple leaf by the Royal Canadian Regiment as a regimental symbol extended back to 1860.[13] During the First World War and Second World War, badges of the Canadian Forces were often based on a maple leaf design.[14] The maple leaf would eventually adorn the tombstones of Canadian military graves.[15]\\r\\nBy proclaiming the Royal Arms of Canada, King George V in 1921 made red and white the official colours of Canada; the former came from Saint George's Cross and the latter from the French royal emblem since King Charles VII.[16] These colours became \\"entrenched\\" as the national colours of Canada upon the proclamation of the Royal Standard of Canada (the Canadian monarch's personal flag) in 1962.[17] The Department of Canadian Heritage has listed the various colour shades for printing ink that should be used when reproducing the Canadian flag; these include:[5]\\r\\nThe number of points on the leaf has no special significance;[18] the number and arrangement of the points were chosen after wind tunnel tests showed the current design to be the least blurry of the various designs when tested under high wind conditions.[19]\\r\\nThe image of the maple leaf used on the flag was designed by Jacques Saint-Cyr;[20] Jack Cook claims that this stylized eleven-point maple leaf was lifted from a copyrighted design owned by a Canadian craft shop in Ottawa.[21] The colours 0/100/100/0 in the CMYK process, PMS 032 (flag red 100%), or PMS 485 (used for screens) in the Pantone colour specifier can be used when reproducing the flag.[5] For the Federal Identity Program, the red tone of the standard flag has an RGB value of 255√ø0√ø0 (web hexadecimal #FF0000).[22] In 1984, the National Flag of Canada Manufacturing Standards Act was passed to unify the manufacturing standards for flags used in both indoor and outdoor conditions.[23]\\r\\nThe first flag known to have flown in Canada was the St George's Cross carried by John Cabot when he reached Newfoundland in 1497. In 1534, Jacques Cartier planted a cross in Gasp bearing the French royal coat of arms with the fleurs-de-lis. His ship flew a red flag with a white cross, the French naval flag at the time. New France continued to fly the evolving French military flags of that period.[4][24] As the de jure national flag of the United Kingdom, the Union Flag (commonly known as the Union Jack and, by law, called the Royal Union Flag in Canada since 1964) was used similarly in Canada since the 1621 British settlement in Nova Scotia. Its use continued after Canada's independence from the United Kingdom in 1931 until the adoption of the current flag in 1965.[4]\\r\\nShortly after Canadian Confederation in 1867, the need for distinctive Canadian flags emerged. The first Canadian flag was that then used as the flag of the Governor General of Canada, a Union Flag with a shield in the centre bearing the quartered arms of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick surrounded by a wreath of maple leaves.[25] In 1870 the Red Ensign, with the addition of the Canadian composite shield in the fly, began to be used unofficially on land and sea[26] and was known as the Canadian Red Ensign. As new provinces joined the Confederation, their arms were added to the shield. In 1892, the British admiralty approved the use of the Red Ensign for Canadian use at sea.[26] The composite shield was replaced with the coat of arms of Canada upon its grant in 1921 and, in 1924, an Order in Council approved its use for Canadian government buildings abroad.[4] In 1925, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King established a committee to design a flag to be used at home, but it was dissolved before the final report could be delivered. Despite the failure of the committee to solve the issue, public sentiment in the 1920s was in favour of fixing the flag problem for Canada.[27] New designs were proposed in 1927,[28] 1931,[29] and 1939.[30]\\r\\nDuring the Second World War, the Red Ensign was the recognized Canadian national flag. A joint committee of the Senate and House of Commons was appointed on November 8, 1945, to recommend a national flag to officially adopt. It received 2,409 designs from the public and was addressed by the director of the Historical Section of the Canadian Army, Fortescue Duguid, who pointed out red and white were Canada's official colours and there was already an emblem representing the country: three joined maple leaves seen on the escutcheon of the Canadian coat of arms.[26] By May 9 the following year, the committee reported back with a recommendation \\"that the national flag of Canada should be the Canadian red ensign with a maple leaf in autumn golden colours in a bordered background of white\\". The Legislative Assembly of Quebec had urged the committee to not include any of what it deemed as \\"foreign symbols\\", including the Union Flag, and Mackenzie King, then still prime minister, declined to act on the report, leaving the order to fly the Canadian Red Ensign in place.[16][25][31]\\r\\nBy the 1960s, debate for an official Canadian flag intensified and became a subject of controversy, culminating in the Great Flag Debate of 1964.[32] In 1963, the minority Liberal government of Lester B. Pearson gained power and decided to adopt an official Canadian flag through parliamentary debate. The principal political proponent of the change was Pearson. He had been a significant broker during the Suez Crisis of 1956, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.[33] During the crisis, Pearson was disturbed when the Egyptian government objected to Canadian peacekeeping forces on the grounds that the Canadian flag (the Red Ensign) contained the same symbol (the Union Flag) also used as a flag by the United Kingdom, one of the belligerents.[33] Pearson's goal was for the Canadian flag to be distinctive and unmistakably Canadian. The main opponent to changing the flag was the leader of the opposition and former prime minister, John Diefenbaker, who eventually made the subject a personal crusade.[34]\\r\\nIn 1961, Leader of the Opposition Lester Pearson asked John Ross Matheson to begin researching what it would take for Canada to have a new flag. Pearson knew the Red Ensign with the Union Jack was unpopular in Quebec, a base of support for his Liberal Party, but strongly favoured by English Canada. By April 1963, Pearson was prime minister in a minority government and risked losing power over the issue. He formed a 15-member multi-party parliamentary committee in 1963 to select a new design, despite opposition leader Diefenbaker's demands for a referendum on the issue.[35] On May 27, 1964, Pearson's cabinet introduced a motion to parliament for adoption of his favourite design, presented to him by artist and heraldic advisor Alan Beddoe,[26] of a \\"sea to sea\\" (Canada's motto) flag with blue borders and three conjoined red maple leaves on a white field. This motion led to weeks of acrimonious debate in the House of Commons and the design came to be known as the \\"Pearson Pennant\\",[36] derided by the media and viewed as a \\"concession to Qubec\\".[26]\\r\\nA new all-party committee was formed in September 1964, comprising seven Liberals, five Conservatives, one New Democrat, one Social Crediter, and one Crditiste, with Herman Batten as chairman, while John Matheson acted as Pearson's right-hand man.[26] Among those who gave their opinions to the group were Duguid, expressing the same views as he had in 1945, insisting on a design using three maple leaves; Arthur R. M. Lower, stressing the need for a distinctly Canadian emblem; Marcel Trudel, arguing for symbols of Canada's founding nations, which did not include the maple leaf (a thought shared by Diefenbaker); and A. Y. Jackson, providing his own suggested designs.[26] A steering committee also considered about 2,000 suggestions from the public, in addition to 3,900 others, \\"including those that had accumulated in the Department of the Secretary of State and those from a parliamentary flag committee of 1945√ø1946\\".[attribution needed][26] Through a six-week period of study with political manoeuvring, the committee took a vote on the two finalists: the Pearson Pennant (Beddoe's design) and the current design. Believing the Liberal members would vote for the Prime Minister's preference, the Conservatives voted for the single leaf design. The Liberals, though, all voted for the same, giving a unanimous, 14 to 0 vote[26] for the option created by George Stanley and inspired by the flag of the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario.[37]\\r\\nThere, near the parade square, in March 1964, while viewing the college flag atop the Mackenzie Building, Stanley, then RMC's Dean of Arts, first suggested to Matheson, then Member of Parliament for Leeds, that the RMC flag should form the basis of the national flag. The suggestion was followed by Stanley's memorandum of March 23, 1964, on the history of Canada's emblems,[38] in which he warned that any new flag \\"must avoid the use of national or racial symbols that are of a divisive nature\\" and that it would be \\"clearly inadvisable\\" to create a flag that carried the Union Jack or a fleur-de-lis. According to Matheson, Pearson's one \\"paramount and desperate objective\\" in introducing the new flag was to keep Quebec in the Canadian union.[39] It was Dr. Stanley's idea that the new flag should be red and white and that it should feature the single maple leaf; his memorandum included the first sketch of what would become the flag of Canada. Stanley and Matheson collaborated on a design that was ultimately, after six months of debate and 308 speeches,[26] passed by a majority vote in the House of Commons on December 15, 1964. Just after this, at 2:00 am, Matheson wrote to Stanley: \\"Your proposed flag has just now been approved by the Commons 163 to 78. Congratulations. I believe it is an excellent flag that will serve Canada well.\\"[40] The Senate added its approval two days later.[16]\\r\\nElizabeth II, Queen of Canada, proclaimed the new flag on January 28, 1965,[16] and it was inaugurated on February 15 of the same year at an official ceremony held on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, in the presence of Governor General Major-General Georges Vanier, the Prime Minister, other members of the Cabinet, and Canadian parliamentarians. The Red Ensign was lowered at the stroke of noon and the new maple leaf flag was raised. The crowd sang \\"O Canada\\" followed by \\"God Save the Queen\\".[41] Of the flag, Vanier said \\"[it] will symbolize to each of usand to the worldthe unity of purpose and high resolve to which destiny beckons us\\".[42] Maurice Bourget, Speaker of the Senate, said: \\"The flag is the symbol of the nation's unity, for it, beyond any doubt, represents all the citizens of Canada without distinction of race, language, belief, or opinion.\\"[41] Yet there was still opposition to the change, and Stanley's life was even threatened for having \\"assassinated the flag\\". In spite of this, Stanley attended the flag raising ceremony.[43]\\r\\nAt the time of the 50th anniversary of the flag, the governmentheld by the Conservative Partywas criticized for the lack of official ceremony dedicated to the date; accusations of partisanship were levelled.[42] Minister of Canadian Heritage Shelly Glover denied the charges and others, including Liberal Members of Parliament, pointed to community events taking place around the country.[42] Governor General David Johnston did, though, preside at an official ceremony at Confederation Park in Ottawa, integrated with Winterlude. He said \\"[t]he National Flag of Canada is so embedded in our national life and so emblematic of our national purpose that we simply cannot imagine our country without it.\\"[44] Queen Elizabeth II stated: \\"On this, the 50th anniversary of the National Flag of Canada, I am pleased to join with all Canadians in the celebration of this unique and cherished symbol of our country and identity.\\"[45] A commemorative stamp and coin were issued by Canada Post and the Royal Canadian Mint, respectively.[44]\\r\\nThe Flag of Canada is represented as the Unicode emoji sequence U+1F1E8 ??

This was created in the form of an illuminated document on vellum, with calligraphy by Yvonne Diceman and heraldic illustrations. The text was rendered in black ink, using a quill, while the heraldic elements were painted in gouache with gilt highlights. The Great Seal of Canada was embossed and secured by a silk ribbon.[47]\\r\\nThis parchment was signed discreetly by the calligrapher, but was made official by the signatures of Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister Lester Pearson, and Attorney General Guy Favreau. In order to obtain these signatures, the document was flown to the United Kingdom (for the Queen's royal sign-manual) and to the Caribbean (for the signature of Favreau, who was on vacation). This transport to different climates, combined with the quality of the materials with which the proclamation was created, and the subsequent storage and repair methods (including the use of Scotch Tape) contributed to the deterioration of the document: The gouache was flaking off, leaving gaps in the heraldic designs, most conspicuously on the red maple leaf of the flag design in the centre of the sheet, and the adhesive from the tape had left stains. A desire to have the proclamation as part of a display at the Canadian Museum of Civilization marking the flag's 25th anniversary led to its restoration in 1989. The proclamation is today stored in a temperature and humidity controlled, plexiglass case, so as to prevent the vellum from changing dimensionally.[47]\\r\\nAs a symbol of the nation's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations, the Royal Union Flag is an official Canadian flag and is flown on certain occasions.[48] Regulations require federal installations to fly the Royal Union Flag beside the national flag when physically possible, using a second flagpole, on the following days: Commonwealth Day (the second Monday in March), Victoria Day (the same date as the Canadian sovereign's official birthday), and the anniversary of the Statute of Westminster (December 11). The Royal Union Flag can also be flown at the National War Memorial or at other locations during ceremonies that honour Canadian involvement with forces of other Commonwealth nations during times of war. The national flag always precedes the Royal Union Flag, with the former occupying the place of honour.[48] The Royal Union Flag is also part of the provincial flags of Ontario and Manitoba, forming the canton of these flags; a stylized version is used on the flag of British Columbia and the flag of Newfoundland and Labrador.[48] Several of the provincial lieutenant governors formerly used a modified union flag as their personal standard, but the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia is the only one who retains this design.[48] The Royal Union Flag and Red Ensign are still flown in Canada by veterans' groups and others who continue to stress the importance of Canada's British heritage and the Commonwealth connection.[48]\\r\\nThe Red Ensign is occasionally still used as well, including official use at some ceremonies. It was flown at the commemorations of the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 2007.[49][50] This decision elicited criticism from those who believe it should not be given equal status to the Canadian flag and received praise from people who believe that it is important to retain the ties to Canada's past.[49][50]\\r\\nIn Quebec, the provincial flag (a white cross on a field of blue with four fleurs-de-lis) can be considered a national flag along with the Maple Leaf flag, as is the Acadian flag in the Acadian regions of the Maritime provinces,[20][51] and the flags of the Iroquois Nation, the Metis Nation and other groups.\\r\\nNo law dictates the proper use of the Canadian flag. Canadian Heritage has released guidelines on how to correctly display the flag alone and with other flags. The guidelines deal with the order of precedence in which the Canadian flag is placed, where the flag can be used, how it is used, and what people should do to honour the flag. The suggestions, titled Flag Etiquette in Canada, were published by Canadian Heritage in book and online formats and last updated in August 2011.[52] The flag itself can be displayed on any day at buildings operated by the Government of Canada, airports, military bases, and diplomatic offices, as well as by citizens, during any time of the day. When flying the flag, it must be flown using its own pole and must not be inferior to other flags, save for, in descending order, the Queen's standard, the governor general's standard, any of the personal standards of members of the Canadian Royal Family, or flags of the lieutenant governors.[53] The Canadian flag is flown at half-mast in Canada to indicate a period of mourning. Canadian Forces does have a special protocol for folding the Canadian flag for presentations, such as during a funeral ceremony; CF does not recommend this method for everyday use.[54]\\r\\nSince the adoption of the Canadian flag in 1965, the Canadian government has sponsored programs to promote it. Examples include the Canadian Parliamentary Flag Program of the Department of Canadian Heritage and the flag program run by the Department of Public Works. These programs increased the exposure of the flag and the concept that it was part of the national identity. To increase awareness of the new flag, the Parliamentary Flag Program was set up in December 1972, by the Cabinet and, beginning in 1973,[55] allowed members of the House of Commons to distribute flags and lapel pins in the shape of the Canadian flag to their constituents. Flags that have been flown on the Peace Tower and the East and West Blocks of Parliament Hill are packaged by the Department of Public Works and offered to the public free of charge. The program has a 34-year waiting list for East and West Block flags, and a 48-year waiting list for Peace Tower flags.[56]\\r\\nSince 1996, February 15 has been commemorated as National Flag of Canada Day.[41] In 1996, Minister of Canadian Heritage Sheila Copps instituted the One in a Million National Flag Challenge.[57] This program was intended to provide Canadians with a million new national flags in time for Flag Day, 1997. The program was controversial because it cost some $45?million, and provided no means to hoist or fly the flags. The official numbers from Canadian Heritage put the expenses at $15.5?million, with approximately a seventh of the cost offset by donations.[58]\\r\\nMany museums across the country have special historic flags in their collections. Settlers, Rails & Trails Inc., of Argyle, Manitoba is home to Canada's 2nd largest flag collection (second only to the Canadian Museum of History, Gatineau, Quebec) The Canadian Flag Collection contains over 1,300 historic, corporate, regional, sport and special occasion flags.[citation needed]","input":"When did canada get its maple leaf flag?"},{"output":"15 August 1972","context":"A Postal Index Number or PIN or PIN code[1] is a code in the post office numbering or post code system used by India Post, the Indian postal administration.

Aboriginal peoples in Canada and Native Americans in the United States of different regions traded among themselves in the Pre-Columbian Era, but Europeans participated in the trade beginning from the time of their arrival in the New World and extended its reach to Europe. The French started trading in the 16th century, the English established trading posts on Hudson Bay in present-day Canada in the 17th century, and the Dutch had trade by the same time in New Netherland. The 19th-century North American fur trade, when the industry was at its peak of economic importance, involved the development of elaborate trade networks and companies.\\r\\nThe fur trade became one of the main economic ventures in North America attracting competition among the French, British, Dutch, Spanish, and Russians. Indeed, in the early history of the United States, capitalizing on this trade, and removing the British stranglehold over it, was seen as a major economic objective. Many Native American societies across the continent came to depend on the fur trade as their primary source of income. By the mid-1800s, however, changing fashions in Europe brought about a collapse in fur prices. The American Fur Company and some other companies failed. Many Native communities were plunged into long-term poverty and consequently lost much of the political influence they once had.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench explorer Jacques Cartier in his three voyages into the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the 1530s and 1540s conducted some of the earliest fur trading between European and First Nations peoples associated with sixteenth century and later explorations in North America. Cartier attempted limited fur trading with the First Nations in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and along the St. Lawrence River. He concentrated on trading for furs used as trimming and adornment. He overlooked the fur that would become the driving force of the fur trade in the north, the beaver pelt, which would become fashionable in Europe.[1]\\r\\nThe earliest European trading for beaver pelts dated to the growing cod fishing industry that spread to the Grand Banks of the North Atlantic in the 16th century. The new preservation technique of drying fish allowed the mainly Basque fishermen to fish near the Newfoundland coast and transport fish back to Europe for sale. Drying fish enabled gathering greater yields, which justified the economic cost and time of long voyages across the Atlantic. The fisherman sought suitable harbors with ample lumber to dry large quantities of cod. This generated their earliest contact with local Aboriginal peoples, with whom the fisherman began simple trading.\\r\\nThe fishermen traded metal items for beaver robes made of sewn-together, native-tanned, beaver pelts. They used the robes to keep warm on the long, cold return voyages across the Atlantic. These castor gras in French (or \\"beaver coat\\" in English) became prized by European hat makers in the second half of the 16th century, as they converted the pelts to fur felt.[2] The discovery of the superior felting qualities of beaver fur, along with the rapidly increasing popularity of beaver felt hats in fashion, transformed the incidental trading of fishermen in the sixteenth century into a growing trade in the French and later English territories in the next century.\\r\\nThe transition from a seasonal coastal trade into a permanent interior fur trade was formally marked with the foundation of Quebec on the St. Lawrence River in 1608 by Samuel de Champlain. This settlement marked the beginning of the westward movement of French traders from the first permanent settlement of Tadoussac at the mouth of the Saguenay River on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, up the St. Lawrence River and into the pays d'en haut (or \\"upper country\\") around the Great Lakes. What followed in the first half of the 17th century were strategic moves by both the French and the indigenous groups to further their own economic and geopolitical ambitions.\\r\\nSamuel de Champlain led the expansion while centralizing the French efforts. As native peoples had the primary role of suppliers in the fur trade, Champlain quickly created alliances with the Algonquin, Montagnais (who were located in the territory around Tadoussac), and most importantly, the Huron to the west. The latter, an Iroquoian-speaking people, served as middlemen between the French on the St. Lawrence and nations in the pays d'en haut. Champlain supported the northern groups in their preexisting military struggle with the Iroquois Confederacy to the south. He secured the Ottawa River route to Georgian Bay, greatly expanding the trade.[3] Champlain also sent young French men to live and work among the natives, most notably tienne Br?l, to learn the land, language, and customs, as well as to promote trade.[4]\\r\\nChamplain reformed the business of the trade, creating the first informal trust in 1613 in response to increasing losses due to competition.[5] The trust was later formalized with a royal charter, leading to a series of trade monopolies during the term of New France. The most notable monopoly was the Company of One Hundred Associates, with occasional concessions, such as to habitants in the 1640s and 1650s, permitting them limited trading. While the monopolies dominated the trade, their charters also required payment of annual returns to the national government, military expenditures, and expectations that they would encourage settlement for the sparsely populated New France.[6]\\r\\nThe vast wealth in the fur trade created enforcement problems for the monopoly. Unlicensed independent traders, known as coureurs des bois (or runners of the woods), began to do business in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Over time, many Mtis were drawn to the independent trade; they were the descendants of French trappers and native women. The increasing use of currency, as well as the importance of personal contacts and experience in the fur trade, gave an edge to independent traders over the more bureaucratic monopolies.[7] The newly established English colonies to the south quickly joined the lucrative trade, raiding the St. Lawrence River valley and capturing and controlling Quebec from 1629 to 1632.[8]\\r\\nWhile bringing wealth to a few select French traders and the French regime, the fur trade also brought profound changes to the indigenous groups living along the St. Lawrence. European wares, such as iron axe heads, brass kettles, cloth, and firearms were bought with beaver pelts and other furs. The widespread practice of trading furs for rum and whiskey led to problems associated with inebriation and alcohol abuse.[9] The subsequent destruction of beaver populations along the St. Lawrence heightened the fierce competition between the Iroquois and Huron for access to the rich fur-bearing lands of the Canadian Shield.[10] The competition for hunting is believed to have contributed to the earlier destruction of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians in the valley by 1600, likely by the Iroquois Mohawk tribe, who were located closest to them, were more powerful than the Huron, and had the most to gain by controlling this part of the valley.[11]\\r\\nIroquois access to firearms through Dutch and later English traders along the Hudson River increased the casualties in the warfare. This greater bloodshed, previously unseen in Iroquoian warfare, increased the practice of Mourning Wars. The Iroquois raided neighboring groups to take captives, who were ritually adopted to replace the dead Iroquois; thus a cycle of violence and warfare escalated. More significantly, new infectious diseases brought by the French decimated native groups and broke up their communities. Combined with warfare, disease led to the near destruction of the Huron by 1650.[10]\\r\\nThe era from roughly 1660 through 1763 saw a fierce rivalry grow between France and Great Britain as each European power struggled to expand their fur-trading territories. The two imperial powers and their native allies competed in conflicts that culminated in the French and Indian War, a part of the Seven Years' War in Europe.\\r\\nThe 1659-1660 voyage of French traders Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Mdard Chouart des Groseilliers into the country north and west of Lake Superior symbolically opened this new era of expansion. Their trading voyage proved extremely lucrative in furs. More importantly, they learned of a frozen sea to the north that provided easy access to the fur-bearing interior. Upon their return, French officials confiscated the furs of these unlicensed coureurs des bois. Radisson and Groseilliers went to Boston and then to London to secure funding and two ships to explore the Hudson Bay. Their success led to England's chartering of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1670, a major player in the fur trade for the next two centuries.\\r\\nFrench exploration and expansion westward continued with men such as La Salle and Marquette exploring and claiming the Great Lakes as well as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. To bolster these territorial claims, the French constructed a series of small fortifications, beginning with Fort Frontenac on Lake Ontario in 1673. Together with the construction of Le Griffon in 1679, the first full-sized sailing ship on the Great Lakes, the forts opened the upper Great Lakes to French navigation.[12]\\r\\nDuring the 1640s and 1650s, the Iroquois Wars forced a massive demographic shift as Iroquois western neighbors fled the violence. They sought refuge west and north of Lake Michigan.[13] More native groups learned about European wares and became trading middlemen, most notably the Ottawa. The competitive impact of the new English Hudson's Bay Company trade was felt as early as 1671, with diminished returns for the French and the role of the native middlemen. This new competition directly stimulated French expansion into the North West to win back native customers.[14] What followed was a continual expansion north and west of Lake Superior. The French used diplomatic negotiations with natives to win back trade and an aggressive military policy to temporarily eliminate the Hudson's Bay Company competition.[15] At the same time, the English presence in New England grew stronger, while the French were occupied with trying to combat the coureurs de bois and allied Indians from smuggling furs to the English for often higher prices and higher quality goods than they could offer.[16]\\r\\nThe settlement of native refugees from the Iroquois Wars in the western and northern Great Lakes combined with the decline of the Ottawa middlemen to create vast new markets for French traders. Resurgent Iroquoian warfare in the 1680s also stimulated the fur trade as native French allies bought weapons. The new more distant markets and fierce English competition stifled direct trade from the North West with Montreal. The old system of native middlemen and coureurs de bois traveling to trade fairs in Montreal or illegally to English markets was replaced by an increasingly complex and labor-intensive trade network. Licensed voyageurs, allied with Montreal merchants, used water routes to reach the far-flung corners of the North West with canoe loads of trade goods. These risky ventures required large initial investments and had a very slow return. The first revenues from fur sales in Europe did not arrive until four or more years after the initial investment. These economic factors concentrated the fur trade in the hands of a few large Montreal merchants who had available capital.[17] This trend expanded in the eighteenth century, and reached its zenith with the great fur-trading companies of the nineteenth century.\\r\\nThe effect on beaver stocks of competition between the English and the French was disastrous. The status of beavers changed dramatically as it went from being a source of food and clothing for the Aboriginals to a vital good for exchange with the Europeans. The French were constantly in search of cheaper fur and trying to cut off the Aboriginal middleman which led them to explore the interior all the way to Lake Winnipeg and the Central Plains. While some historians dispute the claims that the competition was predominantly responsible for over-exploitation of stocks,[18] others have used empirical analysis to emphasize the changing economic incentives for Aboriginals and role of the Europeans in the matter.[19] Innis holds that the population of beavers decreased dramatically even before the rivalry in the 1700s and stocks in far-flung western areas were increasingly being tapped before there was any serious competition between the English and the French.[citation needed] However, there is widespread agreement on the matter in ethnohistory literature that Aboriginals depleted the resource. Calvin Martin holds that there was a breakdown of the relationship between man and animal in the values of the Aboriginals which made them drastically accelerate the exploitation of reserves.[20]\\r\\nThe English and French had very different trading hierarchical structures. The Hudson's Bay Company had a technical monopoly of the beaver trade within the drainage basin of Hudson Bay while the Compagnie d'Occident was given a monopoly of the beaver trade farther south. The English organized their trade on strictly hierarchical lines while the French used licenses to lease the use of their posts. This meant that the French incentivized the extension of trade, and French traders did indeed infiltrate much of the Great Lakes region. The French established posts on Lake Winnipeg, Lac des Praires and Lake Nipigon which represented a serious threat to flow of furs to the York Factory. The increasing penetration near English ports now meant that the Aboriginals had more than one place to sell their goods.\\r\\nAs competition increased between the English and French in the 1700s, the fur was still predominantly caught by Aboriginal tribes which acted as the middleman. The response to increased competition led to a severe over-harvesting of beavers. Data from three of the trading posts of the Hudson's Bay Company show this trend.[21] The simulation of beaver populations around trading posts are done by taking into account the beaver returns from each trading post, biological evidence on beaver population dynamics and contemporary estimates of beaver densities. While the view that increased competition between the English and the French led to over-exploitation of beaver stocks by the Aboriginals does not receive uncritical support, most believe that Aboriginals were the primary actors in depleting animal stocks. However, there has been a lack of critical discussion on other factors such as beaver population dynamics, the number of animals harvested, nature of property rights, prices, role of the English and the French in the matter.\\r\\nThe primary effect of increased French competition was that the English raised the prices they paid to the Aboriginals to harvest fur. The result of this was greater incentive for Aboriginals to increase harvests. Increased price will lead to a gap between demand and supply and to a higher equilibrium in terms of supply. Data from the trading posts show that the supply of beavers from the Aboriginals was price-elastic and therefore traders responded with increased harvests as prices rose. The harvests were further increased due to the fact that no tribe had an absolute monopoly near any trade and most of them were competing against each other to derive the maximum benefit from the presence of the English and the French.[citation needed]\\r\\nAdditionally, the problem of the commons is also glaringly visible in this matter. Open access to resources leads to no incentive to conserve stocks, and actors which try to conserve lose out compared to the others when it comes to maximizing economic output. Therefore, there appeared to be a lack of concern by tribes of the First Nations about the sustainability of the fur trade. The problem of over-exploitation is not helped by the fact that the efforts by the French to remove the middlemen such as the Huron who increasingly resented their influence meant that stocks were put under more pressure. All these factors contributed to an unsustainable trade pattern in furs which depleted beaver stocks very fast.[citation needed]\\r\\nAn empirical study done by Ann M. Carlos and Frank D. Lewis shows that apart from the settling to a lower level of stable population, further declines were caused by over-harvesting in two of the three English trading posts (Albany and York). The data from the third trading post are also very interesting in that the post did not come under French pressure and was therefore shielded from the kind of over-exploitation of stocks which resulted at the other trading posts. At Fort Churchill, the stocks of beaver adjusted to the maximum sustained yield level. The data from Churchill further reinforce the case of over-exploitation of stocks caused by the French-English competition.[citation needed]\\r\\nBy the end of the 18th century the four major British fur trading outposts were Fort Niagara in modern New York, Fort Detroit and Fort Michilimackinac in modern Michigan, and Grand Portage in modern Minnesota, all located in the Great Lakes region.[22] The American Revolution and the resulting resolution of national borders forced the British to re-locate their trading centers northward. The newly formed United States began its own attempts to capitalize on the fur trade, initially with some success. However, by the 1830s the fur trade had begun a steep decline. Fur was never again the lucrative enterprise it had once been.\\r\\nOn the Pacific Coast of North America, the fur trade mainly pursued seal and sea otter. In northern areas, this trade was established first by the Russian-American Company, with later participation by Spanish/Mexican, British, and U.S. hunters/traders. Non-Russians extended fur-hunting areas south as far as the Baja California Peninsula.\\r\\nStarting in the mid-16th century, Europeans traded weapons and household goods in exchange for furs with Native Americans in southeast America.[23] The trade originally tried to mimic the fur trade in the north, with large quantities of wildcats, bears, beavers, and other fur bearing animals being traded.[24] The trade in fur coat animals decreased in the early 18th century, curtailed by the rising popularity of trade in deerskins.[24] The deerskin trade went onto dominate the relationships between the Native Americans of the southeast and the European settlers there. Deerskin was a highly valued commodity due to the deer shortage in Europe, and the British leather industry needed deerskins to produce goods.[25] The bulk of deerskins were exported to Great Britain during the peak of the deerskin trade.[26]\\r\\nNative Americanspecifically the Creek's -- beliefs revolved around respecting the environment. The Creek believed they had a unique relationship with the animals they hunted.[25] The Creek had several rules surround how a hunt could occur, particularly prohibiting needless killing of deer.[25] There were specific taboos against taking the skins of unhealthy deer.[25] However, the lucrative deerskin trade prompted hunters to act past the point of restraint they had operated under before.[25] The hunting economy collapsed due to the scarcity of deer as they were over-hunted and lost their lands to white settlers.[25] Due to the decline of deer populations, and the governmental pressure to switch to the colonists way of life, animal husbandry replaced deer hunting both as an income and in the diet.[27]\\r\\nRum was first introduced in the early 1700s as a trading item, and quickly became an inelastic good.[28] While Native Americans were for the most part acted conservatively in trading deals, they consumed a surplus of alcohol.[25] Traders used rum to help form partnerships.[28] Rum had a significant effect on the social behavior of Native Americans. Under the influence of rum, the younger generation did not obey the elders of the tribe, and became involved with more skirmishes with other tribes and white settlers.[25] Rum also disrupted the amount of time the younger generation of males spent on labor.[28] Alcohol was one of the goods provided on credit, and led to a debt trap for many Native Americans.[28] Native Americans did not know how to distill alcohol, and thus were driven to trade for it.[25]\\r\\nNative Americans had become dependent on manufactured goods such as guns and domesticated animals, and lost much of their traditional practices. With the new cattle herds roaming the hunting lands, and a greater emphasis on farming due to the invention of the Cotton Gin, Native Americans struggled to maintain their place in the economy.[27] An inequality gap had appeared in the tribes, as some hunters were more successful than others.[25] Still, the creditors treated and individuals debt as debt of the whole tribe, and used several strategies to keep the Native Americans in debt.[28] Traders would rig the weighing system that determined the value of the deerskins in their favor, cut measurement tools to devalue the deerskin, and would tamper with the manufactured goods to decrease their worth, such as watering down the alcohol they traded.[28] To satisfy the need for deerskins, many males of the tribes abandoned their traditional seasonal roles and became full-time traders.[28] When the deerskin trade collapsed, Native Americans found themselves dependent on manufactured goods, and could not return to the old ways due to lost knowledge.[28]\\r\\nSpanish exploratory parties in the 1500s had violent encounters with the powerful chiefdoms, which led to the decentralization of the indigenous people in the southeast.[29] Almost a century passed between the original Spanish exploration and the next wave of European immigration,[29] which allowed the survivors of the European diseases to organize into new tribes.[30] Most Spanish trade was limited with Indians on the coast until expeditions inland in the beginning of the 17th century.[23] By 1639, substantial trade between the Spanish in Florida and the Native Americans for deerskins developed, with more interior tribes incorporated into the system by 1647.[23] Many tribes throughout the southeast began to send trading parties to meet with the Spanish in Florida, or used other tribes as middlemen to obtain manufactured goods.[23] The Apalachees used the Apalachiola people to collect deerskins, and in return the Apalachees would give them silver, guns, or horses.[23]\\r\\nAs the English and French colonizers ventured into the southeast, the deerskin trade experienced a boom going into the 18th century.[25] Many of the English colonists who settled in the Carolinas in the late 1600s came from Virginia, where trading patterns of European goods in exchange for beaver furs already had started.[31] The white-tailed deer herds that roamed south of Virginia were a more profitable resource.[25] The French and the English struggled for control over Southern Appalachia and the Mississippi Valley, and needed alliances with the Indians there to maintain dominance.[28] The European colonizers used the trade of deerskins for manufactured goods to secure trade relationships, and therefore power.[24]\\r\\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, more organized violence than in previous decades occurred between the Native Americans involved in the deerskin trade and white settlers, most famously the Yamasee War. This uprising of Indians against fur traders almost wiped out the European colonists in the southeast.[28] The British promoted competition between tribes, and sold guns to both Creeks and Cherokees. This competition sprang out of the slave demand in the southeast √ø tribes would raid each other and sell prisoners into the slave trade of the colonizers.[28] France tried to outlaw these raids because their allies, the Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Yazoos bore the brunt of the slave trade.[28] Guns and other modern weapons were essential trading items for the Native Americans to protect themselves from slave raids; motivation which drove the intensity of the deerksin trade.[25][32] The need for Indian slaves decreased as African slaves began to be imported in larger quantities, and the focus returned to deerskins.[28] The drive for Indian slaves also was diminished post-Yamasee War to avoid furture uprisings.[32]\\r\\nThe Yamasees had collected extensive debt in the first decade of the 1700s due to buying manufactured goods on credit from traders, and then not being able to produce enough deerskins to pay the debt later on in the year.[33] Indians who were not able to pay their debt were often enslaved.[33] The practice of enslavement extended to the wives and children of the Yamsees in debt as well.[34] This process frustrated the Yamasees and other tribes, who lodged complaints against the deceitful credit-loaning scheme traders had enforced, along with methods of cheating or trade.[33] The Yamasees were a coastal tribe in the aread that is now known as South Carolina, and most of the white-tailed deer herds had moved inland for the better environment.[33] The Yamasees rose up against the English in South Carolina, and soon other tribes joined them, creating combatants from almost every nation in the South.[24][31] The British were able to defeat the Indian coalition with help from the Cherokees, cementing a pre-existing trade partnership.[31]\\r\\nAfter the uprisings, the Native Americans returned to making alliances with the European powers, using political savvy to get the best deals by playing the three nations off each other.[31] The Creek were particularly good at manipulation √ø they had begun trading with South Carolina in the last years of the 17th century and became a trusted deerskin provider.[33] The Creeks were already a wealthy tribe due to their control over the most valuable hunting lands, especially when compared to the impoverished Cherokees.[31] Due to allying with the British during the Yamasee War, the Cherokees lacked Indian trading partners and could not break with Britain to negotiate with France or Spain.[31]\\r\\nDeerskin trade was at its most profitable in the mid-18th century.[27] The Creeks rose up as the largest deerskin supplier, and the increase in supply only intensified European demand for deerskins.[27] Native Americans continued to negotiate the most lucrative trade deals by forcing the England, France, and Spain to compete for their supply of deerskins.[27] In the 1750 and 1760s, the Seven Years' War disrupted Frances ability to provide manufactures goods to its allies, the Choctaws and Chickasaw.[31] The French and Indian War further disrupted trade, as the British blockaded French goods.[31] The Cherokees allied themselves with France, who were driven out from the southeast in accordance with the Treaty of Paris in 1763.[31] The British were now the dominant trading power in the southeast.\\r\\nWhile both the Cherokee and the Creek were the main trading partners of the British, their relationships with the British were different. The Creeks adapted to the new economic trade system, and managed to hold onto their old social structures.[25] Originally Cherokee land was divided into five districts; however, the number soon grew to thirteen districts with 200 hunters assigned per district due to deerskin demand.[28]\\r\\nBoth Charleston and Savannah were the main trading ports for the export of deerskins.[28] Deerskins became the most popular export, and monetarily supported the colonies with the revenue produced by taxes on deerskins.[28] Charlestons trade was regulated by the Indian Trade Commission, composed of traders who monopolized the market and profited off the sale of deerskins.[28] From the beginning of the 18th century to mid-century, the deerskin exports of Charleston more than doubled in exports.[25] Charleston received tobacco and sugar from the West Indies and rum from the North in exchange for deerskins.[28] In return for deerskins, Great Britain sent woolens, guns, ammunition, iron tools, clothing, and other manufactured goods that were traded to the Native Americans.[28]\\r\\nThe Revolutionary War disrupted the deerskin trade, as the import of British manufactured goods with cut off.[25] The deerskin trade had already begun to decline due to over-hunting of deer.[33] The lack of trade caused the Native Americans to run out of items, such as guns, on which they depended.[25] Some Indians, such as the Creeks, tried to reestablish trade with the Spanish in Florida, where some loyalists were hiding as well.[25][31] When the war ended with the British retreating, many tribes who had fought on their side were now left unprotected and now had to make peace and new trading deals with the new country.[31] Many Native Americans were subject to violence from the new Americans who sought to settle their territory.[35] The new American government negotiated treaties that recognized prewar borders, such as those with the Choctaw and Chickasaw, and allowed open trade.[35]\\r\\nIn the two decades following the Revolutionary War, the United States government established new treaties with the Native Americans the provided hunting grounds and terms of trade.[25] However, the value of deerskins dropped as domesticated cattle took over the market, and many tribes soon found themselves in debt.[25][27] The Creeks began to sell their land to the government to try and pay their debts, and infighting among the Indians made it easy for white settles to encroach upon their lands.[25] The government also sought to encourage Native Americans to give up their old ways of subsistence hunting, and turn to farming and domesticated cattle for trade.[27]\\r\\nThe fur trade and its actors has played a certain role in films and popular culture. It was the topic of various books and films, from James Fenimore Cooper via Irving Pichels Hudson's Bay of 1941, the popular Canadian musical My Fur Lady (music by Galt MacDermot) of 1957, till Nicolas Vaniers documentaries. However, in contrast to \\"the huddy buddy narration of Canada as Hudson's country\\", propagated either in popular culture as well in elitist circles as the Beaver Club, founded 1785 in Montreal[36] the often male-centered scholarly description of the fur business does not fully describe the history. Chantal Nadeau, a communication scientist in Montreal's Concordia University refers to the \\"country wives\\" and \\"country marriages\\" between Indian women and European trappers[37] and the Filles du Roy[38] of the 18th century. Nadeau says that women have been described as a sort of commodity, \\"skin for skin\\", and they were essential to the sustainable prolongation of the fur trade.[39]\\r\\nNadeau describes fur as an essential, \\"the fabric\\" of Canadian symbolism and nationhood. She notes the controversies around the Canadian seal hunt, with Brigitte Bardot as a leading figure. Bardot, a famous actress, had been a model in the 1971 \\"Legend\\" campaign of the US mink label Blackglama, for which she posed nude in fur coats. Her involvement in anti-fur campaigns shortly afterward was in response to a request by the noted author Marguerite Yourcenar, who asked Bardot to use her celebrity status to help the anti-sealing movement. Bardot had successes as an anti-fur activist and changed from sex symbol to the grown-up mama of \\"white seal babies\\". Nadeau related this to her later involvement in French right-wing politics. The anti-fur movement in Canada was intertwined with the nation's exploration of history during and after the Quiet Revolution in Quebec, until the roll back of the anti-fur movement in the late 1990s.[40] Finally, the PETA celebrity campaign: \\"I'd rather go naked than wear fur\\", turned around the \\"skin for skin\\" motto and symbology against fur and the fur trade.\\r\\nAs men from the old fur trade in the Northeast made the trek west in the early nineteenth century, they sought to recreate the economic system from which they had profited in the Northeast. Some men went alone but others relied on companies like the Hudson Bay Company and the Missouri Fur Company. Marriage and kinship with native women would play an important role in the western fur trade. White traders who moved west needed to establish themselves in the kinship networks of the tribes, and they often did this by marrying a prominent Indian woman. This practice was called a country marriage and allowed the trader to network with the adult male members of the womans band, who were necessary allies for trade.[41] The children of these unions, who were known as Mtis, were an integral part of the fur trade system.\\r\\nThe Mtis label defined these children as a marginal people with a fluid identity.[42] Early on in the fur trade, Mtis were not defined by their racial category, but rather by the way of life they chose. These children were generally the offspring of white men and Native mothers and were often raised to follow the mothers lifestyle. The father could influence the enculturation process and prevent the child from being classified as Mtis[43] in the early years of the western fur trade. Fur families often included displaced native women who lived near forts and formed networks among themselves. These networks helped to create kinship between tribes which benefitted the traders. Catholics tried their best to validate these unions through marriages. But missionaries and priests often had trouble categorizing the women, especially when establishing tribal identity.[44]\\r\\nMtis were among the first groups of fur traders who came from the Northeast. These men were mostly of a mixed race identity, largely Iroquois, as well as other tribes from the Ohio country.[45] Rather than one tribal identity, many of these Mtis had multiple Indian heritages.[46] Lewis and Clark, who opened up the market on the fur trade in the Upper Missouri, brought with them many Mtis to serve as engags. These same Mtis would become involved in the early western fur trade. Many of them settled on the Missouri River and married into the tribes there before setting up their trade networks.[47] The first generation of Mtis born in the West grew up out of the old fur trade and provided a bridge to the new western empire.[48] These Mtis possessed both native and European skills, spoke multiple languages, and had the important kinship networks required for trade.[49] In addition, many spoke the Michif Mtis dialect. In an effort to distinguish themselves from natives, many Mtis strongly associated with Roman Catholic beliefs and avoided participating in native ceremonies.[50]\\r\\nBy the 1820s, the fur trade had expanded into the Rocky Mountains where American and British interests begin to compete for control of the lucrative trade. The Mtis would play a key role in this competition. The early Mtis congregated around trading posts where they were employed as packers, laborers, or boatmen. Through their efforts they helped to create a new order centered on the trading posts.[51] Other Mtis traveled with the trapping brigades in a loose business arrangement where authority was taken lightly and independence was encouraged. By the 1830s Canadians and Americans were venturing into the West to secure a new fur supply. Companies like the NWC and the HBC provided employment opportunities for Mtis. By the end of the 19th century, many companies considered the Mtis to be Indian in their identity. As a result, many Mtis left the companies in order to pursue freelance work.[52]\\r\\nAfter 1815 the demand for bison robes began to rise gradually, although the beaver still remained the primary trade item. The 1840s saw a rise in the bison trade as the beaver trade begin to decline.[53] Many Mtis adapted to this new economic opportunity. This change of trade item made it harder for Mtis to operate within companies like the HBC, but this made them welcome allies of the Americans who wanted to push the British to the Canada√øUS border. Although the Mtis would initially operate on both sides of the border, by the 1850s they were forced to pick an identity and settle either north or south of the border. The period of the 1850s was thus one of migration for the Mtis, many of whom drifted and established new communities or settled within existing Canadian, American or Indian communities.[54]\\r\\nA group of Mtis who identified with the Chippewa moved to the Pembina in 1819 and then to the Red River area in 1820, which was located near St. Fran?ois Xavier in Manitoba. In this region they would establish several prominent fur trading communities. These communities had ties to one another through the NWC. This relationship dated back to between 1804 and 1821 when Mtis men had served as low level voyageurs, guides, interpreters, and contre-maitres, or foremen. It was from these communities that Mtis buffalo hunters operating in the robe trade arose.\\r\\nThe Mtis would establish a whole economic system around the bison trade. Whole Mtis families were involved in the production of robes, which was the driving force of the winter hunt. In addition, they sold pemmican at the posts.[55] Unlike Indians, the Mtis were dependent on the fur trade system and subject to the market. The international prices of bison robes were directly influential on the well-being of Mtis communities. By contrast, the local Indians had a more diverse resource base and were less dependent on Americans and Europeans at this time.\\r\\nBy the 1850s the fur trade had expanded across the Great Plains, and the bison robe trade began to decline. The Mtis had a role in the depopulation of the bison. Like the Indians, the Mtis had a preference for cows, which meant that the bison had trouble maintaining their herds.[56] In addition, flood, drought, early frost, and the environmental impact of settlement posed further threats to the herds. Traders, trappers, and hunters all depended on the bison to sustain their way of life. The Mtis tried to maintain their lifestyle through a variety of means. For instance, they often used two wheel carts made from local materials, which meant that they were more mobile than Indians and thus were not dependent on following seasonal hunting patterns.[57]\\r\\nThe 1870s brought an end to the bison presence in the Red River area. Mtis communities like those at Red River or Turtle Mountain were forced to relocate to Canada and Montana. An area of resettlement was the Judith Basin in Montana, which still had a population of bison surviving in the early 1880s. By the end of decade, however, the bison were gone and Mtis hunters relocated back to tribal lands. They wanted to take part in treaty negotiations in the 1880s, but they had questionable status with tribes such as the Chippewa.[58] Many former Mtis bison hunters tried to get land claims during the treaty negotiations in 1879-1880. They were reduced to squatting on Indian land during this time and collecting bison bones for $15√ø20 a ton in order to purchase supplies for the winter. The reservation system did not ensure that the Mtis were protected and accepted as Indians. To further complicate matters, Mtis had a questionable status as citizens and were often deemed incompetent to give court testimonies and denied the right to vote.[59] The end of the bison robe trade was the end of the fur trade for many Mtis. This meant that they had to reestablish their identity and adapt to a new economic world.\\r\\nModern fur trapping and trading in North America is part of a wider $15 billion global fur industry where wild animal pelts make up only 15 percent of total fur output.\\r\\nIn 2008, the global recession hit the fur industry and trappers especially hard with greatly depressed fur prices thanks to a drop in the sale of expensive fur coats and hats. Such a drop in fur prices reflects trends of previous economic downturns.[60]\\r\\nIn 2013, the North American Fur Industry Communications group (NAFIC)[61] was established as a cooperative public educational program for the fur industry in Canada and the USA.

Agra is one of the most populous cities in Uttar Pradesh, and the 24th most populous in India.[5]\\r\\nAgra is a major tourist destination because of its many Mughal-era buildings, most notably the Tj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpr Sikrÿê, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[4] Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur; and the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, tourist circuit of UP state, along Lucknow and Varanasi. Agra falls within the Braj cultural region.\\r\\nThe city was first mentioned in the epic Mahbhrata, where it was called Agreva?a (derived from Sanskrit (???????) meaning \\"the border of the forest\\").[6]\\r\\nHowever, the 11th-century Persian poet Mas'd Sa'd Salmn writes of a desperate assault on the fortress of Agra, then held by the Shhÿê King Jayapala, by Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni.[7] It was mentioned for the first time in 1080 AD when a Ghaznavide force captured it. Sultan Sikandar Lodÿê (1488√ø1517) was the first to move his capital from Delhi to Agra in 1506. He governed the country from here and Agra assumed the importance of the second capital. He died in 1517 and his son, Ibrhÿêm Lodÿê, remained in power there for nine more years and several palaces, wells and a mosque were built by him in the fort during his period, finally being defeated at the Battle of Panipat in 1526.[8] Between 1540 and 1556, Afghans, beginning with Sher Shah Suri ruled the area. It was the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1556 to 1658.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAgra features a semiarid climate that borders on a humid subtropical climate. The city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a monsoon season. However the monsoons, though substantial in Agra, are not quite as heavy as the monsoon in other parts of India. This is a primary factor in Agra featuring a semiarid climate as opposed to a humid subtropical climate.\\r\\nAs of 2011[update] India census,[2][12] Agra city has a population of 1,585,704, while the population of Agra cantonment is 53,053.

After the Sultan's death, the city passed on to his son, Sultan Ibrhÿêm Lodÿê. He ruled his Sultanate from Agra until he fell fighting to Mughal Badshah Bbar in the First battle of Panipat fought in 1526.\\r\\nThe golden age of the city began with the Mughals. It was known then as Akbarabd and remained the capital of the Mughal Empire under the Badshahs Akbar, Jahngÿêr and Shh Jahn. Akbar made it the eponymous seat of one of his original twelve subahs (imperial top-level provinces), bordering (Old) Delhi, Awadh (Oudh), Allahabad, Malwa and Ajmer subahs. Shh Jahn later shifted his capital to Shhjahnabd in the year 1649.\\r\\nSince Akbarabd was one of the most important cities in India under the Mughals, it witnessed a lot of building activity. Babar, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, laid out the first formal Persian garden on the banks of river Yamuna. The garden is called the Arm Bgh or the Garden of Relaxation. His grandson Akbar the Great raised the towering ramparts of the Great Red Fort, besides making Agra a centre for learning, arts, commerce and religion. Akbar also built a new city on the outskirts of Akbarabd called Fatehpr Sikrÿê. This city was built in the form of a Mughal military camp in stone.\\r\\nHis son Jahngÿêr had a love of flora and fauna and laid many gardens inside the Red Fort or Ll Qil'a. Shh Jahn, known for his keen interest in architecture, gave Akbarabd its most prized monument, the Tj Mahal. Built in loving memory of his wife Mumtz Mahal, the mausoleum was completed in 1653.\\r\\nShh Jahn later shifted the capital to Delhi during his reign, but his son Aurangzeb moved the capital back to Akbarabd, usurping his father and imprisoning him in the Fort there. Akbarabd remained the capital of India during the rule of Aurangzeb until he shifted it to Aurangabad in the Deccan in 1653.\\r\\nAfter the decline of the Mughal Empire, the city came under the influence of Marathas and was called Agra, before falling into the hands of the British Raj in 1803.\\r\\nIn 1835 when the Presidency of Agra was established by the British, the city became the seat of government, and just two years later it was witness to the Agra famine of 1837√ø38. During the Indian rebellion of 1857 British rule across India was threatened, news of the rebellion had reached Agra on 11 May and on 30 May two companies of native infantry, the 44th and 67th regiments, rebelled and marched to Delhi. The next morning native Indian troops in Agra were forced to disarm, on 15 June Gwalior (which lies south of Agra) rebelled. By 3 July, the British were forced to withdraw into the fort. Two days later a small British force at Sucheta were defeated and forced to withdraw, this led to a mob sacking the city. However, the rebels moved onto Delhi which allowed the British to restore order by 8 July. Delhi fell to the British in September, the following month rebels who had fled Delhi along with rebels from Central India marched on Agra but were defeated. After this British rule was again secured over the city until the independence of India in 1947.[18]\\r\\nAgra is the birthplace of the religion known as Dÿên-i Ilhÿê, which flourished during the reign of Akbar and also of the Radhaswami Faith, which has around two million followers worldwide.

It is one of the New Seven Wonders of the world, and one of the three World Heritage Sites in Agra. Agra is commonly identified as the \\"City of Taj\\".[39]\\r\\nCompleted in 1653, the Tj Mahal was built by the Mughal king Shah Jahan as the final resting place for his beloved wife, Mumtz Mahal. Finished in marble, it is perhaps India's most beautiful monument and is set amidst landscaped gardens. Built by the Persian architect, Ustd 'ÿês, the Tj Mahal is on the south bank of the Yamuna River. It can be observed from Agra Fort from where Emperor Shh Jahn gazed at it for the last eight years of his life, a prisoner of his son Aurangzeb. Verses of the Quran are inscribed on it and at the top of the gate are twenty-two small domes, signifying the number of years the monument took to build. The Tj Mahal was built on a marble platform that stands above a sandstone one. The most elegant dome of the Tj Mahal has a diameter of 60 feet (18?m), and rises to a height of 80 feet (24?m); directly under this dome is the tomb of Mumtz Mahal. Shah Jahn's tomb was erected next to hers by his son Aurangzeb. The interiors are decorated with fine inlay work, incorporating semi-precious stones.\\r\\nAgra Fort (sometimes called the Red Fort), was commissioned by the conquering Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great in 1565, and is another of Agra's World Heritage Sites. A stone tablet at the gate of the Fort states that it had been built before 1000 but was later renovated by Akbar. The red sandstone fort was converted into a palace during Shh Jahn's time, and reworked extensively with marble and pietra dura inlay. Notable buildings in the fort include the Pearl Mosque or Motÿê Masjid, the Dÿêwn-e-'m and Dÿêwn-e-Khs (halls of public and private audience), Jahngÿêr's Palace, Khs Mahal, Shÿêsh Mahal (mirrored palace), and the Musamman Burj.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe forbidding exteriors of this fort conceal an inner paradise. The fort is crescent shaped, flattened on the east with a long, nearly straight wall facing the river. It has a total perimeter of 2.4 kilometres (1.5?mi), and is ringed by double castellated ramparts of red sandstone punctuated at regular intervals by bastions. A moat 9 metres (30?ft) wide and 10 metres (33?ft) deep surrounds the outer wall.\\r\\nChhatrapati Shÿêvajÿê visited the Agra Fort, as a result of the conditions of the Treaty of Purandar entered into with Mirz Rj Jaisingh to meet Aurangzeb in the Dÿêwn-i-Khs (Special Audience Chamber). In the audience he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. An insulted Shÿêvajÿê stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to Jai Sing's quarters on 12 May 1666. Fearing the dungeons and execution he escaped on 17 August 1666.\\r\\nThe fort is a typical example of Mughal architecture, effectively showing how the North Indian style of fort construction differed from that of the South. In the South, the majority of forts were built on the seabed like the one at Bekal in Kerala.[40]\\r\\nThe Mughal Emperor Akbar built Fatehpr Sikrÿê about 35?km (22?mi) from Agra, and moved his capital there. Later abandoned, the site displays a number of buildings of significant historical importance. A World Heritage Site, it is often visited by tourists. The name of the place came about after the Mughal Emperor Bbar defeated R? Sng in a battle at a place called Sikrÿê (about 40?km (25?mi) from Agra). Then the Mughal Emperor Akbar wanted to make Fatehpr Sikrÿê his headquarters, so he built a majestic fort; due to shortage of water, however, he had to ultimately move his headquarters to Agra Fort.\\r\\nBuland Darwza or 'the lofty gateway' was built by the great Mughal emperor, Akbar in 1601?CE. at Fatehpr Sikrÿê. Akbar built the Buland Darwza to commemorate his victory over Gujarat. The Buland Darwza is approached by 52 steps. The Buland Darwza is 53.63 metres (175.95 feet) high and 35 metres (115 feet) wide. it is made of red and buff sandstone, decorated by carving and black and white marble inlays. An inscription on the central face of the Buland Darwza demonstrates Akbar's religious broadmindedness, it is a message from Jesus advising his followers not to consider this world as their permanent home.\\r\\nThe Empress Nr Jahn built I'timd-Ud-Daulah's Tomb, sometimes called the \\"Baby Tj\\", for her father, Mirz Ghiys Beg, the Chief Minister of the Emperor Jahngÿêr. Located on the left bank of the Yamuna river, the mausoleum is set in a large cruciform garden, criss-crossed by water courses and walkways. The area of the mausoleum itself is about 23?m2 (250?sq?ft), and is built on a base that is about 50?m2 (540?sq?ft) and about one metre (3.3 feet) high. On each corner are hexagonal towers, about thirteen metres (43 feet) tall. Small in comparison to many other Mughal-era tombs, it is sometimes described as a jewel box. Its garden layout and use of white marble, pietra dura, inlay designs and latticework presage many elements of the Tj Mahal.\\r\\nThe walls are white marble from Rajasthan encrusted with semi-precious stone decorations √ø cornelian, jasper, lapis lazuli, onyx, and topaz in images of cypress trees and wine bottles, or more elaborate decorations like cut fruit or vases containing bouquets. Light penetrates to the interior through delicate jlÿê screens of intricately carved white marble.\\r\\nMany of Nr Jahn's relatives are interred in the mausoleum. The only asymmetrical element of the entire complex are the tombs of her father and mother, which have been set side-by-side, a formation replicated in the Taj Mahal.[clarification needed]\\r\\nSikandra, the last resting place of the Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great, is on the Delhi-Agra Highway, only 13 kilometres (8.1 miles) from the Agra Fort. Akbar's tomb reflects the completeness of his personality. The vast, beautifully carved, red-ochre sandstone tomb with deers, rabbits and langurs is set amidst a lush garden. Akbar himself planned his own tomb and selected a suitable site for it. To construct a tomb in one's lifetime was a Turkic custom which the Mughals followed religiously. Akbar's son Jahngÿêr completed construction of this pyramidal tomb in 1613. The 99 names of Allah have been inscribed on the tomb.\\r\\nThe Jma Masjid is a large mosque attributed to Shah Jahan's daughter, Princess Jahanara Begum, built in 1648, notable for its unusual dome and absence of minarets.

Shortly after 193, the northern regions were split off as Syria Coele in the north and Phoenice in the south, and the province Syria Palaestina was reduced to Judea.[citation needed] The earliest numismatic evidence for the name Syria Palaestina comes from the period of emperor Marcus Aurelius.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSyria was an early Roman province, annexed to the Roman Republic in 64 BC by Pompey in the Third Mithridatic War, following the defeat of Armenian King Tigranes the Great.[2] Following the partition of the Herodian kingdom into tetrarchies in 6 AD, it was gradually absorbed into Roman provinces, with Roman Syria annexing Iturea and Trachonitis.\\r\\nThe Roman province of Judea incorporated the regions of Judea, Samaria, and Idumea, and extended over parts of the former regions of the Hasmonean and Herodian kingdoms of Israel. It was named after Herod Archelaus's Tetrarchy of Judea, but the Roman province encompassed a much larger territory.\\r\\nThe capital of Roman Syria was established in Antioch from the very beginning of Roman rule, while the capital of the Judaea province was shifted to Caesarea Maritima, which, according to historian H. H. Ben-Sasson, had been the \\"administrative capital\\" of the region beginning in 6 AD.[3]\\r\\nJudea province was the scene of unrest at its founding in 6 AD during the Census of Quirinius and several wars were fought in its history, known as the Jewish√øRoman wars. The Temple was destroyed in 70 as part of the Great Jewish Revolt resulting in the institution of the Fiscus Judaicus. The Provinces of Judaea and Syria were key scenes of an increasing conflict between Judaean and Hellenistic population, which exploded into full scale Jewish√øRoman wars, beginning with the Great Jewish Revolt of 66√ø70. Disturbances followed throughout the region during the Kitos War in 117√ø118. Between 132√ø135, Simon bar Kokhba led a revolt against the Roman Empire, controlling parts of Judea but seemingly not Jerusalem, for three years. As a result, Hadrian sent Sextus Julius Severus to the region, who brutally crushed the revolt. Shortly before or after the Bar Kokhba's revolt (132√ø135), the Roman Emperor Hadrian changed the name of the Judea province and merged it with Roman Syria to form Syria Palaestina, while Jerusalem was renamed to Aelia Capitolina, which certain scholars conclude was done in an attempt to remove the relationship of the Jewish people to the region.[4][5][6]\\r\\nAfter crushing the Bar Kokhba revolt, the Roman Emperor Hadrian applied the name Syria Palestina to the entire region that had formerly included Judea province. Hadrian probably chose a name that revived the ancient name of Philistia (Palestine), combining it with that of the neighboring province of Syria, in an attempt to suppress Jewish connection to the land, although the actual Philistines from which the name derives had disappeared from history during the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911√ø605 BC).[4][7][8] The city of Aelia Capitolina was built by the emperor Hadrian on the ruins of Jerusalem. The capital of the enlarged province remained in Antiochia.\\r\\nIn 193, the province of Syria-Coele was split from Syria Palaestina. In the 3rd century, Syrians even reached for imperial power, with the Severan dynasty. Syria was of crucial strategic importance during the Crisis of the Third Century.\\r\\nBeginning in 212, Palmyra's trade diminished as the Sassanids occupied the mouth of the Tigris and the Euphrates. In 232, the Syrian Legion rebelled against the Roman Empire, but the uprising went unsuccessful.\\r\\nSeptimius Odaenathus, a Prince of the Aramean state of Palmyra, was appointed by Valerian as the governor of the province of Syria Palaestina. After Valerian was captured by the Sassanids in 260, and died in captivity in Bishapur, Odaenathus campaigned as far as Ctesiphon (near modern-day Baghdad) for revenge, invading the city twice. When Odaenathus was assassinated by his nephew Maconius, his wife Septimia Zenobia took power, ruling Palmyra on behalf of her son, Vabalathus.\\r\\nZenobia rebelled against Roman authority with the help of Cassius Longinus and took over Bosra and lands as far to the west as Egypt, establishing the short-lived Palmyrene Empire. Next, she took Antioch and large sections of Asia Minor to the north. In 272, the Roman Emperor Aurelian finally restored Roman control and Palmyra was besieged and sacked, never to recover her former glory. Aurelian captured Zenobia, bringing her back to Rome. He paraded her in golden chains in the presence of the senator Marcellus Petrus Nutenus, but allowed her to retire to a villa in Tibur, where she took an active part in society for years. A legionary fortress was established in Palmyra and although no longer an important trade center, it nevertheless remained an important junction of Roman roads in the Syrian desert.[9]\\r\\nDiocletian built the Camp of Diocletian in the city of Palmyra to harbor even more legions and walled it in to try and save it from the Sassanid threat. The Byzantine period following the Roman Empire only resulted in the building of a few churches; much of the city went to ruin.\\r\\nIn circa 390, Syria Palaestina was reorganised into the several administrative units: Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda, and Palaestina Tertia (in the 6th century),[10] Syria Prima and Phoenice and Phoenice Lebanensis. All were included within the larger Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Diocese of the East, together with the provinces of Isauria, Cilicia, Cyprus (until 536), Euphratensis, Mesopotamia, Osroene and Arabia Petraea.\\r\\nPalaestina Prima consisted of Judea, Samaria, the Paralia, and Peraea with the governor residing in Caesarea. Palaestina Secunda consisted of the Galilee, the lower Jezreel Valley, the regions east of Galilee, and the western part of the former Decapolis with the seat of government at Scythopolis. Palaestina Tertia included the Negev, southern Transjordan part of Arabiaand most of Sinai with Petra, as the usual residence of the governor. Palestina Tertia was also known as Palaestina Salutaris.[11]\\r\\nA number of events with far-reaching consequences took place, including religious schisms, such as Christianity branching off from Judaism.\\r\\nAfter the Jewish√øRoman wars (66√ø135), which Epiphanius believed the Cenacle survived,[12] the significance of Jerusalem to Christians entered a period of decline, Jerusalem having been temporarily converted to the pagan Aelia Capitolina, but interest resumed again with the pilgrimage of Helena (the mother of Constantine the Great) to the Holy Land c. 326√ø28.\\r\\nNew pagan cities were founded in Judea at Eleutheropolis (Bayt Jibrin), Diopolis (Lydd), and Nicopolis (Emmaus).[13][14]\\r\\nSecond Temple Judaism is Judaism between the construction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, c. 515 BCE, and its destruction by the Romans in 70 CE. The development of the Hebrew Bible canon, the synagogue, Jewish apocalyptic expectations for the future, and Christianity, can all be traced to the Second Temple period.\\r\\nFollowing the Jewish√øRoman wars, many Jews left the country altogether for the Diaspora communities, and large numbers of prisoners of war were sold as slaves throughout the Empire. This changed the perception of Jerusalem as the center of faith and autonomous Jewish communities shifted from centralized religious authority into more dispersed one.\\r\\nThe Romans destroyed the Jewish community of the Church in Jerusalem, which had existed since the time of Jesus.[15][verification needed] Traditionally it is believed the Jerusalem Christians waited out the Jewish√øRoman wars in Pella in the Decapolis.\\r\\nThe line of Jewish bishops in Jerusalem, which is claimed to have started with Jesus's brother James the Righteous as its first bishop, ceased to exist, within the Empire. Hans Kung in \\"Islam?:Past Present and Future\\", suggests that the Jewish Christians sought refuge in Arabia and he quotes with approval Clemen et al.:[16]\\r\\nChristianity was practiced in secret and the Hellenization of Palaestina continued under Septimius Severus (193√ø211 AD).[13]\\r\\nAs a large province, the territory of Syria-Palaestina comprised the Levant and the western part of Mesopotamia. In Northern Levant, the mixed pagan population of Phoenicians, Greeks and Romans formed the majority, alongside later arriving migrant Ismaelite Arab societies of Itureans and later also Qahtanite Ghassanids, who migrated to the area of Golantis in 4th century from what is today Yemen.\\r\\nIndigenous Assyrians were still populating western Mesopotamia and indeed Mesopotamia as a whole, while nomad Arameans, Nabateans and Bedouins, were thriving in the south Syrian Desert. In Southern Levant, until about 200 AD and despite the genocide of Jewish√øRoman wars, Jews had formed a majority of the population.[17] Due to the decline of Jewish population, Samaritans and Greco-Romans became the dominant societies in this region by the end of the 2nd century.\\r\\nBy the beginning of the medieval Roman (Byzantine) period (disestablishment of Syria-Palaestina), the Jews had become a minority and were living alongside Samaritans, pagan Greco-Syriacs and a large Syriac Christian community.[18] Other opinions however, put the majority population of southern Levant on Samaritans or Christian Byzantines.[clarification needed]","input":"What was the primary role of syria√øpalestine?"},{"output":"ca. 3500 BCE","context":"A zoo (short for zoological garden or zoological park and also called an animal park or menagerie) is a facility in which animals are housed within enclosures, displayed to the public, and in which they may also breed.\\r\\nThe term \\"zoological garden\\" refers to zoology, the study of animals, a term deriving from the Greek zon (?, 'animal') and l‹ágos (‹á?, 'study'). The abbreviation \\"zoo\\" was first used of the London Zoological Gardens, which was opened for scientific study in 1828 and to the public in 1857.[1] The number of major animal collections open to the public around the world now exceeds to 1,000, around 80 percent of them are in cities.[2] In the United States of America alone, zoos are visited by over 180 million people annually.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon Zoo, which opened in 1826, was initially known as the \\"Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological Society of London\\", and it described itself as a menagerie or \\"zoological forest\\".[4] The abbreviation \\"zoo\\" first appeared in print in the United Kingdom around 1847, when it was used for the Clifton Zoo, but it was not until some 20 years later that the shortened form became popular in the song \\"Walking in the Zoo\\" by music-hall artist Alfred Vance.[4] The term \\"zoological park\\" was used for more expansive facilities in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Washington, D.C., and the Bronx in New York, which opened in 1847, 1891 and 1899 respectively.[5]\\r\\nRelatively new terms for zoos coined in the late 20th century are \\"conservation park\\" or \\"biopark\\". Adopting a new name is a strategy used by some zoo professionals to distance their institutions from the stereotypical and nowadays criticized zoo concept of the 19th century.[6] The term \\"biopark\\" was first coined and developed by the National Zoo in Washington D.C. in the late 1980s.[7] In 1993, the New York Zoological Society changed its name to the Wildlife Conservation Society and rebranded the zoos under its jurisdiction as \\"wildlife conservation parks\\".[8]\\r\\nThe predecessor of the zoological garden is the menagerie, which has a long history from the ancient world to modern times. The oldest known zoological collection was revealed during excavations at Hierakonpolis, Egypt in 2009, of a ca. 3500 BCE menagerie. The exotic animals included hippopotami, hartebeest, elephants, baboons and wildcats.[9] King Ashur-bel-kala of the Middle Assyrian Empire created zoological and botanical gardens in the 11th century BCE. In the 2nd century BCE, the Chinese Empress Tanki had a \\"house of deer\\" built, and King Wen of Zhou kept a 1,500-acre (6.1?km2) zoo called Ling-Yu, or the Garden of Intelligence. Other well-known collectors of animals included King Solomon of the Kingdom of Israel and Judah, queen Semiramis and King Ashurbanipal of Assyria, and King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia.[2] By the 4th century BCE, zoos existed in most of the Greek city states; Alexander the Great is known to have sent animals that he found on his military expeditions back to Greece. The Roman emperors kept private collections of animals for study or for use in the arena,[2] the latter faring notoriously poorly. The 19th-century historian W. E. H. Lecky wrote of the Roman games, first held in 366 BCE:\\r\\nAt one time, a bear and a bull, chained together, rolled in fierce combat across the sand ... Four hundred bears were killed in a single day under Caligula ... Under Nero, four hundred tigers fought with bulls and elephants. In a single day, at the dedication of the Colosseum by Titus, five thousand animals perished. Under Trajan ... lions, tigers, elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotami, giraffes, bulls, stags, even crocodiles and serpents were employed to give novelty to the spectacle.[10]\\r\\nCharlemagne had an elephant named Abul-Abbas that was given to him by the Abbasid Caliph. Henry I of England kept a collection of animals at his palace in Woodstock, which reportedly included lions, leopards, and camels.[11] The most prominent collection in medieval England was in the Tower of London, created as early as 1204 by King John I.\\r\\nHenry III received a wedding gift in 1235 of three leopards from Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, and in 1264, the animals were moved to the Bulwark, renamed the Lion Tower, near the main western entrance of the Tower. It was opened to the public during the reign of Elizabeth I in the 16th century.[12] During the 18th century, the price of admission was three half-pence, or the supply of a cat or dog for feeding to the lions.[11] The animals were moved to the London Zoo when it opened.\\r\\nAztec emperor Moctezuma had in his capital city of Tenochtitlan a \\"house of animals\\" with a large collection of birds, mammals and reptiles in a garden tended by more than 600 employees. The garden was described by several Spanish conquerors, including Hernn Corts in 1520. After the Aztec revolt against the Spanish rule, and during the subsequent battle for the city, Corts reluctantly ordered the zoo to be destroyed.[13]\\r\\nThe oldest zoo in the world still in existence is the Tiergarten Sch?nbrunn in Vienna, Austria. It was constructed by Adrian van Stekhoven in 1752 at the order of the Holy Roman Emperor Francis I, husband of Maria Theresa of Austria, to serve as an imperial menagerie as part of Sch?nbrunn Palace. The menagerie was initially reserved for the viewing pleasure of the imperial family and the court, but was made accessible to the public in 1765.\\r\\nIn 1775, a zoo was founded in Madrid, and in 1795, the zoo inside the Jardin des Plantes in Paris was founded by Jacques-Henri Bernardin, with animals from the royal menagerie at Versailles, primarily for scientific research and education. The Kazan Zoo, the first zoo in Russia was founded in 1806 by the Professor of Kazan State University Karl Fuchs.\\r\\nUntil the early 19th century, the function of the zoo was often to symbolize royal power, like King Louis XIV's menagerie at Versailles. The modern zoo that emerged in the early 19th century at Halifax, London, Paris and Dublin, was focused on providing educational exhibits to the public for entertainment and inspiration.[14]\\r\\nA growing fascination for natural history and zoology, coupled with the tremendous expansion in the urbanization of London, led to a heightened demand for a greater variety of public forms of entertainment to be made available. The need for public entertainment, as well as the requirements of scholarly research, came together in the founding of the first modern zoos.\\r\\nThe Zoological Society of London was founded in 1826 by Stamford Raffles and established the London Zoo in Regent's Park two years later in 1828.[15] At its founding, it was the world's first scientific zoo.[2][16] Originally intended to be used as a collection for scientific study, it was eventually opened to the public in 1847.[16] The Zoo was located in Regent's Park - then undergoing development at the hands of the architect John Nash. What set the London zoo apart from its predecessors was its focus on society at large. The zoo was established in the middle of a city for the public, and its layout was designed to cater for the large London population. The London zoo was widely copied as the archetype of the public city zoo.[17] In 1853, the Zoo opened the world's first public aquarium.\\r\\nDowns' Zoological Gardens Created by Andrew Downs and opened to the Nova Scotia public in 1847. Was originally intended to be used as a collection for scientific study. By the early 1860s, the zoo grounds covered 40 hectares with many fine flowers & ornamental trees, picnic areas, statues, walking paths, The Glass House (which contained a greenhouse with an aviary, aquarium, & museum of stuffed animals & birds), a pond, a bridge over a waterfall, an artificial lake with a fountain, a wood-ornamented greenhouse, a forest area, and enclosures & buildings.[18][19][20]\\r\\nDublin Zoo was opened in 1831 by members of the medical profession interested in studying animals while they were alive and more particularly getting hold of them when they were dead.[21] The first zoological garden in Australia was Melbourne Zoo in 1860. In the same year, Central Park Zoo, the first public zoo in the United States, opened in New York, although in 1859, the Philadelphia Zoological Society had made an effort to establish a zoo, but delayed opening it until 1874 because of the American Civil War.\\r\\nIn 1907, the German entrepreneur Carl Hagenbeck founded the Tierpark Hagenbeck in Stellingen, now a quarter of Hamburg. His zoo was a radical departure from the layout of the zoo that had been established in 1828. It was the first zoo to use open enclosures surrounded by moats, rather than barred cages, to better approximate animals' natural environments.[22] He also set up mixed-species exhibits and based the layout on the different organizing principle of geography, as opposed to taxonomy.\\r\\nWhen ecology emerged as a matter of public interest in the 1970s, a few zoos began to consider making conservation their central role, with Gerald Durrell of the Jersey Zoo, George Rabb of Brookfield Zoo, and William Conway of the Bronx Zoo (Wildlife Conservation Society) leading the discussion. From then on, zoo professionals became increasingly aware of the need to engage themselves in conservation programs, and the American Zoo Association soon said that conservation was its highest priority.[23] Because they wanted to stress conservation issues, many large zoos stopped the practice of having animals perform tricks for visitors. The Detroit Zoo, for example, stopped its elephant show in 1969, and its chimpanzee show in 1983, acknowledging that the trainers had probably abused the animals to get them to perform.[24]\\r\\nWhipsnade Park in Bedfordshire, England, was opened in 1931 as the first safari park. It allowed visitors to drive through the enclosures and come into close proximity to the animals.\\r\\nMass destruction of wildlife habitat has yet to cease all over the world and many species such as elephants, big cats, penguins, tropical birds, primates, rhinos, exotic reptiles, and many others are in danger of dying out. Many of today's zoos hope to stop or slow the decline of many endangered species. Many zoos see their primary purpose as breeding endangered species in captivity and reintroducing them into the wild. Modern zoos also aim to help teach visitors the importance on animal conservation, often through letting visitors witness the animals firsthand.[25] Some critics and the majority of animal rights activists say that zoos, no matter what their intentions are, or how noble they are, are immoral and serve as nothing but to fulfill human leisure at the expense of the animals (which is an opinion that has spread over the years). However, zoo advocates argue that their efforts make a difference in wildlife conservation and education.[25]\\r\\nHuman beings were sometimes displayed in cages along with non-human animals, to illustrate the differences between people of European and non-European origin. In September 1906, William Hornaday, director of the Bronx Zoo in New Yorkwith the agreement of Madison Grant, head of the New York Zoological Societyhad Ota Benga, a Congolese pygmy, displayed in a cage with the chimpanzees, then with an orangutan named Dohong, and a parrot. The exhibit was intended as an example of the \\"missing link\\" between the orangutan and white man. It triggered protests from the city's clergymen, but the public reportedly flocked to see it.[26][27]\\r\\nHuman beings were also displayed in cages during the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition, and as late as 1958 in a \\"Congolese village\\" display at Expo '58 in Brussels.[28]\\r\\nZoo animals live in enclosures that often attempt to replicate their natural habitats or behavioral patterns, for the benefit of both the animals and visitors. Nocturnal animals are often housed in buildings with a reversed light-dark cycle, i.e. only dim white or red lights are on during the day so the animals are active during visitor hours, and brighter lights on at night when the animals sleep. Special climate conditions may be created for animals living in extreme environments, such as penguins. Special enclosures for birds, mammals, insects, reptiles, fish, and other aquatic life forms have also been developed. Some zoos have walk-through exhibits where visitors enter enclosures of non-aggressive species, such as lemurs, marmosets, birds, lizards, and turtles. Visitors are asked to keep to paths and avoid showing or eating foods that the animals might snatch.\\r\\nSome zoos keep animals in larger, outdoor enclosures, confining them with moats and fences, rather than in cages. Safari parks, also known as zoo parks and lion farms, allow visitors to drive through them and come in close proximity to the animals.[2] Sometimes, visitors are able to feed animals through the car windows. The first safari park was Whipsnade Park in Bedfordshire, England, opened by the Zoological Society of London in 1931 which today (2014) covers 600 acres (2.4?km2). Since the early 1970s, a 1,800 acre (7?km2) park in the San Pasqual Valley near San Diego has featured the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, run by the Zoological Society of San Diego. One of two state-supported zoo parks in North Carolina is the 2,000-acre (8.1?km2) North Carolina Zoo in Asheboro.[29] The 500-acre (2.0?km2) Werribee Open Range Zoo in Melbourne, Australia, displays animals living in an artificial savannah.\\r\\nThe first public aquarium was opened in London Zoo in 1853. This was followed by the opening of public aquaria in continental Europe (e.g. Paris in 1859, Hamburg in 1864, Berlin in 1869, and Brighton in 1872) and the United States (e.g. Boston in 1859, Washington in 1873, San Francisco Woodward's Garden in 1873, and the New York Aquarium at Battery Park in 1896).\\r\\nRoadside zoos are found throughout North America, particularly in remote locations. They are often small, for-profit zoos, often intended to attract visitors to some other facility, such as a gas station. The animals may be trained to perform tricks, and visitors are able to get closer to them than in larger zoos.[30] Since they are sometimes less regulated, roadside zoos are often subject to accusations of neglect[31] and cruelty.[32]\\r\\nIn June 2014 the Animal Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Iowa-based roadside Cricket Hollow Zoo for violating the Endangered Species Act by failing to provide proper care for its animals.[33] Since filing the lawsuit, ALDF has obtained records from investigations conducted by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services; these records show that the zoo is also violating the Animal Welfare Act.[34]\\r\\nA petting zoo, also called petting farms or children's zoos, features a combination of domestic animals and wild species that are docile enough to touch and feed. To ensure the animals' health, the food is supplied by the zoo, either from vending machines or a kiosk nearby.\\r\\nAn animal theme park is a combination of an amusement park and a zoo, mainly for entertaining and commercial purposes. Marine mammal parks such as Sea World and Marineland are more elaborate dolphinariums keeping whales, and containing additional entertainment attractions. Another kind of animal theme park contains more entertainment and amusement elements than the classical zoo, such as a stage shows, roller coasters, and mythical creatures. Some examples are Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in Tampa, Florida, Disney's Animal Kingdom and Gatorland in Orlando, Florida, Flamingo Land in North Yorkshire, England, and Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, California.\\r\\nBy the year 2000 most animals being displayed in zoos were the offspring of other zoo animals. This trend, however was and still is somewhat species-specific. When animals are transferred between zoos, they usually spend time in quarantine, and are given time to acclimatize to their new enclosures which are often designed to mimic their natural environment. For example, some species of penguins may require refrigerated enclosures. Guidelines on necessary care for such animals is published in the International Zoo Yearbook.[35]\\r\\nThe position of most modern zoos in Australasia, Asia, Europe, and North America, particularly those with scientific societies, is that they display wild animals primarily for the conservation of endangered species, as well as for research purposes and education, and secondarily for the entertainment of visitors,[36][37] an argument disputed by critics. The Zoological Society of London states in its charter that its aim is \\"the advancement of Zoology and Animal Physiology and the introduction of new and curious subjects of the Animal Kingdom.\\" It maintains two research institutes, the Nuffield Institute of Comparative Medicine and the Wellcome Institute of Comparative Physiology. In the U.S., the Penrose Research Laboratory of the Philadelphia Zoo focuses on the study of comparative pathology.[2] The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums produced its first conservation strategy in 1993, and in November 2004, it adopted a new strategy that sets out the aims and mission of zoological gardens of the 21st century.[38]\\r\\nThe breeding of endangered species is coordinated by cooperative breeding programmes containing international studbooks and coordinators, who evaluate the roles of individual animals and institutions from a global or regional perspective, and there are regional programmes all over the world for the conservation of endangered species.[39]\\r\\nBesides conservation of captive species, large zoos may form a suitable environment for wild native animals such as herons to live in or visit. A colony of black-crowned night herons has regularly summered at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. for more than a century.[40] Some zoos may provide information to visitors on wild animals visiting or living in the zoo, or encourage them by directing them to specific feeding or breeding platforms.[41][42]\\r\\nIn modern, well-regulated zoos, breeding is controlled to maintain a self-sustaining, global captive population. This is not the case in some less well-regulated zoos, often based in poorer regions. Overall \\"stock turnover\\" of animals during a year in a select group of poor zoos was reported as 20%-25% with 75% of wild caught apes dying in captivity within the first 20 months.[43] The authors of the report stated that before successful breeding programs, the high mortality rate was the reason for the \\"massive scale of importations.\\"\\r\\nOne 2-year study indicated that of 19,361 mammals that left accredited zoos in the U.S. between 1992 and 1998, 7,420 (38%) went to dealers, auctions, hunting ranches, unaccredited zoos and individuals, and game farms.[44]\\r\\nThe welfare of zoo animals varies widely. Many zoos work to improve their animal enclosures and make it fit the animals' needs, although constraints such as size and expense make it difficult to create ideal captive environments for many species.[45][46]\\r\\nA study examining data collected over four decades found that polar bears, lions, tigers and cheetahs show evidence of stress in captivity.[47] Zoos can be internment camps for animals, but also a place of refuge. A zoo can be considered an internment camp due to the insufficient enclosures that the animals have to live in. When an elephant is placed in a pen that is flat, has no tree, no other elephants and only a few plastic toys to play with; it can lead to boredom and foot problems (Lemonic, McDowel, and Bjerklie 50). Also, animals can have a shorter life span when they are in these types of enclosures. Causes can be human diseases, materials in the cages, and possible escape attempts (Bendow 382). When zoos take time to think about the animal's welfare, zoos can become a place of refuge. There are animals that are injured in the wild and are unable to survive on their own, but in the zoos they can live out the rest of their lives healthy and happy (McGaffin). In recent years, some zoos have chosen to stop showing their larger animals because they are simply unable to provide an adequate enclosure for them (Lemonic, McDowell, and Bjerklie 50).\\r\\nSome critics and many animal rights activists argue that zoo animals are treated as voyeuristic objects, rather than living creatures, and often suffer due to the transition from being free and wild to captivity.[48] In the last 2 decades, European and North-American zoos, strongly depend on breeding within zoos, while decreasing the number of wild caught animals.[clarification needed]\\r\\nMany modern zoos attempt to improve animal welfare by providing more space and behavioural enrichments. This often involves housing the animals in naturalistic enclosures that allow the animals to express some of their natural behaviours, such as roaming and foraging. However, many animals remain in barren concrete enclosures or other minimally enriched cages.[49]\\r\\nAnimals which naturally range over many km each day, or make seasonal migrations, are unable to perform these behaviours in zoo enclosures. For example, elephants usually travel approximately 45?km (28?mi) each day.[50]\\r\\nAnimals in zoos often exhibit behaviors that are abnormal in their frequency, intensity, or would not normally be part of their behavioural repertoire. These are usually indicative of stress.[51] For example, elephants sometimes perform head-bobbing, bears sometimes pace repeatedly around the limits of their enclosure, wild cats sometimes groom themselves obsessively, and birds pluck out their own feathers.[50] Some critics of zoos claim that the animals are always under physical and mental stress, regardless of the quality of care towards the animals.[52] Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos.[53]\\r\\nElephants in Japanese zoos have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long as those in the wild.[54] Although, most other animals, such as reptiles, and others, can live much longer than they would in the wild.\\r\\nClimatic conditions can make it difficult to keep some animals in zoos in some locations. For example, Alaska Zoo had an elephant named Maggie. She was housed in a small, indoor enclosure because the outdoor temperature was too low.[55][56]\\r\\nEspecially in large animals, a limited number of spaces are available in zoos. As a consequence, various management tools are used to preserve the space for the most \\"valuable\\" individuals and reduce the risk of inbreeding. Management of animal populations is typically through international organizations such as AZA and EAZA.[57] Zoos have several different ways of managing the animal populations, such as moves between zoos, contraception, sale of excess animals and euthanization (culling).[58]\\r\\nContraception can be effective, but may also have health repercussions and can be difficult (or even impossible) to reverse in some animals.[59] Additionally, some species may lose their reproductive capability entirely if prevented from breeding for a period (whether through contraceptives or isolation), but further study is needed on the subject.[57] Sale of surplus animals from zoos was once common and in some cases animals have ended up in substandard facilities. In recent decades the practice of selling animals from certified zoos has declined.[58] A large number of animals are culled each year in zoos, but this is controversial.[60] A highly publicized culling as part of population management was that of a healthy giraffe at Copenhagen Zoo in 2014. The zoo argued that its genes already were well-represented in captivity, making the giraffe unsuitable for future breeding. There were offers to adopt it and an online petition to save it had many thousand signatories, but the culling proceeded.[61] Although zoos in some countries have been open about culling, the controversy of the subject and pressure from the public has resulted in others being closed.[58] This stands in contrast to most zoos publicly announcing animal births.[58] Furthermore, while many zoos are willing to cull smaller and/or low-profile animals, fewer are willing to do it with larger high-profile species.[58][60]\\r\\nIn many countries, feeding live vertebrates to zoo animals is illegal, except in exceptional circumstances.[citation needed] For example, some snakes refuse to eat dead prey. However, in the Badaltearing Safari Park in China, visitors can throw live goats into the lion enclosure and watch them being eaten, or can purchase live chickens tied to bamboo rods for the equivalent of 2 dollars/euros to dangle into lion pens. Visitors can drive through the lion compound in buses with specially designed chutes which they can use to push live chickens into the enclosure. In the Xiongsen Bear and Tiger Mountain Village near Guilin in south-east China, live cows and pigs are thrown to tigers to amuse visitors.[62][63]\\r\\nIn Qingdao zoo (Eastern China), visitors can engage in \\"tortoise baiting\\", where tortoises are kept inside small rooms with elastic bands around their necks so that they are unable to retract their heads. Visitors are allowed to throw coins at them. The marketing claim is that if a person hits one of the tortoises on the head and makes a wish, it will be fulfilled.[62]\\r\\nIn the United States, any public animal exhibit must be licensed and inspected by the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Depending on the animals they exhibit, the activities of zoos are regulated by laws including the Endangered Species Act, the Animal Welfare Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and others.[64] Additionally, zoos in North America may choose to pursue accreditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). To achieve accreditation, a zoo must pass an application and inspection process and meet or exceed the AZA's standards for animal health and welfare, fundraising, zoo staffing, and involvement in global conservation efforts. Inspection is performed by three experts (typically one veterinarian, one expert in animal care, and one expert in zoo management and operations) and then reviewed by a panel of twelve experts before accreditation is awarded. This accreditation process is repeated once every five years. The AZA estimates that there are approximately 2,400 animal exhibits operating under USDA license as of February 2007; fewer than 10% are accredited.[65]\\r\\nIn April 1999, the European Union introduced a directive to strengthen the conservation role of zoos, making it a statutory requirement that they participate in conservation and education, and requiring all member states to set up systems for their licensing and inspection.[66] Zoos are regulated in the UK by the Zoo Licensing Act of 1981, which came into force in 1984. A zoo is defined as any \\"establishment where wild animals are kept for exhibition ... to which members of the public have access, with or without charge for admission, seven or more days in any period of twelve consecutive months\\", excluding circuses and pet shops. The Act requires that all zoos be inspected and licensed, and that animals kept in enclosures are provided with a suitable environment in which they can express most normal behavior.[66]\\r\\n Media related to Zoos at Wikimedia Commons","input":"When did the first zoo in the world open?"},{"output":"no maximum length","context":"The numerous Formula One regulations, made and enforced by the FIA and later the FISA, have changed dramatically since the first Formula One World Championship in 1950. This article covers the current state of F1 technical and sporting regulations, as well as the history of the technical regulations since 1950.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn F1 car can be no more than 200?cm wide and 95?cm tall.[1] Though there is no maximum length, other rules set indirect limits on these dimensions, and nearly every aspect of the car carries size regulations; consequently the various cars tend to be very close to the same size.\\r\\nThe car must only have four wheels mounted externally of the body work with only the front two steered and only the back two driven. There are minimum distances allowed between the wheels and the rear and front body work.\\r\\nThe main chassis contains a \\"safety cell\\" which includes the cockpit, a structure designed to reduce impact directly in front of the cockpit, and the fuel cell directly behind the cockpit. Additionally, the car must contain roll structures behind and ahead of the driver. The driver must be able to enter and exit the cockpit without any adjustments other than removing the steering wheel.\\r\\nThere are also mandatory crash test standards. There is a 30?mph (48?km/h) head-on impact into a steel barrier; \\"average deceleration must not exceed 25g\\", with a maximum 60g for a minimum 3 milliseconds, with no damage to the chassis beyond the nose section.[2] The same chassis must then sustain a rear impact from a sled travelling at 30?mph (48?km/h), with no damage in front of the rear axle.[2] The roll hoop is not permitted to crush beyond 50?mm (2.0?in), and structural failure is only permitted in the top 100?mm (3.9?in) of the body.[3] Side impacts by a 780?kg (1,720?lb) object at 10?m/s (22?mph) must be decelerated at less than 20g, and absorb no less than 15% and no more than 35% of the total energy; 80?kN (18,000?lbf) can not be exceeded more than 3 milliseconds.[3] The steering wheel must survive the impact of an 8?kg (18?lb) 165?mm (6.5?in)-diameter object at 7?m/s (16?mph) with no deformation of the wheel or damage to the quick-release mechanism.[3]\\r\\nIn addition, there are \\"squeeze tests\\" on the cockpit sides, fuel tank, and nosebox. The cockpit must survive a 25?kN (5,600?lbf) pressure with no failure; for the fuel tank, 12.5?kN (2,800?lbf) is applied. A maximum 3?mm (0.12?in) deformation is allowed.[3] For the cockpit rim, the figures are 10?kN (2,200?lbf) and 20?mm (0.79?in).[3] The nosebox must withstand 40?kN (9,000?lbf) for 30 seconds without failing.[3]\\r\\nOnboard electrical and computer systems, once inspected at the start of the season, may not be changed without prior approval. Electronic starters and launch control are forbidden.[citation needed] The computers must contain a telemetric accident data reporting system.\\r\\n2.4 litre V8 engines were used in 2013 season. However, the 2014 season brought a major change in engine technology by introducing the 1.6 litre turbocharged V6 engine.\\r\\nThe power outputs of F1 engines have not been disclosed since the 1990s, however the consensus view is that today's 1.6?l turbocharged V-6 engines produce about 600?bhp.\\r\\nAnother radical change in 2014 was the introduction of ERS(Energy Recovery System). This system works similar to KERS, with drivers getting full-time boost of about 150?bhp from electric motors used in conjunction with the internal combustion engine (generating around 750?bhp in total) instead of a 6-second bank of extra power per lap. The combination of these systems led to the term power unit being used in lieu of engine.\\r\\nDevices designed to pre-cool air before it enters the cylinders are not allowed, nor is the injection of any substance into the cylinders other than air and fuel (petrol).\\r\\nVariable-length intake and exhaust systems are also forbidden.\\r\\nThe crankshaft and camshafts must be made of steel or cast iron. The use of carbon composite materials for the cylinder block, cylinder head and pistons is not allowed.\\r\\nSeparate starting devices may be used to start engines in the pits and on the grid. If the engine is fitted with an anti-stall device, this must be set to cut the engine within ten seconds in the event of an accident.\\r\\nThe engines, now referred to as power units, are divided into 6 components: the internal combustion engine (ICE); turbocharger (TC); Motor Generator Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K), which harvests energy that would normally be wasted under braking; Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H), which collects energy in the form of heat as it is expelled through the exhaust; Energy Store (ES), which functions as batteries, holding the energy gathered by the Motor Generator Units; and Control Electronics (CE), which includes the Electronic Control Unit and software used to manage the entire power unit. In 2015, each driver is allowed to use up to four of each component during a season that is up to 20 scheduled races in length; a fifth power unit (and its components) may be used without penalty if more than 20 races are scheduled to take place. A ten place starting grid penalty will be applied for the use of a power unit component used beyond the established allocation; a pit lane start for entire unit changes beyond the limit.\\r\\nFrom 2010, refuelling is no longer permitted during the race: every car starts with a full fuel load. The 2010 season cars were about 22?cm longer than 2009 cars to accommodate the enlarged fuel tank this necessitated.\\r\\nFormula 1 has contracted a single supplier of tyres since the 2007 season. The supplier (currently Pirelli) supplies five specifications of slick dry-weather tyres (ultra soft, super soft, soft, medium and hard) (Ultra soft being introduced during Monaco 2016), of which two compounds are provided at each race; these are referred to as the \\"Prime\\" and \\"Option\\" tyres. The distinction between Prime and Option is that the teams are supplied with more sets of the Prime than the Option tyre for use throughout the weekend. Usually the Prime tyre is harder and therefore more durable than the Option tyre, while the Option tyre provides more grip and therefore allows faster lap times on fresh tyres; at some events the selection is reversed, with the Option tyre being harder than the Prime. The combination of longer lasting and faster tyres adds an element to each car's race strategy. Additionally, two wet-weather compounds are provided by the supplier: intermediate and full wet. Each compound is differentiated by a colour-coded band painted around the tyre's sidewall and including the supplier's logo; purple for ultra soft, red for super-soft, yellow for soft, white for medium, orange for hard, green for intermediate and blue for full wet.\\r\\nCompetitors are allowed only a limited number of tyre sets during a race event: eleven dry, four intermediate, three wet. Each tyre must be marked with a unique identifier for tracking and scrutinising during a race event. During the practice sessions drivers are limited to the use of three sets of dry tyres, and certain sets must be returned to the supplier before the second and third sessions. If qualifying and starting the race on dry tyres, drivers who complete a lap during the third period of qualifying (the top ten) must start the race on the tyre set with which they recorded their fastest time during the second period.[4] Any cars that qualified outside the top ten may start the race on any remaining set of tyres. Cars must race on both the Prime and Option dry compounds during a race unless intermediate or wet tyres have been used by that car in that race.\\r\\nPrior to qualifying, wet and intermediate tyres may only be used if the track is judged wet by the race director. Starting the race behind the safety car due to heavy rain requires cars to be fitted with wet tyres until they make a pit stop.\\r\\nHeaters may be applied only to the outside of tyres.\\r\\nAfter weighing during each qualifying session, teams are required to take their cars to a place in the paddock, sectioned off by the FIA, known as parc ferm; they may not do work on the cars, other than routine maintenance, until they are released from parc ferm for the race the next morning.\\r\\nIf a team must do other significant work, body work or suspension adjustments, the car will start from the pit lane.\\r\\nThe pit lane opens thirty minutes before the start of a race (t-30:00), during which time drivers may drive around the track as much as they like, driving through the pitlane each time around in order to avoid the grid. Drivers must be in their cars and in place on the grid by time the pit lane closes at t-15:00; otherwise they must start the race from the pits. Meanwhile, teams may work on their cars on the grid.\\r\\nAt t-10:00 the grid is cleared of everyone except team mechanics, race marshals, and drivers. A team will generally want to keep its tyres off their cars and heated in their tyre-warmers for as long as possible, but they must be attached to the cars by t-3:00.\\r\\nEngines must be running by t-1:00; at fifteen seconds to the start all personnel must be clear of the track. Green lights signify the start of the formation lap, also known as the parade lap, during which drivers must remain in the same order (no passing) except if a car ahead has stopped due to a technical problem, or has had an accident. The cars circle the track once, usually weaving from side to side to warm up their tyres, and form up again in their starting positions on the grid. A series of short, controlled burnouts is usually performed as each driver approaches their grid box in order to maximize rear tyre temperature and clean off any debris from the parade lap.\\r\\nIf, for some reason, a car cannot start the race (engine failure during qualifying or practice, suspension fails, etc.), the car can still join the race, but will take a 10-position penalty at the start. For example, if the car qualifies in 3rd, but has to change an engine at any point during the race weekend prior to the actual race, the car will start from 13th position. For strategy's sake, teams will sometimes opt to start a car affected in this way from the pit lane. This means they start at the tail end of the grid; however, they can not only change an engine, but also start the race with fresh tyres.\\r\\nGearboxes must be used for 5 consecutive events (counted as P3, the qualifying practice session and the race). A five place grid penalty will be incurred if a replacement gearbox is used.\\r\\nThe race is started by ten red lights in two rows of five (i.e. five columns of two),[5] controlled by FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting. The red lights in each column operate as a pair i.e. both go on and off together. The lights illuminate one pair at a time, left to right, in one-second intervals, and then go out simultaneously after an interval of between four and seven seconds. When the lights go out, the race begins. Should the start need to be aborted for any reason, all five pairs of red lights will come on as normal, but instead of going out, the orange lights will flash. All engines are stopped and the start resumes from the five-minute point. If a single driver raises his hand to indicate that he can't start, the marshall for that row will wave a yellow flag, then after a few seconds, both the red and orange lights will extinguish and the green lights will come on to indicate another formation lap.[6]\\r\\nThe Drivers' and Constructors' Championships are decided by points, which are awarded according to the place in which a driver classifies at each grand prix. To receive points a racer need not finish the race, but at least 90% of the winner's race distance must be completed. Therefore, it is possible for a driver to receive some points even though he retired before the end of the race. In that case the scoring is based on the distance completed in comparison to other drivers. It is also possible for the lower points not to be awarded (as at the 2005 United States Grand Prix) because insufficient drivers completed 90% of the winner's distance. The system was revised in 2003 and later amended for the 2010 season because of 2 new teams entering the sport. The scoring system from 2010 on is:\\r\\nFor scoring systems prior to 2010, refer to the List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems.\\r\\nDrivers finishing lower than tenth place receive no points.\\r\\nIf the race had for some reason to be abandoned before 75% of the planned distance (rounded up to the nearest lap) had been completed, then the points awarded are halved: 12.5, 9, 7.5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.5.\\r\\nPoints are awarded equally to the driver and his constructor; for example, if a driver for one team comes second, eighteen points are added to his season total; if his teammate finished third in the same race, he adds fifteen to his total and the team adds 33 (the sum of the drivers' points) to its total. The championships are awarded to whichever driver and constructor have the most points at the end of the season. In case of a tie, the FIA compares the number of times each driver has finished in each position. The championship goes to whichever had the greater number of wins; if they have the same number of wins, it goes to the driver with the greater number of second places, and so on. For example, if drivers A and B were tied at the end of a season, and B had six wins and three second-place finishes, but A had six wins and four second-place finishes (even if he had fewer third places than B, etc.), then A would be champion.\\r\\nOn 10 December 2013, it was confirmed that drivers and constructors will score double points in the final Grand Prix from 2014 onwards,[7] but this was abandoned in the weeks following the 2014 season.\\r\\nMany venues make use of electronic displays to indicate flags to give various messages to drivers. However, race marshals continue to use physical flags as a redundancy mechanism in the event of electronic display failure. Marshals are positioned at numerous points around the track during every race. Flags have different meanings depending on their colour; the colours (with Pantone values as specified by the FIA) signify as follows:\\r\\nA red flag indicates that the race, practice session, or qualifying session has been suspended. All marshal stations will signal this. Drivers may not leave the pits. All drivers on the track must proceed cautiously to the pit lane and stop. There they will be reordered in their correct racing order. Sessions may be resumed or abandoned as the race director indicates. If the safety car is deployed, the racing cars should follow it and provisions allow for the safety car to divert the field into the pit lane and wait there.\\r\\nFlags, whose specifications and usage are prescribed by Appendix H (PDF) of the FIA's International Sporting Code, must measure at least 60?cm by 80?cm, excepting the red and chequered flags, which must measure at least 80?cm by 100?cm.\\r\\nPenalties may be imposed on drivers for numerous offenses, including starting prematurely, speeding in the pitlane, causing an accident, blocking unfairly, or ignoring flags of any color. There are four types of penalty which a driver may incur for violation of on-track rules:\\r\\nFor the drive-through and stop-go penalties, a driver has two laps from the time his team hears of the penalty to enter the pits; if he does not pit within two laps, he will be black-flagged. The exception to this rule is if the Safety Car is deployed before a driver serves his penalty, in which case he is not allowed to serve his penalty until after the Safety Car comes back in. If he incurs a penalty within the last five laps of the race, he need not pit at all; instead, twenty seconds will be added to his total race time in case of a drive-through penalty, and thirty seconds in case of stop-go penalty.\\r\\nTo ensure that drivers drive the car 'alone and unaided' and are not being 'coached' from the pit wall, stricter rules have been introduced to govern what information can and cannot be given to a driver over team radio. For example, a driver can no longer be given information about driving lines or how to adjust his car to make it faster whilst out on track.[10] This rule has been changed effective the German Grand Prix in 2016 whereby information can now be given to the driver.[11]\\r\\nThe primary reasons behind rule changes have traditionally been to do with safety[12] and (mostly since 2000) to limit the cost of the sport.[13]","input":"What is the length of an f1 car?"},{"output":"28 January 1950","context":"The Supreme Court of India is the highest judicial forum and final court of appeal under the Constitution of India, the highest constitutional court, with the power of constitutional review.

It safeguards fundamental rights of citizens and settles disputes between various governments in the country. As an advisory court, it hears matters which may specifically be referred to it under the constitution by the President of India. It also may take cognisance of matters on its own (or suo moto), without anyone drawing its attention to them.

The first Chief Justice of India was Sir H J Kania. In 1958, the supreme court moved to its present premises.[5] Originally, the Constitution of India envisaged a supreme court with a chief justice and seven judges; leaving it to parliament to increase this number.[6] In formative years, the supreme court met from 10 to 12 in the morning and then 2 to 4 in the afternoon for 28 days in a month.[7]\\r\\nThe building is shaped to symbolize scales of justice with its centre-beam being the Central Wing of the building comprising the chief justices court, the largest of the courtrooms, with two court halls on either side. The Right Wing of the structure has the bar √ø room, the offices of the Attorney General of India and other law officers and the library of the court. The Left Wing has the offices of the court. In all, there are 15 courtrooms in the various wings of the building.[4][5][8]\\r\\nThe foundation stone of the supreme court's building was laid on 29 October 1954 by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India.

It portrays Mother India in the form of the figure of a lady, sheltering the young Republic of India represented by the symbol of a child, who is upholding the laws of land symbolically shown in the form of an open book. On the book, a balance beam is shown, which represents dispensation of equal justice to all. The sculpture was made by the renowned artist Chintamoni Kar. The sculpture is just behind the statue of Mahatma Gandhi.\\r\\nThe design of the Court's seal is reproduced from the wheel that appears on the abacus of the Sarnath Lion capital of Asoka with 24 spokes. The inscription in Sanskrit, ??? ????????? ??? (IAST: Yato Dharmastato Jaya?, means \\"whence law (dharma), thence victory\\". It is also referred to √ø as the wheel of righteousness, encompassing truth, goodness and equity.[4]\\r\\nThe registry of the supreme court is headed by the Secretary-General who is assisted by 8 registrars, several additional and deputy registrars, etc., with 1770 employees in all (221 gazetted officers, 805 non-gazetted and 744 Class IV employees)[9] Article 146 of the constitution deals with the appointments of officers and servants of the supreme court registry.[10][11]\\r\\nSupreme Court Rules, 2013 entitle only those advocates who are registered with the supreme court, called 'advocates-on-record' to appear, act and plead for a party in the court.[12] Those advocates who are designated as 'senior advocates' by the supreme court or any of the high courts can appear for clients along with an advocate-on-record. Any other advocate can appear for a party along with or under instructions from an advocate-on-record.\\r\\nInitially the Constitution of India provided for a supreme court with a chief justice and 7 judges. In the early years, a full bench of the supreme court sat together to hear the cases presented before them. As the work of the Court increased and cases began to accumulate, parliament increased the number of judges from the original 8 in 1950 to 10 in 1956, 13 in 1960, 17 in 1977, 26 in 1986 and 31 in 2008 (current strength). As the number of the judges has increased, they sit in smaller benches of two or three (referred to as a division bench)?[13] coming together in larger benches of five or more (referred to as a constitution bench) when required to settle fundamental questions of law. A bench may refer a case before it to a larger bench, should the need arise.[14]\\r\\nA citizen of India not exceeding 65 years age per Article 124 of the constitution who has been\\r\\nis eligible to be recommended for appointment, a judge of the supreme court.[15]\\r\\nI am proud to be an Indian. India is the only country where a member of the minority Parsi community with a population of 1,67,000, like myself, can aspire to attain the post of the Chief Justice of India. These things do not happen in our neighbouring countries.\\r\\nIn practice, judges of the supreme court have been selected so far, mostly from amongst judges of the high courts. Barely seven justices  S. M. Sikri, S. Chandra Roy, Kuldip Singh, Santosh Hegde, R. F. Nariman, U. U. Lalit, L. Nageswara Rao and Indu Malhotra have been appointed to the supreme court directly from the bar (i.e. who were practising advocates).[18][19]\\r\\nThe supreme court saw its first woman judge when Justice M. Fathima Beevi was sworn into office in 1989.[20] The seventh and the most recent woman judge in the court is Justice Indu Malhotra.[21][22] In 1968, Justice Mohammad Hidayatullah became the first Muslim Chief Justice of India. In 2000, Justice K. G. Balakrishnan became the first judge from the dalit community. In 2007 he also became the first dalit Chief Justice of India. In 2010, Justice S. H. Kapadia coming from a Parsi minority community became the Chief Justice of India.[16][23] In 2017, Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar became the first Sikh Chief Justice of India. Indu Malhotra is the first women justice to be selected directly from bar.\\r\\nThe constitution seeks to ensure the independence of supreme court judges in various ways. Per Article 50 of directive principles of state policy, the state shall take steps to separate the judiciary from the executive. Independence of the judiciary, the supremacy of the constitution and rule of law are the features of the basic structure of the constitution. Supreme court and high courts are empowered to frame suo moto cases without receiving the formal petitions/complaints on any suspected injustice including actions/acts indulging in contempt of court and contempt of the constitution by the executive, legislators, citizens, etc.[24] The main purpose of supreme court is to decide constitutional issues.[25] It is the duty of the judiciary to frame suo moto cases or to probe the cases/petitions at the earliest against the executive or legislature when laws are implemented violating the basic foundation and basic structure of the constitution as the Article 38 (1) of directive principles ensures that the state / judiciary shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing a social order in which social, economic and political justice is animated/informed in all institutions of life.[26]\\r\\nDr. Ambedkar clarified as given below in the Constituent Assembly debates on Article 38 (1) high lighting its inevitable implementation.\\r\\n... The word 'strive' which occurs in the Draft Constitution, in judgement, is very important. We have used it because our intention is even when there are circumstances which prevent the Government, or which stand in the way of the Government giving effect to these Directive Principles, they shall, even under hard and unpropitious circumstances, always strive in the fulfilment of these Directives. That is why we have used the word 'strive'. Otherwise, it would be open for any Government to say that the circumstances are so bad, that the finances are so inadequate that we cannot even make an effort in the direction in which the Constitution asks us to go.\\r\\nAs per the constitution, as held by the court in the Three Judges Cases √ø (1982, 1993, 1998), a judge is appointed to the supreme court by the president on the recommendation of the collegium ? a closed group of the Chief Justice of India, the four most senior judges of the court and the senior-most judge hailing from the high court of a prospective appointee.[27] This has resulted in a Memorandum of Procedure being followed, for the appointments.\\r\\nJudges used to be appointed by the President on the advice of the Union Cabinet. After 1993 (the Second judges' Case), no minister, or even the executive collectively, can suggest any names to the President,[28][29] who ultimately decides on appointing them from a list of names recommended only by the collegium of the judiciary. Simultaneously, as held in that judgment, the executive was given the power to reject a recommended name. However, according to some,[who?] the executive has not been diligent in using this power to reject the names of bad candidates recommended by the judiciary.[30][31][32]\\r\\nThe collegium system has come under a fair amount of criticism.[29] In 2015, the parliament passed a law to replace the collegium with a National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC). This was struck down as unconstitutional by the supreme court, in the Fourth judges' Case, as the new system would undermine the independence of the judiciary.[33] Putting the old system of the collegium back, the court invited suggestions, even from the general public, on how to improve the collegium system, broadly along the lines of  setting up an eligibility criteria for appointments, a permanent secretariat to help the collegium sift through material on potential candidates, infusing more transparency into the selection process, grievance redressal and any other suggestion not in these four categories, like transfer of judges.[34] This resulted in the court asking the government and the collegium to finalize the memorandum of procedure incorporating the above.[35]\\r\\nOnce, in 2009, the recommendation for the appointment of a judge of a high court made by the collegium of that court, had come to be challenged in the supreme court. The court held that who could become a judge was a matter of fact, and any person had a right to question it. But who should become a judge was a matter of opinion and could not be questioned. As long as an effective consultation took place within a collegium in arriving at that opinion, the content or material placed before it to form the opinion could not be called for scrutiny in court.[36]\\r\\nSupreme court judges retire at the age of 65. However, there have been suggestions from the judges of the Supreme Court of India to provide for a fixed term for the judges including the Chief Justice of India.[37]\\r\\nArticle 125 of the Indian constitution leaves it to the Indian parliament to determine the salary, other allowances, leave of absence, pension, etc. of the supreme court judges. However, the parliament cannot alter any of these privileges and rights to the judge's disadvantage after his/her appointment.[38] A judge of the supreme court draws a salary of ?250,000 (US$3,800) per month, equivalent to the Cabinet Secretary of India, while the chief justice earns ?280,000 (US$4,300) per month.[39]\\r\\nAs Per Article 124 and third Schedule of the constitution, the chief justice (or a judge) of the Supreme Court of India is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the President an oath or affirmation that he/she\\r\\nwill bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, that I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India, that I will duly and faithfully and to the best of my ability, knowledge and judgement perform the duties of my office without fear or favour, affection or ill-will and that I will uphold the Constitution and the laws.\\r\\nPer Article 124(4) of the constitution, President can remove a judge on proved misbehaviour or incapacity when parliament approves with a majority of the total membership of each house in favour of impeachment and not less than two thirds of the members of each house present. For initiating impeachment proceedings against a judge, at least 50 members of Rajya Sabha or 100 members of Lok Sabha shall issue the notice as per judges (inquiry) act,1968.[40] Then a judicial committee would be formed to frame charges against the judge, to conduct the fair trial and to submit its report to parliament. When the judicial committee report finds the judge guilty of misbehaviour or incapacity, further removal proceedings would be taken up by the parliament if the judge is not resigning himself.[41][42][43]\\r\\nThe judge upon proven guilty is also liable for punishment as per applicable laws or for contempt of the constitution by breaching the oath under disrespecting constitution[44]\\r\\nA Person who has retired as a judge of the supreme court is debarred from practicing in any court of law or before any other authority in India.\\r\\nArticle 137 of the Constitution of India lays down provision for the power of the supreme court to review its own judgements. As per this Article, subject to the provisions of any law made by parliament or any rules made under Article 145, the supreme court shall have power to review any judgment pronounced or order made by it.[45]\\r\\nUnder Order XL of the supreme court Rules, that have been framed under its powers under Article 145 of the constitution, the supreme court may review its judgment or order but no application for review is to be entertained in a civil proceeding except on the grounds mentioned in Order XLVII, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\\r\\nUnder Articles 129 and 142 of the constitution the supreme court has been vested with power to punish anyone for contempt of any court in India including itself. The supreme court performed an unprecedented action when it directed a sitting Minister of the state of Maharashtra, Swaroop Singh Naik,[46] to be jailed for 1-month on a charge of contempt of court on 12 May 2006. This was the first time that a serving Minister was ever jailed.[47][48]\\r\\nThe Constitution of India under Article 145 empowers the supreme court to frame its own rules for regulating the practice and procedure of the Court as and when required (with the approval of the President of India). Accordingly, \\"supreme court Rules, 1950\\" were framed. The 1950 Rules were replaced by the supreme court Rules, 1966.[49] In 2014, supreme court notified the supreme court Rules, 2013 replacing the 1966 Rules effective from 19 August 2014.[12]\\r\\nThe supreme court decided to follow a new roster system from February 5, 2018 for allocation of matters to judges. Under the new roster system, the CJI will hear all special leave petitions (SLPs), and matters related to public interest, social justice, elections, arbitration, and criminal matters, among others. The other collegium/senior judges to hear matters related to labour disputes, taxation matters, compensation matters, consumer protection matters, maritime law matters, mortgage matters, personal law matters, family law matters, land acquisition matters, service matters, company matters etc.[50]\\r\\nSupreme court Reports is the official journal of reportable supreme court decisions. It is published under the authority of the Supreme Court of India by the Controller of Publications, Government of India, Delhi.[51] In addition, there are many other reputed private journals that report supreme court decisions. Some of these other important journals are: SCR (The supreme court Reports), SCC(supreme court Cases), AIR (All India Reporter), SCALE, etc.\\r\\nIn the year 2010, the supreme court filed an appeal before itself challenging the judgement of the Delhi high court holding that the office of the chief justice of India came under the ambit of the RTI Act and was liable to reveal information under it.[52] Though the supreme court is in favour of bringing CJI office under RTI act, the judgement of the pending case is not yet pronounced.[53][54]\\r\\nLegal-aid,[55][56][57] court-fee vendors, first-aid post, dental clinic, physiotherapy unit and pathology lab; rail-reservation counter, canteen, post office and a branch and 3 ATMs of UCO Bank, supreme court Museum[9] can be availed by litigants and visitors.\\r\\nAfter some of the courts overturned state laws for redistributing land from zamindar (landlord) estates on the ground that the laws violated the zamindars' fundamental rights, the parliament passed the 1st amendment to the constitution in 1951, followed by the 4th amendment in 1955, to uphold its authority to redistribute land. The supreme court countered these amendments in 1967 when it ruled in Golaknath v. State of Punjab[58] that the parliament did not have the power to abrogate fundamental rights, including the provisions on private property. The 25th amendment to the constitution in 1971 curtailed the right of a citizen to property as a fundamental right and gave authority to the government to infringe private property, which led to a furor amongst the zamindars.\\r\\nThe independence of judiciary was severely curtailed[59] during the Indian Emergency (1975√ø1977) of Indira Gandhi. The constitutional rights of imprisoned persons were restricted under Preventive detention laws passed by the parliament. In the case of Shiva Kant Shukla Additional District Magistrate of Jabalpur v. Shiv Kant Shukla, popularly known as the Habeas Corpus case, a bench of five senior-most judges of supreme court ruled in favour of state's right for unrestricted powers of detention during the emergency. Justices A.N. Ray, P. N. Bhagwati, Y. V. Chandrachud, and M.H. Beg, stated in the majority decision:[60]\\r\\nThe only dissenting opinion was from Justice H. R. Khanna, who stated:\\r\\nIt is believed that before delivering his dissenting opinion, Justice Khanna had mentioned to his sister: \\"I have prepared my judgment, which is going to cost me the Chief Justice-ship of India.\\"[61] In January 1977, Justice Khanna was superseded despite being the most senior judge at the time and thereby Government broke the convention of appointing only the senior most judge to the position of Chief Justice of India. Justice Khanna remains a legendary figure among the legal fraternity in India for this decision.\\r\\nThe New York Times, wrote of this opinion: \\"The submission of an independent judiciary to absolutist government is virtually the last step in the destruction of a democratic society; and the Indian supreme court's decision appears close to utter surrender.\\"\\r\\nDuring the emergency period, the government also passed the 39th amendment, which sought to limit judicial review for the election of the prime minister; only a body constituted by parliament could review this election.[62] Subsequently, the parliament, with most opposition members in jail during the emergency, passed the 42nd Amendment which prevented any court from reviewing any amendment to the constitution with the exception of procedural issues concerning ratification. A few years after the emergency, however, the supreme court rejected the absoluteness of the 42nd amendment and reaffirmed its power of judicial review in the Minerva Mills case (1980).\\r\\nAfter Indira Gandhi lost elections in 1977, the new government of Morarji Desai, and especially law minister Shanti Bhushan (who had earlier argued for the detenues in the Habeas Corpus case), introduced a number of amendments making it more difficult to declare and sustain an emergency, and reinstated much of the power to the supreme court. It is said that the Basic Structure doctrine, created in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, was strengthened in Indira Gandhi's case and set in stone in Minerva Mills v. Union of India.[63]\\r\\nThe supreme court's creative and expansive interpretations of Article 21 (Life and Personal Liberty), primarily after the Emergency period, have given rise to a new jurisprudence of public interest litigation that has vigorously promoted many important economic and social rights (constitutionally protected but not enforceable) including, but not restricted to, the rights to free education, livelihood, a clean environment,[64] food and many others. Civil and political rights (traditionally protected in the Fundamental Rights chapter of the Indian constitution) have also been expanded and more fiercely protected. These new interpretations have opened the avenue for litigation on a number of important issues.\\r\\nAmong the important pronouncements of the supreme court post 2000 is the Coelho case I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu (Judgment of 11 January 2007). A unanimous bench of 9 judges reaffirmed the basic structure doctrine. It held that a constitutional amendment which entails violation of any fundamental rights which the Court regards as forming part of the basic structure of the constitution, then the same can be struck down depending upon its impact and consequences. The judgment clearly imposes further limitations on the constituent power of parliament with respect to the principles underlying certain fundamental rights. The judgment in Coelho has in effect restored the decision in Golak Nath regarding non-amendability of the constitution on account of infraction of fundamental rights, contrary to the judgment in the Kesavananda Bharati case.\\r\\nAnother important decision was of the five-judge bench in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India; where the constitutional validity of Central Educational Institutions (Reservations in Admissions) Act, 2006 was upheld, subject to the \\"creamy layer\\" criteria. Importantly, the Court refused to follow the 'strict scrutiny' standards of review followed by the United States supreme court. At the same time, the Court has applied the strict scrutiny standards in Anuj Garg v. Hotel Association of India (2007) ([1])a\\r\\nThe supreme court declared allotment of spectrum as \\"unconstitutional and arbitrary\\" and quashed all the 122 licenses issued in 2008 during tenure of A. Raja (then minister for communications & IT), the main official accused in the 2G case.[65]\\r\\nThe government refused to disclose details of about 18 Indians holding accounts in LGT Bank, Liechtenstein, evoking a sharp response from a bench comprising justices B Sudershan Reddy and S S Nijjar. The court ordered Special investigation team (SIT) to probe the matter.[66][67] Lack of enthusiasm made the court create a special investigative team (SIT).[68]\\r\\nThe supreme court refused to stay the Andhra Pradesh High Court judgement quashing 4.5% sub-quota for minorities under OBC reservation quota of 27%.[69]\\r\\nThree judge bench presided by chief justice, Justice Altamas Kabir issued notice to the Centre and the Election Commission of India (EC) on the PIL filed by a group of NRIs for online/postal ballot for the Indian citizens living abroad.[70][71]\\r\\nWhile hearing T.S.R. Subramanian vs Union of India, a division bench of the supreme court ruled that\\r\\nThese rulings were received mostly positively, and were termed as a 'major reform'.[73][75][82][83][84]\\r\\nIn April 2014, Justice K. S. Radhakrishnan declared transgender to be the 'third gender' in Indian law, in the case, National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India.[85][86][87] The ruling said:[88]\\r\\nSeldom, our society realises or cares to realise the trauma, agony and pain which the members of Transgender community undergo, nor appreciates the innate feelings of the members of the Transgender community, especially of those whose mind and body disown their biological sex. Our society often ridicules and abuses the Transgender community and in public places like railway stations, bus stands, schools, workplaces, malls, theatres, hospitals, they are sidelined and treated as untouchables, forgetting the fact that the moral failure lies in the society's unwillingness to contain or embrace different gender identities and expressions, a mindset which we have to change.\\r\\nJustice Radhakrishnan said that transgender people should be treated consistently with other minorities under the law, enabling them to access jobs, healthcare and education.[89] He framed the issue as one of human rights, saying that, \\"These TGs, even though insignificant in numbers, are still human beings and therefore they have every right to enjoy their human rights\\", concluding by declaring that:[88]\\r\\n(1) Hijras, eunuchs, apart from binary gender, be treated as \\"third gender\\" for the purpose of safeguarding their rights under Part III of our constitution and the laws made by the parliament and the State Legislature.\\r\\n(2) Transgender persons' right to decide their self-identified gender is also upheld and the Centre and State Governments are directed to grant legal recognition of their gender identity such as male, female or as third gender.\\r\\nIn B.Prabhakara Rao vs. State of A.P. involved sudden reduction in age of superannuation from 58 years to 55 years of over 35,000 public servants of State Government, public sector undertakings, statutory bodies, educational institutions and Tirupathi-Tirumalai Devasthanams (TTD). They lost first round of litigation in the supreme court. Realising the mistake, fresh legislation was brought restoring the original age of superannuation of 58 years but providing that the benefit of new legislation would not extend to those whose reduction of age of superannuation had been upheld. In challenge to this law, Subodh Markandeya argued that all that was required was to strike down naughty not √ø which found favour with the supreme court bringing relief to over 35,000 public servants.\\r\\nThe year 2008 saw the supreme court embroiled in several controversies, from serious allegations of corruption at the highest level of the judiciary,[90] expensive private holidays at the tax payers expense,[91] refusal to divulge details of judges' assets to the public,[92] secrecy in the appointments of judges',[93] to refusal to make information public under the Right to Information Act.[94] The chief justice K. G. Balakrishnan invited a lot of criticism for his comments on his post not being that of a public servant, but that of a constitutional authority.[95] He later went back on this stand.[96] The judiciary has come in for serious criticisms from former presidents Pratibha Patil and A. P. J. Abdul Kalam for failure in handling its duties.[97] Former prime minister Manmohan Singh, has stated that corruption is one of the major challenges facing the judiciary, and suggested that there is an urgent need to eradicate this menace.[98]\\r\\nThe Cabinet Secretary of India introduced the judges Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2008 in parliament for setting up of a panel called the National Judicial Council, headed by the Chief Justice of India, that will probe into allegations of corruption and misconduct by High Court and supreme court judges.[99][100]\\r\\nAccording to supreme court newsletter, there are 58,519 cases pending in the supreme court, out of which 37,385 are pending for more than a year, at the end of 2011. Excluding connected cases, there are still 33,892 pending cases.[101] As per the latest pendency data made available by the supreme court, the total number of pending cases in the supreme court as on 1 November 2017 is 55,259 which includes 32,160 admission matters (miscellaneous) and 23,099 regular hearing matters.[102] In May, 2014, former Chief Justice of India, Justice R.M. Lodha, proposed to make Indian judiciary work throughout the year (instead of the present system of having long vacations, specially in the higher courts) in order to reduce pendency of cases in Indian courts; however, as per this proposal there is not going to be any increase in the number of working days or working hours of any of the judges and it only meant that different judges would be going on vacation during different periods of the year as per their choice; but, the Bar Council of India rejected this proposal mainly because it would have inconvenienced the advocates who would have to work throughout the year.[103] More over, various time frames specified in 'code of civil procedure' are also diluted by supreme court judgements to give the courts right to endlessly adjourn the cases.[104][105]\\r\\nSupreme court has not taken up the trail of many pending cases, since April 2014 (more than three years), challenging the validity of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 which was enacted by the parliament without following the stipulated procedure in the constitution and is claimed detrimental to the basic foundation of the constitution on which the basic structure of the constitution is resting.[106] The basic foundation of the constitution is the dignity and the freedom of its citizens which is of supreme importance and can not be destroyed by any legislation of the parliament.[107] Whereas the fair trial to examine the validity of the ninety-ninth constitutional amendment dated 31 December 2014, to form National Judicial Appointments Commission for the purpose of appointing the judges of the supreme court and high courts, was conducted on utmost priority and supreme court delivered its judgement on 16 October 2015 (within a year) quashing the constitutional amendment as unconstitutional and ultra virus stating the said amendment is interfering with the independence of the judiciary.[108] Disposal of the various petitions filed against Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 is also equally important as it has alienated the basic rights of a vast section of Indian citizens and also against federal character of the constitution which is part of the basic structure of the constitution. Supreme court is also wasting its valuable time by not taking up the case in toto but conducted a piecemeal trail by delivering its judgement to dispose the petitions related with apportionment of assets between the newly formed states Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.[109] Supreme court is also conducting piecemeal trail of the petitions filed by the states regarding water sharing of rivers and bifurcation of the common high court without considering the earlier pending petitions challenging the validity of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 which is the basic cause of all these disputes.[110][111] Under checks and balances as provided in the constitution, it is the duty of the judiciary/supreme court to establish the rule of law at the earliest by rectifying any misuse of the constitution by the parliament and the executive without colluding with them and to remove perceptions of people that rule of law is side lined and a section of its citizens are subjected to discrimination.[112][113]\\r\\nOn 12 January 2018, four senior judges of the supreme court; Jasti Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan Lokur and Kurian Joseph addressed a press conference criticizing Chief Justice Dipak Misra's style of administration and the manner in which he allocated cases among judges of the supreme court. However, people close to Misra refuted the allegations that allocation of cases was unfair.[114] On 20 April 2018, seven opposition parties submitted a petition seeking impeachment of Dipak Misra to the Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, with signatures from seventy-one parliamentarians.[115] On 23 April 2018, the petition was rejected by Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, primarily on the basis that the complaints were about administration and not misbehaviour, and that thus impeachment would seriously interfere with the constitutionally protected independence of the judiciary.[116][117][118]","input":"When was the first supreme court established in india?"},{"output":"almost 500 years","context":"The Norse colonization of North America began in the late 10th century AD when Norsemen explored and settled areas of the North Atlantic including the northeastern fringes of North America.[1] Viking houses were found at LAnse aux Meadows near the northern tip of Newfoundland in 1960. This discovery aided the reignition of archaeological exploration for the Vikings in the north Atlantic.[2]\\r\\nThe Norse colony in Greenland lasted for almost 500 years. Continental North American settlements were small and did not develop into permanent colonies. While voyages, for example to collect timber, are likely to have occurred for some time, there is no evidence of any lasting Norse settlements on mainland North America.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Sagas of Icelanders, Norsemen from Iceland first settled Greenland in the 980s. There is no special reason to doubt the authority of the information that the sagas supply regarding the very beginning of the settlement, but they cannot be treated as primary evidence for the history of Norse Greenland because they embody the literary preoccupations of writers and audiences in medieval Iceland that are not always reliable.[4]\\r\\nErik the Red (Old Norse: Eirkr rauei), having been banished from Iceland for manslaughter, explored the uninhabited southwestern coast of Greenland during the three years of his banishment.[5][6] He made plans to entice settlers to the area, naming it Greenland on the assumption that \\"people would be more eager to go there because the land had a good name\\".[7] The inner reaches of one long fjord, named Eiriksfjord after him, was where he eventually established his estate Brattahlid. He issued tracts of land to his followers.[8]\\r\\nAt its peak the colony consisted of two settlements. The Eastern was at the southwestern tip of Greenland, while the Western Settlement was about 500?km up the west coast, inland from present-day Nuuk. A smaller settlement near the Eastern Settlement is sometimes considered the Middle Settlement. The combined population was around 2,000√ø3,000.[9] At least 400 farms have been identified by archaeologists.[8] Norse Greenland had a bishopric (at Garear) and exported walrus ivory, furs, rope, sheep, whale or seal blubber, live animals such as polar bears, supposed \\"unicorn horns\\" (in reality narwhal tusks), and cattle hides. In 1126, the population requested a Bishop (headquartered at Garear), and in 1261, they accepted the overlordship of the Norwegian King. They continued to have their own law and became almost completely independent after 1349, the time of the Black Death. In 1380, the Norwegian Kingdom entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark.[10]\\r\\nThere is evidence of Norse trade with the natives (called Skraelings by the Vikings). The Norse would have encountered both Native Americans (the Beothuk, related to the Algonquin) and the Thule, the ancestors of the Inuit. The Dorset had withdrawn from Greenland before the Norse settlement of the island. Items such as comb fragments, pieces of iron cooking utensils and chisels, chess pieces, ship rivets, carpenter's planes, and oaken ship fragments used in Inuit boats have been found far beyond the traditional range of Norse colonization. A small ivory statue that appears to represent a European has also been found among the ruins of an Inuit community house.[10]\\r\\nThe colony began to decline in the 14th century. The Western Settlement was abandoned around 1350, and the last bishop at Garear died in 1377.[10] After a marriage was recorded in 1408, no written records mention the settlers. It is probable that the Eastern Settlement was defunct by the late 15th century. The most recent radiocarbon date found in Norse settlements as of 2002 was 1430 (I15 years). Several theories have been advanced to explain the decline.\\r\\nThe Little Ice Age of this period would have made travel between Greenland and Europe, as well as farming, more difficult; although fishing and seal hunting provided a healthy diet, there was more prestige in cattle farming, and there was increased availability of farms in Scandinavian countries depopulated by famine and plague epidemics. In addition, Greenlandic ivory may have been supplanted in European markets by cheaper ivory from Africa.[11] Despite the loss of contact with the Greenlanders, the Norwegian-Danish crown continued to consider Greenland a possession.\\r\\nNot knowing whether the old Norse civilization remained in Greenland or notand worried that if it did, it would still be Catholic 200 years after the Scandinavian homelands had experienced the Reformationa joint merchant-clerical expedition led by the Dano-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede was sent to Greenland in 1721. Though this expedition found no surviving Europeans, it marked the beginning of Denmark's re-assertion of sovereignty over the island.\\r\\nAccording to the Icelandic sagasEirik the Red's Saga,[12] Saga of the Greenlanders, plus chapters of the Hauksb‹ák and the Flatey Bookthe Norse started to explore lands to the west of Greenland only a few years after the Greenland settlements were established. In 985 while sailing from Iceland to Greenland with a migration fleet consisting of 400√ø700 settlers[8][13] and 25 other ships (14 of which completed the journey), a merchant named Bjarni Herj‹álfsson was blown off course, and after three days' sailing he sighted land west of the fleet. Bjarni was only interested in finding his father's farm, but he described his discovery to Leif Erikson who explored the area in more detail and planted a small settlement fifteen years later.[8]\\r\\nThe sagas describe three separate areas discovered during this exploration: Helluland, which means \\"land of the flat stones\\"; Markland, \\"the land of forests\\", definitely of interest to settlers in Greenland where there were few trees; and Vinland, \\"the land of wine\\", found somewhere south of Markland. It was in Vinland that the settlement described in the sagas was founded.\\r\\nThree of Erik the Red's children visited the North American continent: his sons Leif and Thorvald, and their sister (or half-sister) Freydis. Thorvald died there.\\r\\nUsing the routes, landmarks, currents, rocks, and winds that Bjarni had described to him, Leif sailed some 1,800 miles to the west of the land, with a crew of 35sailing the same knarr Bjarni had used to make the voyage. He described Helluland as \\"level and wooded, with broad white beaches wherever they went and a gently sloping shoreline.\\"[8] Leif and others had wanted his father, Erik the Red, to lead this expedition and talked him into it. However, as Erik attempted to join his son Leif on the voyage towards these new lands, he fell off his horse as it slipped on the wet rocks near the shore; thus he was injured and stayed behind.[8]\\r\\nLeif wintered in 1001, probably near Cape Bauld on the northern tip of Newfoundland, where one day his foster father Tyrker was found drunk, on what the saga describes as \\"wine-berries.\\" Squashberries, gooseberries, and cranberries all grew wild in the area. There are varying explanations for Leif apparently describing fermented berries as \\"wine.\\"\\r\\nLeif spent another winter at \\"Leifsb~eir\\" without conflict, and sailed back to Brattahle in Greenland to assume filial duties to his father.\\r\\nIn 1004, Leif's brother Thorvald Eiriksson sailed with a crew of 30 men to Vinland and spent the following winter at Leif's camp. In the spring, Thorvald attacked nine of the local people who were sleeping under three skin-covered canoes. The ninth victim escaped and soon came back to the Norse camp with a force. Thorvald was killed by an arrow that succeeded in passing through the barricade. Although brief hostilities ensued, the Norse explorers stayed another winter and left the following spring. Subsequently, another of Leif's brothers, Thorstein, sailed to the New World to retrieve his dead brother's body, but he died before leaving Greenland.[8]\\r\\nIn 1009 Thorfinn Karlsefni, also known as \\"Thorfinn the Valiant\\", supplied three ships with livestock and 160 men and women[13] (although another source sets the number of settlers at 250). After a cruel winter, he headed south and landed at Straumfjord. He later moved to Straums?y, possibly because the current was stronger there. A sign of peaceful relations between the indigenous peoples and the Norsemen is noted here. The two sides bartered with furs and gray squirrel skins for milk and red cloth, which the natives tied around their heads as a sort of headdress.\\r\\nThere are conflicting stories but one account states that a bull belonging to Karlsefni came storming out of the wood, so frightening the natives that they ran to their skin-boats and rowed away. They returned three days later, in force. The natives used catapults, hoisting \\"a large sphere on a pole; it was dark blue in color\\" and about the size of a sheep's belly,[14] which flew over the heads of the men and made an ugly din.[14]\\r\\nThe Norsemen retreated. Leif Erikson's half-sister Freyds Eirksd‹áttir was pregnant and unable to keep up with the retreating Norsemen. She called out to them to stop fleeing from \\"such pitiful wretches\\", adding that if she had weapons, she could do better than that. Freyds seized the sword belonging to a man who had been killed by the natives. She pulled one of her breasts out of her bodice and struck it with the sword, frightening the natives, who fled.[14]\\r\\nPurported runestones have been found in North America, most famously the Kensington Runestone. These are generally considered to be hoaxes or misinterpretations of Native American petroglyphs.[15]\\r\\nThere are many claims of Norse colonization in New England, none well-founded.\\r\\nMonuments claimed to be Norse include:[16]\\r\\nThe nineteenth-century Harvard chemist Eben Norton Horsford connected the Charles River Basin to places described in the Norse sagas and elsewhere, notably Norumbega.[17] He published several books on the topic and had plaques, monuments, and statues erected in honor of the Norse.[18] His work received little support from mainstream historians and archeologists at the time, and even less today.[19][20][21]\\r\\nSettlements in continental North America aimed to exploit natural resources such as furs and in particular lumber, which was in short supply in Greenland.[22] It is unclear why the short-term settlements did not become permanent, though it was likely in part because of hostile relations with the indigenous peoples, referred to as Skr?lings by the Norse.[23] Nevertheless, it appears that sporadic voyages to Markland for forages, timber, and trade with the locals could have lasted as long as 400 years.[24][25]\\r\\nEvidence of continuing trips includes the Maine Penny, a Norwegian coin from King Olaf Kyrre's reign (1067√ø1093) allegedly found in a Native American archaeological site in the U.S. state of Maine, suggesting an exchange between the Norse and the Native Americans late in or after the 11th century; and an entry in the Icelandic Annals from 1347 which refers to a small Greenlandic vessel with a crew of eighteen that arrived in Iceland while attempting to return to Greenland from Markland with a load of timber.[26]\\r\\nFor centuries it remained unclear whether the Icelandic stories represented real voyages by the Norse to North America. The sagas first gained serious historic respectability when, in 1837, the Danish antiquarian Carl Christian Rafn pointed out the possibility for a Norse settlement in, or voyages to, North America. North America, by the name Winland, first appeared in written sources in a work by Adam of Bremen from approximately 1075. The most important works about North America and the early Norse activities there, namely the Sagas of Icelanders, first reached written form only in the 13th and 14th centuries.[citation needed]\\r\\nEvidence of Norse west of Greenland came in the 1960s when archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad and her husband, outdoorsman and author Helge Ingstad, excavated a Norse settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland. The location of the various lands described in the sagas remains unclear, however. Many historians identify Helluland with Baffin Island and Markland with Labrador. The location of Vinland poses a thornier question. Most believe that the L'Anse aux Meadows settlement represents the Vinland settlement described in the sagas; others argue that the sagas depict Vinland as warmer than Newfoundland and therefore lying farther south.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2012 Canadian researchers identified possible signs of Norse outposts in Nanook at Tanfield Valley on Baffin Island, as well as on Nunguvik, Willows Island and Avayalik.[27][28][29] Unusual fabric cordage found on Baffin Island in the 1980s and stored at the Canadian Museum of Civilization was identified in 1999 as possibly of Norse manufacture; that discovery led to more in-depth exploration of the Tanfield Valley archaeological site.[citation needed]\\r\\nArcheological findings in 2015 at Point Rosee, on the southwest coast of Newfoundland, reveal evidence of the location being a bog iron-smelting site and therefore a possible second 10th century Viking settlement in Canada. The possible settlement was initially discovered through satellite imagery and magnetometer readings and archaeologists have begun excavating the area.[30][31]\\r\\nThe Sklholt Map, made by an Icelandic teacher in 1570, depicts part of north-eastern North America mentioning Helluland, Markland and Vinland.[32]","input":"How long were the vikings present in north america?"},{"output":"Portuguese","context":"Portuguese 97,9% German 1,9%, Indigenous languages 0,2%[1][2]\\r\\nPortuguese is the official language of Brazil,[5] and is widely spoken by most of population. Brazilian Sign Language is also an official language, minority languages include indigenous languages, and languages of more recent European and Asian immigrants. The population speaks or signs approximately 210 languages, of which 180 are indigenous.[6] Less than forty thousand people actually speak any one of the indigenous languages in the Brazilian territory.[7]\\r\\nLanguage is one of the strongest elements of Brazil's national unity. The only groups, and pockets of immigrants who maintain their heritage languages. Within Brazil, there is no major dialect variation of the Portuguese, only moderate regional variation in accent, vocabulary, and use of personal nouns, pronouns, and verb conjugations. Variations are diminishing as a result of mass media, especially national television networks that are viewed by the majority of Brazilians.\\r\\nThe written language, which is uniform across Brazil, follows national rules of spelling and accentuation that are revised from time to time for simplification. With the implementation of the Orthographic Agreement of 1990, the orthographic norms of Brazil and Portugal were made virtually identical, with some minor differences. Brazil enacted these changes in 2009, and Portugal enacted them in 2012.\\r\\nWritten Brazilian Portuguese differs significantly from the spoken language, with only an educated subsection of the population adhering to prescriptive norms.[citation needed] The rules of grammar are complex and allow more flexibility than English or Spanish. Many foreigners who speak Portuguese fluently have difficulty writing it properly. Because of Brazil's size, self-sufficiency, and relative isolation, foreign languages are not widely spoken. English is often studied in school and is increasingly studied in private courses. It has replaced French as the principal second language among educated people. Spanish is mutually intelligible with Portuguese to a certain degree, allowing Brazilians to considerably understand written and spoken Spanish without prior study, while Spanish speakers sometimes have a little difficulty to understand spoken Portuguese, but understand written Portuguese almost perfectly.[8]\\r\\nIn 2002, Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) was made the official language of the Bennidorm deaf community.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the first Portuguese arrived in 1500, what is now Brazil was inhabited by several Amerindian peoples, who spoke different languages. According to Aryon Dall'Igna Rodrigues[9] there were six million Indians in Brazil speaking 1,000 different languages. When the Portuguese settlers arrived, they encountered the Tupi people, who dominated most of the Brazilian coast and spoke a set of closely related languages. The Tupi called the non-Tupi peoples \\"Tapuias\\", a designation that the Portuguese adopted; however, there was little unity among the diverse Tapuia tribes other than their not being Tupi. In the first two centuries of colonization, a language based on Tupian languages (known as Lngua geral) was widely spoken in the colony,[citation needed] not only by the Amerindians, but also by the Portuguese settlers, Africans and their descendants. This language was spoken in a vast area from S?o Paulo to Maranh?o, as an informal language for domestic use, while Portuguese was the language used for public purposes. Lngua Geral was spread by the Jesuit missionaries and Bandeirantes to other areas of Brazil where the Tupi language was not spoken. Then, until the 1940s this language based on Tupi was widely spoken in some Northern Amazonian areas where the Tupi people were not present.[citation needed] In 1775, Marqus de Pombal prohibited the use of Lngua geral or any other indigenous language in Brazil.\\r\\nHowever, before that prohibition, the Portuguese language was dominant in Brazil. Most of the other Amerindian languages gradually disappeared as the populations that spoke them were integrated or decimated when the Portuguese-speaking population expanded to most of Brazil. The several African languages spoken[citation needed] in Brazil also disappeared. Since the 20th century there are no more records of speakers of African languages in the country. However, in some isolated communities settled by escaped slaves (Quilombo) the Portuguese language spoken by its inhabitants still preserves some lexicon of African origin, which is not understood by other Brazilians.[10] Due to the contact with several Amerindian and African languages, the Portuguese spoken in Brazil absorbed many influences from these languages, which led to a notable differentiation from the Portuguese spoken in Portugal.[11][not in citation given]\\r\\nStarting in the early 19th century, Brazil started to receive substantial immigration of non-Portuguese-speaking people from Europe and Asia. Most immigrants, particularly Italians[12] and Spaniards, adopted the Portuguese language after a few generations. Other immigrants, particularly Germans, Japanese and Ukrainians,[12][13] preserved their languages for more generations. German-speaking[14] immigrants started arriving in 1824. They came not only from Germany, but also from other countries that had a substantial German-speaking population (Switzerland, Poland, Austria and Russia (Volga Germans). During over 100 years of continuous emigration, it is estimated that some 300,000 German-speaking immigrants settled in Brazil. Italian immigration started in 1875 and about 1.5 million Italians immigrated to Brazil until World War II. They spoke several dialects from Italy. Other sources of immigration to Brazil included Spaniards, Poles, Ukrainians, Japanese and Middle-easterns. With the notable exception of the Germans, who preserved their language for several generations, and in some degree the Japanese, Ukrainians and Italians, most of the immigrants in Brazil adopted Portuguese as their mother tongue after a few generations.[15][16]\\r\\nPortuguese is the official language of Brazil, and is the only language used in schools, newspapers, radio and TV. It is used for all business and administrative purposes. Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, giving it a national culture sharply distinct from its Spanish-speaking neighbours and also being a major factor contributing to the differentiation between Brazilians and people from the rest of South America. Brazilian Portuguese has had its own development, influenced by the Amerindian and African languages.[citation needed] Due to this, the language is somewhat different from that spoken in Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries, mainly due to phonological differences,[citation needed] of similar importance to the differences between British English and American English.\\r\\nDuring the 18th century, other differences between the Brazilian and European Portuguese developed, mainly through the introduction of lexicon from African and Tupi languages, such as words related to fauna and flora. At that time Brazilian Portuguese failed to adopt linguistic changes taking place in Portugal produced by French influence.[which?][citation needed] The Brazilian Portuguese remained loyal to the pronunciation used at the time of its discovery. However, when Don Jo?o, the Portuguese king, and the royal entourage took refuge in Brazil in 1808 (when Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Portugal), he influenced the Portuguese spoken in the cities, making it more similar to the Portuguese of Portugal.[citation needed] After Brazilian independence in 1822, Brazilian Portuguese became influenced by Europeans who had migrated to the country.[citation needed] This is the reason that, in those areas (such as Rio de Janeiro and Recife), one finds variations in pronunciation (for instance, palatalization of post-vocalic /s/) and a few superficial lexical changes.[which?][citation needed] These changes reflect the linguistics of the nationalities settling in each area.[which?] In the 20th century, the divide between the Portuguese and Brazilian variants of Portuguese widened as the result of new words for technological innovations. This happened because Portuguese lacked a uniform procedure for adopting such words.[citation needed] Certain words took different forms in different countries. For example: in Portugal one hears \\"comboio,\\" and in Brazil one hears \\"trem,\\" both meaning train. \\"Autocarro\\" in Portugal is the same thing as \\"?nibus\\" in Brazil, both meaning bus.[17]\\r\\nDespite the fact that Portuguese is the official language of Brazil and the vast majority of Brazilians speak only Portuguese, there are several other languages spoken in the country. According to the president of IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) there are an estimated 210 languages spoken in Brazil. Eighty[citation needed] are Amerindian languages, while the others are languages brought by immigrants. The 1950 Census was the last one to ask Brazilians which language they speak at home. Since then, the Census does not ask about language. However, the Census of 2010 asked respondents which languages they speak, allowing a better analysis of the languages spoken in Brazil.[18]\\r\\nAt least one of the indigenous languages, Nheengatu, became an official language alongside Portuguese in the municipality of S?o Gabriel da Cachoeira.[19]\\r\\nAccording to the 1940 Census, after Portuguese, German was the most widely spoken language in Brazil. Although the Italian immigration to Brazil was much more significant than the German one, the German language had many more speakers than the Italian one, according to the Census. The Census revealed that two-thirds of the children of German immigrants spoke German at home. In comparison, half of the children of Italians spoke Portuguese at home. The stronger preservation of the German language when compared to the Italian one has many factors: Italian is closer to Portuguese than German, leading to a faster assimilation of the Italian speakers. (One might compare this to the United States, where a huge wave of German immigrants almost completely switched to English and assimilated more thoroughly than the Italian-Americans.) Also, the German immigrants used to educate their children in German schools. The Italians, on the other hand, had less organized ethnic schools and the cultural formation was centered in church, not in schools. Most of the children of Italians went to public schools, where Portuguese was spoken.[20] Until World War II, some 1.5 million Italians had immigrated to Brazil, compared to only 250,000 Germans. However, the 1940 Census revealed that German was spoken as a home language by 644,458 people, compared to only 458,054 speakers of Italian.[21]\\r\\nSpaniards, who formed the third largest immigrant group in Brazil (after the Portuguese and Italians) were also quickly assimilated into the Portuguese-speaking majority. Spanish is similar to Portuguese, which led to a fast assimilation. Moreover, many of the Spanish immigrants were from Galicia, where the dominant language was not Spanish, but Galician, which is even closer to Portuguese, sometimes even being considered two dialects of the same language.[22][23] Despite the large influx of Spanish immigrants to Brazil from 1880 to 1930 (over 700,000 people) the Census of 1940 revealed that only 74,000 people spoke Spanish in Brazil.\\r\\nOther languages such as Polish and Ukrainian, along with German and Italian, are spoken in rural areas of Southern Brazil, by small communities of descendants of immigrants, who are for the most part bilingual. There are whole regions in southern Brazil where people speak both Portuguese and one or more of these languages. For example, it is reported that more than 90% of the residents of the small city of Presidente Lucena, located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, speak Riograndenser Hunsrckisch, a Brazilian form of the Hunsrckisch dialect of German.[24]\\r\\nSome immigrant communities in southern Brazil, chiefly the German and the Italian ones, have lasted long enough to develop distinctive dialects from their original European sources. For example, Brazilian German, also known as Riograndenser Hunsrckisch. In the Serra Ga~cha region, we can find Italian dialects such as Talian or italiano riograndense, based on the Venetian language.\\r\\nOther German dialects were transplanted to this part of Brazil. For example, the Austrian dialect spoken in Dreizehnlinden or Treze Tlias in the state of Santa Catarina; or the dialect Schwowisch, from Donauschwaben immigrants, is spoken in Entre Rios, Guarapuava, in the state of Paran; or the East Pomeranian dialect spoken in many different parts of southern Brazil (in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paran, Esprito Santo, S?o Paulo, etc.). Plautdietsch is spoken by the descendants of Russian Mennonites. However, these languages have been rapidly replaced by Portuguese in the last few decades, partly due to a government decision to integrate immigrant populations. Today, states like Rio Grande do Sul are trying to reverse that trend and immigrant languages such as German and Italian are being reintroduced into the curriculum again, in communities where they originally thrived. Meanwhile, on the Argentinian and Uruguayan border regions, Brazilian students are being introduced to the Spanish language.\\r\\nIn the city of S?o Paulo, Korean, Chinese and Japanese can be heard in the immigrants districts, like Liberdade. A Japanese-language newspaper, the S?o Paulo Shinbun, has been published in the city of S?o Paulo since 1946.[25] There is a significant community of Japanese speakers in S?o Paulo, Paran, Mato Grosso do Sul, Par and Amazonas. Much smaller groups exist in Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and other parts of Brazil. Many Chinese, especially from Macau, speak a Chinese creole called Macanese (patu or macasta), aside from Hakka, Mandarin and Cantonese.\\r\\nMany Amerindian minority languages are spoken throughout Brazil, mostly in Northern Brazil. Indigenous languages with about 10,000 speakers or more are Ticuna (language isolate), Kaingang (Gean family), Kaiw Guarani, Nheengatu (Tupian), Guajajra (Tupian), Macushi (Cariban), Terena (Arawakan), Xavante (Gean) and Maw (Tupian). Tucano (Tucanoan) has half that number, but is widely used as a second language in the Amazon.\\r\\nOne of the two Brazilian lnguas gerais (general languages), Nheengatu, was until the late 19th century the common language used by a large number of indigenous, European, African, and African-descendant peoples throughout the coast of Brazilit was spoken by the majority of the population in the land. It was proscribed by the Marquis of Pombal for its association with the Jesuit missions. A recent resurgence in popularity of this language occurred, and it is now an official language in the city of S?o Gabriel da Cachoeira. Today, in the Amazon Basin, political campaigning is still printed in this Tupian language.\\r\\nSpanish is understood to various degrees by most Brazilians, due to the similarities of the languages. However, it is hardly spoken well by individuals who have not taken specific education in the language, due to the substantial differences in phonology between the two languages. In some parts of Brazil, close to the border of Brazil with Spanish-speaking countries, Brazilians will use a rough mixture of Spanish and Portuguese that is sometimes known as Portu?ol to communicate with their neighbours on the other side of the border; however, these Brazilians continue to speak Portuguese at home. In recent years, Spanish has become more popular as a second or third language in Brazil due in large part to the economic advantages that Spanish fluency brings in doing business with other countries in the region, since seven of the 11 countries that border Brazil use Spanish as an official language.\\r\\nIn S?o Paulo, the German-Brazilian newspaper Brasil-Post has been published for over fifty years. There are many other media organizations throughout the land specializing either in church issues, music, language etc.\\r\\nThe Italian online newspaper La Rena offers Italian lessons.\\r\\nThere are many other non-Portuguese publications, bilingual web sites, radio and television programs throughout the country. For example, TV Galega from Blumenau shows German-language programming on their channel on a weekly basis.\\r\\nOn the Rio Grande do Sul state, there are several German and Italian colonized cities, communities and groups. Most small cities have German or Italian as their second language. In the capital Porto Alegre, it is easy to find people who speak one of those or both.\\r\\nThere are also at least two ethnic neighborhoods in the country: Liberdade, bastion of Japanese immigrants,[26][27] and Bixiga, stronghold of Italian immigrants,[28][29] both in S?o Paulo; however, these neighborhoods do not count yet with specific legislation for the protection of Japanese and Italian languages in these sites.[30][31]\\r\\nThis century has seen the growth of a trend of co-official languages in cities populated by immigrants (such as Italian and German) or indigenous in the north, both with support from the Ministry of Tourism, as was recently established in Santa Maria de Jetib, Pomerode and Vila Pav?o,[32] where German also has co-official status.[33]\\r\\nThe first municipality to adopt a co-official language in Brazil was S?o Gabriel da Cachoeira, in 2002.[34][35] Since then, other municipalities have attempted to adopt their own co-official languages.\\r\\nThe states of Santa Catarina[36][37][38] and Rio Grande do Sul have Talian officially approved as a heritage language in these states,[39] and Esprito Santo has the East Pomeranian dialect, along with the German language as cultural heritage.[40][41][42][43] [44] [45]\\r\\nAlso in production is the documentary video Brasil Talian,[46] with directed and written by Andr Costantin and executive producer of the historian Fernando Roveda.[47] The pre-launch occurred on November 18, 2011, the date that marked the start of production of the documentary.[48]\\r\\n[54]","input":"What is the most widely spoken language in brazil?"},{"output":"After World War II","context":"A reserve currency (or anchor currency) is a currency that is held in significant quantities by governments and institutions as part of their foreign exchange reserves. The reserve currency is commonly used in international transactions, international investments and all aspects of the global economy. It is often considered a hard currency or safe-haven currency. People who live in a country that issues a reserve currency can purchase imports and borrow across borders more cheaply than people in other nations because they do not need to exchange their currency to do so.\\r\\nBy the end of the 20th century, the United States dollar was considered the world's most dominant reserve currency.[1] The world's need for dollars has allowed the United States government as well as Americans to borrow at lower costs, granting them an advantage in excess of $100 billion per year.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReserve currencies come and go. International currencies in the past have included the Greek drachma, coined in the fifth century B.C., the Roman denari, the Byzantine solidus and Arab dinar of the middle-ages, the Venetian ducato and the Florentine florin of the Renaissance, the seventeenth century Dutch guilder and the French franc.\\r\\nThe Dutch guilder emerged as a de facto world currency in the 18th century due to unprecedented domination of trade by the Dutch East India Company.[3] However, the development of the modern concept of a reserve currency took place in the mid nineteenth century, with the introduction of national central banks and treasuries and an increasingly integrated global economy. By the 1860s, most industrialised countries had followed the lead of the United Kingdom and put their currency on to the gold standard. At that point the UK was the primary exporter of manufactured goods and services and over 60% of world trade was invoiced in pound sterling. British banks were also expanding overseas, London was the world centre for insurance and commodity markets and British capital was the leading source of foreign investment around the world; sterling soon became the standard currency used for international commercial transactions.[4]\\r\\nAttempts were made in the interwar period to restore the gold standard. The British Gold Standard Act reintroduced the gold bullion standard in 1925,[5] followed by many other countries. This led to relative stability, followed by deflation, but because the onset of the Great Depression and other factors, global trade greatly declined and the gold standard fell. Speculative attacks on the pound forced Britain entirely off the gold standard in 1931.[6][7]\\r\\nAfter World War II, the international financial system was governed by a formal agreement, the Bretton Woods System. Under this system the United States dollar was placed deliberately as the anchor of the system, with the US government guaranteeing other central banks that they could sell their US dollar reserves at a fixed rate for gold.[8]\\r\\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the system suffered setbacks ostensibly due to problems pointed out by the Triffin dilemmathe conflict of economic interests that arises between short-term domestic objectives and long-term international objectives when a national currency also serves as a world reserve currency.\\r\\nThus the following table is a limited view about the global currency reserves that only deals with allocated reserves:\\r\\nThe percental composition of currencies of official foreign exchange reserves from 1995 to 2013.[9][10][11]\\r\\nEconomists debate whether a single reserve currency will always dominate the global economy.[12] Many have recently argued that one currency will almost always dominate due to network externalities, especially in the field of invoicing trade and denominating foreign debt securities, meaning that there are strong incentives to conform to the choice that dominates the marketplace. The argument is that, in the absence of sufficiently large shocks, a currency that dominates the marketplace will not lose much ground to challengers.\\r\\nHowever, some economists, such as Barry Eichengreen, argue that this is not as true when it comes to the denomination of official reserves because the network externalities are not strong. As long as the currency's market is sufficiently liquid, the benefits of reserve diversification are strong, as it insures against large capital losses. The implication is that the world may well soon begin to move away from a financial system dominated uniquely by the US dollar. In the first half of the 20th century multiple currencies did share the status as primary reserve currencies. Although the British Sterling was the largest currency, both the French franc and the German mark shared large portions of the market until the First World War, after which the mark was replaced by the dollar. Since the Second World War, the dollar has dominated official reserves, but this is likely a reflection of the unusual domination of the American economy during this period, as well as official discouragement of reserve status from the potential rivals, Germany and Japan.\\r\\nThe top reserve currency is generally selected by the banking community for the strength and stability of the economy in which it is used. Thus, as a currency becomes less stable, or its economy becomes less dominant, bankers may over time abandon it for a currency issued by a larger or more stable economy. This can take a relatively long time, as recognition is important in determining a reserve currency. For example, it took many years after the United States overtook the United Kingdom as the world's largest economy before the dollar overtook the pound sterling as the dominant global reserve currency.[13] In 1944, when the US dollar was chosen as the world reference currency at Bretton Woods, it was only the second currency in global reserves.[13]\\r\\nThe G8 also frequently issues public statements as to exchange rates. In the past due to the Plaza Accord, its predecessor bodies could directly manipulate rates to reverse large trade deficits.\\r\\nThe United States dollar is the most widely held currency in the Allocated Reserves today. Throughout the last decade, an average of two thirds of the total Allocated foreign exchange reserves of countries have been in US dollars. For this reason, the US dollar is said to have \\"reserve-currency status\\", making it somewhat easier for the United States to run higher trade deficits with greatly postponed economic impact or even postponing a currency crisis. Central bank reserves held in dollar-denominated debt, however, are small compared to private holdings of such debt. In the event that non-United States holders of dollar-denominated assets decided to shift holdings to assets denominated in other currencies, there could be serious consequences for the US economy. Changes of this kind are rare, and typically change takes place gradually over time; the markets involved adjust accordingly.[13]\\r\\nHowever, the dollar remains the favorite reserve currency because it has stability along with assets such as United States Treasury security that have both scale and liquidity.[14]\\r\\nThe US dollar's dominant position in global reserves is challenged occasionally, because of the growing share of unallocated reserves, and because of the doubt regarding dollar stability in the long term.[15][16][17][18][19] However, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the dollars share in the worlds foreign-exchange trades rose slightly from 85% in 2010 to 87% in 2013.[20]\\r\\nThe dollar's role as the undisputed reserve currency of the world allows the United States to impose unilateral sanctions against actions performed between other countries, for example the American fine against BNP Paribas for violations of U.S. sanctions that were not laws of France or the other countries involved in the transactions.[21] In 2014 Beijing and Moscow signed a 150 billion yuan central bank liquidity swap line agreement to get around American sanctions on their behaviors.[22]\\r\\nThe euro is currently the second most commonly held reserve currency, comprising about a quarter of allocated holdings. After World War II and the rebuilding of the German economy, the German Deutsche Mark gained the status of the second most important reserve currency after the US dollar. When the euro was introduced on 1 January 1999, replacing the Mark, French franc and ten other European currencies, it inherited the status of a major reserve currency from the Mark. Since then, its contribution to official reserves has risen continually as banks seek to diversify their reserves, and trade in the eurozone continues to expand.[23]\\r\\nFormer U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in September 2007 that the euro could replace the U.S. dollar as the world's primary reserve currency. It was \\"absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the US dollar as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency.\\"[24] Econometric analysis by Jeffrey Frankel and Menzie Chinn in 2006 suggested that the euro could replace the U.S. dollar as the major reserve currency by 2020 if either the remaining EU members, including the UK and Denmark, adopted the euro by 2020, or the recent depreciation trend of the dollar persisted into the future.[25][26] In recent years, the euro's share of the worldwide currency reserve basket has continued to increasealbeit at a slower rate than before the beginning of the worldwide credit crunch related recession and Eurozone crisis, which harmed the euro and slowed its adoption.[27] Since 2009, the reserve currency use of the euro has continued to drop, down to 23.9 percent in 2013.[28]\\r\\nThe Dutch guilder was the de facto reserve currency in Europe in 17th and 18th centuries.[3][29]\\r\\nThe United Kingdom's pound sterling was the primary reserve currency of much of the world in the 19th century and first half of the 20th century.[13] The emergence of the USA as an economic superpower, and the establishment of the U.S. Federal Reserve System in 1913,[30] and U.S. economic dominance from the second half of the 20th century onward, as well as economic weakness in the UK at various times during the second half of the 20th century, resulted in Sterling losing its status as the world's most important reserve currency: in the 1950s 55% of global reserves were still held in sterling; but the share was 10% lower within 20 years.[13][31]\\r\\nSince 2006, with the exception of 2012, Sterling is the third most widely held reserve currency, having seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years, growing from about 2.5% to around 4% of all currency reserves.[32] Analysts said this resurgence was caused by carry-trade investors considering the pound as a stable high-yield proxy to the euro, and by the position of London in world financial affairs.[33]\\r\\nJapan's yen is part of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) special drawing rights (SDR) valuation. The SDR currency value is determined daily by the IMF, based on the exchange rates of the currencies making up the basket, as quoted at noon at the London market. The valuation basket is reviewed and adjusted every five years.[34]\\r\\nThe SDR Values and yen conversion for government procurement are used by the Japan External Trade Organization for Japan's official procurement in international trade.[35]\\r\\nThe Swiss franc, despite gaining ground among the world's foreign-currency reserves[36] and being often used in denominating foreign loans,[37] cannot be considered as a world reserve currency, since the share of all foreign exchange reserves held in Swiss francs has historically been well below 0.5%. The daily trading market turnover of the franc, however, ranked fifth, or about 3.4%, among all currencies in a 2007 survey by the Bank for International Settlements.[38]\\r\\nA number of central banks (and commercial banks) keep Canadian dollars as a reserve currency. In the economy of the Americas, the Canadian dollar plays a similar role to that played by the Australian dollar (AUD) in the Asia-Pacific region. The Canadian dollar (as a regional reserve currency for banking) has been an important part of the British, French and Dutch Caribbean states' economies and finance systems since the 1950s.[39] The Canadian dollar is also held by many central banks in Central America and South America. It is held in Latin America because of remittances and international trade in the region.[39]\\r\\nBecause Canadas primary foreign-trade relationship is with the United States, Canadian consumers, economists, and many businesses primarily define and value the Canadian dollar in terms of the United States dollar. Thus, by observing how the Canadian dollar floats in terms of the US dollar, foreign-exchange economists can indirectly observe internal behaviours and patterns in the US economy that could not be seen by direct observation. Also, because it is considered a petrodollar, the Canadian dollar has only fully evolved into a global reserve currency since the 1970s, when it was floated against all other world currencies.\\r\\nThe Canadian dollar, since 2013, is ranked 5th among foreign currency reserves in the world.[40]\\r\\nChinese yuan officially became a world reserve currency on November 30, 2015. It represents 10.92% of the IMF's Special Drawing Rights currency basket.[41][42] This makes Chinese yuan the third reserve currency after the US dollar and Euro.[41]\\r\\nA report released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in 2010, called for abandoning the U.S. dollar as the single major reserve currency. The report states that the new reserve system should not be based on a single currency or even multiple national currencies but instead permit the emission of international liquidity to create a more stable global financial system.[43][44][45]\\r\\nCountries such as Russia and the People's Republic of China, central banks, and economic analysts and groups, such as the Gulf Cooperation Council, have expressed a desire to see an independent new currency replace the dollar as the reserve currency.\\r\\nOn 10 July 2009, Russian President Medvedev proposed a new 'world currency' at the G8 meeting in London as an alternative reserve currency to replace the dollar.[46]\\r\\nChina, Russia, India, Turkey, Brazil, Venezuela and other oil-producing countries have recently agreed \\"to transact all of their mutual trade and investment in their own currencies\\" effectively minimizing the need, at least in the short term, for a global reserve currency.[47] Nevertheless, at the beginning of the 21st century, gold and crude oil were still priced in dollars, which helps export inflation and has brought complaints about OPEC's policies of managing oil quotas to maintain dollar price stability.[48]\\r\\nSome have proposed the use of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) special drawing rights (SDRs) as a reserve.\\r\\nChina has proposed using SDRs, calculated daily from a basket of U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen and British pounds, for international payments.[49]\\r\\nOn 3 September 2009, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) issued a report calling for a new reserve currency based on the SDR, managed by a new global reserve bank.[50] The IMF released a report in February 2011, stating that using SDRs \\"could help stabilize the global financial system.\\"[51]","input":"When did the us dollar become reserve currency?"},{"output":"1980s","context":"Experiments have been conducted on automating cars since at least the 1920s;[1] promising trials took place in the 1950s and work has proceeded since then. The first self-sufficient and truly autonomous cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab[2] and ALV[3][4] projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's Eureka Prometheus Project [5] in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working prototype autonomous vehicles including Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, Continental Automotive Systems, Autoliv Inc., Bosch, Nissan, Toyota, Audi, Volvo, Vislab from University of Parma, Oxford University and Google.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] In July 2013, Vislab demonstrated BRAiVE, a vehicle that moved autonomously on a mixed traffic route open to public traffic.[14]\\r\\nAs of 2013, four U.S. states have passed laws permitting autonomous cars: Nevada, Florida, California, and Michigan.[15][16][17][18][19] In Europe, cities in Belgium, France, Italy and the UK are planning to operate transport systems for driverless cars,[20][21][22] and Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain have allowed testing robotic cars in traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1925, Houdina Radio Control demonstrated the radio-controlled \\"American Wonder\\" on New York City streets, traveling up Broadway and down Fifth Avenue through the thick of the traffic jam. The American Wonder was a 1926 Chandler that was equipped with a transmitting antennae on the tonneau and was operated by a second car that followed it and sent out radio impulses which were caught by the transmitting antennae. The antennae introduced the signals to circuit-breakers which operated small electric motors that directed every movement of the car.\\r\\nAchen Motor, a distributor of cars in Milwaukee and surrounding territory, used Francis' invention under the name \\"Phantom Auto\\" and demonstrated it in December 1926 on the streets of Milwaukee.[1] It was demonstrated again in June 1932 on the streets of Fredericksburg as a feature attraction of Bigger Bargain Day in which most of the merchants of the city were participating.[23]\\r\\nAn early representation of an automated guided car was Norman Bel Geddes's Futurama exhibit sponsored by General Motors at the 1939 World's Fair, which depicted radio-controlled electric cars that were propelled via electromagnetic fields provided by circuits embedded in the roadway.[24]\\r\\nBel Geddes later outlined his vision in his book, Magic Motorways (1940), promoting advances in highway design and transportation, foreshadowing the Interstate Highway System, and arguing that humans should be removed from the process of driving. Bel Geddes forecasted these advances to be a reality in 1960.[25][26]\\r\\nIn 1953, RCA Labs successfully built a miniature car that was guided and controlled by wires that were laid in a pattern on a laboratory floor. The system sparked the imagination of Leland M. Hancock, traffic engineer in the Nebraska Department of Roads, and of his director, L. N. Ress, state engineer. The decision was made to experiment with the system in actual highway installations.\\r\\nIn 1957, a full size system was successfully demonstrated by RCA Labs and the State of Nebraska on a 400-foot strip of public highway at the intersection of U.S. Route 77 and Nebraska Highway 2, then just outside Lincoln, Nebraska. A series of experimental detector circuits buried in the pavement were a series of lights along the edge of the road. The detector circuits were able to send impulses to guide the car and determine the presence and velocity of any metallic vehicle on its surface. A previous test installation of the system in September 1954 along U.S. Route 73 and U.S. Route 75 in Cass County, Nebraska was utilized as an experimental traffic counter. It was developed in collaboration with General Motors, who paired two standard models with equipment consisting of special radio receivers and audible and visual warning devices that were able to simulate automatic steering, accelerating and brake control.[27][28][29]\\r\\nIt was further demonstrated on 5 June 1960, at RCA Lab's headquarter in Princeton, New Jersey, where reporters were allowed to \\"drive\\" on the cars. Commercialization of the system was expected to happen by 1975.[30][31]\\r\\nAlso during the 1950s throughout the 1960s, General Motors showcased the Firebirds, a series of experimental cars that were described to have an \\"electronic guide system [that] can rush it over an automatic highway while the driver relaxes\\".\\r\\nIn 1960, Ohio State University's Communication and Control Systems Laboratory launched a project to develop driverless cars which were activated by electronic devices imbedded in the roadway. Head of the project, Dr. Robert L. Cosgriff, claimed in 1966 that the system could be ready for installation on a public road in 15 years.[32]\\r\\nIn the early 1960s, the Bureau of Public Roads considered the construction of an experimental electronically controlled highway. Four states √ø Ohio, Massachusetts, New York and California √ø were bidding for the construction.[33] In August 1961, Popular Science reported on the Aeromobile 35B, an air-cushion vehicle (ACV) that was invented by William Bertelsen and was envisioned to revolutionize the transportation system, with personal self-driving hovering cars that could speed up to 1,500MPH.\\r\\nDuring the 1960s, the United Kingdom's Transport and Road Research Laboratory tested a driverless Citroen DS that interacted with magnetic cables that were embedded in the road. It went through a test track at 80 miles per hour (130?km/h) without deviation of speed or direction in any weather conditions, and in a far more effective way than by human control. Research continued in the '70s with cruise control devices activated by signals in the cabling beneath the tracks. According to cost benefit analyses that were made, adoption of system on the British motorways would be repaid by end of the century, increase the road capacity by at least 50% and prevent around 40% of the accidents. Funding for these experiments was withdrawn by the mid-1970s.[34][35][36]\\r\\nAlso during the 1960s and the 1970s, Bendix Corporation developed and tested driverless cars that were powered and controlled by buried cables, with wayside communicators relaying computer messages. Stanford demonstrated its Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Cart, a small wheeled robot that once accidentally navigated onto a nearby road.\\r\\nPreliminary research into the intelligent automated logic needed for autonomous cars was conducted at the Coordinated Science Laboratory of the University of Illinois in the early to mid 1970s.[37]\\r\\nIn the 1980s, a vision-guided Mercedes-Benz robotic van, designed by Ernst Dickmanns and his team at the Bundeswehr University Munich in Munich, Germany, achieved a speed of 39 miles per hour (63?km/h) on streets without traffic.[5] Subsequently, EUREKA conducted the ?749,000,000 Prometheus Project on autonomous vehicles from 1987 to 1995.\\r\\nIn the same decade, the DARPA-funded Autonomous Land Vehicle (ALV) project in the United States made use of new technologies developed by the University of Maryland, Carnegie Mellon University, the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan, Martin Marietta and SRI International. The ALV project achieved the first road-following demonstration that used lidar, computer vision and autonomous robotic control to direct a robotic vehicle at speeds of up to 19 miles per hour (31?km/h). In 1987, HRL Laboratories (formerly Hughes Research Labs) demonstrated the first off-road map and sensor-based autonomous navigation on the ALV. The vehicle traveled over 2,000 feet (610?m) at 1.9 miles per hour (3.1?km/h) on complex terrain with steep slopes, ravines, large rocks, and vegetation. By 1989, Carnegie Mellon University had pioneered the use of neural networks to steer and otherwise control autonomous vehicles,[38] forming the basis of contemporary control strategies.\\r\\nIn 1991, the United States Congress passed the ISTEA Transportation Authorization bill, which instructed USDOT to \\"demonstrate an automated vehicle and highway system by 1997.\\" The Federal Highway Administration took on this task, first with a series of Precursor Systems Analyses and then by establishing the National Automated Highway System Consortium (NAHSC). This cost-shared project was led by FHWA and General Motors, with Caltrans, Delco, Parsons Brinkerhoff, Bechtel, UC-Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon University, and Lockheed Martin as additional partners. Extensive systems engineering work and research culminated in Demo '97 on I-15 in San Diego, California, in which about 20 automated vehicles, including cars, buses, and trucks, were demonstrated to thousands of onlookers, attracting extensive media coverage. The demonstrations involved close-headway platooning intended to operate in segregated traffic, as well as \\"free agent\\" vehicles intended to operate in mixed traffic. Other carmakers were invited to demonstrate their systems, such that Toyota and Honda also participated. While the subsequent aim was to produce a system design to aid commercialization, the program was cancelled in the late 1990s due to tightening research budgets at USDOT. Overall funding for the program was in the range of $90 million.[39]\\r\\nIn 1994, the twin robot vehicles VaMP and Vita-2 of Daimler-Benz and Ernst Dickmanns of UniBwM drove more than 620 miles (1,000?km) on a Paris three-lane highway in standard heavy traffic at speeds up to 81 miles per hour (130?km/h), albeit semi-autonomously with human interventions. They demonstrated autonomous driving in free lanes, convoy driving, and lane changes with autonomous passing of other cars.[citation needed] That same year, Lucas Industries developed parts for a semi-autonomous car in a project that was funded by Jaguar Cars, Lucas, and the UK Department of Trade and Industry.[40]\\r\\nIn 1995, Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab project completed a 3,100 miles (5,000?km) cross-country journey, of which 98.2% was autonomously controlled, dubbed \\"No Hands Across America\\".[41] This car, however, was semi-autonomous by nature: it used neural networks to control the steering wheel, but throttle and brakes were human-controlled, chiefly for safety reasons. Also in 1995, Dickmanns' re-engineered autonomous S-Class Mercedes-Benz undertook a 990 miles (1,590?km) journey from Munich in Bavaria, Germany to Copenhagen, Denmark and back, using saccadic computer vision and transputers to react in real time. The robot achieved speeds exceeding 109 miles per hour (175?km/h) on the German Autobahn, with a mean time between human interventions of 5.6 miles (9.0?km), or 95% autonomous driving. It drove in traffic, executing manoeuvres to pass other cars. Despite being a research system without emphasis on long distance reliability, it drove up to 98 miles (158?km) without human intervention.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1996, (now Professor) Alberto Broggi of the University of Parma launched the ARGO Project, which worked on enabling a modified Lancia Thema to follow the normal (painted) lane marks in an unmodified highway.[42] The culmination of the project was a journey of 1,200 miles (1,900?km) over six days on the motorways of northern Italy dubbed Mille Miglia in Automatico (\\"One thousand automatic miles\\"), with an average speed of 56 miles per hour (90?km/h).[43] The car operated in fully automatic mode for 94% of its journey, with the longest automatic stretch being 34 miles (55?km). The vehicle had only two black-and-white low-cost video cameras on board and used stereoscopic vision algorithms to understand its environment.\\r\\nThe ParkShuttle, billed as the worlds first driverless vehicle,[44] is an automated people mover which uses artificial reference points (magnets) embedded in the road surface to verify its position. Two pilot projects were started in the Netherlands, at Schiphol Airport (December 1997) and business park Rivium (1999). Both carried members of the general public and as such claim stake to the title to the first driverless vehicles. The vehicles are autonomous, do not feature a steering wheel or pedals, nor do they have a safety driver or steward on board. The drive at grade, on a dedicated lane which does feature intersections with pedestrians, bicyclists and cars.[45]\\r\\nThe US Government funded three military efforts known as Demo I (US Army), Demo II (DARPA), and Demo III (US Army). Demo III (2001)[46] demonstrated the ability of unmanned ground vehicles to navigate miles of difficult off-road terrain, avoiding obstacles such as rocks and trees. James Albus at the National Institute of Standards and Technology provided the Real-Time Control System which is a hierarchical control system. Not only were individual vehicles controlled (e.g. throttle, steering, and brake), but groups of vehicles had their movements automatically coordinated in response to high level goals.\\r\\nIn the first Grand Challenge held in March 2004, DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) offered a $1 million prize to any team of robotic engineers which could create an autonomous car capable of finishing a 150-mile course in the Mojave Desert. No team was successful in completing the course.[47]\\r\\nIn October 2005, the second DARPA Grand Challenge was again held in a desert environment. GPS points were placed and obstacle types were located in advance.[48] This year, five vehicles completed the course.\\r\\nIn November 2007, DARPA again sponsored Grand Challenge III, but this time the Challenge was held in an urban environment. In this race, a 2007 Chevy Tahoe autonomous car from Carnegie Mellon University earned the 1st place. Prize competitions as DARPA Grand Challenges gave students and researchers an opportunity to research a project on autonomous cars to reduce the burden of transportation problems such as traffic congestion and traffic accidents that increasingly exist on many urban residents.[48]\\r\\nIn January 2006, the United Kingdom's 'Foresight' think-tank revealed a report which predicts RFID-tagged driverless cars on UK's roads by 2056 and the Royal Academy of Engineering claimed that driverless trucks could be on Britain's motorways by 2019.[49][50]\\r\\nIn 1998, Willie Jones [51] states that many automakers consider autonomous technology as part of their research yearly. He notes \\"In May 1998, Toyota became the first to introduce an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system on a production vehicle when it unveiled a laser-based system for its Progres compact luxury sedan, which it sold in Japan\\".[52]\\r\\nAutonomous vehicles have also been used in mining. In December 2008, Rio Tinto Alcan began testing the Komatsu Autonomous Haulage System √ø the world's first commercial autonomous mining haulage system √ø in the Pilbara iron ore mine in Western Australia. Rio Tinto has reported benefits in health, safety, and productivity. In November 2011, Rio Tinto signed a deal to greatly expand its fleet of driverless trucks.[53]\\r\\nGoogle began developing its self-driving cars in 2009, but did so privately, avoiding public announcement of the program until a later time.[54]\\r\\nMany major automotive manufacturers, including General Motors, Ford, Mercedes Benz, Volkswagen, Audi, Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and Volvo, are testing driverless car systems as of 2013. BMW has been testing driverless systems since around 2005,[55][56] while in 2010, Audi sent a driverless Audi TTS to the top of Pikes Peak at close to race speeds.[7] In 2011, GM created the EN-V (short for Electric Networked Vehicle), an autonomous electric urban vehicle.[57] In 2012, Volkswagen began testing a \\"Temporary Auto Pilot\\" (TAP) system that will allow a car to drive itself at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour (130?km/h) on the highway.[58] Ford has conducted extensive research into driverless systems and vehicular communication systems.[59] In January 2013, Toyota demonstrated a partially self-driving car with numerous sensors and communication systems.[9] Other programs in the field include the 2GetThere passenger vehicles from the Netherlands and the DARPA Grand Challenge in the USA; some plans for bimodal public transport systems include autonomous cars as a component.[60]\\r\\nIn 2010, Italy's VisLab from the University of Parma, led by Professor Alberto Broggi, ran the VisLab Intercontinental Autonomous Challenge (VIAC), a 9,900-mile (15,900?km) test run which marked the first intercontinental land journey completed by autonomous vehicles. Four electric vans made a 100-day journey, leaving Parma, Italy, on 20 July 2010, and arriving at the Shanghai Expo in China on 28 October.\\r\\nThe research project is co-funded by the European Union CORDIS program.[62]\\r\\nIn 2010, the Institute of Control Engineering of the Technische Universit?t Braunschweig demonstrated the first autonomous driving on public streets in Germany with the research vehicle Leonie. It was the first car licensed for autonomous driving on the streets and highways in Germany.[63]\\r\\nIn 2011, the Freie Universit?t Berlin developed two autonomous cars to drive in the innercity traffic of Berlin in Germany. Led by the AutoNOMOS group, the two vehicles Spirit of Berlin and MadeInGermany handled intercity traffic, traffic lights and roundabouts between International Congress Centrum and Brandenburg Gate. It was financed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.[64]\\r\\nOn May 1, 2012, a 22?km (14?mi) driving test was administered to a Google self-driving car by Nevada motor vehicle examiners in a test route in the city of Las Vegas, Nevada. The autonomous car passed the test, but was not tested at roundabouts, no-signal railroad crossings, or school zones.[54]\\r\\nIn 2013, on July 12, VisLab conducted another pioneering test of autonomous vehicles, during which a robotic vehicle drove in downtown Parma with no human control, successfully navigating roundabouts, traffic lights, pedestrian crossings and other common hazards.[65]\\r\\nIn August 2013, Daimler R&D with Karlsruhe Institute of Technology/FZI, made a Mercedes-Benz S-class vehicle with close-to-production stereo cameraS[66] and radars drive completely autonomously for about 100?km from Mannheim to Pforzheim, Germany, following the historic Bertha Benz Memorial Route.[67][68]\\r\\nIn August 2013 Nissan announced its plans to launch several driverless cars by 2020. The company is building in Japan a dedicated autonomous driving proving ground, to be completed in 2014. Nissan installed its autonomous car technology in a Nissan Leaf electric car for demonstration purposes. The car was demonstrated at Nissan 360 test drive event held in California in August 2013.[69][70] In September 2013, the Leaf fitted the prototype Advanced Driver Assistance System was granted a license plate that allows to drive it on Japanese public roads. The testing car will be used by Nissan engineers to evaluate how its in-house autonomous driving software performs in the real world. Time spent on public roads will help refine the cars software for fully automated driving.[71] The autonomous Leaf was demonstrated on public roads for the first time at a media event held in Japan in November 2013. The Leaf drove on the Sagami Expressway in Kanagawa prefecture, near Tokyo. Nissan vice chairman Toshiyuki Shiga and the prefectures Governor, Yuji Kuroiwa, rode in the car during the test.[72][73]\\r\\nAvailable in 2013, the 2014 Mercedes S-Class has options for autonomous steering, lane keeping, acceleration/braking, parking, accident avoidance, and driver fatigue detection, in both city traffic and highway speeds of up to 124 miles (200?km) per hour.[74][75][76][77]\\r\\nReleased in 2013, the 2014 Infiniti Q50 uses cameras, radar and other technology to deliver various lane-keeping, collision avoidance and cruise control features. One reviewer remarked, \\"With the Q50 managing its own speed and adjusting course, I could sit back and simply watch, even on mildly curving highways, for three or more miles at a stretch,\\" adding that he wasn't touching the steering wheel or pedals.[78]\\r\\nAlthough as of 2013, fully autonomous vehicles are not yet available to the public, many contemporary car models have features offering limited autonomous functionality. These include adaptive cruise control, a system that monitors distances to adjacent vehicles in the same lane, adjusting the speed with the flow of traffic; lane assist, which monitors the vehicle's position in the lane, and either warns the driver when the vehicle is leaving its lane, or, less commonly, takes corrective actions; and parking assist, which assists the driver in the task of parallel parking.[79]\\r\\nIn January 2014, Induct Technology's Navia shuttle became the first self-driving vehicle to be available for commercial sale.[80] Limited to 12.5 miles per hour (20.1?km/h), the open-air electric vehicle resembles a golf cart and seats up to eight people. It is intended to shuttle people around \\"pedestrianized city centers, large industrial sites, airports, theme parks, university campuses or hospital complexes.\\"[81]\\r\\nOn May 27, 2014, Google[82] announced plans to unveil 100 autonomous car prototypes built from scratch inside Google's secret X lab, as manifestations of years of work that began by modifying existing vehicles, along with, \\"in the next couple of years\\" according to Google in the above blog post, a pilot program similar to that which was used for the Cr-48 Chromebook back in 2010.\\r\\nIn October 2014 Tesla Motors announced its first version of AutoPilot. Model S cars equipped with this system are capable of lane control with autonomous steering, braking and speed limit adjustment based on signals image recognition. The system also provide autonomous parking and is able to receive software updates to improve skills over time.[83] As of March?2015[update], Tesla has been testing the autopilot system on the highway between San Francisco and Seattle with a driver but letting the car to drive the car almost unassisted.[84]\\r\\nIn February 2015, the UK Government announced it would oversee public trials of the LUTZ Pathfinder driverless pod in Milton Keynes.[85]\\r\\nIn March 2015 Tesla Motors announced that it will introduce its Autopilot technology by mid 2015 through a software update for the cars equipped with the systems that allow autonomous driving.[84] Some industry experts have raised questions about the legal status of autonomous driving in the U.S. and whether Model S owner would violate current state regulations when using the autopilot function. The few states that have passed laws allowing autonomous cars on the road limit their use for testing purposes, not the use by the general public. Also, there are questions about the liability for autonomous cars in case there is a mistake.[84] A Tesla spokesman said there is \\"nothing in our autopilot system that is in conflict with current regulations.\\" \\"We are not getting rid of the pilot. This is about releasing the driver from tedious tasks so they can focus and provide better input.\\" Google's director of self-driving cars at the company said he does not think there is a regulatory block as far as the self-driving vehicle met crash-test and other safety standards. A spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said that \\"any autonomous vehicle would need to meet applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards\\" and the NHTSA \\"will have the appropriate policies and regulations in place to ensure the safety of this type of vehicles.\\" [84]\\r\\nIn mid October 2015 Tesla Motors rolled out version 7 of their software in the U.S. that included Autopilot capability.[88] On January 9, 2016, Tesla rolled out version 7.1 as an over-the-air update, adding a new \\"summon\\" feature that allows cars to self-park at parking locations without the driver in the car.[89] Tesla's autonomous driving features are ahead of production cars, and can be classified as is somewhere between level 2 and level 3 under the NHTSA five levels of vehicle automation. At this levels the car can act autonomously but requires the full attention of the driver, who must be prepared to take control at a moment's notice.[90][91][92] Autopilot should be used only on limited-access highways, and sometimes it will fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself. In urban driving the system will not read traffic signals or obey stop signs. The system also does not detect pedestrians or cyclists.[86]\\r\\nIn February 2015 Volvo Cars announced its plans to lease 100 XC90 SUVs fitted with Drive Me Level 3 automation technology to residents of Gothenburg in 2017.[87][93] The Drive Me XC90s will be equipped with Nvidias Drive PX 2 supercomputer, and will be driven autonomously in certain weather conditions and on one road that loops around the city. As part of Volvo's Drive Me project, the 100 cars in the Sweden test will have an interface called IntelliSafe Auto Pilot, a feature that will let drivers activate and deactivate the autonomous mode through specially-designed paddles on the steering wheel. The interface was developed to oversee how drivers will transfer control to a cars autonomous driving mode in future cars. Volvo considers autonomous driving systems as the tool that will help it meet the company's goal to have no one seriously injured or killed in a new Volvo by the year 2020.[94]\\r\\nIn April 2015, a car designed by Delphi Automotive became the first automated vehicle to complete a coast-to-coast journey across North America. It traveled from San Francisco to New York, under computer control for 99% of that distance.[96]\\r\\nIn July 2015, Google announced that the test vehicles in its driverless car project had been involved in 14 minor accidents since the project's inception in 2009. Chris Urmson, the project leader, said that all of the accidents were caused by humans driving other cars, and that 11 of the mishaps were rear-end collisions. \\"Our self-driving cars are being hit surprisingly often by other drivers who are distracted and not paying attention to the road. Thats a big motivator for us.\\" Over the six years of the project's existence the test vehicles had logged nearly 2 million miles on the road.[95]\\r\\nIn April 2016 Volvo announced plans to deploy 100 XC90 self-driving cars to test them in everyday driving conditions in China in 2017.[94] Also in April 2016, the carmaker announced plans to begin a trial in London in 2017 with 100 Volvo XC90 plug-in hybrids fitted with Drive Me technology. The XC90s will be leased to everyday users, and the self-driving cars will log each and every journey, passing on that data to Thatcham Research, which will conduct a thorough analysis to examine how the car behaves in everyday situations as well as understanding how other road users and the cars occupants respond to autonomous driving decisions made by the car.[97]\\r\\nThe first known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself took place in Williston, Florida on 7 May 2016 while a Tesla Model S electric car was engaged in Autopilot mode. The driver was killed in a crash with a large 18-wheel tractor-trailer. On 28 June 2016 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the Florida Highway Patrol. According to the NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The car continued to travel after passing under the trucks trailer.[98][99][100] The NHTSA's preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash, which involves a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.[101]\\r\\nIn August 2016 Singapore launched the first self-driving taxi service, provided by nuTonomy.[102]\\r\\nStarting October 2016, all Tesla cars are built with the necessary hardware to allow full self-driving capability at a safety level (SAE Level 5). The hardware includes eight surround cameras and twelve ultrasonic sensors, in addition to the forward-facing radar with enhanced processing capabilities.[103] The system will operate in \\"shadow mode\\" (processing without taking action) and send data back to Tesla to improve its abilities until the software is ready for deployment via over-the-air upgrades.[104] Full autonomy is only likely after millions of miles of testing, and approval by authorities. Tesla Motors says it expects to enable full self-driving by the end of 2017.[105]\\r\\nOn June 4, 2017, Audi stated that its new A8 will be fully self-driving for speeds up to 60?km/h using its Audi AI. Contrary to other cars, the driver will not have to do safety checks such as touching the steering wheel every 15 seconds to use this feature. The Audi A8 will therefore be the first production car to reach level 3 autonomous driving, meaning that the driver can safely turn their attention away from driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie. Audi will also be the first manufacturer to use a 3D LIDAR system in addition to cameras and ultrasonic sensors for their AI.[106][107]","input":"When was the first self driving car release?"},{"output":"20 February 1868.","context":"Amrita Bazar Patrika (Bengali: ????????? ???????); is one of the oldest daily newspapers in South Asia and the oldest in Bangladesh. Originally published in Bengali script,[2] it evolved into an English format published from Kolkata and other locations such as Cuttack, Ranchi and Allahabad.[3] The paper discontinued its publication in 1991 after 123 years of publication,[1][2] although it was relaunched in Dhaka in 2006 where it is now published in Bengali once again.\\r\\nIt debuted on 20 February 1868. It was started by Sisir Ghosh and Moti Lal Ghosh, sons of Hari Naryan Ghosh, a rich merchant from Magura, in Jessore District during the Bengal Presidency of the British Raj (present day in Bangladesh). The family had constructed a Bazaar and named it after Amritamoyee, wife of Hari Naryan Ghosh. Sisir Ghosh and Moti Lal Ghosh started Amrita Bazar Patrika as a weekly first. It was first edited by Motilal Ghosh, who did not have a formal university education. It had built its readership as a rival to Bengalee which was being looked after by Surendranath Banerjee.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmrita Bazaar Patrika was the oldest Indian-owned English daily. It played a major role in the evolution and growth of Indian journalism and made a striking contribution to creating and nurturing the Indian freedom struggle. In 1920, Russian Communist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin described ABP as the best nationalist paper in India.[citation needed]\\r\\nABP was born as a Bengali weekly in February 1868 in the village of Amrita Bazaar in Jessore district (now located in modern-day Bangladesh). It was started by the Ghosh brothers to fight the cause of peasants who were being exploited by indigo planters. Sisir Kumar Ghosh was the first editor. The Patrika operated out of a battered wooden press purchased for Rs 32.\\r\\nIn 1871, the Patrika moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata), due to the outbreak of plague in Amrita Bazaar. Here it functioned as a bilingual weekly, publishing news and views in English and Bengali. Its anti-government views and vast influence among the people was a thorn in the flesh of the government. Lord Lytton, the Viceroy of India promulgated the Vernacular Press Act on 1878 mainly against ABP.\\r\\nThe Patrika became a daily in 1891. It was the first Indian-owned English daily to go into investigative journalism. During the tenure of Lord Lansdowne, a Patrika journalist rummaged through the waste paper basket of the Viceroy's office and pieced together a torn up letter detailing the Viceroy's plans to annexe Kashmir. ABP published the letter on its front page, where it was read by the Maharaja of Kashmir, who immediately went to London and lobbied for his independence.\\r\\nSisir Kumar Ghosh also launched vigorous campaigns against restrictions on civil liberties and economic exploitation. He wanted Indians to be given important posts in the administration. Both he and his brother Motilal were deeply attached to Bal Gangadhar Tilak. When Tilak was prosecuted for sedition in 1897, they raised funds in Calcutta for his defence. They also published a scathing editorial against the judge who sentenced Tilak to 6 years of imprisonment, for 'presuming to teach true patriotism to a proved and unparalleled patriot.'\\r\\nThe Patrika had many brushes with Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India at the time of the Partition of Bengal (1905). It referred to him as 'Young and a little foppish, and without previous training but invested with unlimited powers.' Because of such editorials, the Press Act of 1910 was passed and a security of Rs 5,000 was demanded from ABP. Motilal Ghosh was also charged with sedition but his eloquence won the case.\\r\\nAfter this, the Patrika started prefacing articles criticising the British government with ridiculously exuberant professions of loyalty to the British crown. When Subhas Chandra Bose and other students were expelled from Calcutta Presidency College, the Patrika took up their case and succeeded in having them re-admitted.[citation needed]\\r\\nEven after Motilal Ghosh's death in 1922, the Patrika kept up its nationalist spirit. Higher securities of Rs 10,000 were demanded from it during the Salt Satyagraha. Its editor Tushar Kanti Ghosh (son of Sisir Kumar Ghosh) was imprisoned. The Patrika contributed its share to the success of its freedom movement under the leadership of Gandhi and suffered for its views and actions at the hands of the British rulers.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Patrika espoused the cause of communal harmony during the Partition of India. During the great Calcutta killings of 1946, the Patrika left its editorial columns blank for three days. When freedom dawned on August 15, 1947, the Patrika published in an editorial:\\r\\nIt is dawn, cloudy though it is. Presently sunshine will break.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs a part of the 'Endangered Archive project' attempting to rescue text published prior to 1950, the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta took up the project of digitizing the old newspapers (ABP and Jugantar) for safe storage and retrieval in 2010.[5] The newspaper archives are also available from the Nehru Memorial Museum & Library, Delhi, and in 2011 over one lakh images from the newspaper were digitized by the library and available online.[6] and also at The Centre of South Asian Studies at the University of Cambridge.","input":"When was the amrit bazar patrika started in bangalore?"},{"output":"drowned","context":"August: Osage County[a] is a Comedy-drama play by Tracy Letts.

Violet is addicted to several different kinds of prescription drugs and exhibits paranoia and mood swings. Beverly, who freely admits that he is an alcoholic, lightly converses about Violet's current problems, most of which Beverly concedes are the result of personal demons too powerful to be cured by drugs. Violet enters the scene clearly affected by her drugs. After an incoherent and combative argument with Beverly, Violet returns upstairs. Beverly hires Johnna, lends her a book of TS Eliot's poetry, and continues to drink.\\r\\nAct One\\r\\nSeveral weeks later. Beverly Weston has not been seen for five days. Several family members have gathered in the house to provide support for Violet including her daughter Ivy, her sister Mattie Fae and Mattie Fae's husband Charlie. When Violet is not making calls attempting to track down her husband or popping pills, she spends the time sniping at her family, particularly Ivy, whom she criticizes for her mode of dress and lack of a romantic life. The news comes that Beverly's boat is missing, furthering the fear that he has committed suicide. Ivy's older sister Barbara arrives from Boulder, Colorado with her husband Bill and 14-year-old daughter Jean. Barbara has not visited her mother in several years, and has mixed feelings about returning to the house because of the confrontational nature of their relationship. They fall into an argument almost immediately, during which Violet accuses her of abandoning her family and breaking her father's heart.\\r\\nLater in the evening, Jean bonds with Johnna after the older woman allows her to smoke some marijuana in her room. She confides to Johnna that her parents are separated and are attempting to hide the fact from the family. Bill and Barbara argue over the cause of their separation as they make a bed out of the fold-out sofa in the living room: Bill is sleeping with a much-younger woman, one of his students at the university where he teaches. At five AM, the local sheriff, Deon Gilbeau (Barbara's high school boyfriend) rings the doorbell and breaks the news that Beverly has been found drowned. Barbara goes to identify the body as Violet comes downstairs in a drug-addled fog. The act ends with her spiraling into confusion.\\r\\nAct Two\\r\\nSeveral days later. The family has come from Beverly's funeral. Violet spends a quiet moment alone in Beverly's office, bitterly reproaching him for leaving her, and takes some more pills. Before the memorial dinner prepared for the family by Johnna, several family arguments and scenes arise. Ivy and Barbara's sister Karen has flown in from Florida with her new fianc and can talk about nothing except her wedding plans, distressing Barbara. During an argument with her mother and Mattie Fae, Ivy unwittingly confesses that she is seeing someone romantically but refuses to say who. Mattie Fae and Charlie's son Little Charles has overslept and missed the funeral. His father is sympathetic but Mattie Fae is, as usual, rude to and critical of her son. Karen's fianc Steve discovers that Jean is a pot-smoker and offers to share his stash with her, lewdly flirting with the teenaged girl. In a private moment, it is revealed that Ivy's lover is actually Little Charles, her first cousin.\\r\\nDinner is served, and Violet begins insulting and needling all of her family members. After inappropriately discussing Beverly's will at the table, she cruelly exposes Barbara and Bill's separation. When Barbara starts to fight back, Violet tauntingly reveals the full extent of her addiction, and the tensions develop into a violent confrontation, culminating in Barbara physically attacking her mother. After family members separate them, Barbara takes control of the situation, ordering that the family raid the house to discover all of Violet's hiding places for her pills.\\r\\nAct Three\\r\\nSeveral hours later things have calmed down, but the pain of the dinner confrontation has not gone away. Barbara reports that Violet's doctor thinks she has brain damage, and the three sisters share a drink in their father's study, discussing their mother. Ivy reveals that she and Little Charles are planning to run away to New York, and refuses to acknowledge the need for someone to take care of Violet. She reveals that it was Violet, not Beverly, who was heartbroken when Barbara left Oklahoma. Violet enters, now more coherent and off her drugs but no less incorrigible, is resigned to dealing with her demise on her own terms. She discusses a depressing story from her childhood with her daughters. In a private moment, Barbara and Violet apologize to each other, but it is uncertain how long the peace will last.\\r\\nMattie Fae observes a tender moment between Little Charles and Ivy, and begins taunting him again when the ever-patient Charlie finally loses his temper with his wife, berating her for her cruelty to her own son and promising her that unless she can find a way to be kind to Little Charles, he is going to leave her. The lecture is accidentally overheard by Barbara, who confirms when pressed that Little Charles and Ivy are lovers. She is shocked when Mattie Fae reveals that Little Charles is not just Ivy's first cousin but also her half-brother, the result of a long-ago affair between Mattie Fae and Beverly. Mattie Fae refuses to tell Ivy or Little Charles the truth, leaving it up to Barbara, who knows that the news will destroy Ivy, to find a way to end the incestuous affair.\\r\\nLate that night, Steve and Jean share a joint, and before long, Steve attempts to molest Jean. Johnna walks in on the scene and attacks Steve with a cast iron skillet; the noise brings Jean's parents and Karen to the scene. An ugly argument follows when Jean defensively lashes out at her parents with hurtful comments about her father's affair, and Barbara slaps her. Karen leaves with Steve, choosing to lie to herself and mistakenly blaming Jean for what happened. Bill elects to return to Boulder with Jean and admits, when Barbara confronts him, that he is not going to come back to her. He leaves as Barbara tells him she loves him.\\r\\nTwo weeks pass. Barbara, now drinking heavily, offers Johnna a chance to quit and leave the toxic environment of the Weston house, but she chooses to stay. Sheriff Gilbeau drops by the house with the news that Beverly had stayed at a motel shortly before he committed suicide. He and Barbara nearly share a tender moment, but she is too emotionally exhausted and drunk to consummate it.\\r\\nSeveral days later, Ivy has dinner with Barbara and Violet. Ivy attempts to tell her mother, over Barbara's objections, of her plans with Little Charles but Violet suddenly confesses that she already knows that Little Charles is Beverly's son. Ivy recoils in shock and horror, rebuffing Barbara's attempts to comfort her, and says that she will never tell him and leaves for New York anyway. Violet calmly reveals that she has deliberately destroyed Ivy and Charles' affair, which she knew of the entire time. Barbara and her mother have one last angry confrontation during which Violet blames Barbara for her father's suicide. Violet also reveals his suicide might have been preventable since she knew which motel he stayed in the night he left the house. Barbara, realizing that her Mother has slipped beyond her help, leaves the house. Violet breaks down and is left only with Johnna, who ends the play with a quotation from a T.S. Eliot poem: \\"This is the way the world ends, this is the way the world ends.\\"\\r\\nThe show was originally produced on August 12, 2007 by the Steppenwolf Theatre Company at the Downstairs Theatre in Chicago.[4] The Broadway production began previews on October 30, 2007, at the Imperial Theatre only days before the 2007 Broadway stagehand strike on November 10 which temporarily closed most shows on Broadway.

It is an adaptation of the 1964 novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. Dahl was credited with writing the film's screenplay; however, David Seltzer, who went uncredited in the film, was brought in to re-work Dahl's screenplay against his wishes, making major changes to the ending and adding musical numbers. These changes and other decisions made by the director led Dahl to disown the film.[4][5]\\r\\nThe film tells the story of Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) as he receives a Golden Ticket and visits Willy Wonka's chocolate factory with four other children from around the world. Filming took place in Munich in 1970, and the film was released by Paramount Pictures on June 30, 1971. With a budget of just $3 million, the film received generally positive reviews and earned $4 million by the end of its original run. Paramount distributed the film until 1977, and beginning in the 1980s, Warner Bros. assumed control of the rights for home entertainment purposes. The film then made an additional $21 million during its re-release by Warner Bros. under its Family Entertainment banner in 1996. The film became highly popular in part through repeated television airings and home entertainment sales.[6] In 1972, the film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score, and Wilder was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, but lost both to Fiddler on the Roof. The film also introduced the song \\"The Candy Man\\", which went on to become a popular hit when recorded by Sammy Davis Jr. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an unnamed town, children visit a candy shop. Charlie Bucket, a poor paperboy, stares through the window as the shop owner sings \\"The Candy Man\\". Walking home, he passes Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. A mysterious tinker recites the first lines of William Allingham's poem \\"The Fairies\\", and tells Charlie, \\"Nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes out.\\" Charlie rushes home to his widowed mother and bedridden grandparents. After telling Grandpa Joe about the tinker, Joe reveals that Wonka locked the factory because other candy makers, including rival Arthur Slugworth, sent in spies to steal his recipes. Wonka disappeared, but for three years resumed selling candy; the origin of Wonka's labor force is unknown.\\r\\nThe next day, Wonka announces that he hid five \\"Golden Tickets\\" in chocolate Wonka Bars. Finders of the tickets will receive a factory tour and a lifetime supply of chocolate. Four of the tickets are found by Augustus Gloop, a gluttonous boy; Veruca Salt, a spoiled girl; Violet Beauregarde, a gum-chewing girl; and Mike Teavee, a television-obsessed boy. As each winner's announced on TV, a man whispers to them. Charlie opens two Wonka Bars but finds no Golden Ticket and loses hope. The newspapers announce the fifth ticket was found by a millionaire in Paraguay. Charlie finds money in a sewer and uses it to buy a Scrumdiddlyumptious bar. With the change, he buys another Wonka Bar for Joe. Walking home, as Charlie hears people reading the newspapers; revealing that the Paraguayan millionaire's ticket is a forgery, he opens the Wonka Bar and finds the fifth golden ticket. While rushing home, he is confronted by the same man seen whispering to the other winners, who introduces himself as Slugworth and offers a reward for a sample of Wonka's latest creation, the Everlasting Gobstopper.\\r\\nCharlie returns home with the Golden Ticket and chooses Grandpa Joe as his chaperone and they sing \\"I've Got A Golden Ticket\\". The next day, Wonka greets the ticket winners and leads them inside where each signs a contract before the tour. The factory includes a river of chocolate, edible mushrooms, lickable wallpaper, and other sweets and inventions. As the visitors sample these, Wonka sings \\"Pure Imagination\\". The visitors see Wonka's workers, small men known as Oompa-Loompas, who sing their song whenever a ticket holder falls into a trap. Augustus falls into the chocolate river and is sucked up a pipe to the Fudge Room. In the Inventing Room, everyone receives an Everlasting Gobstopper. Violet becomes a large blueberry after chewing an experimental gum containing a three-course meal, despite Wonka's warnings. The group reaches the Fizzy Lifting Drinks Room, where Charlie and Grandpa Joe ignore Wonka's warning and sample the drinks. They float and have a near-fatal encounter with an exhaust fan before burping back to the ground. In the Chocolate Eggs Room, Veruca demands a golden goose for herself before falling into a garbage chute leading to the furnace, with her father falling in trying to rescue her. The group tests out Wonka's Wonkavision, only to have Mike teleport himself and become only a few inches tall.\\r\\nOnly Charlie and Grandpa Joe remain, but Wonka dismisses them without the promised chocolate. When Grandpa Joe asks him why, Wonka angrily explains that they violated the contract by stealing Fizzy Lifting Drinks and will receive nothing. An angered Grandpa Joe suggests to Charlie that he should give Slugworth the Gobstopper in revenge, but Charlie returns the candy back to Wonka. With this selfless act, Wonka declares Charlie as the winner. He reveals that Slugworth is actually \\"Mr. Wilkinson\\", an employee of his, and the offer to buy the Gobstopper was a morality test which only Charlie passed. The trio enter the \\"Wonkavator\\", a multi-directional glass elevator that flies out of the factory. Soaring over the city, Wonka reveals that his actual prize is the factory; Wonka created the contest to find a worthy heir enough, and so Charlie and his family can immediately move in. Wonka then reminds Charlie not to forget about the man who suddenly received everything he ever wanted. Charlie asks, \\"What happened?\\" to which Wonka replies, \\"He lived happily ever after.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea for adapting the book into a film came about when director Mel Stuart's ten-year-old daughter read the book and asked her father to make a film out of it, with \\"Uncle Dave\\" (producer David L. Wolper) producing it. Stuart showed the book to Wolper, who happened to be in the midst of talks with the Quaker Oats Company regarding a vehicle to introduce a new candy bar from its Chicago-based Breaker Confections subsidiary (since renamed the Willy Wonka Candy Company and sold to Nestl). Wolper persuaded the company, which had no previous experience in the film industry, to buy the rights to the book and finance the picture for the purpose of promoting a new Quaker Oats Wonka Bar.[7]\\r\\nIt was agreed that the film would be a children's musical, and that Dahl himself would write the screenplay.[7] However, the title was changed to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\\r\\nScreenwriter David Seltzer conceived a gimmick exclusively for the film that had Wonka quoting numerous literary sources, such as Arthur O'Shaughnessy's Ode, Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice. Seltzer also worked Slugworth (only mentioned as a rival candy maker in the book) into the plot as an actual character (only to be revealed to be Wilkinson, one of Wonka's agents, at the end of the film).[7]\\r\\nAll six members of Monty Python: Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Michael Palin, expressed interest in playing Wonka, but at the time they were deemed not big enough names for an international audience. Three of the members, Cleese, Idle and Palin, were later seriously considered for the same role in Tim Burton's version.[8][9]\\r\\nBefore Wilder was officially cast for the role, producers considered Fred Astaire, Joel Grey, Ron Moody and Jon Pertwee.[9][10] Spike Milligan was Roald Dahl's original choice to play Willy Wonka.[9] Peter Sellers even begged Dahl for the role.[11]\\r\\nWhen Wilder was cast for the role, he accepted it on one condition:\\r\\nWhen I make my first entrance, I'd like to come out of the door carrying a cane and then walk toward the crowd with a limp. After the crowd sees Willy Wonka is a cripple, they all whisper to themselves and then become deathly quiet. As I walk toward them, my cane sinks into one of the cobblestones I'm walking on and stands straight up, by itself; but I keep on walking, until I realize that I no longer have my cane. I start to fall forward, and just before I hit the ground, I do a beautiful forward somersault and bounce back up, to great applause.\\r\\nThe reason why Wilder wanted this in the film was that \\"from that time on, no one will know if I'm lying or telling the truth.\\"[12]\\r\\nJean Stapleton turned down the role of Mrs. Teevee.[13][14] Jim Backus was considered for the role of Sam Beauregarde.[15] Sammy Davis, Jr. wanted to play Bill, the candy store owner, but Stuart did not like the idea because he felt that the presence of a big star in the candy store scene would break the reality.[8] Nevertheless, Davis' recording of the film's opening musical number, \\"The Candy Man,\\" would top the Billboard magazine record charts in 1972, despite the fact that Davis initially hated the song. Anthony Newley also wanted to play Bill, but Stuart also objected to this for the same reason.[15]\\r\\nPrincipal photography commenced on April 30, 1970, and ended on November 19, 1970. The primary shooting location was Munich, Bavaria, West Germany, because it was significantly cheaper than filming in the United States and the setting was conducive to Wonka's factory; Stuart also liked the ambiguity and unfamiliarity of the location. External shots of the factory were filmed at the gasworks of Stadtwerke Mnchen (Emmy-Noether-Stra?e 10); the entrance and side buildings still exist. The exterior of Charlie Bucket's house, which was only a set constructed for the film, was filmed at Quellenstra?e in Munich, Bavaria. Charlie's school was filmed at Katholisches Pfarramt St. Sylvester, Biedersteiner Stra?e 1 in Munich. Bill's Candy Shop was filmed at Lilienstra?e, Munich. The closing sequence when the Wonkavator is flying above the factory is footage of N?rdlingen in Bavaria.\\r\\nMunich Gasworks as it appears today (building on the left)\\r\\nMunich Gasworks as it appears today\\r\\nN?rdlingen, the town seen from above at the end of the film\\r\\nProduction designer Harper Goff centered the factory on the massive Chocolate Room. According to Paris Themmen, who played Mike Teevee, \\"The river was made of water with food coloring. At one point, they poured some cocoa powder into it to try to thicken it but it didn't really work. When asked this question, Michael B?llner, who played Augustus Gloop, answers, 'It vas dirty, stinking vater.'\\"[16]\\r\\nWhen interviewed for the 30th anniversary special edition, Gene Wilder stated that he enjoyed working with most of the child actors, but said that he and the crew had some problems with Paris Themmen, claiming that he was \\"a handful\\".[17]\\r\\nBefore its release, the film received advance publicity though TV commercials offering a \\"Willy Wonka candy factory kit\\" for sending $1.00 and two seals from boxes of Quaker cereals such as King Vitaman, Life and any of the Cap'n Crunch brands.[18]\\r\\nWilly Wonka was released on June 30, 1971. The film was not a big success, being the fifty-third highest-grossing film of the year in the U.S., earning just over $2.1 million on its opening weekend.[19] It received positive reviews from critics such as Roger Ebert, who compared it to The Wizard of Oz. Ebert said, \\"All of this is preface to a simple statement: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is probably the best film of its sort since The Wizard of Oz. It is everything that family movies usually claim to be, but aren't: Delightful, funny, scary, exciting, and, most of all, a genuine work of imagination. Willy Wonka is such a surely and wonderfully spun fantasy that it works on all kinds of minds, and it is fascinating because, like all classic fantasy, it is fascinated with itself.\\"[20]\\r\\nBy the mid-1980s, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory had experienced a spike in popularity thanks in large part to repeated television broadcasts and home video sales. Following a 25th anniversary theatrical re-release in 1996, it was released on DVD the next year, allowing it to reach a new generation of viewers. The film was released as a remastered special edition on DVD and VHS in 2001 to commemorate the film's 30th anniversary. In 2003, Entertainment Weekly ranked it 25th in the \\"Top 50 Cult Movies\\" of all time.\\r\\nAs of 2017[update], the film holds a 90% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 7.7/10 based on 42 reviews. The site's critical consensus states: \\"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is strange yet comforting, full of narrative detours that don't always work but express the film's uniqueness\\".[21]\\r\\nWilly Wonka was ranked No. 74 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments[22] for the \\"scary tunnel\\" scene.\\r\\nDahl disowned the film, the script of which was partially rewritten by David Seltzer after Dahl failed to meet deadlines. Dahl said he was \\"disappointed\\" because \\"he thought it placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie\\", as well as the casting of Gene Wilder instead of Spike Milligan.[23] Dahl was also \\"infuriated\\" by the deviations in the plot Seltzer devised in his draft of the screenplay, including the conversion of Slugworth, a minor character in the book, into a spy (so that the movie could have a villain) and the \\"fizzy lifting drinks\\" scene along with music other than the original Oompa Loompa compositions (including \\"Pure Imagination\\" and \\"The Candy Man\\"), and the ending dialogue for the movie.[24] In 1996, Dahl's second wife Felicity commented on her husband's objections towards the film saying \\"they always want to change a book's storyline. What makes Hollywood think children want the endings changed for a film, when they accept it in a book?\\"[23]\\r\\nThe film made its television debut on November 23, 1975 on NBC. There was some controversy with the showing as the Oakland Raiders vs Washington Redskins (26-23) football game went into overtime, and the first 40 minutes of the movie were cut.[25] The film placed 19th in the TV Ratings for the week ending Nov 23, beating out The Streets of San Francisco and Little House on the Prairie.[26] The next TV showing of the film was on May 2, 1976,[27] where it placed 46th in the ratings.[28] Some TV listings indicate the showing was part of the World of Disney time slot.\\r\\nIn 2017, an adaptation of the film with Tom and Jerry was released. Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory stars JP Karliak as Willy Wonka and is dedicated to Gene Wilder, who died under a year before the release.\\r\\nThe film was first released on DVD in 1997/1999 in a \\"25th anniversary edition\\"[29] as a double sided disc containing a widescreen and \\"standard\\" version. The \\"standard\\" version is an open matte print, where the mattes used to make the image widescreen are removed, revealing information originally intended to be hidden from viewers.[30] VHS copies were also available, but only containing the \\"standard\\" version.\\r\\nA special edition DVD was released, celebrating the film's 30th anniversary, on August 28, 2001, but in fullscreen only. Due to the lack of a letterboxed release, fan petitioning eventually led Warner Home Video to issue a widescreen version on November 13, 2001. It was also released on VHS, with only one of the special features (a making-of feature). Several original cast members reunited to film documentary footage for this special edition DVD release. The two editions featured restored sound, and better picture quality. In addition to the documentary, the DVD included a trailer, a gallery, and audio commentary by the cast.\\r\\nIn 2007, Warner Home Video released the film on HD DVD with all the bonus features from the 2001 DVD.[31] The film was released on Blu-ray on October 20, 2009.[32] It includes all the bonus features from the 2001 DVD and 2007 HD-DVD as well as a 38-page book.\\r\\nIn 2011, a new deluxe-40th-anniversary edition Blu-ray/DVD set was released on November 1, consisting of the film on Blu-ray Disc and DVD as well as a bonus features disc. The set also included a variety of rarities such as a Wonka Bar-designed tin, four scented pencils, a scented eraser, a book detailing the making of the film, original production papers and a Golden Ticket to win a trip to Los Angeles. The set is now out of print.[33]\\r\\nThe Academy Award-nominated original score and songs were composed by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, and musical direction was by Walter Scharf. The soundtrack was first released by Paramount Records in 1971. On October 8, 1996, Hip-O Records (in conjunction with MCA Records, which by then owned the Paramount catalog), released the soundtrack on CD as a \\"25th Anniversary Edition\\".\\r\\nThe music and songs, in order of appearance, are:\\r\\nThe track listing for the soundtrack's as follows:","input":"When was willy wonka and the chocolate factory released?"},{"output":"roughly 30 million years ago","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean[1] or the Austral Ocean,[2][note 4] comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60?S latitude and encircling Antarctica.[6] As such, it is regarded as the fourth-largest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean.[7] This ocean zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy way of his voyages in the 1770s, Captain James Cook proved that waters encompassed the southern latitudes of the globe. Since then, geographers have disagreed on the Southern Ocean's northern boundary or even existence, considering the waters as various parts of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, instead. However, according to Commodore John Leech of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO)[weasel?words], recent oceanographic research has discovered the importance of Southern Circulation, and the term Southern Ocean has been used to define the body of water which lies south of the northern limit of that circulation.[8] This remains the current official policy of the IHO, since a 2000 revision of its definitions including the Southern Ocean as the waters south of the 60th parallel has not yet been adopted. Others regard the seasonally-fluctuating Antarctic Convergence as the natural boundary.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nBorders and names for oceans and seas were internationally agreed when the International Hydrographic Bureau (IHB), the precursor to the IHO, convened the First International Conference on 24 July 1919. The IHO then published these in its Limits of Oceans and Seas, the first edition being 1928. Since the first edition, the limits of the Southern Ocean have moved progressively southwards; since 1953, it has been omitted from the official publication and left to local hydrographic offices to determine their own limits. The IHO included the ocean and its definition as the waters south of 60S in its year 2000 revisions, but this has not been formally adopted, due to continuing impasses over other areas of the text, such as the naming dispute over the Sea of Japan. The 2000 IHO definition, however, was circulated in a draft edition in 2002 and is used by some within the IHO and by some other organizations such as the US Central Intelligence Agency[7] and Merriam-Webster.[note 5][10] Australian authorities regard the Southern Ocean as lying immediately south of Australia.[11][12] The National Geographic Society does not recognize the ocean,[2] depicting it (if at all) in a typeface different from the other world oceans; instead, it shows the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans extending to Antarctica on both its print and online maps.[13][note 6] Map publishers using the term Southern Ocean on their maps include Hema Maps[15] and GeoNova.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Southern Ocean\\" is an obsolete name for the Pacific Ocean or South Pacific, coined by Vasco N~?ez de Balboa, the first European to discover it, who approached it from the north.[17] The \\"South Seas\\" is a less archaic synonym. A 1745 British Act of Parliament  established a prize for discovering a Northwest Passage to \\"the Western and Southern Ocean of America\\".[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthors using \\"Southern Ocean\\" to name the waters encircling the unknown southern polar regions used varying limits. James Cook's account of his second voyage implies New Caledonia borders it.[19] Peacock's 1795 Geographical Dictionary said it lay \\"to the southward of America and Africa\\";[20] John Payne in 1796 used 40 degrees as the northern limit;[21] the 1827 Edinburgh Gazetteer used 50 degrees.[22] The Family Magazine in 1835 divided the \\"Great Southern Ocean\\" into the \\"Southern Ocean\\" and the \\"Antarctick [sic] Ocean\\" along the Antarctic Circle, with the northern limit of the Southern Ocean being lines joining Cape Horn, the Cape of Good Hope, Van Diemen's Land and the south of New Zealand.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Kingdom's South Australia Act 1834 described the waters forming the southern limit of the new colony of South Australia as \\"the Southern Ocean\\". The Colony of Victoria's Legislative Council Act of 1881 delimited part of the division of Bairnsdale as \\"along the New South Wales boundary to the Southern ocean\\".[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1928 first edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas, the Southern Ocean was delineated by land-based limits:  Antarctica to the south, and South America, Africa, Australia, and Broughton Island, New Zealand to the north.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe detailed land-limits used were from Cape Horn in South America eastwards to Cape Agulhas in Africa, then further eastwards to the southern coast of mainland Australia to Cape Leeuwin, Western Australia. From Cape Leeuwin, the limit then followed eastwards along the coast of mainland Australia to Cape Otway, Victoria, then southwards across Bass Strait to Cape Wickham, King Island, along the west coast of King Island, then the remainder of the way south across Bass Strait to Cape Grim, Tasmania. The limit then followed the west coast of Tasmania southwards to the\\r\\nSouth East Cape and then went eastwards to Broughton Island, New Zealand, before returning to Cape Horn.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe northern limits of the Southern Ocean were moved southwards in the IHO's 1937 second edition of the Limits of Oceans and Seas. From this edition, much of the ocean's northern limit ceased to abut land masses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second edition, the Southern Ocean then extended from Antarctica northwards to latitude 40S between Cape Agulhas in Africa (long. 20E) and Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia (long. 115E), and extended to latitude 55S between Auckland Island of New Zealand (165 or 166E east) and Cape Horn in South America (67W).[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is discussed in more detail below (see section on '2002 delineation'), prior to the 2002 (draft) edition the limits of oceans explicitly excluded the seas lying within each of them. The Great Australian Bight was unnamed in the 1928 edition, and delineated as shown in the figure above in the 1937 edition. It therefore encompassed former Southern Ocean waters (as designated in 1928) but was technically not inside any of the three adjacent oceans by 1937. In the 2002 draft edition, the IHO have designated 'seas' as being subdivisions within 'oceans', so the Bight would have still been within the Southern Ocean in 1937 if the 2002 convention were in place then. To perform direct comparisons of current and former limits of oceans (for example to compare surface areas) it is necessary to consider, or at least be aware of, how the 2002 change in IHO terminology for 'seas' can affect the comparison.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Southern Ocean did not appear in the 1953 third edition and a note in the publication read:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Antarctic or Southern Ocean has been omitted from this publication as the majority of opinions received since the issue of the 2nd Edition in 1937 are to the effect that there exists no real justification for applying the term Ocean to this body of water, the northern limits of which are difficult to lay down owing to their seasonal change. The limits of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans have therefore been extended South to the Antarctic Continent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHydrographic Offices who issue separate publications dealing with this area are therefore left to decide their own northern limits (Great Britain uses Latitude of 55 South.)\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, in the IHO 1953 publication, the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans were extended southward, the Indian and Pacific Oceans (which had not previously touched pre 1953, as per the first and second editions) now abutted at the meridian of South East Cape, and the southern limits of the Great Australian Bight and the Tasman Sea were moved northwards.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IHO readdressed the question of the Southern Ocean in a survey in 2000. Of its 68 member nations, 28 responded, and all responding members except Argentina agreed to redefine the ocean, reflecting the importance placed by oceanographers on ocean currents. The proposal for the name Southern Ocean won 18 votes, beating the alternative Antarctic Ocean. Half of the votes supported a definition of the ocean's northern limit at 60S (with no land interruptions at this latitude), with the other 14 votes cast for other definitions, mostly 50S, but a few for as far north as 35S.\\r\\n\\r\\nA draft fourth edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas was circulated to IHO member states in August 2002 (sometimes referred to as the \\"2000 edition\\" as it summarized the progress to 2000).[29] It has yet to be published due to 'areas of concern' by several countries relating to various naming issues around the world √ø primarily the Sea of Japan naming dispute √ø and there have been various changes, 60 seas were given new names, and even the name of the publication was changed.[30] A reservation had also been lodged by Australia regarding the Southern Ocean limits.[31] Effectively, the 3rd edition (which did not delineate the Southern Ocean leaving delineation to local hydrographic offices) has yet to be superseded.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite this, the 4th edition definition has partial de facto usage by many nations, scientists and organisations such as the U.S. (the Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook uses \\"Southern Ocean\\" but none of the other new sea names within the \\"Southern Ocean\\" such as \\"Cosmonauts Sea\\") and Merriam-Webster,[7][10][14] scientists and nations √ø and even by some within the IHO.[32] Some nations' hydrographic offices have defined their own boundaries; the United Kingdom used the 55S parallel for example.[27] Other organisations favour more northerly limits for the Southern Ocean. For example, the Encyclop?dia Britannica describes the Southern Ocean as extending as far north as South America, and confers great significance on the Antarctic Convergence, yet its description of the Indian Ocean contradicts this, describing the Indian Ocean as extending south to Antarctica.[12][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther sources, such as the National Geographic Society, show the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans as extending to Antarctica on its maps, although articles on the National Geographic web site have begun to reference the Southern Ocean.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia, cartographical authorities define the Southern Ocean as including the entire body of water between Antarctica and the south coasts of Australia and New Zealand, and up to 60s elsewhere.[34] Coastal maps of Tasmania and South Australia label the sea areas as Southern Ocean,[35] while Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia is described as the point where the Indian and Southern Oceans meet.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nA radical shift from past IHO practices (1928√ø1953) was also seen in the 2002 draft edition when the IHO delineated 'seas' as being subdivisions that lay within the boundaries of 'oceans'. While the IHO are often considered the authority for such conventions, the shift brought them into line with the practices of other publications (e.g. the CIA World Fact Book) which already adopted the principle that seas are contained within oceans. This difference in practice is markedly seen for the Pacific Ocean in the adjacent figure. Thus, for example, previously the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand was not regarded by the IHO as being part of the Pacific, but as of the 2002 draft edition it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new delineation of seas being subdivisions of oceans has avoided the need to interrupt the northern boundary of the Southern Ocean where intersected by Drake Passage which includes all of the waters from South America to the Antarctic coast, nor interrupt it for the Scotia Sea, which also extends below the 60th parallel south. The new delineation of seas has also meant that the long-time named seas around Antarctica, excluded from the 1953 edition (the 1953 map did not even extend that far south), are 'automatically' part of the Southern Ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\nExploration of the Southern Ocean was inspired by a belief in the existence of a Terra Australis √ø a vast continent in the far south of the globe to \\"balance\\" the northern lands of Eurasia and North Africa √ø which had existed since the times of Ptolemy. The doubling of the Cape of Good Hope in 1487 by Bartolomeu Dias first brought explorers within touch of the Antarctic cold, and proved that there was an ocean separating Africa from any Antarctic land that might exist. Ferdinand Magellan, who passed through the Strait of Magellan in 1520, assumed that the islands of Tierra del Fuego to the south were an extension of this unknown southern land. In 1564, Abraham Ortelius published his first map, Typus Orbis Terrarum, an eight-leaved wall map of the world, on which he identified the Regio Patalis with Locach as a northward extension of the Terra Australis, reaching as far as New Guinea.[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean geographers continued to connect the coast of Tierra del Fuego with the coast of New Guinea on their globes, and allowing their imaginations to run riot in the vast unknown spaces of the south Atlantic, south Indian and Pacific oceans they sketched the outlines of the Terra Australis Incognita (\\"Unknown Southern Land\\"), a vast continent stretching in parts into the tropics. The search for this great south land was a leading motive of explorers in the 16th and the early part of the 17th centuries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spaniard Gabriel de Castilla, who claimed having sighted \\"snow-covered mountains\\" beyond the 64 S in 1603, is recognized as the first explorer that discovered the continent of Antarctica, although he was ignored in his time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1606, Pedro Fernndez de Quir‹ás took possession for the king of Spain all of the lands he had discovered in Australia del Espiritu Santo (the New Hebrides) and those he would discover \\"even to the Pole\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancis Drake, like Spanish explorers before him, had speculated that there might be an open channel south of Tierra del Fuego. When Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire discovered the southern extremity of Tierra del Fuego and named it Cape Horn in 1615, they proved that the Tierra del Fuego archipelago was of small extent and not connected to the southern land, as previously thought. Subsequently, in 1642, Abel Tasman showed that even New Holland (Australia) was separated by sea from any continuous southern continent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visit to South Georgia by Anthony de la Roch in 1675 was the first ever discovery of land south of the Antarctic Convergence i.e. in the Southern Ocean/Antarctic.[39][40]  Soon after the voyage cartographers started to depict Roch Island, honouring the discoverer.  James Cook was aware of la Roch's discovery when surveying and mapping the island in 1775.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmond Halley's voyage in HMS Paramour for magnetic investigations in the South Atlantic met the pack ice in 52?S in January 1700, but that latitude (he reached 140?mi off the north coast of South Georgia) was his farthest south. A determined effort on the part of the French naval officer Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier to discover the \\"South Land\\" √ø described by a half legendary \\"sieur de Gonneyville\\" √ø resulted in the discovery of Bouvet Island in 5410?S, and in the navigation of 48 of longitude of ice-cumbered sea nearly in 55?S in 1730  .\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1771, Yves Joseph Kerguelen sailed from France with instructions to proceed south from Mauritius in search of \\"a very large continent.\\"  He lighted upon a land in 50?S which he called South France, and believed to be the central mass of the southern continent. He was sent out again to complete the exploration of the new land, and found it to be only an inhospitable island which he renamed the Isle of Desolation, but which was ultimately named after him.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe obsession of the undiscovered continent culminated in the brain of Alexander Dalrymple, the brilliant and erratic hydrographer who was nominated by the Royal Society to command the Transit of Venus expedition to Tahiti in 1769. The command of the expedition was given by the admiralty to Captain James Cook. Sailing in 1772 with Resolution, a vessel of 462 tons under his own command and Adventure of 336 tons under Captain Tobias Furneaux, Cook first searched in vain for Bouvet Island, then sailed for 20 degrees of longitude to the westward in latitude 58?S, and then 30 eastward for the most part south of 60?S, a lower southern latitude than had ever been voluntarily entered before by any vessel. On 17 January 1773 the Antarctic Circle was crossed for the first time in history and the two ships reached 67 15' S by 39 35' E, where their course was stopped by ice.\\r\\n\\r\\nCook then turned northward to look for French Southern and Antarctic Lands, of the discovery of which he had received news at Cape Town, but from the rough determination of his longitude by Kerguelen, Cook reached the assigned latitude 10 too far east and did not see it. He turned south again and was stopped by ice in 61 52 S by 95?E and continued eastward nearly on the parallel of 60?S to 147?E. On 16 March, the approaching winter drove him northward for rest to New Zealand and the tropical islands of the Pacific. In November 1773, Cook left New Zealand, having parted company with the Adventure, and reached 60?S by 177?W, whence he sailed eastward keeping as far south as the floating ice allowed. The Antarctic Circle was crossed on 20 December and Cook remained south of it for three days, being compelled after reaching 67 31 S to stand north again in 135?W.\\r\\n\\r\\nA long detour to 47 50 S served to show that there was no land connection between New Zealand and Tierra del Fuego. Turning south again, Cook crossed the Antarctic Circle for the third time at 109 30 W before his progress was once again blocked by ice four days later at 71 10 S by 106 54 W. This point, reached on 30 January 1774, was the farthest south attained in the 18th century. With a great detour to the east, almost to the coast of South America, the expedition regained Tahiti for refreshment. In November 1774, Cook started from New Zealand and crossed the South Pacific without sighting land between 53 and 57?S to Tierra del Fuego; then, passing Cape Horn on 29 December, he rediscovered Roch Island renaming it Isle of Georgia, and discovered the South Sandwich Islands (named Sandwich Land by him), the only ice-clad land he had seen, before crossing the South Atlantic to the Cape of Good Hope between 55 and 60. He thereby laid open the way for future Antarctic exploration by exploding the myth of a habitable southern continent. Cook's most southerly discovery of land lay on the temperate side of the 60th parallel, and he convinced himself that if land lay farther south it was practically inaccessible and without economic value.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nVoyagers rounding Cape Horn frequently met with contrary winds and were driven southward into snowy skies and ice-encumbered seas; but so far as can be ascertained none of them before 1770 reached the Antarctic Circle, or knew it, if they did.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a voyage from 1822 to 1824, James Weddell commanded the 160-ton brig Jane, accompanied by his second ship Beaufoy captained by Matthew Brisbane. Together they sailed to the South Orkneys where sealing proved disappointing. They turned south in the hope of finding a better sealing ground. The season was unusually mild and tranquil, and on 20 February 1823 the two ships reached latitude 7415'?S and longitude 3416'45?W the southernmost position any ship had ever reached up to that time. A few icebergs were sighted but there was still no sight of land, leading Weddell to theorize that the sea continued as far as the South Pole. Another two days' sailing would have brought him to Coat's Land (to the east of the Weddell Sea) but Weddell decided to turn back.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first land south of the parallel 60 south latitude was discovered by the Englishman William Smith, who sighted Livingston Island on 19 February 1819. A few months later Smith returned to explore the other islands of the South Shetlands archipelago, landed on King George Island, and claimed the new territories for Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, the Spanish Navy ship San Telmo sank in September 1819 when trying to cross Cape Horn. Parts of her wreckage were found months later by sealers on the north coast of Livingston Island (South Shetlands). It is unknown if some survivor managed to be the first to set foot on these Antarctic islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first confirmed sighting of mainland Antarctica cannot be accurately attributed to one single person. It can, however, be narrowed down to three individuals. According to various sources,[45][46][47] three men all sighted the ice shelf or the continent within days or months of each other: von Bellingshausen, a captain in the Russian Imperial Navy; Edward Bransfield, a captain in the British navy; and Nathaniel Palmer, an American sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut. It is certain that the expedition, led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships Vostok and Mirny, reached a point within 32?km (20?mi) from Princess Martha Coast and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 692128S 21450W? / ?69.35778S 2.24722W? / -69.35778; -2.24722[48] that became known as the Fimbul ice shelf. On 30 January 1820, Bransfield sighted Trinity Peninsula, the northernmost point of the Antarctic mainland, while Palmer sighted the mainland in the area south of Trinity Peninsula in November 1820. Von Bellingshausen's expedition also discovered Peter I Island and Alexander I Island, the first islands to be discovered south of the circle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1839, as part of the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838√ø42 conducted by the United States Navy (sometimes called \\"the Wilkes Expedition\\"), an expedition sailed from Sydney, Australia, on the sloops-of-war USS?Vincennes and USS?Peacock, the brig USS?Porpoise, the full-rigged ship Relief, and two schooners Sea Gull and USS?Flying Fish. They sailed into the Antarctic Ocean, as it was then known, and reported the discovery \\"of an Antarctic continent west of the Balleny Islands\\" on 25 January 1840. That part of Antarctica was later named \\"Wilkes Land\\", a name it maintains to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nExplorer James Clark Ross passed through what is now known as the Ross Sea and discovered Ross Island (both of which were named for him) in 1841. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the Ross Ice Shelf. Mount Erebus and Mount Terror are named after two ships from his expedition: HMS Erebus and Terror.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914, led by Ernest Shackleton, set out to cross the continent via the pole, but their ship, the Endurance, was trapped and crushed by pack ice before they even landed. The expedition members survived after an epic journey on sledges over pack ice to Elephant Island. Then Shackleton and five others crossed the Southern Ocean, in an open boat called James Caird, and then trekked over South Georgia to raise the alarm at the whaling station Grytviken.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1946, US Navy Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd and more than 4,700 military personnel visited the Antarctic in an expedition called Operation Highjump. Reported to the public as a scientific mission, the details were kept secret and it may have actually been a training or testing mission for the military. The expedition was, in both military or scientific planning terms, put together very quickly. The group contained an unusually high amount of military equipment, including an aircraft carrier, submarines, military support ships, assault troops and military vehicles. The expedition was planned to last for eight months but was unexpectedly terminated after only two months. With the exception of some eccentric entries in Admiral Byrd's diaries, no real explanation for the early termination has ever been officially given.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Finn Ronne, Byrd's executive officer, returned to Antarctica with his own expedition in 1947√ø1948, with Navy support, three planes, and dogs. Ronne disproved the notion that the continent was divided in two and established that East and West Antarctica was one single continent, i.e. that the Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea are not connected.[50]  The expedition explored and mapped large parts of Palmer Land and the Weddell Sea coastline, and identified the Ronne Ice Shelf, named by Ronne after his wife Edith \\"Jackie\\" Ronne.[51] Ronne covered 3,600 miles by ski and dog sled √ø more than any other explorer in history.[52] The Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition discovered and mapped the last unknown coastline in the world and was the first Antarctic expedition to ever include women.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Antarctic Treaty was signed on 1 December 1959 and came into force on 23 June 1961. Among other provisions, this treaty limits military activity in the Antarctic to the support of scientific research.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first person to sail single-handed to Antarctica was the New Zealander David Henry Lewis, in 1972, in a 10-metre steel sloop Ice Bird.\\r\\n\\r\\nA baby, named Emilio Marcos de Palma, was born near Hope Bay on 7 January 1978, becoming the first baby born on the continent. He also was born further south than anyone in history.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MS Explorer was a cruise ship operated by the Swedish explorer Lars-Eric Lindblad. Observers point to the Explorer's 1969 expeditionary cruise to Antarctica as the frontrunner for today's sea-based tourism in that region.[55][56] The Explorer was the first cruise ship used specifically to sail the icy waters of the Antarctic Ocean and the first to sink there[57] when she struck an unidentified submerged object on 23 November 2007, reported to be ice, which caused a 10 by 4 inches (25 by 10?cm) gash in the hull.[58] The Explorer was abandoned in the early hours of 23 November 2007 after taking on water near the South Shetland Islands in the Southern Ocean, an area which is usually stormy but was calm at the time.[59] The Explorer was confirmed by the Chilean Navy to have sunk at approximately position: 62 24 South, 57 16 West,[60] in roughly 600?m of water.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Southern Ocean, geologically the youngest of the oceans, was formed when Antarctica and South America moved apart, opening the Drake Passage, roughly 30 million years ago. The separation of the continents allowed the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a northern limit at 60S, the Southern Ocean differs from the other oceans in that its largest boundary, the northern boundary, does not abut a landmass (as it did with the first edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas). Instead, the northern limit is with the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne reason for considering it as a separate ocean stems from the fact that much of the water of the Southern Ocean differs from the water in the other oceans. Water gets transported around the Southern Ocean fairly rapidly because of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current which circulates around Antarctica. Water in the Southern Ocean south of, for example, New Zealand, resembles the water in the Southern Ocean south of South America more closely than it resembles the water in the Pacific Ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Southern Ocean has typical depths of between 4,000 and 5,000?m (13,000 and 16,000?ft) over most of its extent with only limited areas of shallow water. The Southern Ocean's greatest depth of 7,236?m (23,740?ft) occurs at the southern end of the South Sandwich Trench, at 6000'S, 024W. The Antarctic continental shelf appears generally narrow and unusually deep, its edge lying at depths up to 800?m (2,600?ft), compared to a global mean of 133?m (436?ft).\\r\\n\\r\\nEquinox to equinox in line with the sun's seasonal influence, the Antarctic ice pack fluctuates from an average minimum of 2.6?million square kilometres (1.0G10^6?sq?mi) in March to about 18.8?million square kilometres (7.3G10^6?sq?mi) in September, more than a sevenfold increase in area.\\r\\n\\r\\nSub-divisions of oceans are geographical features such as \\"seas\\", \\"straits\\", \\"bays\\", \\"channels\\", and \\"gulfs\\". There are many sub-divisions of the Southern Ocean defined in the never-approved 2002 draft fourth edition of the IHO publication Limits of Oceans and Seas. In clockwise order these include (with IHO sub-division chartlet numbers in parenthesis) the Weddell Sea (10.1), the Lazarev Sea (10.2), the Riiser-Larsen Sea (10.3), the Cosmonauts Sea (10.4), the Cooperation Sea (10.5), the Davis Sea (10.6), Tryoshnikova Gulf (10.6.1), the Mawson Sea (10.7), the Dumont D'Urville Sea (10.8), the Somov Sea (10.9), the Ross Sea (10.10), McMurdo Sound (10.10.1), the Amundsen Sea (10.11), the Bellingshausen Sea (10.12), part of the Drake Passage (10.13), Bransfield Strait (10.14) and part of the Scotia Sea (4.2).[29][note 7][note 8]  A number of these such as the 2002 Russian-proposed \\"Consmonauts Sea\\", \\"Cooperation Sea\\", and \\"Somov (mid-1950s Russian polar explorer) Sea\\" are not included in the 1953 IHO document which remains currently in force,[27] because they received their names largely originated from 1962 onward. Leading geographic authorities and atlases do not use these latter three names, including the 2014 10th edition World Atlas from the United States' National Geographic Society and the 2014 12th edition of the British Times Atlas of the World, but Soviet and Russian-issued maps do.[62][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Southern Ocean probably contains large, and possibly giant, oil and gas fields on the continental margin. Placer deposits, accumulation of valuable minerals such as gold, formed by gravity separation during sedimentary processes are also expected to exist in the Southern Ocean.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nManganese nodules are expected to exist in the Southern Ocean. Manganese nodules are rock concretions on the sea bottom formed of concentric layers of iron and manganese hydroxides around a core. The core may be microscopically small and is sometimes completely transformed into manganese minerals by crystallization. Interest in the potential exploitation of polymetallic nodules generated a great deal of activity among prospective mining consortia in the 1960s and 1970s.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe icebergs that form each year around in the Southern Ocean hold enough fresh water to meet the needs of every person on Earth for several months. For several decades there have been proposals, none yet to be feasible or successful, to tow Southern Ocean icebergs to more arid northern regions (such as Australia) where they can be harvested.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nIcebergs can occur at any time of year throughout the ocean. Some may have drafts up to several hundred meters; smaller icebergs, iceberg fragments and sea-ice (generally 0.5 to 1 m thick) also pose problems for ships. The deep continental shelf has a floor of glacial deposits varying widely over short distances.\\r\\n\\r\\nSailors know latitudes from 40 to 70 degrees south as the \\"Roaring Forties\\", \\"Furious Fifties\\" and \\"Shrieking Sixties\\" due to high winds and large waves that form as winds blow around the entire globe unimpeded by any land-mass. Icebergs, especially in May to October, make the area even more dangerous. The remoteness of the region makes sources of search and rescue scarce.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Antarctic Circumpolar Current moves perpetually eastward √ø  chasing and joining itself, and at 21,000?km (13,000?mi) in length √ø  it comprises the world's longest ocean current, transporting 130?million cubic metres per second (4.6G10^9?cu?ft/s) of water √ø 100 times the flow of all the world's rivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral processes operate along the coast of Antarctica to produce, in the Southern Ocean, types of water masses not produced elsewhere in the oceans of the Southern Hemisphere. One of these is the Antarctic Bottom Water, a very cold, highly saline, dense water that forms under sea ice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAssociated with the Circumpolar Current is the Antarctic Convergence encircling Antarctica, where cold northward-flowing Antarctic waters meet the relatively warmer waters of the subantarctic, Antarctic waters predominantly sink beneath subantarctic waters, while associated zones of mixing and upwelling create a zone very high in nutrients. These nurture high levels of phytoplankton with associated copepods and Antarctic krill, and resultant foodchains supporting fish, whales, seals, penguins, albatrosses and a wealth of other species.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Antarctic Convergence is considered to be the best natural definition of the northern extent of the Southern Ocean.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nLarge-scale upwelling is found in the Southern Ocean. Strong westerly (eastward) winds blow around Antarctica, driving a significant flow of water northwards. This is actually a type of coastal upwelling. Since there are no continents in a band of open latitudes between South America and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, some of this water is drawn up from great depths. In many numerical models and observational syntheses, the Southern Ocean upwelling represents the primary means by which deep dense water is brought to the surface. Shallower, wind-driven upwelling is also found off the west coasts of North and South America, northwest and southwest Africa, and southwest and southeast Australia, all associated with oceanic subtropical high pressure circulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome models of the ocean circulation suggest that broad-scale upwelling occurs in the tropics, as pressure driven flows converge water toward the low latitudes where it is diffusively warmed from above. The required diffusion coefficients, however, appear to be larger than are observed in the real ocean. Nonetheless, some diffusive upwelling does probably occur.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ross Gyre and Weddell Gyre are two gyres that exist within the Southern Ocean. The gyres are located in the Ross Sea and Weddell Sea respectively, and both rotate clockwise. The gyres are formed by interactions between the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Antarctic Continental Shelf.\\r\\n\\r\\nSea ice has been noted to persist in the central area of the Ross Gyre.[66] There is some evidence that global warming has resulted in some decrease of the salinity of the waters of the Ross Gyre since the 1950s.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the Coriolis effect acting to the left in the Southern Hemisphere and the resulting Ekman transport away from the centres of the Weddell Gyre, these regions are very productive due to upwelling of cold, nutrient rich water.\\r\\n\\r\\nSea temperatures vary from about ?2 to 10?C (28 to 50?F). Cyclonic storms travel eastward around the continent and frequently become intense because of the temperature contrast between ice and open ocean. The ocean-area from about latitude 40 south to the Antarctic Circle has the strongest average winds found anywhere on Earth.[68] In winter the ocean freezes outward to 65 degrees south latitude in the Pacific sector and 55 degrees south latitude in the Atlantic sector, lowering surface temperatures well below 0 degrees Celsius. At some coastal points, however, persistent intense drainage winds from the interior keep the shoreline ice-free throughout the winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nA variety of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean. Antarctic sea life includes penguins, blue whales, orcas, colossal squids and fur seals. The emperor penguin is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the Adlie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin. The rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. King penguins, chinstrap penguins, and gentoo penguins also breed in the Antarctic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Antarctic fur seal was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The Weddell seal, a \\"true seal\\", is named after Sir James Weddell, commander of British sealing expeditions in the Weddell Sea. Antarctic krill, which congregates in large schools, is the keystone species of the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean, and is an important food organism for whales, seals, leopard seals, fur seals, squid, icefish, penguins, albatrosses and many other birds.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe benthic communities of the seafloor are diverse and dense, with up to 155,000 animals found in 1 square metre (10.8?sq?ft). As the seafloor environment is very similar all around the Antarctic, hundreds of species can be found all the way around the mainland, which is a uniquely wide distribution for such a large community. Deep-sea gigantism is common among these animals.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nA census of sea life carried out during the International Polar Year and which involved some 500 researchers was released in 2010. The research is part of the global Census of Marine Life (CoML) and has disclosed some remarkable findings. More than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of 12,000?km (7,456?mi). Large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually. More surprising are small forms of life such as mudworms, sea cucumbers and free-swimming snails found in both polar oceans. Various factors may aid in their distribution √ø fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ by no more than 5?C, and the major current systems or marine conveyor belt which transport egg and larva stages.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rocky shores of mainland Antarctica and its offshore islands provide nesting space for over 100 million birds every spring. These nesters include species of albatrosses, petrels, skuas, gulls and terns.[72] The insectivorous South Georgia pipit is endemic to South Georgia and some smaller surrounding islands. Freshwater ducks inhabit South Georgia and the Kerguelen Islands.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flightless penguins are all located in the Southern Hemisphere, with the greatest concentration located on and around Antarctica. Four of the 18 penguin species live and breed on the mainland and its close offshore islands. Another four species live on the subantarctic islands.[74] Emperor penguins have four overlapping layers of feathers, keeping them warm. They are the only Antarctic animal to breed during the winter.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are relatively few fish species in few families in the Southern Ocean. The most species-rich family are the snailfish (Liparidae), followed by the cod icefish (Nototheniidae)[76] and eelpout (Zoarcidae). Together the snailfish, eelpouts and notothenioids (which includes cod icefish and several other families) account for almost ?9?10 of the more than 320 described fish species of the Southern Ocean (tens of undescribed species also occur in the region, especially among the snailfish).[77] Southern Ocean snailfish are generally found in deep waters, while the icefish also occur in shallower waters.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nCod icefish (Nototheniidae), as well as several other families, are part of the Notothenioidei suborder, collectively sometimes referred to as icefish. The suborder contains many species with antifreeze proteins in their blood and tissue, allowing them to live in water that is around or slightly below 0?C (32?F).[78][79] Antifreeze proteins are also known from Southern Ocean snailfish.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crocodile icefish (family Channichthyidae), also known as white-blooded fish, are only found in the Southern Ocean. They lack hemoglobin in their blood, resulting in their blood being colourless. One Channichthyidae species, the mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari), was once the most common fish in coastal waters less than 400 metres (1,312?ft) deep, but was overfished in the 1970s and 1980s. Schools of icefish spend the day at the seafloor and the night higher in the water column eating plankton and smaller fish.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two species from the genus Dissostichus, the Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) and the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). These two species live on the seafloor 100√ø3,000 metres (328√ø9,843?ft) deep, and can grow to around 2 metres (7?ft) long weighing up to 100 kilograms (220?lb), living up to 45 years. The Antarctic toothfish lives close to the Antarctic mainland, whereas the Patagonian toothfish lives in the relatively warmer subantarctic waters. Toothfish are commercially fished, and overfishing has reduced toothfish populations.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother abundant fish group is the genus Notothenia, which like the Antarctic toothfish have antifreeze in their bodies.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn unusual species of icefish is the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum), which is the only truly pelagic fish in the waters near Antarctica.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven pinniped species inhabit Antarctica. The largest, the elephant seal (Mirounga leonina), can reach up to 4,000 kilograms (8,818?lb), while females of the smallest, the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), reach only 150 kilograms (331?lb). These two species live north of the sea ice, and breed in harems on beaches. The other four species can live on the sea ice. Crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus) and Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) form breeding colonies, whereas leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) and Ross seals (Ommatophoca rossii) live solitary lives. Although these species hunt underwater, they breed on land or ice and spend a great deal of time there, as they have no terrestrial predators.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four species that inhabit sea ice are thought to make up 50% of the total biomass of the world's seals.[83] Crabeater seals have a population of around 15 million, making them one of the most numerous large animals on the planet.[84] The New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri), one of the rarest and most localised pinnipeds, breeds almost exclusively on the subantarctic Auckland Islands, although historically it had a wider range.[85] Out of all permanent mammalian residents, the Weddell seals live the furthest south.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 10 cetacean species found in the Southern Ocean; six baleen whales, and four toothed whales. The largest of these, the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), grows to 24 metres (79?ft) long weighing 84 tonnes. Many of these species are migratory, and travel to tropical waters during the Antarctic winter.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nFive species of krill, small free-swimming crustaceans, have been found in the Southern Ocean.[88] The Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is one of the most abundant animal species on earth, with a biomass of around 500 million tonnes. Each individual is 6 centimetres (2.4?in) long and weighs over 1 gram (0.035?oz).[89]  The swarms that form can stretch for kilometres, with up to 30,000 individuals per 1 cubic metre (35?cu?ft), turning the water red.[88] Swarms usually remain in deep water during the day, ascending during the night to feed on plankton. Many larger animals depend on krill for their own survival.[89] During the winter when food is scarce, adult Antarctic krill can revert to a smaller juvenile stage, using their own body as nutrition.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany benthic crustaceans have a non-seasonal breeding cycle, and some raise their young in a brood pouch. Glyptonotus antarcticus is an unusually large benthic isopod, reaching 20 centimetres (8?in) in length weighing 70 grams (2.47?oz). Amphipods are abundant in soft sediments, eating a range of items, from algae to other animals.[70] The amphipods are highly diverse with more than 600 recognized species found south of the Antarctic Convergence and there are indications that many undescribed species remain. Among these are several \\"giants\\", such as the iconic epimeriids that are up to 8?cm (3.1?in) long.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nSlow moving sea spiders are common, sometimes growing as large as a human hand. They feed on the corals, sponges, and bryozoans that litter the seabed.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany aquatic molluscs are present in Antarctica. Bivalves such as Adamussium colbecki move around on the seafloor, while others such as Laternula elliptica live in burrows filtering the water above.[70] There are around 70 cephalopod species in the Southern Ocean,[91] the largest of which is the colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni), which at up to 14 metres (46?ft) is among the largest invertebrate in the world.[92] Squid makes up most of the diet of some animals, such as grey-headed albatrosses and sperm whales, and the warty squid (Moroteuthis ingens) is one of the subantarctic's most preyed upon species by vertebrates.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sea urchin genus Abatus burrow through the sediment eating the nutrients they find in it.[70] Two species of salps are common in Antarctic waters, Salpa thompsoni and Ihlea racovitzai. Salpa thompsoni is found in ice-free areas, whereas Ihlea racovitzai is found in the high latitude areas near ice. Due to their low nutritional value, they are normally only eaten by fish, with larger animals such as birds and marine mammals only eating them when other food is scarce.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nAntarctic sponges are long lived, and sensitive to environmental changes due to the specificity of the symbiotic microbial communities within them. As a result, they function as indicators of environmental health.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreased solar ultraviolet radiation resulting from the Antarctic ozone hole has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) by as much as 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish.[95] Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll international agreements regarding the world's oceans apply to the Southern Ocean. In addition, it is subject to these agreements specific to the region:\\r\\n\\r\\nMany nations prohibit the exploration for and the exploitation of mineral resources south of the fluctuating Antarctic Convergence,[98] which lies in the middle of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and serves as the dividing line between the very cold polar surface waters to the south and the warmer waters to the north. The Antarctic Treaty covers the portion of the globe south of sixty degrees south,[99]\\r\\nit prohibits new claims to Antarctica.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources applies to the area south of 60 South latitude as well as the areas further north up to the limit of the Antarctic Convergence.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1 July 1998 and 30 June 1999, fisheries landed 119,898 tonnes, of which 85% consisted of krill and 14% of Patagonian toothfish. International agreements came into force in late 1999 to reduce illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which in the 1998√ø99 season landed five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor operational ports include: Rothera Station, Palmer Station, Villa Las Estrellas, Esperanza Base, Mawson Station, McMurdo Station, and offshore anchorages in Antarctica.\\r\\n\\r\\nFew ports or harbors exist on the southern (Antarctic) coast of the Southern Ocean, since ice conditions limit use of most shores to short periods in midsummer; even then some require icebreaker escort for access. Most Antarctic ports are operated by government research stations and, except in an emergency, remain closed to commercial or private vessels; vessels in any port south of 60 degrees south are subject to inspection by Antarctic Treaty observers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Southern Ocean's southernmost port operates at McMurdo Station at 7750S 16640E? / ?77.833S 166.667E? / -77.833; 166.667. Winter Quarters Bay forms a small harbor, on the southern tip of Ross Island where a floating ice pier makes port operations possible in summer. Operation Deep Freeze personnel constructed the first ice pier at McMurdo in 1973.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the original 1928 IHO delineation of the Southern Ocean (and the 1937 delineation if the Great Australian Bight is considered integral), Australian ports and harbors between Cape Leeuwin and Cape Otway on the Australian mainland and along the west coast of Tasmania would also be identified as ports and harbors existing in the Southern Ocean. These would include the larger ports and harbors of Albany, Thevenard, Port Lincoln, Whyalla, Port Augusta, Port Adelaide, Portland, Warrnambool, and Macquarie Harbour.\\r\\n\\r\\nYacht races have been held in the Southern Ocean, such as the Volvo Ocean Race, Velux 5 Oceans Race, Vende Globe, Jules Verne Trophy and Global Challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 70S 150W? / ?70S 150W? / -70; -150","input":"When did the southern ocean come into existence?"},{"output":"the 19th century","context":"Urban planning in Australia has a significant role to play in ensuring the future sustainability of Australian cities. Australia is one of the most highly urbanised societies in the world. Continued population growth in Australian cities is placing increasing pressure on infrastructure, such as public transport and roadways, energy, air and water systems within the urban environment.\\r\\nUrban planning is undertaken at all levels of Government in Australia. However, the Federal Government is playing an increasing part in setting policy[citation needed] as part of an overall response to developing climate adaptation and mitigation strategies[citation needed]. The local government has also been engaging with the community to make decisions on urban planning designs that help to promote social cohesion. Over the past few decades Australians have developed a respect for urban heritage places and community groups have fought hard to stop developers from destroying them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUrban planning in Australia has evolved since early British colonial settlement, and has been heavily influenced by contemporary planning movements in Britain, the United States of America and western Europe.[1] However, over the past century, distinctly Australian responses and solutions to Australian urban issues have developed.\\r\\nThe first examples of town planning in Australia occurred during the early phases of the Colonial era, where critical decisions locked in 'path dependency' for the future form of cities.[2] Typically this involved colonial Governors undertaking surveying for land grants and subdivisions, and making executive decisions on the location and construction of roads, rail transport, water supply and other basic infrastructure to support early penal and military settlements. Primacy was given to the functional and practical needs of Colonial administration, as opposed to more lofty civic or aesthetic ideals.[3]\\r\\nDespite these humble, utilitarian beginnings, there were places where clear planning and design for settlements occurred. One of the earliest forms of a planned settlement in Australia involved the work of Colonel William Light, a Colonial Surveyor and the Surveyor-General for the colony of South Australia, in planning and designing the original city centre grid for Adelaide in 1837. While Light's plan was not entirely realised, it is widely regarded as a fine achievement of colonial era civic design.[4]\\r\\nRapid colonial expansion in the 19th century, matched by economic growth, resulted in Australia becoming one of the most highly urbanised nations in the world. For example, by 1861, 40% of Sydney's residents lived in suburbs.[5] This trend towards urbanisation was established early and continued into the 20th century.\\r\\nAustralia's rapid urbanization meant urban planning became an increasingly important issue.\\r\\nEarly town planners focused on the orderly planning of cities, closely following international contemporary town planning and urban reform movements (especially from the UK), where urban planning aimed to improve urban health, efficiency and aesthetics.[6]\\r\\nThis concern with civic improvement was expressed in many ways, with citizen groups forming in Australian cities to advocate healthier, more beautiful cities.[7] In Sydney, this desire to improve planning found its expression through a Royal Commission into the Improvement of Sydney and its Suburbs, which commenced in 1908, focusing on transportation, slum clearance, the future growth of Sydney, and aesthetics.[8] The Garden City movement, founded by Ebenezer Howard in the UK, was also influential and was adopted as a design strategy in several areas of Australian cities (such as in Daceyville in south eastern Sydney).\\r\\nOne of the earliest international contributions made by Australia to urban planning theory and practice resulted from the international competition held to design Australia's new federal capital, Canberra, which was held between 1911 and 1912. The winning design was submitted by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin, with the design reflecting state of the art planning concepts from the time. Whilst Canberra was actually constructed some time after the competition, it still represented an early international example of a planned city.\\r\\nAustralian cities and urban centres, particularly capital cities, experienced significant growth after World War II, which was largely driven by a combination of rapid economic expansion, high birth rates and unparalleled levels of immigration, particularly from western Europe and, from the 1970s, south east Asia. Furthermore, increasing ownership of the motor car, combined with cheap fuel, resulted in an explosion in the urban form of many Australian urban centres.[9] Many cities were rapidly transformed from modest, medium density centres, supported by public transport, to a suburban, car dominated city with large, residential dormitory suburbs. As a consequence, population and land use become increasingly dispersed. For example, in 1840 40% of Sydney's residents lived in suburbs, while by the 1960s this figure had risen to over 70%.[10]\\r\\nAustralia's long period of post war economic growth resulted in Federal and State governments developing metropolitan plans in an attempt to address some of the negative aspects associated with urban growth.[11] Typically, many capital cities engaged in creating metropolitan wide spatial plans to guide development over long periods of up to 20 years or more. Particular focus was given to land release on the Rural-urban fringe, establishing a hierarchy of urban centres, the construction of new public housing estates and a preference towards building car based infrastructure (such as new highways, etc.). Examples include the Sydney County of Cumberland Plan of 1948 (regarded as the first metropolitan plan for Sydney) and the Sydney Region Outline Plan of 1968.\\r\\nFrom the early 1970s the Australian Federal Government became directly involved in urban policy with the Whitlam Labour government establishing for the first time a federal Department of Urban and Regional Development.[12] Federal government involvement included taking care of sewage servicing backlogs in major metropolitan centres, the establishment of growth centres and new towns to foster de-centralization, funding infrastructure and public housing.\\r\\nUrban planning in Australia is a distinct, defined profession, represented by a peak industry group called the Planning Institute of Australia. Similarly, urban planning activities in Australia are codified in law, with a significant body of legislation and case law guiding planning principles and decisions.[13]\\r\\nAustralia's federal system of governance, the nationwide Australian Government, the six states and two territories have their own urban planning laws and procedures resulting in separate systems of planning and land use management, including separate administrative departments that oversee and regulate planning and land use activities.[14] Consequently, there is no single urban planning system for Australia √ø rather, there are a number of planning systems that operate largely independently of each other along state based lines.[15]\\r\\nUrban planning is not specifically referred to in the Constitution of Australia as a Federal Government responsibility. Nevertheless, the Federal Government is increasingly playing a role in the urban planning process in Australia, mainly through the regulation of development on areas that are of national environmental significance, or through actual development activities on federal land. Examples of this are where the Federal Government has actively sought to provide strategic guidance and direction in urban policy, starting with the Whitlam Labour Government in the early 1970s, the Building Better Cities Program of the mid-1990s,[16] and, most recently, with the release of a National Urban Policy in 2011. The National Urban Policy was released by the Minister for Infrastructure in 2011 and establishes for the first time the Australian Government's overarching goals for the nation's cities and how to make them more productive and sustainable.[17]\\r\\nThe principal piece of Commonwealth legislation impacting urban planning decisions is the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 which establishes a framework for assessing impacts on threatened species of national significance, world heritage sites, nuclear actions, and national heritage places, amongst other considerations.[18]\\r\\nLand use planning in New South Wales (NSW) is principally controlled under the provisions of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (EP&A Act). The EP&A Act establishes a number of key planning considerations in NSW, including:\\r\\nIn addition to the legislative framework governing land use and urban planning in New South Wales, the Minister for Planning, through the Department of Planning and Infrastructure, publishes a Metropolitan Plan for Sydney, along with Regional Strategies for the Far North Coast, Mid North Coast, Lower Hunter, Illawarra, Sydney to Canberra Corridor, and Murray regions. Whilst not provided for explicitly in the EP&A Act, these strategic planning documents provide a basis for more detailed planning at the Local Government Council, and sub-regional levels (especially in the Sydney Metropolitan Area).\\r\\nGiven that urban planning in NSW is codified through specific legislation, there is a dedicated Land and Environment Court of New South Wales to deal with urban planning disputes. Typically, these most urban planning cases heard by the Land and Environment Court deal with development assessment matters.\\r\\nIn Western Australia urban planning is primarily directed by the Western Australian Planning Commission, a statutory authority of the Government of Western Australia. and implementing legislation is the The Environmental Protection Act 1986 and the Planning and Development Act 2005.\\r\\nPopulation growth and demographic change is a key consideration for Australian urban planning. Data in the 2006 census in Australia indicates that over 75% of all Australians live in 17 cities each with a population size of over 100,000.[20] The five largest cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide contain the majority (60.8%) of urban Australians.[20]\\r\\nAccording to projections from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Department of the Treasury (Australia) it is anticipated that Australia's population will continue growing and will reach 35?million by 2050. It is estimated that 72% of this growth will occur in cities.[20] The Department of the Treasury produced an Intergenerational Report in 2010 which predicts that there will be 8.1?million Australians over the age of 65 years by 2050. This compares to 2.6?million in 2006.[20] This prediction for an aging population in Australia is attributed to low fertility rates and increasing life expectancy.[21]\\r\\nAt the same time it is predicted that households will increase from 7.4?million in 2001 to 10.2?million in 2026 while decline of household size is expected from 2.6 in 2001 to 2.3 in 2026.[20] The composition and size of households varies across Australian cities. A significant proportion of population growth since 2000 has been attributed to overseas immigration to Australia. In 2007√ø08 the Australian Bureau of Statistics data records that migration contributed 60% of population growth.[22] Long term migration to Australia has meant that 24% of the population was born overseas.[22] The majority of these migrants live in the major cities.[23]\\r\\nAs well as overseas migration some cities are also experiencing internal movement. In 2007√ø08 New South Wales experienced a net loss of 19,831 whereas Queensland had a net gain of 18,388.[24]\\r\\nThe structure of households within urban cities in Australia has also changed. There is an increasing trend towards couple only, lone parent and single person households with only a marginal increase in parents with children.[25] Despite the trend towards smaller households Australian cities still showed growth in couples with children that was above the overall Australian average. Consequently, cities are still the place where the next generation Australian will be raised.[25]\\r\\nThese demographic changes, in particular the population ageing and increase in smaller households, is leading to a greater demand in urban planning for housing and also different types of housing overall. Some metropolitan areas are experiencing housing shortages, particularly with regards to the provision of affordable accommodation. It is also placing pressure on housing affordability where there is only a single income.[26]\\r\\nTrends in population growth, transport emissions, energy usage, waste management, urban development, rainfall patterns and extreme weather events (such as droughts, heat waves, severe storms, bushfires, extensive flooding) are highlighting the need for increasing focus on sustainability in Australian cities.\\r\\nTransport emissions have been reported as one of strongest areas of emissions growth in Australia, which is a consequence of the distance separating many land uses, and of the underlying low density form of many Australian metropolitan areas. Private car use has continued to increase which is leading to greater levels of city congestion and urban air quality challenges.[27] The cost of congestion to the Australia economy was estimated at $9.4?billion in 2005 with a prediction of a rise in cost to $20?billion by 2020 unless the issue is addressed.[28]\\r\\nResearch indicates that while the total levels of key pollutants in cities has fallen over the last ten years as a result of improved fuel and emissions standards, particulate air pollution and ozone levels remain above the national air quality standard.[29]\\r\\nRates of recycling nationally have increased, however waste generation has also increased over the period 2002√ø03 to 2006√ø07 by 31%. This exceeds the population increase of 5.6% over the same period.[29] As a result, this has placed pressure on governments to adequate plan for landfill and associated waste management facilities in metropolitan areas.\\r\\nData on rainfall patterns in eastern and southwest Australia, where the major cities are located, indicates a decline in the annual rate of rainfall per decade of up to 50?mm since 1950.[27] This is providing challenges in terms of both availability and the quality of water supplies, particularly when combined with population growth.\\r\\nAt the planning level basic aspects of sustainable housing design such as raising density, mixed use, promoting mixed use development, and encouraging transit oriented development to increase trips made by public transport have been progressively adopted as policy responses in Australian cities.[30]\\r\\nSustainable building codes such as the Victoria's Green Star (Australia) rating and New South Wales' BASIX sustainability assessment tool are being applied to new developments to improve energy and water conservation at the individual building scale.[30]\\r\\nFurther improvements in waste, water, energy and onsite food production are being progressively seen as a necessary and significant part of planning for urban sustainability in Australian cities.[31]\\r\\nWater-sensitive urban design (WSUD) has evolved to become a framework for integrating the management of urban water within the practice of sustainable urban design in Australia.[32] Water sensitive design aims to ensure that the management of urban water occurs with sensitivity towards natural water systems and the broader ecosystem that the water systems support.[33]\\r\\nWithin the frame-work planners consider:\\r\\nWSUD incorporates planning and design as it relates to the building and landscape architecture on site and also in the context of wider local and regional initiatives.[36]\\r\\nUrban renewal and consolidation is changing the character of Australian cities. Planning strategies have focused on containing the outward physical sprawl of cities whilst at the same time emphasis has been placed on redeveloping the inner city and older employment zones as new residential spaces.[37]\\r\\nA new inner urban city middle class has emerged which has driven the renovation and restoration of the housing stock formally owned by older inner city working class communities.[37] The transformation of these areas has predominantly seen the end of these areas being viewed as places of social disadvantage.[37]\\r\\nIn parallel to the renovation of the housing stock there has also been a revitalization of disused industrial and commercial spaces such as warehouses and docklands and these have been transformed into new residential, commercial and recreational spaces often with high density development.[37] Examples include the Docklands development in Melbourne, Green Square, Victoria Park and Barrangaroo in Sydney and South Bank in Brisbane.\\r\\nHigh density living in Australian cities is limited to the inner urban cores of major metropolitan areas, and is substantially less dense than comparable cities in Asia and Europe. Typically most urban housing development focused on a single one level house (although this is changing) on a separate block of land. There has been a small amount of low rise apartments in inner city areas since the 1930s but this started to change since the introduction of Strata Title legislation in the 1960s.[38] The Strata Title legislation enabled individuals to own individual apartments in a multi-apartment block on a single piece of land. Before this apartment blocks were predominantly owned as a single property by landlords.\\r\\nThe introduction of Strata Titles also enabled easier financing arrangements for individuals wishing to purchase a single apartment. Strata titles cover both apartments as well as attached dwellings such as town houses where these have been developed on a single title of land.\\r\\nOnce introduced Strata Titling facilitated the redevelopment, particularly in valuable areas or often close to transport infrastructure, of older housing on larger pieces of land which were replaced with apartment blocks.[38]\\r\\nGoing forward this style of higher density housing is expected to play a large part in meeting housing needs for the changing demographics of an aging population and smaller households in Australian cities.[39] For example, the Sydney Metropolitan Plan 2036 has a growth target of 70% of all new housing to be in the existing urban footprint, with 80% of all housing to be within a 20-minute commute of a major centre. To facilitate this, the Minister for Planning in NSW released an Urban Renewal Planning Policy to specifically deliver urban renewal in key sites in the Sydney Metropolitan area.\\r\\nClimate change is an important factor in the decision making process for urban planning in Australia because of the highly urbanised population prone to extreme weather patterns. Australia's urban areas are susceptible to changes in the climate because of the physical construction of the built environment, infrastructure, and its ecological correlation with the urban ecosystem.[40] Over 80% of the Australian population lives in the coastal area of Australia and many on the fringe of bush land and rivers making them vulnerable to the effects of climate change. These effects include sea level rise, increased storm surges resulting in coastal erosion, strong winds, intense rainfall causing flash flooding and bushfires due to increased temperatures.[41] The Australian Federal Government is in the process of developing climate adaptation and mitigation strategies along with risk assessment analysis initiatives to urban planning.[40]\\r\\nHistorically urban planning has been the role of the state, regional and local governments but since December 2009 the Australian Federal Government has re-engaged in a strategic decision making process to prepare for climate change. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency (DCCEE) has developed adaption programs and risk assessments.[41] A risk assessment has been calculated for possible effects on urban areas due to climate change and replacement values for transport, industrial, residential and commercial infrastructure runs into billions of dollars.[42] Therefore, avoidance of future risk is the most cost-effective approach to urban planning.[41]\\r\\nThe options for coastal and riverside management to deal with sea level rise and storm surges fall into three categories; \\"retreat\\", \\"accommodate\\" and \\"protect\\".[43] \\"Retreat\\" entails relocating coastal and riverside infrastructure that are high risk of damage from extreme weather patterns, as well as designing buildings and infrastructures in new locations away from potential risk areas.[43] \\"Accommodate\\" means adapting the existing built environments to effectively cope with the changing conditions such as Island raising through adding sand to beaches and raising infrastructure and buildings near the coast and riverside. \\"Protect\\" involves building sea walls and levees to prevent damage from storm surges and sea level rise.[44]\\r\\nThere are a number of simple but effective adaptation options possible at a local scale to deal with intense rainfall and temperature rises. These include reducing impervious surfaces to allow for water infiltration, tree planting in urban areas to reduce the \\"heat island effect\\" and constructing transport facilities away from flood areas. Designing buildings with natural ventilation and building insulation will also help with increasing temperatures. While the only possible solution to bushfires might be to increase fire breaks between the houses and bush land.[43]\\r\\nPoliticians, planners and the community came to see the value of heritage buildings in Australia only recently in the 1970s.[45] Laws and policies are now in place to conserve and protect historic buildings across Australia. The Green Ban is a key aspect in the initiation of these regulations especially the impact it had on proposed urban development in the city of Sydney.[46]\\r\\nIn the early twentieth century there was no historic sense of preservation with regard to the built environment and people were happy to see the old replaced by the new. Then in the 1970s came the Green Bans movement imposed by builders labourers across Australia, being particularly prominent in Sydney.[46] The Green Ban was created to defend the demolition of older style buildings that were to make way for new developments of skyscrapers, shopping precincts and luxury apartments. It was initiated by the builders labourers that were hired to construct these new buildings and was the first of its kind around the world.[46] The key element of the movement came from the New South Wales Builders Labourers Federation (NSWBLF) which consisted of over 100 union members that belonged to the Communist Party of Australia. The most famous union leaders of the NSWBLF were Bob Pringle, Joe Owens and Jack Mundey. Many critics of the union disputed that they were denying workers employment but the union responded that they wanted to build but in a way that enhanced the built environment, such as schools and houses for the everyday person not buildings based on developers' needs.[47] Among the 40 green bans imposed in NSW, The Rocks in Sydney was the most significant areas saved. The green ban prevented the demolition of some of the oldest buildings in Australia and beautiful foreshore parks which were going to be replaced by concrete, glass office blocks.[46]\\r\\nStates and territories of Australia have since implemented heritage acts and have heritage frameworks in place to protect buildings and places of cultural significance.[45] On a national scale in 1999 the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act was introduced which outlines a National Heritage List (NHL).[48] The NHL is in place to protect \\"exceptional natural and cultural places that contribute to Australia's national identity\\".[49] Since then measurements of heritage have evolved and in 2011, there are 113 places listed of iconic heritage value to the whole of Australia, which include the Sydney Opera House, Melbourne Cricket Ground and Anzac Parade in Canberra.[50]\\r\\nUrban planning in Australia in the 21st century now has very strict guidelines to follow and heritage is of fundamental significance in the decision making process before any construction takes place. As developers now know there will always be people watching and ready to protect Australia's cultural history.\\r\\nThe Australian government has begun to see community engagement in the decision making process of urban planning of fundamental importance. Due to this engagement local governments have looked for ways to design urban infrastructure in a way that helps to encourage social cohesion. However, there is still room for developing a method that uses community involvement more effectively. Community participation has also created many barriers along the way by preventing urban planning projects from proceeding.[51]\\r\\nPreviously, urban planning in Australia quite often did not involve the community and projects went ahead to construct residential buildings that were crammed into small areas and did not provide space for recreation and socialising. Recently this approach has changed and planners have realised the importance of creating an urban environment that encourages social behavior among its residents.[52] These new designs incorporate active living and recreational areas that provide for social connectivity and wellbeing. This new approach has come through feedback from the community showing the positive effects of their involvement.[52]\\r\\nIn 2008, the Australian federal government headed by former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd inaugurated the Department of Infrastructure and Transport to work with the newly established Major Cities Unit (MCU)in an effort to involve the community to develop urban environments into more productive and sustainable places.[52] From then on the MCU has been researching ways to develop policies that improve urban planning to make cities more socially inclusive and encouraging the community to actively participate in the decision making process.[53] In May 2011, national urban new policies were released by the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Anthony Albanese which promised to: \\"enhance the livability of cities by promoting better urban design, planning and affordable access to recreational, cultural and community facilities.\\" [54]\\r\\nThere is still a need to develop more effective participation from the community. Often the participants do not represent the views of the whole community and disadvantaged groups such as the poor and minorities do not get a fair say in the urban planning process.[55]\\r\\nAustralia's urban transport system could become under increasing demand as the population grows and Australia moves to a more environmentally friendly urban system. Some of Australia's urban problems such as road congestion and pollution could be solved by the improvement of public transport, as it is a crucial aspect in creating a functional, sustainable city.[56] The urban structure of Australian cities consists of dispersed suburbs and dense central building districts which creates immense planning challenges for decision makers.[56] Urban planners now realise the need to integrate active and sustainable public transport with destinations accessible to alternative modes of transport such as cycling and walking to encourage people to reduce the stress of cars on the roads.[57]\\r\\nRoad transport contributes to 88% of all transport emissions and the cities of Australia are congested not only by automobiles but the parking lots they use.[58] In March 2006, 75% of adults in Australian cities travelled to work or study by private automobile in comparison to 19% that used public transport and 5% that walked or cycled.[59] Reducing private automobile dependence will improve the pollution problem and free up land to build more needed infrastructure such as schools, houses and hospitals. To encourage Australians to use public transport research suggests it should be more efficient (timely, reliable, and accessible) and affordable.[60]\\r\\nThe Australian Transport Council has found that the current networks of buses and trains in Australian cities need to be integrated with effective land use.[61] At the moment buses and trains run along the same routes competing with each other. Ideally trains are used to travel long distances, with a high passenger capacity and avoid the traffic signals. Buses should be in place as an intermediary for fast inner city train networks and for passengers to access surrounding suburbs not suitable for trains.[56] Land use integration would mean that urban planners design infrastructure around public transport to enable the public to have access to transport within close walking distance from their home or work.[61] Some urban planners and policy makers think there is a need to remove car parks, build upon current transport infrastructure to create a more efficient[citation needed] system that facilitates urban regeneration.[61]\\r\\n123123123","input":"When did australia experience most of its urbanisation?"},{"output":"24 November 1859","context":"","input":"When did charles darwin publish the origin of species?"},{"output":"February 10, 1940","context":"","input":"When did the first tom and jerry cartoon air?"},{"output":"7,930","context":"New Hamburg is a community of approximately 7,930 (2011 stats) in Wilmot Township.

The settlement was laid out in 1832.[2][3] A historical plaque honours Josiah Cushman, an Amish Mennonite from Germany, who built a grist mill in the village in about 1834.[4] Later, the village was called Cassel but by 1840, it had been changed to New Hamburg.[5]\\r\\nIn 1851 the New Hamburg post-office was established by mill owner William Scott. The population was 500 at the time and there was a pottery, a carriage works and a foundry. The Grand Trunk Railroad reached the area in 1856 and helped the village to establish milling and farm machinery manufacturing. In 1869 the population was 1,400 and the settlement had a railway station.[6]\\r\\nNew Hamburg was incorporated as a Village in 1857, with a population of about 1100 and then as a Town in 1966.[7] The river was an excellent source of power for two wool factories and two flour mills in 1864.

It covers a land area of 617?km2 (238 square miles) and reported a population of 165,595 in the 2010 census.[7] Its capital is Castries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French were the island's first European settlers. They signed a treaty with the native Island Caribs in 1660. England took control of the island from 1663 to 1667. In ensuing years, it was at war with France fourteen times, and rule of the island changed frequently (it was ruled seven times each by the French and British). In 1814, the British took definitive control of the island. Because it switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the \\"Helen of the West Indies\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nRepresentative government came about in 1840 (with universal suffrage from 1953). From 1958 to 1962, the island was a member of the West Indies Federation. On 22 February 1979, Saint Lucia became an independent state and a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.[6] Saint Lucia is a mixed jurisdiction,[8] meaning that it has a legal system based in part on both the civil law and English common law. The Civil Code of St. Lucia of 1867 was based on the Quebec Civil Code of 1866, as supplemented by English common law-style legislation. It is also a member of Organisation internationale de la Francophonie.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the Windward Islands, Saint Lucia was named after Saint Lucy of Syracuse by the French, who were the island's first European settlers. It is the only country in the world named after a woman.[10]  Legend states French sailors were shipwrecked here on 13 December, the feast day of St. Lucy, thus naming the island in honor of Sainte Lucie.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1550s, the French pirate Fran?ois le Clerc (known as Jambe de Bois, due to his wooden leg) set up a camp on Pigeon Island, from where he attacked passing Spanish ships. In 1605, an English vessel called the Oliphe Blossome was blown off-course on its way to Guyana, and the 67 colonists started a settlement on Saint Lucia, after initially being welcomed by the Carib chief Anthonie.  By 26 September 1605, only 19 survived, after continued attacks by the Carib chief Augraumart, so they fled the island.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1664, Thomas Warner (son of Sir Thomas Warner, the governor of St Kitts) claimed Saint Lucia for England. He brought 1,000 men to defend it from the French, but after two years, only 89 survived with the rest dying mostly due to disease. In 1666, the French West India Company resumed control of the island, which in 1674 was made an official French crown colony as a dependency of Martinique.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the British and the French found the island attractive after the sugar industry developed, and during the 18th century the island changed ownership or was declared neutral territory a dozen times, although the French settlements remained and the island was a de facto French colony well into the eighteenth century.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1722, George I of Great Britain granted both Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent to The 2nd Duke of Montagu. He in turn appointed Nathaniel Uring, a merchant sea captain and adventurer, as deputy-governor. Uring went to the islands with a group of seven ships, and established settlement at Petit Carenage. Unable to get enough support from British warships, he and the new colonists were quickly run off by the French.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Seven Years' War, Britain occupied Saint Lucia for a year. Britain handed the island back to the French at the Treaty of Paris in 1763. Like the English and Dutch on other islands, the French began to develop the land for the cultivation of sugar cane as a commodity crop on large plantations in 1765.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1791, during the French Revolution, the National Assembly sent four commissaries to St. Lucia to spread the revolution philosophy.   By August 1791, slaves began to abandon their estates and Governor de Gimat fled.  In December 1792, Lt. Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse arrived with revolutionary pamphlets, and the impoverished whites and free people of color began to arm themselves as patriots.  On 1 February 1793, France declared war on England and Holland, and General Nicolas Xavier de Ricard  took over as Governor.  The National Convention abolished enslavement on 4 February 1794, but St. Lucia fell to a British invasion led by Vice Admiral John Jervis on 1 April 1794. Morne Fortune became Fort Charlotte.  Soon, a patriot army of resistance, L'Armee Francaise dans les Bois, began to fight back.  Thus started the First Brigand War.[12]:60√ø65\\r\\n\\r\\nA short time later the British invaded the island as a part of the recently broken out war with France. On 21 February 1795 and a group of locals under the nominal control of Victor Hugues defeated a battalion of British troops at Vieux  Fort and Rabot. In 1796, Castries was burned as part of the conflict. General John Moore retook Fort Charlotte in 1796 with the 27th Inniskilling Fusiliers after two days of bitter fighting. As an honour, the Fusiliers' regimental colour was displayed on the flagstaff of the captured fortress at Morne Fortune for an hour before being replaced by the Union Jack.[15] Moore would then participate in British efforts to repress the slave rebels until falling ill of yellow fever, upon which he returned to Britain before 1798.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1803, the British regained control of the island. Many of the rebels escaped into the thick rainforest where they evaded capture and established maroon communities.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe slavery on the island was continued for a short time, but anti-slavery sentiment was rising in Britain. The British stopped the import of slaves by anyone, white or coloured, when they abolished the slave trade in 1807.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance and Great Britain continued to contest Saint Lucia until the British secured it in 1814, as part of the Treaty of Paris ending the Napoleonic Wars. Thereafter, Saint Lucia was considered part of the British Windward Islands colony.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe institution of slavery was abolished on the island in 1836, as it was throughout the British Empire. After abolition, all former slaves had to serve a four-year \\"apprenticeship,\\" to accustom them to the idea of freedom. During this period, they worked for their former masters for at least three-quarters of the work week. Full freedom was duly granted by the British in 1838. By that time, people of African ethnicity greatly outnumbered those of ethnic European background. Some people of Carib descent also comprised a minority on the island.\\r\\n\\r\\nCastries' harbour was protected by a system of 60 surrounding forts. Along the top of Morne Fortune there are six military sites, building work by the French started in 1768, and the British completed the work by 1890. They include Fort Charlotte (Old Morne Fortress), the Apostle's Battery (1888-1890), The Powder Magazine built by the French in the 1750s, Provost's Redoubt (1792) built as a lookout point, and the Combermere barracks.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best preserved installation is a battery at La Toc Point, completed in 1888 it was not abandoned till 1905. This fort in particular was built by the British to repel any attack from the United States on the then valuable coaling harbour of Castries.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mid-twentieth century, Saint Lucia joined the West Indies Federation (1958 √ø 1962) when the colony was dissolved. In 1967, Saint Lucia became one of the six members of the West Indies Associated States, with internal self-government. In 1979, it gained full independence under Sir John Compton of the conservative United Workers party (UWP), who served as prime minister from 1982 to 1996, after which he was succeeded by Vaughan Lewis.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the scenery for the film Dr. Dolittle was shot here in 1967.[19] Water was shot here,[20] as were parts of Firepower.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Kenny Davis Anthony of the Labour Party was prime minister from 1997 to 2006. In 2006, the UWP, again led by Compton, won control of parliament. In May 2007, after Compton suffered a series of small strokes, Finance and External Affairs Minister Stephenson King became acting prime minister and succeeded Compton as prime minister when the latter died in September 2007. In November 2011, Anthony was re-elected as prime minister for a third time. In the June 2016 elections the UWP assumed power again, under Prime Minister Allen Chastanet.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe volcanic island of Saint Lucia is more mountainous than most Caribbean islands, with the highest point being Mount Gimie, at 950 metres (3,120 feet) above sea level. Two other mountains, the Pitons, form the island's most famous landmark. They are located between Soufrire and Choiseul on the western side of the island. Saint Lucia is also one of the few islands in the world that contains a drive-in volcano.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe capital city of Saint Lucia is Castries (population 60,263) where 32.4% of the population lives. Major towns include Gros Islet, Soufrire, and Vieux Fort.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe local climate is tropical, moderated by northeast trade winds, with a dry season from 1 December to 31 May, and a wet season from 1 June to 30 November.\\r\\n\\r\\nAverage daytime temperatures are around 29?C (84.2?F), and average nighttime temperatures are around 24?C (75.2?F). Since it is fairly close to the equator, the temperature does not fluctuate much between winter and summer. Average annual rainfall ranges from 1,300?mm (51.2?in) on the coast to 3,810?mm (150?in) in the mountain rainforests.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe geology of St. Lucia can be described as composing three main areas.  The oldest, 16√ø18 Ma, volcanic rocks are exposed from Castries northward and consist of eroded basalt and andesite centres.  The middle, central highlands, portion of the island consists of dissected andesite centres, 10.4 to 1 Mya, while the lower southwest portion of the island contains recent activity from the Soufriere Volcanic Centre (SVC).  This SVC, centered about the Qualibou depression, contains pyroclastic flow deposits, lava flows, domes, block-and-ash-flow deposits, and explosion craters.  This depression's perimeter includes the town of Soufriere, Mount Tabac, Mt. Gimie, Morne Bonin, and Gros Piton.  At 10 kilometres (6.2?mi) in diameter, though the western portion is open towards the Grenada basin, the depression formed as recently as 100 kya.  The depression is noted for its geothermal activity, especially at Sulphur Springs and Soufrire Estates, a phreatic eruption in 1776, and recent seismic activity (2000√ø2001).[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nEroded andesitic stratovolcanoes to the north east of the depression include Mt. Gimie, Piton St Esprit, and Mt. Grand Magazin, all greater than 1 Ma in age.  Andesitic and dacite pyroclastic flows from these volcanoes are found at Morne Tabac dome (532 ka), Morne Bonin dome (273 kya), and Bellevue (264 kya). Avalanche deposits from the formation of the Qualibou depression are found offshore, and in the massive blocks of Rabot, Pleisance, and Coubaril.  The dacitic domes of Petit Piton (109 kya) and Gros Piton (71 kya) were then extruded onto the depression floor accompanied by the Anse John (104 kya) and La Pointe (59.8 kya) pyroclastic flows.  Later, pyroclastic flows include pumice-rich Belfond and Anse Noir (20 kya).  Finally, the dacitic domes of Terre Blanche (15.3 kya) and Belfond (13.6 kya) formed within the depression.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Lucia is a Commonwealth realm. Queen Elizabeth II is the Head of State, represented on the island by a Governor-General. The prime minister[23] is normally the head of the party commanding the support of the majority of the members of the House of Assembly, which has 17 seats.[24] The other chamber of Parliament, the Senate, has eleven appointed members.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Lucia is a two-party parliamentary democracy. Three political parties participated in the 6 June 2016 General Election. Allen Chastanet of the United Workers Party won eleven of the seventeen seats.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Lucia maintains friendly relations with the major powers active in the Caribbean, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and France. Saint Lucia has no extant international disputes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Lucia is a full and participating member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), and La Francophonie. Saint Lucia is a Commonwealth Realm.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Lucia became the 152nd member of the United Nations on December 9, 1979.[26] As of January 2018, Cosmos Richardson, who presented his credentials on 22 February, 2017, was Saint Lucias representative to the United Nations.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Charter of the OAS was signed in Bogota in 1948 and was amended by several protocols which were named after the city and the year in which the protocol was signed, such as Managua in 1993 forming part of the name of the protocol.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Lucia entered the OAS system on 22 February, 1979.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a CARICOM Meeting, the representative of St. Lucia, John Compton signed The Double Taxation Relief (CARICOM) Treaty 1994 on 6 July 1994.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe representatives of seven CARICOM countries signed similar agreements at Sherbourne Conference Centre, St. Michael, Barbados.[30] The countries whose representatives signed the treaties in Barbados were Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis treaty covered taxes, residence, tax jurisdictions, capital gains, business profits, interest, dividends, royalties and other areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 June 2014, Saint Lucia signed a Model 1 agreement with the United States of America in relation to Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).[31] As of 1 September 2016, the status of the agreement is listed as \\"in force\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nPreceding the 2014 FATCA agreement is one which was entered into on 30 January 1987 between the United States of America and Saint Lucia according to Paragraph 2 of the Model 1 agreement, the purpose of which was to exchange tax Information.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Lucia has no regular military force. A Special Service Unit and the Coast Guard are both under the command of the Royal Saint Lucia Police.[33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe districts of the island, established by the French colonial government and continued by the British, are:\\r\\n\\r\\nAn additional area is the Forest Reserve Area Quarter (78.3?km2).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations categorizes Saint Lucia as a Small Island Developing State, a designation similar to a developing country with a few substantial differences due to Saint Lucia's island nature.[35][36] The services sector accounted for 82.8% of GDP, followed by industry and agriculture at 14.2% and 2.9%, respectively.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn educated workforce and improvements in roads, communications, water supply, sewerage, and port facilities have attracted foreign investment in tourism and in petroleum storage and transshipment. However, with the US, Canada, and Europe in recession, tourism declined by double digits in early 2009. The recent change in the European Union import preference regime and the increased competition from Latin American bananas have made economic diversification increasingly important in Saint Lucia.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Lucia has been able to attract foreign business and investment, especially in its offshore banking and tourism industries, which is Saint Lucia's main source of revenue. The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area, and the government is trying to revitalise the banana industry. Despite negative growth in 2011, economic fundamentals remain solid, and GDP growth should recover in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nInflation has been relatively low, averaging 5.5 percent between 2006 and 2008. Saint Lucia's currency is the East Caribbean Dollar (EC$), a regional currency shared among members of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECU). The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCL) issues the EC$, manages monetary policy, and regulates and supervises commercial banking activities in member countries. In 2003, the government began a comprehensive restructuring of the economy, including elimination of price controls and privatisation of the state banana company.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nTourism is vital to Saint Lucia's economy. Its economic importance is expected to continue to increase as the market for bananas becomes more competitive. Tourism tends to be more substantial during the dry season (January to April). Saint Lucia tends to be popular due to its tropical weather and scenery and its numerous beaches and resorts.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther tourist attractions include a drive-in volcano, Sulphur Springs (in Soufrire), the Botanical Gardens, the Majestic twin Peaks \\"The Pitons\\", a world heritage site, the rain forests, several options of boat trips, zip lining and Pigeon Island National Park, which is home to Fort Rodney, an old British military base.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of tourists visit Saint Lucia as part of a cruise. Most of their time tends to be spent in Castries, although Soufriere, Marigot Bay, Rodney Bay and Gros Islet are popular locations to visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current Minister of Tourism is Dominic Fedee, he has been in his role since 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Lucia reported a population of 165,595 in the 2010 national census.[7] In 2016, the United Nations Population Division estimated Saint Lucia's population at 178,015.[3] The country's population is evenly divided between urban and rural areas, with more than a third living in the capital, Castries.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite a high emigration rate the population is growing rapidly at about 1.2% per year. Migration from Saint Lucia is primarily to Anglophone countries, with the United Kingdom having almost 10,000 Saint Lucian-born citizens, and over 30,000 of Saint Lucian heritage. The second most popular destination for Saint Lucian migrs is the United States, where a combined (foreign and national-born Saint Lucians) almost 14,000 reside. Canada is home to a few thousand Saint Lucians.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Lucia's population is predominantly of African and mixed African-European descent, with a small Indo-Caribbean minority (3%). Members of other or unspecified ethnic groups, account for about 2% of the population.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official language is English.[1][41] Saint Lucian Creole French (Kwyl), which is colloquially referred to as Patois (\\"Patwa\\"), is spoken by 95% of the population.[42] This Antillean Creole is used in literature and music, and is gaining official acknowledgement.[42] As it developed during the early period of French colonisation, the creole is derived chiefly from French and West African languages, with some vocabulary from the Island Carib language and other sources. Saint Lucia is a member of La Francophonie.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nReligion in Saint Lucia (2015)[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 61.5% of the population is Roman Catholic, a legacy of French colonisation[according to whom?] of the island. Another 25.5% belong to Protestant denominations, (includes Seventh Day Adventist 10.4%, Pentecostal 8.9%, Baptist 2.2%, Anglican 1.6%, Church of God 1.5%, other Protestant 0.9%). Evangelicals comprise 2.3% of the population and 1.1% are Jehovah's Witnesses. In addition, about 1.9% of the population adheres to the Rastafari movement. Other religions include Islam, Bah' Faith, Judaism, and Buddhism.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic expenditure on health was at 3.3% of the GDP in 2004, whereas private expenditure was at 1.8%.[45] Health expenditure was at US$302 (PPP) per capita in 2004.[45] Infant mortality was at 12 per 100,000 births in 2005.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, Saint Lucia recorded 60 homicides, the highest in the country's history.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe culture of Saint Lucia has been influenced by African, East Indian, French, and English heritage. One of the secondary languages is Saint Lucian French Creole or Kwyl, spoken by almost all of the population.[1][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Lucia boasts the second highest ratio of Nobel laureates produced with respect to the total population of any sovereign country in the world. Two winners have come from Saint Lucia: Sir Arthur Lewis won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1979, and the poet Derek Walcott received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Lucian cultural festivals include La Rose and La Marguerite, the first representing a native Saint Lucian fraternal society known as the Order of the Rose that is fashioned in the mould of Rosicrucianism, and the second representing its traditional rival, the native Saint Lucian equivalent of Freemasonry known as the Order of the Marguerite.[46] References to their origins as versions of pre-existing external secret societies can be seen in a mural painted by Dunstan St Omer, depicting the holy trinity of Osiris, Horus, and Isis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest festival of the year is the Saint Lucia Jazz Festival.  Held in early May at multiple venues throughout the island, it draws visitors and musicians from around the world. The grand finale or main stage is held at the Pigeon Island[47] which is located to the North of the Island.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally in common with other Caribbean countries, Saint Lucia held a carnival before Lent. In 1999, the government moved Carnival to mid-July to avoid competing with the much larger Trinidad and Tobago carnival and so as to attract more overseas visitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2009, Saint Lucians commemorated the 150th Anniversary of West Indian Heritage on the island.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Windward Islands cricket team includes players from Saint Lucia and plays in the West Indies regional tournament. Daren Sammy became the first Saint Lucian to represent the West Indies on his debut in 2007, and since 2010 has captained the side.[48] In an international career spanning 2003 to 2008, and including 41 ODIs and one Test, Nadine George MBE became the first woman to score a Test century for the team.[49] Sammy and George were recognised by the Saint Lucian government as Sportsman of the Year and Sportswoman of the Year respectively for 2004.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor sailing enthusiasts, the annual Atlantic Rally for Cruisers (ARC) race begins in the Canary Islands and ends in Saint Lucia. The year 2015 marked the ARCs 30th year of existence. Every November, the race attracts over 200 boats and 1,200 people to sail across the Atlantic to the Caribbean.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether with Caribbean music genres such as Calypso, Soca, Dancehall, Reggae, Compas, Zouk, and Salsa, Saint Lucia has a strong indigenous folk music tradition. Each May since 1991, Saint Lucia has hosted an internationally renowned Jazz Festival.  In 2013, the festival was re-branded The Saint Lucia Jazz & Arts Festival which encompassed culture, visual art, alternative music, education, fashion, and food.\\r\\n\\r\\nDancing in Saint Lucia is inspired by Caribbean culture and enjoys an active following. A popular folk dance is the Kwadril.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Education Act provides for free and compulsory education in Saint Lucia from the ages of 5 to 15.[45][51] Public spending on education was at 5.8% among the 2002√ø2005 GDP.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Lucia has one university, the University of the West Indies Open Campus,[52] and a few medical schools √ø American International Medical University, International American University ? College of Medicine, Destiny University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, and the oldest of which is Spartan Health Sciences University.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Lucia's national dish is green figs and saltfish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island's cuisine is a unique blend of West African[citation needed], European (mainly British and French) and East Indian cuisine; this creates dynamic meal dishes such as macaroni pie, Stew chicken, rice and peas, fish broth or fish water, and soups packed full with fresh locally produced vegetables. Typical essential foodstuffs are potatoes, onions, celery, thyme, coconut milk, the very hot scotch bonnet peppers, flour, and cornmeal. All mainstream meat and poultry are eaten in St. Lucia; meat and seafood are normally stewed and browned to create a rich gravy sometimes served over ground provisions or rice. The island is also home to the famous fried dough, known by many as a bake or Johnny Cake. These bakes can be served with different sides, such as saltfish which is either sauted or lightly fried along with red, green peppers, onions, and seasoned well. This is the most common way for bake to be prepared, though it can also be served with meats such as stewed chicken or beef.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne popular Saint Lucian dessert is the pastry called a turnover. The pastry is made with sweetened coconut that is boiled with spices, some sugar, and whatever is satisfying. It is boiled until cooked to a light or dark brown colour; then the mixture is separated into various size portions placed on a rolled out piece of dough. The dough size may vary too depending on how much is desired, and lastly, it is baked in the oven until the colour of the turnover is nicely browned.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to Saint Lucia's Indo-Caribbean population, curry is very popular; however due to the blend of cooking styles, curry dishes have a distinct Caribbean twist. Roti is typically served as a fast food meal: the bread itself is very flat (sometimes very thin) and is wrapped around curried vegetables such as chickpeas and potato, seafood such as shrimp and conch, or meats such as chicken, beef, goat, and liver.\\r\\n\\r\\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people living in Saint Lucia face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT members of the population. Saint Lucia prohibits male-on-male sexual activity, punishing those found guilty with 10 years in jail. Saint Lucia was also the only UN member in the Americas to formally oppose the UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nToraille Waterfall - July 2016\\r\\n\\r\\nGros Piton seen from the Ladera Hotel restaurant √ø September 2007\\r\\n\\r\\nPetit Piton seen from the Ladera Hotel restaurant √ø December 2004\\r\\n\\r\\nSoufrire Bay √ø February 2006\\r\\n\\r\\nAerial view of resort √ø June 2006\\r\\n\\r\\nTypical sight in Canaries: houses on hills, June 2006\\r\\n\\r\\nSt Lucia beach √ø February 2006\\r\\n\\r\\nView from the Le Sport? resort √ø March 2006\\r\\n\\r\\nClick on a coloured area to see an article about English in that country or region","input":"What language do they speak on st lucia?"},{"output":"protecting the integrity of its trade","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nA trade union or trades union, also called a labour union (Canada) or labor union (US), is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve many common goals; such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, and attaining better wages, benefits (such as vacation, health care, and retirement), and working conditions through the increased bargaining power wielded by the creation of a monopoly of the workers.[1] The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \\"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\\".[2] This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnions may organize a particular section of skilled workers (craft unionism),[3] a cross-section of workers from various trades (general unionism), or attempt to organize all workers within a particular industry (industrial unionism). The agreements negotiated by a union are binding on the rank and file members and the employer and in some cases on other non-member workers. Trade unions traditionally have a constitution which details the governance of their bargaining unit and also have governance at various levels of government depending on the industry that binds them legally to their negotiations and functioning.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginating in Great Britain, trade unions became popular in many countries during the Industrial Revolution. Trade unions may be composed of individual workers, professionals, past workers, students, apprentices or the unemployed. Trade union density, or the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union, is highest in the Nordic countries.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the publication of the History of Trade Unionism (1894) by Sidney and Beatrice Webb, the predominant historical view is that a trade union \\"is a continuous association of wage earners for the purpose of maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment.\\"[2] Karl Marx described trade unions thus: \\"The value of labour-power constitutes the conscious and explicit foundation of the trade unions, whose importance for the [] working class can scarcely be overestimated. The trade unions aim at nothing less than to prevent the reduction of wages below the level that is traditionally maintained in the various branches of industry. That is to say, they wish to prevent the price of labour-power from falling below its value\\" (Capital V1, 1867, p.?1069).\\r\\n\\r\\nA modern definition by the Australian Bureau of Statistics states that a trade union is \\"an organization consisting predominantly of employees, the principal activities of which include the negotiation of rates of pay and conditions of employment for its members.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nYet historian R.A. Leeson, in United we Stand (1971), said:\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo conflicting views of the trade-union movement strove for ascendancy in the nineteenth century: one the defensive-restrictive guild-craft tradition passed down through journeymen's clubs and friendly societies, ... the other the aggressive-expansionist drive to unite all 'labouring men and women' for a 'different order of things'.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent historical research by Bob James in Craft, Trade or Mystery (2001) puts forward the view that trade unions are part of a broader movement of benefit societies, which includes medieval guilds, Freemasons, Oddfellows, friendly societies, and other fraternal organizations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 18th century economist Adam Smith noted the imbalance in the rights of workers in regards to owners (or \\"masters\\"). In The Wealth of Nations, Book I, chapter 8, Smith wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe rarely hear, it has been said, of the combination of masters, though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labor above their actual rate[.]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen workers combine, masters ... never cease to call aloud for the assistance of the civil magistrate, and the rigorous execution of those laws which have been enacted with so much severity against the combination of servants, labourers and journeymen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Smith noted, unions were illegal for many years in most countries, although Smith argued that it should remain illegal to fix wages or prices by employees or employers. There were severe penalties for attempting to organize unions, up to and including execution. Despite this, unions were formed and began to acquire political power, eventually resulting in a body of labour law that not only legalized organizing efforts, but codified the relationship between employers and those employees organized into unions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origins of trade unions can be traced back to 18th century Britain, where the rapid expansion of industrial society then taking place, drew women, children, rural workers and immigrants into the work force in large numbers and in new roles. This pool of unskilled and semi-skilled labour spontaneously organized in fits and starts throughout its beginnings,[2] and would later be an important arena for the development of trade unions. Trade unions have sometimes been seen as successors to the guilds of medieval Europe, though the relationship between the two is disputed, as the masters of the guilds employed workers (apprentices and journeymen) who were not allowed to organize.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrade unions and collective bargaining were outlawed from no later than the middle of the 14th century when the Ordinance of Labourers was enacted in the Kingdom of England. As collective bargaining and early worker unions grew with the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the government began to clamp down on what it saw as the danger of popular unrest at the time of the Napoleonic Wars. In 1799, the Combination Act was passed, which banned trade unions and collective bargaining by British workers. Although the unions were subject to often severe repression until 1824, they were already widespread in cities such as London. Workplace militancy had also manifested itself as Luddism and had been prominent in struggles such as the 1820 Rising in Scotland, in which 60,000 workers went on a general strike, which was soon crushed. Sympathy for the plight of the workers brought repeal of the acts in 1824, although the Combination Act 1825 severely restricted their activity.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 1810s, the first labour organizations to bring together workers of divergent occupations were formed. Possibly the first such union was the General Union of Trades, also known as the Philanthropic Society, founded in 1818 in Manchester. The latter name was to hide the organization's real purpose in a time when trade unions were still illegal.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first attempts at setting up a national general union were made in the 1820s and 30's. The National Association for the Protection of Labour was established in 1830 by John Doherty, after an apparently unsuccessful attempt to create a similar national presence with the National Union of Cotton-spinners. The Association quickly enrolled approximately 150 unions, consisting mostly of textile related unions, but also including mechanics, blacksmiths, and various others. Membership rose to between 10,000 and 20,000 individuals spread across the five counties of Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire within a year.[3] To establish awareness and legitimacy, the union started the weekly Voice of the People publication, having the declared intention \\"to unite the productive classes of the community in one common bond of union.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1834, the Welsh socialist Robert Owen established the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union. The organization attracted a range of socialists from Owenites to revolutionaries and played a part in the protests after the Tolpuddle Martyrs' case, but soon collapsed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore permanent trade unions were established from the 1850s, better resourced but often less radical. The London Trades Council was founded in 1860, and the Sheffield Outrages spurred the establishment of the Trades Union Congress in 1868, the first long-lived national trade union center. By this time, the existence and the demands of the trade unions were becoming accepted by liberal middle class opinion. In Principles of Political Economy (1871) John Stuart Mill wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nIf it were possible for the working classes, by combining among themselves, to raise or keep up the general rate of wages, it needs hardly be said that this would be a thing not to be punished, but to be welcomed and rejoiced at. Unfortunately the effect is quite beyond attainment by such means. The multitudes who compose the working class are too numerous and too widely scattered to combine at all, much more to combine effectually. If they could do so, they might doubtless succeed in diminishing the hours of labour, and obtaining the same wages for less work. They would also have a limited power of obtaining, by combination, an increase of general wages at the expense of profits.[9]\\r\\nTrade unions were finally legalized in 1872, after a Royal Commission on Trade Unions in 1867 agreed that the establishment of the organizations was to the advantage of both employers and employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis period also saw the growth of trade unions in other industrializing countries, especially the United States, Germany and France.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the first effective nationwide labour organization was the Knights of Labor, in 1869, which began to grow after 1880. Legalization occurred slowly as a result of a series of court decisions.[10] The Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions began in 1881 as a federation of different unions that did not directly enrol workers. In 1886, it became known as the American Federation of Labor or AFL.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Germany the Free Association of German Trade Unions was formed in 1897 after the conservative Anti-Socialist Laws of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck were repealed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn France, labour organization was illegal until 1884. The Bourse du Travail was founded in 1887 and merged with the Fdration nationale des syndicats (National Federation of Trade Unions) in 1895 to form the General Confederation of Labour (France).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prevalence of unions in various countries can be assessed using the measure \\"union density\\". The definition of union density is \\"the proportion of paid workers who are union members\\".[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrade union density figures are provided below for various countries:[13][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSupporters of unions, such as the ACTU or Australian Labor Party (ALP), often credit trade unions with leading the labour movement in the early 20th century. This generally sought to end child labour practices, improve worker safety, increase wages for both union workers and non-union workers, raise the entire society's standard of living, reduce the hours in a work week, provide public education for children, and bring other benefits to working class families.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelbourne Trades Hall was opened in 1859 with Trades and Labour Councils and Trades Halls opening in all cities and most regional towns in the following forty years. During the 1880s Trade unions developed among shearers, miners, and stevedores (wharf workers), but soon spread to cover almost all blue-collar jobs. Shortages of labour led to high wages for a prosperous skilled working class, whose unions demanded and got an eight-hour day and other benefits unheard of in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralia gained a reputation as \\"the working man's paradise.\\" Some employers tried to undercut the unions by importing Chinese labour. This produced a reaction which led to all the colonies restricting Chinese and other Asian immigration. This was the foundation of the White Australia Policy. The \\"Australian compact\\", based around centralised industrial arbitration, a degree of government assistance particularly for primary industries, and White Australia, was to continue for many years before gradually dissolving in the second half of the 20th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1870s and 1880s, the growing trade union movement began a series of protests against foreign labour. Their arguments were that Asians and Chinese took jobs away from white men, worked for \\"substandard\\" wages, lowered working conditions and refused unionisation.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nObjections to these arguments came largely from wealthy land owners in rural areas.[17] It was argued that without Asiatics to work in the tropical areas of the Northern Territory and Queensland, the area would have to be abandoned.[18] Despite these objections to restricting immigration, between 1875 and 1888 all Australian colonies enacted legislation which excluded all further Chinese immigration.[18] Asian immigrants already residing in the Australian colonies were not expelled and retained the same rights as their Anglo and Southern compatriots.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Barton Government which came to power following the first elections to the Commonwealth parliament in 1901 was formed by the Protectionist Party with the support of the Australian Labor Party. The support of the Labor Party was contingent upon restricting non-white immigration, reflecting the attitudes of the Australian Workers Union and other labour organisations at the time, upon whose support the Labor Party was founded.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith 65% of the workers belonging to a union Belgium is a country with one of the highest percentages of labour union membership. Only the Scandinavian countries have a higher labour union density. The biggest union with around 1.7 million members is the Christian democrat Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (ACV-CSC) which was founded in 1904.[19] The origins of the union can be traced back to the \\"Anti-Socialist Cotton Workers Union\\" that was founded in 1886.[20] The second biggest union is the socialist General Federation of Belgian Labour (ABVV-FGTB) which has a membership of more than 1.5 million.[21] The ABVV-FGTB traces its origins to 1857, when the first Belgian union was founded in Ghent by a group of weavers. The socialist union, in its current form, was founded in 1898. The third 'big' union in Belgium is the liberal General Confederation of Liberal Trade Unions of Belgium (ACLVB-CGSLB) which is relatively small in comparison to the first two with a little under 290 thousand members.[22] The ACLVB-CGSLB was founded in 1920 in an effort to unite the many small liberal unions. Back then the liberal union was known as the \\"Nationale Centrale der Liberale Vakbonden van Belgi?\\". In 1930, the ACLVB-CGSLB adopted its current name.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides these \\"big three\\" there is a long list of smaller unions, some more influential then others. These smaller unions tend to specialize in one profession or economic sector. Next to these specialized unions there is also the Neutral and Independent Union that reject the pillarization that, according to them, the \\"big three\\" represent. There is also a small Flemish nationalist union that exists only in the Flemish-speaking part of Belgium, called the Vlaamse Solidaire Vakbond. The last Belgian union worth mentioning is the very small, but highly active anarchist union called the Vrije Bond.\\r\\n\\r\\nLabour unions have existed in Canada since the early 1800s. There is a record of skilled tradesmen in the Maritimes having a union organization during the War of 1812. Canadian unionism had early ties with Britain. Tradesmen who came from Britain brought traditions of the British trade union movement, and many British unions had branches in Canada. Canadian unionism ties with the United States eventually replaced those with Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollective bargaining was first recognized in 1945, following a strike by the United Auto Workers at the General Motors' plant in Oshawa, Ontario.\\r\\nJustice Ivan Rand issued a landmark legal decision following a strike in Windsor, Ontario, involving 17,000 Ford workers. He granted the union the compulsory check-off of union dues. Rand ruled that all workers in a bargaining unit benefit from a union-negotiated contract. Therefore, he reasoned they must pay union dues, although they do not have to join the union.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe post-World War II era also saw an increased pattern of unionization in the public service. Teachers, nurses, social workers, professors and cultural workers (those employed in museums, orchestras and art galleries) all sought private-sector collective bargaining rights. The Canadian Labour Congress was founded in 1956 as the national trade union center for Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1970s the federal government came under intense pressures to curtail labour cost and inflation. In 1975, the Liberal government of Pierre Trudeau introduced mandatory price and wage controls. Under the new law, wages increases were monitored and those ruled to be unacceptably high were rolled back by the government.\\r\\n\\r\\nPressures on unions continued into the 1980s and '90's. Private sector unions faced plant closures in many manufacturing industries and demands to reduce wages and increase productivity. Public sector unions came under attack by federal and provincial governments as they attempted to reduce spending, reduce taxes and balance budgets. Legislation was introduced in many jurisdictions reversing union collective bargaining rights, and many jobs were lost to contractors.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nProminent domestic unions in Canada include ACTRA, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, the Canadian Union of Public Employees, the Public Service Alliance of Canada, the National Union of Public and General Employees, and Unifor. International unions active in Canada include the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, United Automobile Workers, United Food and Commercial Workers, and United Steelworkers.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil around 1990 Colombian trade unions were among the strongest in Latin America.[25] However, the 1980s expansion of paramilitarism in Colombia saw trade union leaders and members increasingly targeted for assassination, and as a result Colombia has been the most dangerous country in the world for trade unionists for several decades.[26][27][28] Between 2000 and 2010 Colombia accounted for 63.12% of trade unionists murdered globally.[29] According to the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) there were 2832 murders of trade unionists between 1 January 1986 and 30 April 2010,[29] meaning that \\"on average, men and women trade unionists in Colombia have been killed at the rate of one every three days over the last 23 years.\\"[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Costa Rica, trade unions first appeared in the late 1800s to support workers in a variety of urban and industrial jobs, such as railroad builders and craft tradesmen.[31] After facing violent repression, such as during the 1934 United Fruit Strike, unions gained more power following the 1948 Costa Rican Civil War.[31] Today, Costa Rican unions are strongest in the public sector, including the fields of education and medicine, but also have a strong presence in the agricultural sector.[31] In general, Costa Rican unions support government regulation of the banking, medical, and education fields, as well as improved wages and working conditions.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrade unions in Germany have a history reaching back to the German revolution in 1848, and still play an important role in the German economy and society. In 1875 the SPD, the Social Democratic Party of Germany, which is one of the biggest political parties in Germany, supported the forming of unions in Germany.[33] The most important labour organisation is the German Confederation of Trade Unions (Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund √ø DGB), which represents more than 6 million people (31 December 2011) and is the umbrella association of several single trade unions for special economic sectors. The DBG is not the only Union Organization that represents the working trade. There are smaller organizations, such as the CGB, which is a Christian-based confederation, that represent over 1.5 million people.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn India, the Trade Union movement is generally divided on political lines. According to provisional statistics from the Ministry of Labour, trade unions had a combined membership of 24,601,589 in 2002. As of 2008, there are 11 Central Trade Union Organisations (CTUO) recognized by the Ministry of Labour.[35] The forming of these unions was a big deal in India. It led to a big push for more regulatory laws which gave workers a lot more power.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nA trade union with nearly 2,000,000 members is the Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) which protects the rights of Indian women working in the informal economy. In addition to the protection of rights, SEWA educates, mobilizes, finances, and exalts their members' trades.[37] Multiple other organizations represent workers. These organizations are formed upon different political groups. These different groups allow different groups of people with different political views to join a Union.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nLabour unions emerged in Japan in the second half of the Meiji period as the country underwent a period of rapid industrialization.[39] Until 1945, however, the labour movement remained weak, impeded by lack of legal rights,[40] anti-union legislation,[39] management-organised factory councils, and political divisions between cooperative and radical unionists.[41] In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the US Occupation authorities initially encouraged the formation of independent unions.[40] Legislation was passed that enshrined the right to organise,[42] and membership rapidly rose to 5 million by February 1947.[40] The organisation rate, however, peaked at 55.8% in 1949 and subsequently declined to 18.2% (2006).[43] The labour movement went through a process of reorganisation from 1987 to 1991[44] from which emerged the present configuration of three major labour union federations, Rengo, Zenroren, and Zenrokyo, along with other smaller national union organisations.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the 1990s, unions in Mexico had been historically part of a state institutional system. From 1940 until the 1980s, worldwide spread of neo-liberalism through the Washington Consensus, the Mexican unions did not operate independently, but instead as part of a state institutional system, largely controlled by the ruling party.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring these 40 years, the primary aim of the labour unions was not to benefit the workers, but to carry out the state's economic policy under their cosy relationship with the ruling party. This economic policy, which peaked in the 1950s and 60's with the so-called \\"Mexican Miracle\\", saw rising incomes and improved standards of living but the primary beneficiaries were the wealthy.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, Mexico began adhering to Washington Consensus policies, selling off state industries such as railroad and telecommunications to private industries. The new owners had an antagonistic attitude towards unions, which, accustomed to comfortable relationships with the state, were not prepared to fight back. A movement of new unions began to emerge under a more independent model, while the former institutionalized unions had become very corrupt, violent, and led by gangsters. From the 1990s onwards, this new model of independent unions prevailed, a number of them represented by the National Union of Workers / Uni‹án Nacional de Trabajadores.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent old institutions like the Oil Workers Union and the National Education Workers' Union (Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educaci‹án, or SNTE) are examples of how the use of government benefits are not being applied to improve the quality in the investigation of the use of oil or the basic education in Mexico as long as their leaders show publicly that they are living wealthily. With 1.4 million members, the teachers' union is Latin America's largest; half of Mexico's government employees are teachers. It controls school curriculums, and all teacher appointments. Until recently, retiring teachers routinely \\"gave\\" their lifelong appointment to a relative or \\"sell\\" it for anywhere in between $4,700 and $11,800.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrade unions (Danish: Fagforeninger, Swedish: Fackf?reningar) have a long tradition in Scandinavian society. Beginning in the mid-19th century, they today have a large impact on the nature of employment and workers' rights in many of the Nordic countries. One of the largest trade unions in Sweden is the Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions, (LO, Landsorganisationen), incorporating unions such as the Swedish Metal Workers' Union (IF Metall = Industrifacket Metall), the Swedish Electricians' Union (Svenska Elektrikerf?rbundet) and the Swedish Municipality Workers' Union (Svenska Kommunalarbetaref?rbundet, abbreviated Kommunal). One of the aims of IF Metall is to transform jobs into \\"good jobs\\", also called \\"developing jobs\\".[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the world's highest rates of union membership are in the Scandinavian countries. In 2010, the percentage of workers belonging to a union (labour union density) was 68.3% in Sweden and 54.8% in Norway, while it was 34.9% in Ireland and 18.4% in Germany.[48] Excluding full-time students working part-time, Swedish union density was 69% in 2015-2017.[49] In all the Nordic countries with a Ghent systemSweden,[50] Denmark and Finlandunion density is about 70%. The considerably raised membership fees of Swedish union unemployment funds implemented by the new center-right government in January 2007 caused large drops in membership in both unemployment funds and trade unions. From 2006 to 2008, union density declined by six percentage points: from 77% to 71%.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nModerate New Model Unions dominated the union movement from the mid-19th century and where trade unionism was stronger than the political labour movement until the formation and growth of the Labour Party in the early years of the 20th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrade unionism in the United Kingdom was a major factor in some of the economic crises during the 1960s and the 1970s, culminating in the \\"Winter of Discontent\\" of late 1978 and early 1979, when a significant percentage of the nation's public sector workers went on strike. By this stage, some 12,000,000 workers in the United Kingdom were trade union members. However, the election of the Conservative Party led by Margaret Thatcher at the general election in May 1979, at the expense of Labour's James Callaghan, saw substantial trade union reform which saw the level of strikes fall. The level of trade union membership also fell sharply in the 1980s, and continued falling for most of the 1990s. The long decline of most of the industries in which manual trade unions were strong?√ø e.g. steel, coal, printing, the docks?√ø was one of the causes of this loss of trade union members.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011 there were 6,135,126 members in TUC-affiliated unions, down from a peak of 12,172,508 in 1980. Trade union density was 14.1% in the private sector and 56.5% in the public sector.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nLabour unions are legally recognized as representatives of workers in many industries in the United States. In the United States, trade unions were formed based on power with the people, not over the people like the government at the time.[54] Their activity today centres on collective bargaining over wages, benefits and working conditions for their membership, and on representing their members in disputes with management over violations of contract provisions. Larger unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and supporting endorsed candidates at the state and federal level.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost unions in America are aligned with one of two larger umbrella organizations: the AFL-CIO created in 1955, and the Change to Win Federation which split from the AFL-CIO in 2005. Both advocate policies and legislation on behalf of workers in the United States and Canada, and take an active role in politics. The AFL-CIO is especially concerned with global trade issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, the percentage of workers belonging to a union in the United States (or total labour union \\"density\\") was 11.4%, compared to 18.3% in Japan, 27.5% in Canada and 70% in Finland.[55] Union membership in the private sector has fallen under 7%[56] √ø levels not seen since 1932. Unions allege that employer-incited opposition has contributed to this decline in membership.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most prominent unions are among public sector employees such as teachers, police and other non-managerial or non-executive federal, state, county and municipal employees. Members of unions are disproportionately older, male and residents of the Northeast, the Midwest, and California.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnion workers in the private sector average 10-30% higher pay than non-union in America after controlling for individual, job, and labour market characteristics.[58]  Because of their inherently governmental function, public sector workers are paid the same regardless of union affiliation or non-affiliation after controlling for individual, job, and labour market characteristics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economist Joseph Stiglitz has asserted that, \\"Strong unions have helped to reduce inequality, whereas weaker unions have made it easier for CEOs, sometimes working with market forces that they have helped shape, to increase it.\\" The decline in unionization since the Second World War in the United States has been associated with a pronounced rise in income and wealth inequality and, since 1967, with loss of middle class income.[59][60][61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Association of Vatican Lay Workers represents lay employees in the Vatican.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnions may organize a particular section of skilled workers (craft unionism, traditionally found in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US[3]), a cross-section of workers from various trades (general unionism, traditionally found in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, the UK and the US), or attempt to organize all workers within a particular industry (industrial unionism, found in Australia, Canada, Germany, Finland, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US). These unions are often divided into \\"locals\\", and united in national federations. These federations themselves will affiliate with Internationals, such as the International Trade Union Confederation. However, in Japan, union organization is slightly different due to the presence of enterprise unions, i.e. unions that are specific to a specific plant or company. These enterprise unions, however, join industry-wide federations which in turn are members of Rengo, the Japanese national trade union confederation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Western Europe, professional associations often carry out the functions of a trade union. In these cases, they may be negotiating for white-collar or professional workers, such as physicians, engineers or teachers. Typically such trade unions refrain from politics or pursue a more liberal politics than their blue-collar counterparts.\\r\\n\\r\\nA union may acquire the status of a \\"juristic person\\" (an artificial legal entity), with a mandate to negotiate with employers for the workers it represents. In such cases, unions have certain legal rights, most importantly the right to engage in collective bargaining with the employer (or employers) over wages, working hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. The inability of the parties to reach an agreement may lead to industrial action, culminating in either strike action or management lockout, or binding arbitration. In extreme cases, violent or illegal activities may develop around these events.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other circumstances, unions may not have the legal right to represent workers, or the right may be in question. This lack of status can range from non-recognition of a union to political or criminal prosecution of union activists and members, with many cases of violence and deaths having been recorded historically.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnions may also engage in broader political or social struggle. Social Unionism encompasses many unions that use their organizational strength to advocate for social policies and legislation favourable to their members or to workers in general. As well, unions in some countries are closely aligned with political parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnions are also delineated by the service model and the organizing model. The service model union focuses more on maintaining worker rights, providing services, and resolving disputes. Alternately, the organizing model typically involves full-time union organizers, who work by building up confidence, strong networks, and leaders within the workforce; and confrontational campaigns involving large numbers of union members. Many unions are a blend of these two philosophies, and the definitions of the models themselves are still debated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Britain, the perceived left-leaning nature of trade unions has resulted in the formation of a reactionary right-wing trade union called Solidarity which is supported by the far-right BNP. In Denmark, there are some newer apolitical \\"discount\\" unions who offer a very basic level of services, as opposed to the dominating Danish pattern of extensive services and organizing.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, in several European countries (e.g. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Switzerland), religious unions have existed for decades. These unions typically distanced themselves from some of the doctrines of orthodox Marxism, such as the preference of atheism and from rhetoric suggesting that employees' interests always are in conflict with those of employers. Some of these Christian unions have had some ties to centrist or conservative political movements and some do not regard strikes as acceptable political means for achieving employees' goals.[3] In Poland, the biggest trade union Solidarity emerged as an anti-communist movement with religious nationalist overtones[66] and today it supports the right-wing Law and Justice party.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough their political structure and autonomy varies widely, union leaderships are usually formed through democratic elections.[68] Some research, such as that conducted by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training,[69] argues that unionized workers enjoy better conditions and wages than those who are not unionized.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies that employ workers with a union generally operate on one of several models:\\r\\n\\r\\nAn EU case concerning Italy stated that, \\"The principle of trade union freedom in the Italian system implies recognition of the right of the individual not to belong to any trade union (\\"negative\\" freedom of association/trade union freedom), and the unlawfulness of discrimination liable to cause harm to non-unionized employees.\\"[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Britain, previous to this EU jurisprudence, a series of laws introduced during the 1980s by Margaret Thatcher's government restricted closed and union shops. All agreements requiring a worker to join a union are now illegal. In the United States, the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 outlawed the closed shop.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, the European Court of Human Rights found Danish closed-shop agreements to be in breach of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It was stressed that Denmark and Iceland were among a limited number of contracting states that continue to permit the conclusion of closed-shop agreements.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnion law varies from country to country, as does the function of unions. For example, German and Dutch unions have played a greater role in management decisions through participation in corporate boards and co-determination than have unions in the United States.[72] Moreover, in the United States, collective bargaining is most commonly undertaken by unions directly with employers, whereas in Austria, Denmark, Germany or Sweden, unions most often negotiate with employers associations.\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning labour market regulation in the EU, Gold (1993)[73] and Hall (1994)[74] have identified three distinct systems of labour market regulation, which also influence the role that unions play:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States takes a more laissez-faire approach, setting some minimum standards but leaving most workers' wages and benefits to collective bargaining and market forces. Thus, it comes closest to the above Anglo-Saxon model. Also, the Eastern European countries that have recently entered into the EU come closest to the Anglo-Saxon model.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, in Germany, the relation between individual employees and employers is considered to be asymmetrical. In consequence, many working conditions are not negotiable due to a strong legal protection of individuals. However, the German flavor or works legislation has as its main objective to create a balance of power between employees organized in unions and employers organized in employers associations. This allows much wider legal boundaries for collective bargaining, compared to the narrow boundaries for individual negotiations. As a condition to obtain the legal status of a trade union, employee associations need to prove that their leverage is strong enough to serve as a counterforce in negotiations with employers. If such an employees association is competing against another union, its leverage may be questioned by unions and then evaluated in a court trial. In Germany, only very few professional associations obtained the right to negotiate salaries and working conditions for their members, notably the medical doctors association Marburger Bund and the pilots association Vereinigung Cockpit. The engineers association Verein Deutscher Ingenieure does not strive to act as a union, as it also represents the interests of engineering businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the classification listed above, unions' relations with political parties vary. In many countries unions are tightly bonded, or even share leadership, with a political party intended to represent the interests of the working class. Typically this is a left-wing, socialist, or social democratic party, but many exceptions exist, including some of the aforementioned Christian unions.[3] In the United States, trade unions are almost always aligned with the Democratic Party with a few exceptions. For example, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters has supported Republican Party candidates on a number of occasions and the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) endorsed Ronald Reagan in 1980. In Britain trade union movement's relationship with the Labour Party frayed as party leadership embarked on privatization plans at odds with what unions see as the worker's interests. However, it has strengthened once more after the Labour party's election of Ed Miliband, who beat his brother David Miliband to become leader of the party after Ed secured the trade union votes. Additionally, in the past, there was a group known as the Conservative Trade Unionists, or CTU, formed of people who sympathized with right wing Tory policy but were Trade Unionists.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, the Republic of Korea has regulated collective bargaining by requiring employers to participate, but collective bargaining has only been legal if held in sessions before the lunar new year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest trade union federation in the world is the Brussels-based International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), which has approximately 309 affiliated organizations in 156 countries and territories, with a combined membership of 166 million. The ITUC is a federation of national trade union centres, such as the AFL-CIO in the United States and the Trades Union Congress in the United Kingdom. Other global trade union organizations include the World Federation of Trade Unions.\\r\\n\\r\\nNational and regional trade unions organizing in specific industry sectors or occupational groups also form global union federations, such as Union Network International, the International Transport Workers Federation, the International Federation of Journalists, the International Arts and Entertainment Alliance or Public Services International.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrade unions have been accused of benefiting insider workers, those having secure jobs, at the cost of outsider workers, consumers of the goods or services produced and the shareholders of the unionized business.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the outsourcing of labour to Asia, Latin America, and Africa has been partially driven by increasing costs of union partnership, which gives other countries a comparative advantage in labour, making it more profitable to purchase disorganized, low-wage labour from these regions.[76] Milton Friedman, economist and advocate of laissez-faire capitalism, sought to show that unionization produces higher wages (for the union members) at the expense of fewer jobs, and that, if some industries are unionized while others are not, wages will tend to decline in non-unionized industries.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, several studies have emphasized so-called revitalization strategies where trade unions attempt to better represent labour market outsiders, such as the unemployed and precarious workers. Thus, for instance, trade unions in both Nordic and southern European countries have devised collective bargaining agreements that improved the conditions of temporary agency workers.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral sources of current news exist about the trade union movement in the world. These include LabourStart and the official website of the international trade union movement Global Unions. A source of international news about unions is RadioLabour which provides daily (Monday to Friday) news reports.\\r\\n\\r\\nLabor Notes is the largest circulation cross-union publication remaining in the United States. It reports news and analysis about union activity or problems facing the labour movement. Another source of union news is the Workers Independent News, a news organization providing radio articles to independent and syndicated radio shows in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n...the United States Supreme Court again undertook the delicate task of defining the antitrust exemption granted labor unions by section six of the Clayton Act.\\r\\nBenjamin Brown, \\"Trade Unions, Strikes, and the Renewal of Halakhic Labor Law: Ideologies in the Rulings of Rabbis Kook, Uziel, and Feinstein\\"  [5]","input":"What are the main objectives of labor unions?"},{"output":"There are four units, including three in Municipality of Skagway Borough, Alaska and a fourth in the Pioneer Square National Historic District in Seattle, Washington.","context":"Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park is a national historical park operated by the National Park Service that seeks to commemorate the Klondike Gold Rush of the late 1890s. Though the gold fields that were the ultimate goal of the stampeders lay in the Yukon Territory, the park comprises staging areas for the trek there and the routes leading in its direction. There are four units, including three in Municipality of Skagway Borough, Alaska and a fourth in the Pioneer Square National Historic District in Seattle, Washington.\\r\\nA fuller appreciation of the story of the Klondike Gold Rush requires exploration and discovery on both sides of the Canada√øUnited States border. National historic sites in Whitehorse and Dawson City, Yukon, as well as in British Columbia, complete the story. In 1998, Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park joined with Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site, Dawson Historical Complex National Historic Site, and \\"The Thirty Mile\\" stretch of the Yukon River to create Klondike Gold Rush International Historical Park, allowing for an integrated binational experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Skagway unit includes much of the historic downtown such as buildings owned and restored by NPS and others, some leased even today for ordinary commercial purposes to recreate the city's bustling activity. The visitor center in Skagway is located in railroad depot building at Second and Broadway and is a good place to begin tours either led by a ranger or self-guided. Junior rangers can plan their activities further and earn their badges further up Broadway at the Pantheon Saloon.[4]\\r\\nThe park includes as one of its units the White Pass Trail. White Pass is a mountain pass that leads from Skagway to the headwaters of the Yukon River in British Columbia. The trail was one of the two main routes used by prospectors to get from Skagway over the Boundary Range on their way to the gold fields in the Yukon. The White Pass and Yukon Route railway, completed in 1900, used White Pass to bring prospectors from Skagway to Whitehorse, Yukon.\\r\\nThe historic townsite of Dyea is also part of the historical park, from which the Chilkoot Trail leaves and runs to Bennett Lake in British Columbia. From there, prospectors generally rafted to Dawson City, Yukon. The trail center in Skagway, operated by both the National Park Service and Parks Canada, has information regarding current conditions along the Chilkoot Trail as it travels through both countries. A permit is required to hike the 33-mile (53-kilometer) trail.\\r\\nAn integral part of the park is the Visitor's Center in Seattle, Washington, in the Pioneer Square National Historic District. It functions as an interpretive center and museum, and also has information on how to visit the Skagway units of the park. It opened June 2, 1979,[17] and was originally located in the Union Trust Annex (built 1902),[18] across Main Street from Occidental Park.[19]\\r\\nThe Seattle unit is now located in an 1889 building, the Cadillac Hotel at 319 Second Avenue South. The Cadillac Hotel building was a major point of outfitting and departure during the gold rush stampede. Severely damaged in the 2001 Nisqually earthquake, it was rehabilitated 2004√ø2005 as home to the Seattle unit of the park, and was opened and dedicated on June 26, 2006.[20][21] The National Park Travelers Club held its 2014 convention at Klondike Gold Rush.[22]\\r\\nIn 1969, the United States and Canadian governments jointly declared their intention to make Chilkoot Trail a component of a Klondike Gold Rush International Historic Park. The U.S. portion was eventually established in 1976 as part of Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park.\\r\\nThe Canadian portion of the trail became Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site, one of several sites in the national park system associated with the Klondike. But it was not until the centennial of the gold rush, in 1998, that the dream of an international park was realized, when Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park and Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site were declared to constitute jointly the Klondike Gold Rush International Historical Park.[23] Their previous legal names were retained, while the new name reflected co-operative management between the two park services, and the formalization of relations which had in fact been going on for years.\\r\\nBeyond this, joint resolutions recognize the relevance to gold rush interpretation of the Dawson Historical Complex National Historic Site, in Dawson City, Yukon, which includes significant buildings. Parks Canada identifies Dawson City as a unit of the international park,[24] as well as \\"The Thirty Mile\\" section of the Yukon River, a national heritage river from Lake Laberge to the Teslin River. The river has been recognized by both countries as part of their joint interpretative efforts.[25]\\r\\nBeyond the formal international historical park are national historic sites in Yukon concerned with the gold rush:","input":"Where is klondike gold rush national historical park?"},{"output":"from the dark appearance of the red spruce and Fraser fir trees that form a spruce-fir forest on the upper slopes which contrasts with the brown (during winter) or lighter green (during the growing season) appearance of the deciduous trees at lower elevations","context":"The Black Mountains are a mountain range in western North Carolina, in the southeastern United States. They are part of the Blue Ridge Province of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. The Blacks are the highest mountains in the Eastern United States. The range takes its name from the dark appearance of the red spruce and Fraser fir trees that form a spruce-fir forest on the upper slopes which contrasts with the brown (during winter) or lighter green (during the growing season) appearance of the deciduous trees at lower elevations. The Eastern Continental Divide, which runs along the eastern Blue Ridge crest, intersects the southern tip of the Black Mountain range.\\r\\nThe Black Mountains are home to Mount Mitchell State Park, which protects the range's highest summit and adjacent summits in the north-central section of the range. Much of the range is also protected by the Pisgah National Forest. The Blue Ridge Parkway passes along the range's southern section, and is connected to the summit of Mount Mitchell by North Carolina Highway 128. The Black Mountains are mostly located in Yancey County, although the range's southern and western extremes are part of Buncombe County.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Black Mountains form a J-shaped semicircle that opens to the northwest. The Blacks rise southward from the Little Crabtree Creek Valley in the north to the steep 6,327-foot (1,928?m) summit of Celo Knob. A few miles south of Celo, the crest drops to 5,700 feet (1,700?m) at Deep Gap before rising steeply again to the summit of Potato Hill in the north-central section of the range. The crest continues southward across the north-central section, which contains 6 of the 10 highest summits in the eastern United States, including the highest, Mount Mitchell, and the second-highest, Mount Craig. South of Mount Mitchell, the crest drops to just under 6,000 feet (1,800?m) at Stepp's Gap before rising again to 6,520 feet (1,990?m) at the summit of Mount Gibbes. On the slopes of Potato Knob, just south of Clingmans Peak, the Black Mountain crest bends northwestward across Blackstock Knob before dropping again to 5,320 feet (1,620?m) at Balsam Gap, where it intersects the Great Craggy Mountains to the southwest. The crest then turns northward across Point Misery and Big Butt before descending to the Cane River Valley.\\r\\nThe northern section of the Black Mountains are drained by the Cane River to the west and the South Toe River to the east, both of which are part of the upper Nolichucky River watershed. The southwestern part of the range is drained by the upper French Broad River which, like the Nolichucky, is west of the Eastern Continental Divide and thus its waters eventually wind up in the Gulf of Mexico. A few of the streams in the southeastern section of the range are part of the Catawba River watershed, and are thus east of the Eastern Continental Divide.[2]\\r\\nWhile the crest of the Black Mountain range is just 15 miles (24?km) long, within these fifteen miles are 18 peaks climbing to at least 6300 feet (1900 meters) above sea level. The Black Mountains rise prominently above the surrounding lower terrain. This is particularly noticeable from the range's eastern side, which rises over 4500 feet (1375 meters) above the Catawba River Valley and Interstate 40, providing some impressive mountain scenery.\\r\\nThe Black Mountains consist primarily of Precambrian gneiss and schists formed over a billion years ago from primordial sea sediments. The mountains themselves were formed roughly 200-400 million years ago during the Alleghenian orogeny, when the collision of two continental plates thrust what is now the Appalachian Mountains upward to form a large plateau. Weathering and minor geologic events in subsequent periods carved out the mountains.[3]\\r\\nDuring the last Ice Age, approximately 20,000-16,000 years ago, glaciers did not advance into Southern Appalachia, but the change in temperatures drastically changed the forests in the region. A tree-less tundra likely existed in the Black Mountains and surrounding mountains in elevations above 3,500 feet (1,100?m). Spruce-fir forests dominated the lower elevations during this period, while hardwoods \\"fled\\" to warmer refuges in the coastal plains. As the ice sheets began retreating 16,000 years ago and temperatures started to rise, the hardwoods returned to the river valleys and lower slopes, and the spruce-fir forest retreated to the higher elevations.[4] Today, the spruce-fir forest atop the Black Mountains is one of ten or so spruce-fir \\"islands\\" remaining in the mountains of Southern Appalachia.[5]\\r\\nThe forests of the Black Mountains are typically divided into three zones based on altitude: the spruce-fir forest, the northern hardwoods, and the Appalachian hardwoods. The southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest (sometimes called the \\"boreal\\" or \\"Canadian\\" forest) is dominated by red spruce and Fraser fir, and coats the elevations above 5,500 feet (1,700?m). The northern hardwoods, which consist primarily of beech, yellow birch, and buckeye, thrive between 4,500 feet (1,400?m) and 5,500 feet (1,700?m). The more diverse Appalachian hardwoods, which include yellow poplar and various species of hickory, oak, and maple, dominate the slopes and stream valleys below 3,000 feet (910?m). Pine forests, consisting chiefly of Table Mountain pine, pitch pine, and Virginia pine, are found on the drier south-facing slopes.[6] mountain paper birch, which is rare in North Carolina, grows sporadically on the slopes of Mount Mitchell.[7]\\r\\nWildlife in the Black Mountains is typical of the Appalachian highlands. Mammals include black bears, white-tailed deer, raccoons, river otters, minks, bobcats, and the endangered northern flying squirrel. Bird species include the wild turkey, the northern saw-whet owl, and the pileated woodpecker, although peregrine falcons and various species of hawk are known to nest in the upper elevations. Brook trout, which are more typical of northern latitudes, are found in the streams at the base of the Black Mountains.[8][9]\\r\\nNative Americans have likely been hunting in the Black Mountains for thousands of years. At Swannanoa Gap, just south of the range, archaeologists have uncovered evidence of habitation dating to the Archaic period (8000-1000 BC), the Woodland period (1000 BC - 1000 AD), and the Mississippian period (c. 900-1600 AD). The Mississippian-period village of Joara was located near the town of Morganton to the southeast.[10]\\r\\nThe Hernando de Soto expedition, which was attempting to travel from the Florida coast to the Pacific Ocean, is believed to have passed through the North Toe River valley in May 1540, and thus would have included the first Europeans to see the Black Mountains.[11] An expedition led by Juan Pardo probably crossed the Blue Ridge at Swannanoa Gap in October 1567. Both expeditions spent considerable time at Joara.[12]\\r\\nFor much of the 18th century, the Black Mountains were a hunting ground on the eastern fringe of Cherokee territory. By 1785, however, the Cherokee had signed away ownership of the Black Mountains to the United States, and Euro-American settlers moved into the Cane and South Toe valleys shortly thereafter. The early settlers farmed the river valleys and sold animal furs, ginseng, tobacco, liquor, and excess crops at markets in nearby Asheville. The early farmers also brought large herds of cattle and hogs, which thrived in the valleys and mountain areas.[13]\\r\\nIn 1789, French botanist Andr Michaux, who had been sent to America by the King of France to collect exotic plant specimens, made his first excursion into the Southern Appalachian Mountains, which included a brief trip to the Blacks. Michaux returned to the Blacks in August 1794, and collected several plant specimens that thrive above 4,000 feet (1,200?m). Michaux's findings, published in the early 19th century, were among the first to bring attention to the diversity and significance of the plants of Southern Appalachia.[14]\\r\\nIn the early 19th century, Mount Washington in New Hampshire was believed to be the highest summit in the Eastern United States, an assumption many North Carolinians began to question in light of Michaux's findings (Michaux believed that Grandfather Mountain was the highest). In 1835, the state dispatched North Carolina professor Elisha Mitchell (1793√ø1857) into the western part of the state to measure the elevation of Grandfather, the Roan Highlands, and the Black Mountains. Using a crude barometer, Mitchell gained measurements for Grandfather and Roan with apparent ease, although he struggled to discern which of the Blacks was the highest. After measuring Celo Knob, Mitchell descended to the Cane River Valley to obtain advice from the valley's residents. Two local guides (one of whom was William Wilson, a cousin of the later renowned mountain guide, Thomas \\"Big Tom\\" Wilson) led Mitchell up a bear trail to what they believed to be the highest summit. Although exactly which mountain they summited has long been disputed, it was likely Mount Gibbes, Clingmans Peak, or Mount Mitchell. Nevertheless, Mitchell obtained a measurement of 6,476 feet (1,974?m) (later determined to be too low), placing the Blacks at a higher elevation than Mount Washington and thus the highest in the Eastern United States.[15]\\r\\nMitchell returned to the Blacks in 1838 and 1844, gaining a higher measurement on each trip. Several surveyors visited the Blacks in subsequent years, including Nehemiah Blackstock (1794√ø1880) in 1845, Arnold Guyot (1807√ø1884) in 1849, and Robert Gibbes in the early 1850s. As early as Mitchell's third trip (1844) to the Blacks, the locals were calling what is now Clingmans Peak 354406N 821710W? / ?35.735N 82.286W? / 35.735; -82.286 \\"Mount Mitchell\\", as they believed this was the summit measured by Mitchell as the highest. In 1855, Thomas Lanier Clingman (1812√ø1897), a politician and former student of Mitchell's, climbed a summit north of Stepps Gap known as Black Dome (what is now Mount Mitchell) and measured its elevation at 6,941 feet (2,116?m). Clingman reported his findings to Joseph Henry, the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Henry, using Guyot's more careful and accurate measurements taken several years earlier, agreed with Clingman that Black Dome was higher (although Guyot noted Clingman's measurement of 6,941 feet was off by 200 feet), and the highest mountain in the Appalachians was to be named for Clingman.[16]\\r\\nWhen Mitchell learned of Clingman's find, he claimed that the mountain he had measured in 1844 was in fact Black Dome, and that locals had mistakenly named the summit to the south (the modern Clingmans Peak) after him. Clingman rejected Mitchell's claim, arguing that the route Mitchell took led south of Stepps Gap (i.e., to what is now Mount Gibbes or Clingmans Peak), and that a broken barometer found by Blackstock on Mount Gibbes in 1845 could only have been Mitchell's. The two bickered back and forth in the local newspapers throughout 1856, each claiming to have been the first to summit and measure the higher Black Dome. The debate was intensified by the political climate of the 1850s, as Mitchell was a Whig supporter and Clingman had recently left the Whig party to join the pro-secession Democrats. Zebulon Vance, a Whig politician and friend of Mitchell's, located the two guides Mitchell had recruited for his 1844 excursion, and when the two described the route they had followed, it appeared that Mitchell had indeed summited Mount Gibbes. Finally, in 1857, Mitchell returned to the Blacks in an attempt to gain still more accurate measurements. One evening, while attempting to reach the Cane River Valley, he slipped and fell into a gorge along Sugar Camp Fork, near the waterfall that now bears his name. His body was found 11 days later by the legendary mountain guide Thomas \\"Big Tom\\" Wilson (1825√ø1909).[17]\\r\\nMitchell's death sparked an outpouring of public sympathy across North Carolina. Zebulon Vance led a movement to verify Mitchell as the first to summit the highest mountain in the Eastern United States, and to have the mountain named for him. Vance convinced several mountain guides to change previous statements and claim the route they had taken actually led to Black Dome, rather than Mount Gibbes. Mitchell was buried atop Black Dome on land donated by former governor David Lowry Swain. Clingman continued to deny that Mitchell had measured Black Dome first, but was unable to overcome the shift in public sentiment. By 1858, Black Dome had been renamed \\"Mitchell's High Peak.\\" In subsequent decades, Mount Mitchell was renamed \\"Clingmans Peak\\", and Mitchell's High Peak was renamed \\"Mount Mitchell.\\" Clingman eventually turned to the Great Smoky Mountains to the west, which he claimed were higher. Guyot's measurements in the Smokies rejected Clingman's assertions, although Guyot did manage to have the highest mountain in that range, known as Smoky Dome, renamed Clingmans Dome.[18]\\r\\nThe revelation that the Black Mountains were the highest in the Appalachian Range made them an immediate tourist attraction. By the 1850s, a lodge had been established in the southern part of the range, and locals such as Jesse Stepp and Tom Wilson had built several rustic cabins on the higher mountain slopes and were thriving as mountain guides. The American Civil War (1861√ø1865) brought a temporary halt to the tourism boom, but by the late 1870s, the industry had recovered. In the 1880s, brothers K.M. and David Murchison established a large game preserve in the Cane River Valley which was managed by Tom Wilson.[19]\\r\\nAs forests in the north were cut down to meet the growing demand for lumber in the late 19th century, logging firms turned to the virgin forests of Southern Appalachia. Between 1908 and 1912, northern lumber firms, namely Dickey and Campbell (later Perley and Crockett), Brown Brothers, Carolina Spruce, and Champion Fibre, bought up timber rights to most of the Black Mountains and began a series of massive logging operations in the area. In 1911, Dickey and Campbell managed to construct a narrow-gauge railroad line connecting the Swannanoa Valley with Clingmans Peak. Other narrow-gauge lines quickly followed. Between 1909 and 1915, much of the forest on the upper slopes and crest was cut down. An increase in demand for red spruce during World War I led to the rapid deforestation of much of the spruce-fir forest in the higher elevations. As forests were removed, forest fires (caused by the ignition of dried brush and slash left by loggers) and erosion denuded what was left of the landscape.[20]\\r\\nMany North Carolinians, among them Governor Locke Craig and state forester John Simcox Holmes, were alarmed at the abusive logging practices that were stripping bare the Black Mountains. After the North Carolina state legislature rejected an initial attempt to create a state park at the summit of Mount Mitchell in 1913, Craig began negotiating with (and may have threatened) Perley and Crockett to preserve the forest atop Mitchell while he and Holmes lobbied for the creation of a state park. The state legislature finally approved the purchase of a stretch of land between Stepps Gap and the summit of what is now Big Tom in 1915, which became the core of Mount Mitchell State Park. The Pisgah National Forest, established in 1916, also began buying up and replanting lands that had been logged over.[21]\\r\\nIn 1922, the Mount Mitchell Development Company (which had been formed by Fred Perley, a partner in Perley and Crockett) completed the first automobile road to Mount Mitchell, connecting the summit with the Swannanoa Valley. Adolphus and Ewart Wilson (the son and grandson of \\"Big Tom\\" Wilson) completed a road connecting the Cane River Valley with the summit of Mitchell shortly thereafter. The state eventually condemned the Wilsons' road, but allowed Ewart Wilson to operate an inn at Stepps Gap until the early 1960s. NC-128, which connects Mount Mitchell with the Blue Ridge Parkway, was completed in 1948.[22]\\r\\nThe Black Mountains, like many other ranges in the Appalachians, are currently threatened by acid rain and air pollution. Much of the range's once-famous red spruce and Fraser fir trees are dead or dying due in part to the pollution. A more significant threat to the firs, however, is the balsam woolly adelgid, an insect which may have an easier time killing the firs than it normally would due to them being weakened by the acid rain. In some recent studies, individual Fraser fir trees which are resistant to the adelgid have been found, lending hope to the possibility that these will again repopulate a healthy, mature fir forest at the mountains' highest elevations.[23]\\r\\nAt lower elevations of the Black Mountains, eastern and Carolina hemlock trees grow on moist slopes near streams (a National Forest recreation area on the Toe River at the base of Mount Mitchell is called \\"Carolina Hemlocks\\" for this reason). These too are under attack by an introduced pest, the hemlock woolly adelgid. Arriving only in the last few growing seasons, the health of the hemlocks in the region is rapidly declining. Research is currently underway in releasing predator beetles that will, hopefully, eat enough adelgids to balance their population and allow the hemlocks to flourish.\\r\\nThe area around the Black Mountains is also experiencing rapid population growth as retirees from other states pour into the region. Due to a lack of zoning laws, this has resulted in rapid development of ridgetop cabins, large second-homes on the lower ridges, and deforestation that threatens the natural beauty of the region. And although many people visit the Black Mountains for their legendary scenic views, visibility has been greatly reduced due to particulate matter in the air, mainly coming from large TVA coal-fired powerplants \\"upstream\\" of the Black Mountains in the Midwest.\\r\\nThe summit of Big Tom\\r\\nThe South Toe Valley, viewed from the summit of Balsam Cone\\r\\nBackcountry campsite at Deep Gap\\r\\nSign marking the summit of Cattail Peak","input":"How did black mountain north carolina get its name?"},{"output":"Good Morning, Mickey!","context":"This is a list of television series originally broadcast on, and produced at least partially by, Disney Channel (formerly \\"The Disney Channel\\"), a family-oriented American basic cable channel and former premium channel, owned by The Walt Disney Company.

Its key signature consists of two sharps. Its relative minor is B minor and its parallel minor is D minor.\\r\\nD major is well-suited to violin music because of the structure of the instrument, which is tuned G D A E. The open strings resonate sympathetically with the D string, producing a sound that is especially brilliant. This is also the case with all other orchestral strings.\\r\\nIt is thus no coincidence that many classical composers throughout the centuries have chosen to write violin concertos in D major, including those by Mozart (No. 2, 1775, No. 4, 1775); Ludwig van Beethoven (1806); Paganini (No. 1, 1817); Brahms (1878); Tchaikovsky (1878); Prokofiev (No. 1, 1917); Stravinsky (1931); and Korngold (1945).\\r\\nIt is appropriate for guitar music, with drop D tuning making two Ds available as open strings. For some beginning wind instrument students, however, D major is not a very suitable key, since it transposes to E major on B-flat wind instruments, and beginning methods generally tend to avoid keys with more than three sharps.\\r\\nEven so, the clarinet in B-flat is still often used for music in D major, and it is perhaps the sharpest key that is practical for the instrument. There are composers however who, in writing a piece in D minor with B-flat clarinets, will have them change to clarinets in A if the music switches to D major, two examples being Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in the fourth movement.\\r\\nThe vast majority of tin whistles are in D, since they are often used in music with fiddles. It is a common key for Pub session playing.\\r\\nIn the Baroque period, D major was regarded as \\"the key of glory\\";[1] hence many trumpet concertos were in D major, such as those by Johann Friedrich Fasch, Gross, Molter (No. 2), Leopold Mozart, Telemann (No. 2), and Giuseppe Torelli. Many trumpet sonatas were in D major, too, such as those by Corelli, Petronio Franceschini, Purcell, and Torelli. \\"The Trumpet Shall Sound\\" and the \\"Hallelujah\\" chorus from Handel's Messiah, and his coronation anthem Zadok the Priest are in D major.\\r\\n23 of Haydn's 104 symphonies are in D major, making it the most often used main key of his symphonies. The vast majority of Mozart's unnumbered symphonies are in D major, namely K. 66c, 81/73, 97/73m, 95/73n, 120/111a and 161/163/141a. The symphony evolved from the overture, and \\"D major was by far the most common key for overtures in the second half of the eighteenth century.\\"[2] This continued even into the Romantic Period, and was used for the \\"triumphant\\" final movements of several D minor symphonies, including Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the only symphony by Csar Franck, Sergei Rachmaninoff's First Symphony, Felix Mendelssohn's Fifth Symphony and Johann Strauss I Radetzky March.\\r\\nFamous symphonies written in D major include Mozarts symphonies No. 31 (Paris) and No. 38 (Prague), Beethovens No. 2 Op. 36, Brahms's No. 2 Op. 73, Sibelius's No. 2 Op. 43, Mahlers No. 9 (though it ends in the remote key of D-flat major) and Prokofievs No. 1 (Classical) Op. 25.\\r\\nScriabin considered D major to be golden in color (see chromesthesia) and, in a discussion with Rimsky-Korsakov, he gave an example from one of Rimsky-Korsakov's own operas where a character sang in D major about gold.[citation needed]","input":"What is the parallel minor of d major?"},{"output":"Approximately 24","context":"The General Lee (sometimes referred to as simply \\"the General\\") is the name given to a 1969 Dodge Charger driven in the television series The Dukes of Hazzard by the Duke boys, Bo and Luke, along with cousins Coy and Vance (in season 5). It is known for its signature horn, its police chases, stuntsespecially its long jumpsand for having its doors welded shut, leaving the Dukes to climb in and out through the windows. The car appears in every episode but one (\\"Mary Kaye's Baby\\"). The car's name is a reference to American Civil War general Robert E. Lee. It bears a Confederate flag (a rectangular variant of the square battle flag of Lee's Army of Northern Virginia) on its roof, and also has a horn which plays the first twelve notes of the song \\"Dixie\\".[1]\\r\\nThe idea for the General Lee was developed from the bootlegger Jerry Rushing's car, which was named for Lee's favorite horse, Traveller. Traveller was also the name of the car in Moonrunners, the 1975 movie precursor to The Dukes of Hazzard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the estimated number of General Lees used varies from different sources, according to former cast member Ben Jones (\\"Cooter\\" in the show), as well as builders involved with the show, 325 General Lees were used to film the series. Others claim about 255 were used in the series. Approximately 17 still exist in various states of repair. On average, more than one General Lee was used up per show. When filming a jump, anywhere from 500 to 1,000 pounds (230 to 450?kg) of sand bags or concrete ballast was placed in the trunk to prevent the car from nosing over. Later in the series the mechanics would raise the front end of the car to keep it from scraping against the ramp causing it to lose speed, thereby providing a cushion for the driver upon landing. Stunt drivers report enjoying the flights but hating the landings. Despite the ballast, the landing attitude of the car was somewhat unpredictable, resulting in moderate to extremely violent forces, depending on how it landed. On many of the jumps the cars bent upon impact. All cars used in large jumps were immediately retired due to structural damage.\\r\\nChargers from model-years 1968 & 1969 (no 1970 Chargers were used until the 2005 movie) were sourced and converted to General Lee specifications (taillights, grills, etc.). Despite popular belief, according to all builders involved over the years, obtaining cars was not a problem until later years. By that time, the car was the star of the show and Warner Bros. (WB) moved building of the cars in-house to keep the cars consistent in appearance. Later in the show's run, when it got too hard and/or expensive to continue procuring more Chargers, the producers started using more \\"jump footage\\" from previous episodes. In the final season radio-controlled miniatures were occasionally used to the chagrin of several cast members.\\r\\nEpisodes 1 through 5 were filmed in the Georgia towns of Covington and Conyers in November and December 1978. Georgia episode cars consisted of six Dodge Chargers. The first General Lees were built by Warner Bros. and shipped to Georgia where John Marendi (picture car coordinator) labeled the first three cars \\"LEE 1\\", \\"LEE 2\\", and \\"LEE 3\\" in no particular order for film editing purposes.\\r\\nLEE 1 was a second unit car with a full roll cage. It is a 383 V8-powered 1969 Charger equipped with air-conditioning, an AM/FM stereo, power steering, and power drum brakes. It was originally painted in code T3 \\"Light Bronze Metallic\\" with a tan interior, a black vinyl top and chrome rocker trim. The rocker trim was left on due to previously poor body work on the left quarter panel, the gas cap trim, and wheel well trim were missing so the trim was removed on LEE 2 and 3 to match. It should also be noted that the chrome vinyl top trim was supposed to be removed but since the left quarter panel had been replaced and was very poorly installed the trim had to be left on to hide the body work and as a result most General Lees throughout the series had vinyl top trim. After the now-famous jump over Rosco P. Coltrane's police cruiser by stuntman Craig Baxley, it was stripped of its front seats and 1969-specific grill and taillight panel. LEE 1 was used once more as the \\"Richard Petty\\" tire test car in the fourth episode \\"Repo Men\\".\\r\\nLEE 2, like LEE 1, was a second unit car with a full roll cage, a 383 V-8, a floor shifted automatic transmission and A/C. Originally painted B5 Blue with a black interior, the interior was repainted tan to match LEE 1 and 3 though its steering wheel remained black. It was used for the opening scene in \\"One Armed Bandits\\". In this scene, Bo and Luke were chasing Rosco's police cruiser with the General after Cooter stole it.\\r\\nLEE 3 was the first unit 1 close-up car and the first General Lee built by Warner Brothers; it is seen in the first publicity photos. It was originally a F5 Medium Green Metallic R/T SE (Special Edition) model with a tan vinyl top. It was powered by a 440 Magnum engine with 375 HP, the car weighed 3,671-pound (1,665?kg). LEE 3 was equipped with A/C, power windows, a wood grain dash, and an AM radio. It also had a factory tachometer (which can be seen on \\"Repo Men\\"). This car had a tan leather interior and a removable roll bar that allowed installation of a camera for in-car shots. This car was painted 1975 Corvette Flame Red with a special base coat; the base coat was used after they found LEE 1's paint appeared to be blotchy due to the direct application over factory paint, they had first been painted Chrysler code EV2 or \\"Hemi Orange\\". Eventually, the first three General Lees started to show visible damage, so the crew had to start making more. The first General Lee built in Georgia was a 1968 Charger converted to look like a 1969; the tail light panel, front grill, and front seats taken from LEE 1 were used. Interiors not originally tan were sprayed with SEM brand \\"Saddle tan\\" vinyl dye. The first three Georgia Lees had a set of crossed flags (a Confederate flag and checkered flag) on the panel between the rear window and trunk lid. Although four sets were created, only three were used. They were discontinued due to the continuity of the General Lee graphics, making it one less thing to be used. The three surviving cars went back to California and had the crossed flags removed upon reconditioning. The wheels were generally 14-by-7-inch (36?cm G?18?cm) American Racing brand \\"Vectors\\" throughout the show (with Carroll Shelby center caps) and were mainly mounted on P235/70R14 B.?F. Goodrich Radial T/A tires with the blackwall side facing out.\\r\\nLEE 1 was sold to professional golfer Bubba Watson at the 2012 Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale auction for US$110,000 (US$121,000 after buyer premium).[2][3][4][5]\\r\\nAndre and Renaud Veluzat built General Lees for WB from the second season into the fourth season. Viewers can also see two \\"Georgia\\" cars used often up into the early second season. LEE 3 and a specially caged car never appearing (but built) in Georgia were used heavily in early California episodes. The Veluzats were somewhat inconsistent in how they built the cars, so this is when the most variations from specification are found. The paint was GM code 70, Flame Red (still orange, just the name of the color), but there does appear to be some variance here: interiors were mostly dyed brown and occasionally SEM Saddle Tan. According to some sources, the Veluzats charged WB $250 a week per car for rental and a lump sum of $2000 to $3000 upon destruction of the vehicles; this included police cars. WB mechanics had to maintain the cars at company expense.\\r\\nThe money generated by building General Lees financed the Veluzat family project of restoring Gene Autry's Melody Ranch; it had burned in the 1960s. This ranch is where many classic Western films were shot, as well as the television series Gunsmoke. Today, it is a fully functional movie ranch where shows such as HBO's Deadwood are filmed.\\r\\nBy 1983, Warner Brothers turned total control of building General Lees to a man named Ken Fritz. Fritz didn't have the job long before he too was fired and at this point Warner Brothers moved full production in-house. The General Lee was now the highlight of the series, and WB received enormous amounts of Lee-specific fan mail that nit-picked the inconsistencies of the cars. Because of the fame of General Lee, WB had their staff mechanics build the cars to a specific appearance, even underneath. All graphics had to meet specifications, all side markers and rocker panel chrome trim were removed; and roll bars and push bars had to meet an exact specification. However, some changes were made before the specifications were laid out: The push bar became wider, the interior became a light beige color, and the roll bars were covered in black foam padding. During this period, the only way to distinguish the 1968 conversions from the 1969 originals is by the shape of the dashboard padding.\\r\\nAs the WB era rolled on, finding the cars became difficult: Piper Cubs were hired to perform aerial searches for 1968, 1969, and 1970 Chargers amongst the populace; the jumped cars were now no longer scrapped after one jump if deemed salvageable, and were repaired and used until they could no longer function; and, as last resort, miniature radio-controlled models were also brought in toward the end of the series to replace most of the big jump stunts, thereby saving more carssomething that proved unpopular with many episode directors (including Tom Wopat) who felt that the models did not look realistic. By this time, there was also a rivalry for \\"TV's greatest car\\" with the Knight Rider series, leading to the models being used more and more for greater jumps to try to out-do that series. Taking full control also saved some money, as now WB had the ability to buy cars, recondition them, and use them without paying daily rental fees.\\r\\nAt the beginning of the movie, the General was a faded orange with a hand-painted \\"01\\" on the doors, black steel wheels, standard front bumper, and no Confederate Naval Flag. Midway through the film, Cooter repairs the General after it is vandalized by Boss Hogg's hirelings. He repaints it a bright Hemi orange and adds the well-known trademarks (American Racing \\"Vector\\" 10-spoke \\"turbine\\" wheels, octagonal \\"01\\", black grille guard, Confederate flag on the roof, \\"Dixie\\" horn, and \\"General Lee\\" above the door window openings).\\r\\nThe movie General not only flies and makes controlled landings, but also drifts with the aid of professional drifter Rhys Millen. During jump scenes, some stunt cars were propelled under their own power by stunt drivers; others had their engines and transmissions removed. The engineless Chargers were then launched without drivers by a gas-driven catapult similar in principle to those used on aircraft carriers. Approximately 24 1968 to 1970 Chargers were used in the film.\\r\\nUnlike the television show era Lees, the movie cars used aftermarket graphic kits. The movie gave them new credibility and is no longer considered to be an inaccurate choice. Otherwise, except for the white letters on the Goodrich \\"Radial T/A\\" tires, the exterior of the movie's \\"close-up\\" General Lees varied little from the television show cars. The paint was \\"Big Bad Orange\\" (an American Motors Corporation color) rather than Corvette \\"Flame Red\\"; the interior headliner was black instead of tan, an actual roll cage was used; a three-spoke Grant wood-trimmed steering wheel replaced the standard wheel, an AM/FM stereo radio with Compact Disc player was installed in the dashboard; and the interiors were a custom color vinyl fabric made to look like the dye/paint used in the later eras of the TV show. One still can differentiate the 1968 Chargers by looking at the dash pad, but now 1970 Chargers were thrown in the mix. The cars somewhat resembled a late 1990s to early 2000s (decade) General Lee clone, but the overall flavor of the General Lee is still obvious. On all of the cars, the back-up lights and side marker lenses were removed, the openings filled in.\\r\\nEleven of the cars used for the movie had been purchased from the Luedtke Auto Group. Many of the cars had been cut up to allow for inside camera views.\\r\\nGeneral Lee number 020 was the drift car used in the drifting scene around Lee Circle and was also the car racing the black Shelby at the end of the movie. It was the only 4-speed equipped cars and was the backup to car #005. The car contains a unique emergency brake handle near the shifter that allowed the stunt driver quick access to locking the rear brakes at will. Though it did sustain some damage during filming, it is fully road worthy and is privately owned by Troy Martinson in Minnesota.[citation needed]\\r\\nTwo of the General Lees (a 1969 R/T SE and a 1970 made to appear as a 1969) were temporarily sold to Warner Brothers by Everett \\"J.R.\\" Barton of Wichita, Kansas, for $1.00 each then sold back to him for $1.25. They were picked up from him in Wichita and were transported to Baton Rouge, both in driving condition. The 1970 (made to 1969) car then had the engine removed, got the General Lee treatment then weight added to balance the car for the main Freeway jump. One other car was used before this car. The first one landed hard on its nose, broke, and careened right into the guardrail. Given its problematic landing it was not used for that scene. Mr. Barton's car, number 127, was then used for that scene. It was launched from a catapult system, much like that used on aircraft carriers. It flew the farthest of all the jumps in the film and truly did survive. This is the car that made that jump in the film. After the filming the cars were returned to Everett. Everett then put a motor back in the car and even in its jumped condition had driven it in a couple of parades. After keeping the car for 8 years, he sold it to an individual that plans to have it restored to show quality. It will be restored from the men on the TV show Graveyard Cars.[citation needed]\\r\\nEarly in the fifth-season episode \\"Exposed\\" of the television series Smallville, former Dukes of Hazzard co-star Tom Wopat (Luke Duke), playing Kansas Senator Jack Jennings, old friend of Jonathan Kent, played by John Schneider (Bo Duke), fishtails his car into the Kent farmyard. The car is a 1968 Dodge Charger R/T, painted blue instead of orange, and lacking the General Lee's distinctive insignia.\\r\\nIn 2014 the General Lee was featured in a commercial spot for AutoTrader.[6] The commercial featured the General Lee with Dukes of Hazzard stars John Schneider and Tom Wopat. The Duke's theme song \\"Good Ole Boys\\" can be heard playing during the commercial. The video was released on June 6, 2014.\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina shooting deaths, there was a backlash against the Confederate battle flag, due to the flag's historical associations with treason, racism, slavery, and white supremacy.[7][8] In response, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. announced they would halt production of General Lee toy cars.[9] Ben Jones criticized the move, stating, \\"I think all of Hazzard Nation understands that the Confederate battle flag is the symbol that represents the indomitable spirit of independence which keeps us 'makin' our way the only way we know how.'\\"[10] John Schneider responded by stating, \\"I take exception to those who say that the flag on the General Lee should always be considered a symbol of racism. Is the flag used as such in other applications? Yes, but certainly not on the Dukes.\\"[11]\\r\\nOn July 2, 2015, golfer Bubba Watson, current owner of LEE 1, announced via Twitter that he would be painting over the Confederate flag on the car's roof.[12][13] Watson's announcement prompted Brian Grams, director of the Volo Auto Museum, to offer to purchase Watson's General Lee, citing how Watson's car was significant because it was used in the show's first season and would be worthy of inclusion in the museum's collection. His offer was turned down.[14]\\r\\nEngines in the TV show General Lees varied; they used 318, 383, and 440-cubic-inch engines. None of the TV series cars had the 426 Hemi, although in the 2005 The Dukes of Hazzard motion picture, Cooter replaced the \\"General's\\" original engine with a Chrysler 426 Hemi engine. However, the \\"close-up\\" Lees (except for the first one) were 383-powered. The special purpose built \\"Ski Car\\" (the car that was used for stunts involving driving on the left side or right side wheels with the opposite side wheels in the air) had a 318, as it was lighter weight. Most of the 'workhorse' stunt cars had 383s and 440s. The stunt drivers tended to prefer 440s (a higher performance engine) for jumps, so 440-powered stunt Lees were often saved for the higher bobby and longer jumps. Also, though early sound effects led many people to believe otherwise, only a handful of Chargers had manual transmissions; most had 727 TorqueFlite automatic transmissions.\\r\\nThe General Lee, except in the beginning of the movie, does not have opening doors. In the TV series, it is explained that racing cars have their doors welded shut, and this was often used for comedic effect when Uncle Jesse or Boss Hogg required help to squeeze through the window (WB stopped welding the doors for time crams). (In one episode, Sheriff Rosco hires a bounty hunter (Jason Steele in the show) to create a fake General Lee and trick the Dukes into driving it, at which point he promptly orders their arrest for auto theft. The fake car was easily identified because its doors opened.) This was not at first planned but while filming the first chase (where Bo and Luke are chasing Cooter in Rosco's car) the passenger's door handle was damaged (when it hit the mail boxes) and couldn't be opened from the outside, so Tom Wopat (Luke) climbed though the window and the director loved the move so much he had John Schneider (Bo) climb in too, this is why only LEE 1 and 2 had full roll cages and all other General Lees only had a roll bar (this made it easier for the actors to get in and out).[citation needed] In the movie, the car has been repaired after being trashed, but the doors could not be fixed fast enough. The driver and passenger must slide in the window (as in NASCAR). For a running entry, Bo and Luke also slide over the hood rather than walk around the front of the car. However, in the prequel The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning, the left door was welded shut while the right one was not.\\r\\nExhaust systems were basic: some had glasspack mufflers, but most had standard exhausts with the pipe cut just before the rear end. The exhaust sound that can be heard on most of the California-era episode General Lees is from a Thrush brand glasspack. The sounds came from the exhaust systems fitted to the \\"close-up\\" cars; the parts used were Blackjack brand headers, dual exhausts, and the aforementioned Thrush mufflers. However, the sounds were dubbed in after the scene was filmed.\\r\\n[15]Tires used on the General Lee varied, but the best known make and model was the B.F. Goodrich Radial T/A. The most common size was P235/70R14; P235/70R15 was also used. Winston Winners were also used.","input":"How many chargers used in dukes of hazzard movie?"},{"output":"unknown","context":"The origin of the name of the U.S. state of Oregon is unknown,[1] and a subject of some dispute.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost scholarship ascribes the earliest known use of the name \\"Oregon\\" to a 1765 petition by Major Robert Rogers to the Kingdom of Great Britain, seeking money to finance an expedition in search of the Northwest Passage. The petition read \\"the rout... is from the Great Lakes towards the Head of the Mississippi, and from thence to the River called by the Indians Ouragon....\\"[2] Thus, the early Oregon Country and now the present day state of Oregon took their names from the river now known as the Columbia River.[3]\\r\\nIn 1766, Rogers commissioned Jonathan Carver to lead such an expedition and in 1778, Carver used Oregon to label the Great River of the West in his book Travels Through the Interior Parts of North America.[4] The poet William Cullen Bryant took the name from Carver's book and used it in his poem Thanatopsis, published in 1817, to refer to the recent discoveries of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which helped establish the name in modern use.[5]\\r\\nOther theories suggest that Rogers appropriated the Abenaki name for the Ohio River, Waregan, or found the name Ourican on a highly-speculative 1715 French map.[6]\\r\\nWhy Rogers used the name has led to many theories, which include these:\\r\\nOthers have speculated[16] that the name is related to the kingdom of Aragon: the major part of the Spanish soldiers who conquered the West Coast from California to Vancouver Island in the 18th century were in fact from Catalonia, a principality of the ancient Crown of Aragon in Spain.

The oxygen they produced would have been rapidly removed from the atmosphere by weathering of reducing minerals,[citation needed] most notably iron[citation needed]. This \\"mass rusting\\"[citation needed] led to the deposition of iron oxide on the ocean floor, forming banded iron formations. Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities about 50 million years before the start of the Great Oxygenation Event.[4] This mass oxygenation of the atmosphere resulted in rapid buildup of free oxygen. At current rates of primary production, today's concentration of oxygen could be produced by photosynthetic organisms in 2,000 years.[5] In the absence of plants, the rate of oxygen production by photosynthesis was slower in the Precambrian, and the concentrations of O2 attained were less than 10% of today's and probably fluctuated greatly; oxygen may even have disappeared from the atmosphere again around 1.9 billion years ago.[6] These fluctuations in oxygen concentration had little direct effect on life,[citation needed] with mass extinctions not observed until the appearance of complex life around the start of the Cambrian period, 541?million years ago.[7] The presence of O\\r\\n2 provided life with new opportunities. Aerobic metabolism is more efficient than anaerobic pathways, and the presence of oxygen undoubtedly created new possibilities for life to explore.[8]:214, 586[9] Since the start of the Cambrian period, atmospheric oxygen concentrations have fluctuated between 15% and 35% of atmospheric volume.[10] The maximum of 35% was reached towards the end of the Carboniferous period (about 300?million years ago), a peak which may have contributed to the large size of insects and amphibians at that time.[9] Whilst human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, affect relative carbon dioxide concentrations, their effect on the much larger concentration of oxygen is less significant.[11]\\r\\nThe concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere is often cited as a possible contributor to large-scale evolutionary phenomena, such as the origin of the multicellular Ediacara biota, the Cambrian explosion, trends in animal body size, and other extinction and diversification events.[9]\\r\\nThe large size of insects and amphibians in the Carboniferous period, when the oxygen concentration in the atmosphere reached 35%, has been attributed to the limiting role of diffusion in these organisms' metabolism.[citation needed] But Haldane's essay[12] points out that it would only apply to insects. However, the biological basis for this correlation is not firm, and many lines of evidence show that oxygen concentration is not size-limiting in modern insects.[9] There is no significant correlation between atmospheric oxygen and maximum body size elsewhere in the geological record.[9] Ecological constraints can better explain the diminutive size of post-Carboniferous dragonflies - for instance, the appearance of flying competitors such as pterosaurs, birds and bats.[9]\\r\\nRising oxygen concentrations have been cited as one of several drivers for evolutionary diversification, although the physiological arguments behind such arguments are questionable, and a consistent pattern between oxygen concentrations and the rate of evolution is not clearly evident.[9] The most celebrated link between oxygen and evolution occurs at the end of the last of the Snowball glaciations, where complex multicellular life is first found in the fossil record. Under low oxygen concentrations and before the evolution of nitrogen fixation, biologically-available nitrogen compounds were in limited supply [13] and periodic \\"nitrogen crises\\" could render the ocean inhospitable to life.[9] Significant concentrations of oxygen were just one of the prerequisites for the evolution of complex life.[9] Models based on uniformitarian principles (i.e. extrapolating present-day ocean dynamics into deep time) suggest that such a concentration was only reached immediately before metazoa first appeared in the fossil record.[9] Further, anoxic or otherwise chemically \\"nasty\\" oceanic conditions that resemble those supposed to inhibit macroscopic life re-occur at intervals through the early Cambrian, and also in the late Cretaceous √ø with no apparent effect on lifeforms at these times.[9] This might suggest that the geochemical signatures found in ocean sediments reflect the atmosphere in a different way before the Cambrian - perhaps as a result of the fundamentally different mode of nutrient cycling in the absence of planktivory.[7][9]\\r\\nOxygen in the atmosphere can cause phosphorus and iron to be freed from rock, and these elements can then be used for building new species which require these elements.[2]","input":"When did oxygen first appear in earth's atmosphere?"},{"output":"April 15, 1949","context":"The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is one of 27 institutes and centers that make up the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH, in turn, is an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services and is the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and health-related research.\\r\\nNIMH is the largest research organization in the world specializing in mental illness. Joshua A. Gordon is the current Director of NIMH. The institute was first authorized by the U.S. Government in 1946, when then President Harry Truman signed into law the National Mental Health Act, although the institute was not formally established until 1949.[1]\\r\\nNIMH is a $1.5 billion enterprise, supporting research on mental health through grants to investigators at institutions and organizations throughout the United States and through its own internal (intramural) research effort. The mission of NIMH is \\"to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure\\".[2]\\r\\nIn order to fulfill this mission, NIMH \\"must foster innovative thinking and ensure that a full array of novel scientific perspectives are used to further discovery in the evolving science of brain, behavior, and experience. In this way, breakthroughs in science can become breakthroughs for all people with mental illnesses.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNIMH has identified four overarching strategic objectives for itself:\\r\\nMental health has traditionally been a state responsibility, but after World War II there was increased lobbying for a federal (national) initiative. Attempts to create a National Neuropsychiatric Institute failed. Robert H. Felix, then head of the Division of Mental Hygiene, orchestrated a movement to include mental health policy as an integral part of federal biomedical policy. Congressional subcommittees hearings were held and the National Mental Health Act was signed into law in 1946. This aimed to support the research, prevention and treatment of psychiatric illness, and called for the establishment of a National Advisory Mental Health Council (NAMHC) and a National Institute of Mental Health. On April 15, 1949, the NIMH was formally established, with Felix as director. Funding for the NIMH grew slowly and then, from the mid-1950s, dramatically. The institute took on a highly influential role in shaping policy, research and communicating with the public, legitimizing the importance of new advances in biomedical science, psychiatric and psychological services, and community-based mental health policies.[5]\\r\\nIn 1955 the Mental Health Study Act called for \\"an objective, thorough, nationwide analysis and reevaluation of the human and economic problems of mental health.\\"[citation needed] The resulting Joint Commission on Mental Illness and Health prepared a report, \\"Action for Mental Health\\", resulting in the establishment of a cabinet-level interagency committee to examine the recommendations and determine an appropriate federal response.\\r\\nIn 1963, Congress passed the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act, beginning a new era in Federal support for mental health services. NIMH assumed responsibility for monitoring the Nation's community mental health centers (CMHC) programs.\\r\\nDuring the mid-1960s, NIMH launched a campaign on special mental health problems. Part of this was a response to President Lyndon Johnson's pledge to apply scientific research to social problems. The Institute established centers for research on schizophrenia, child and family mental health, suicide, as well as crime and delinquency, minority group mental health problems, urban problems, and later, rape, aging, and technical assistance to victims of natural disasters.\\r\\nAlcohol abuse and alcoholism did not receive full recognition as a major public health problem until the mid-1960s, when the National Center for Prevention and Control of Alcoholism was established as part of NIMH; a research program on drug abuse was inaugurated within NIMH with the establishment of the Center for Studies of Narcotic and Drug Abuse.\\r\\nIn 1967, NIMH separated from NIH and was given Bureau status within PHS. However, NIMH's intramural research program, which conducted studies in the NIH Clinical Center and other NIH facilities, remained at NIH under an agreement for joint administration between NIH and NIMH. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare John W. Gardner transferred St. Elizabeths Hospital, the Federal Government's only civilian psychiatric hospital, to NIMH.\\r\\nIn 1968, NIMH became a component of PHS's Health Services and Mental Health Administration (HSMHA).\\r\\nIn 1970 the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act (P.L. 91-616) established the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism within NIMH.\\r\\nIn 1972, the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act established a National Institute on Drug Abuse within NIMH.\\r\\nIn 1973, NIMH went through a series of organizational moves. The Institute temporarily rejoined NIH on July 1 with the abolishment of HSMHA. Then, the DHEW secretary administratively established the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA) √ø composed of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and NIMH √ø as the successor organization to HSMHA. ADAMHA was officially established in 1974.\\r\\nThe President's Commission on Mental Health in 1977 reviewed the mental health needs of the nation and to make recommendations to the President as to how best meet these needs in 1978.\\r\\nIn 1980 The Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study, an unprecedented research effort that entailed interviews with a nationally representative sample of 20,000 Americans was launched. The field interviews and first wave analyses were completed in 1985. Data from the ECA provided a picture of rates of mental and addictive disorders and services usage.\\r\\nThe Mental Health Systems Act of 1980 √ø based on recommendations of the President's Commission on Mental Health and designed to provide improved services for persons with mental disorders √ø was passed. NIMH participated in development of the National Plan for the Chronically Mentally Ill, a sweeping effort to improve services and fine-tune various Federal entitlement programs for those with severe, persistent mental disorders.\\r\\nIn 1987, Administrative control of St. Elizabeth's Hospital was transferred from the NIMH to the District of Columbia. NIMH retained research facilities on the grounds of the hospital. The NIMH Neuroscience Center and the NIMH Neuropsychiatric Research Hospital, located on the grounds of St. Elizabeth's Hospital, were dedicated in 1989.\\r\\nIn 1992, Congress passed the ADAMHA Reorganization Act, abolishing ADAMHA. The research components of NIAAA, NIDA and NIMH rejoined NIH, while the services components of each institute became part of a new PHS agency, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The return to NIH and the loss of services functions to SAMHSA necessitated a realignment of the NIMH extramural program administrative organization. New offices were created for research on Prevention, Special Populations, Rural Mental Health and AIDS.\\r\\nIn 1994 The House Appropriations Committee mandated that the director of NIH conduct a review of the role, size, and cost of all NIH intramural research programs (IRP). NIMH and the National Advisory Mental Health Council (NAMHC) initiated a major study of the NIMH Intramural Research Program. The planning committee recommended continued investment in the IRP and recommended specific administrative changes; many of these were implemented upon release of the committee's final report; other changes  for example, the establishment of a major new program on Mood and Anxiety Disorders  have been introduced in the years since.\\r\\nIn 1996 NIMH, with the NAMHC, initiated systematic reviews of a number of areas of its research portfolio, including the genetics of mental disorders; epidemiology and services for child and adolescent populations; prevention research; clinical treatment and services research. At the request of the National Institute for Mental Health director, the NAMH Council established programmatic groups in each of these areas. NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health) continued to implement recommendations issued by these Workgroups.\\r\\nIn 1997, NIMH realigned its extramural organizational structure to capitalize on new technologies and approaches to both basic and clinical science, as well as changes that had occurred in health care delivery systems, while retaining the Institute's focus on mental illness. The new extramural organization resulted in three research divisions: Basic and Clinical Neuroscience Research; Services and Intervention Research; and Mental Disorders, Behavioral Research and AIDS.\\r\\nBetween 1997 and 1999 NIMH refocused career development resources on early careers and added new mechanisms for clinical research.\\r\\nIn 1999 The NIMH Neuroscience Center/Neuropsychiatric Research Hospital was relocated from St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, D.C. to the NIH Campus in Bethesda, Maryland, in response to the recommendations of the 1996 review of the NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health) Intramural Research Program by the IRP Planning Committee.\\r\\nThe first White House Conference on Mental Health, held June 7, in Washington, D.C., brought together national leaders, mental health scientific and clinical personnel, patients, and consumers to discuss needs and opportunities. The National Institute on Mental Health developed materials and helped organize the conference.\\r\\nU.S. Surgeon General David Satcher released The Surgeon General's Call To Action To Prevent Suicide, in July, and the first Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health, in December. NIMH, along with other Federal agencies, collaborated in the preparation of both of these landmark reports.\\r\\nSince the appointment of Thomas R. Insel as Director of NIMH in 2002, the institute has undergone organizational changes to better target mental health research needs (the expansion from three extramural divisions to five divisions, with the two new divisions focusing on adult and child translational research). NIMH also weathered several years of controversy due to conflict of interest and ethics violations by some of its intramural investigators. This situation cast light on an area that affected all of NIH, and resulted in more stringent rules about conflict of interest for all of NIH. Recently, Congressional interest turned to ethics and conflict of interest concerns with external investigators who receive NIMH or other NIH support. Current federal law has responsibility for managing and monitoring conflict of interests for external investigators with their home institutions/organizations. NIH responded to these new concerns by initiating a formal process for seeking public input and advice that will likely result in a change to the rules for monitoring and managing conflict of interest concerns for externally supported investigators. Finally, the past decade has also been marked by exciting scientific breakthroughs and efforts in mental illness research, as new genetic advances and bioimaging methodologies have increased understanding of mental illnesses. Two notable consequences of these advances are the Institute's collaboration with the Department of Army to launch the Study To Assess Risk and Resilience in Service Members (STARRS), a Framingham-like effort scheduled to last until 2014 and the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) effort, which seeks to define basic dimensions of functioning (such as fear circuitry or working memory) to be studied across multiple levels of analysis, from genes to neural circuits to behaviors, cutting across disorders as traditionally defined.[6][7]\\r\\nA collection of interviews with directors and individuals significant in the foundation and early history of the institute conducted by Dr. Eli A. Rubenstein between 1975 and 1978 is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.[8]\\r\\nIn 1970, Julius Axelrod, a NIMH researcher, won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for research into the chemistry of nerve transmission for \\"discoveries concerning the humoral transmitters in the nerve terminals and the mechanisms for their storage, release and inactivation.\\" He found an enzyme that terminated the action of the nerve transmitter, noradrenaline in the synapse and which also served as a critical target of many antidepressant drugs.\\r\\nIn 1984, Norman E. Rosenthal, a psychiatrist and NIMH researcher, pioneered seasonal affective disorder, coined the term SAD, and began studying the use of light therapy as a treatment.[9][10][11][12] He received the Anna Monika Foundation Award for his research on seasonal depression.[13]\\r\\nLouis Sokoloff, a NIMH researcher, received the Albert ?asker award in Clinical Medical Research for developing a new method of measuring brain function that contributed to basic understanding and diagnosis of brain diseases. Roger Sperry, a NIMH research grantee, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for discoveries regarding the functional specialization of the cerebral hemispheres, or the \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" brain.\\r\\nEric Kandel and Paul Greengard, each of whom have received NIMH support for more than three decades, shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Sweden's Arvid Carlsson. Kandel received the prize for his elucidating research on the functional modification of synapses in the brain. Initially using the sea slug as an experimental model but later working with mice, he established that the formation of memories is a consequence of short and long-term changes in the biochemistry of nerve cells Greengard was recognized for his discovery that dopamine and a number of other transmitters can alter the functional state of neuronal proteins, and also that such changes could be reversed by subsequent environmental signals.\\r\\nNancy Andreasen, a psychiatrist and long-time NIMH grantee, won the National Medal of Science for her groundbreaking work in schizophrenia and for joining behavioral science with neuroscience and neuroimaging. The Presidential Award is one of the nation's highest awards in science.\\r\\nAaron Beck, a psychiatrist, received the 2006 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research. Often called \\"America's Nobels\\", the Laskers are the nation's most distinguished honor for outstanding contributions to basic and clinical medical research. Beck developed cognitive therapya form of psychotherapywhich transformed the understanding and treatment of many psychiatric conditions, including depression, suicidal behavior, generalized anxiety, panic attacks and eating disorders.[14]\\r\\nIn 2010, Mortimer Mishkin was awarded the National Medal of Science. Mishkin is chief of the NIMH's Section on Cognitive Neuroscience, and acting chief of its Laboratory of Neuropsychology. He is the first NIMH intramural scientist to receive the medal. Due in part to work spearheaded by Mishkin, science now understands much about the pathways for vision, hearing and touch, and about how those processing streams connect with brain structures important for memory.[15]\\r\\nA children's novel Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH by Robert C. O'Brien, published in 1971, features a society of intelligent rats that had presumably escaped from a laboratory at NIMH. The novel was later adapted into a critically acclaimed animated feature film entitled The Secret of NIMH by animator and director Don Bluth. The book was followed by a sequel in 1986, Racso and the Rats of NIMH.","input":"When was the national institute of mental health founded?"},{"output":"Chandra Kumar Agarwala","context":"Jonaki (Assamese: ??????, Moonlight) was an Assamese language magazine published from Calcutta in 1889.[1][2] It was also the mouthpiece of the then Assamese literary society Oxomiya Bhaxa Unnati Xadhini Xobha in which the societys aim and objectives were regularly expressed.[1] The first editor of the magazine was Chandra Kumar Agarwala.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oxomiya Bhaxa Unnati Xadhini Xobha, after its formation in 1888, decided to publish a new monthly Assamese magazine.

Chandra Kumar Agarwala, who belonged to a rich business family, came forward to finance the magazine and named it Jonaki (\\"Moonlight\\"). Agarwala was a FA student in Presidency College then and also a member of the society. He put forward two conditions to publish and edit the magazine:\\r\\nIf those conditions were not met by anyone, a fine of Rs 15 would be imposed on him.

The printing of the magazine continued until 1898.[1] Publishing resumed in Guwahati in 1901 and continued until 1903.[1][3] Satyanath Borah and Kanaklal Baruah were the editors of the Guwahati editions.\\r\\nOne unusual feature of the magazine was that it did not have an editorial. Rather, it contained a regular column called Atmokotha (Self-sketches) in which the ideology of the magazine as well as the society was expressed.[1] The aim and objective of the magazine as expressed in this column in the first edition was (English translation: Uddipan Dutta):[1]\\r\\nJonaki marked the dawn of romanticism in Assamese literature.

Hemchandra Goswamis Kaku Aru Hiya Nibilau (No More of my Heart to Anybody) was a unique poem of its kind.

Kamalakanta Bhattacharjyas Pahoroni (Oblivion) and Chandrakumar Agarwalas Niyor (Dew-drops) were two epoch-making poems published in the first year of the magazine. The joint efforts of these pioneers established a new era in Assamese literature: The Jonaki Era, or the romantic age.

Founded on June 20, 1325, the city was built on an island in what was then Lake Texcoco in the Valley of Mexico. The city was the capital of the expanding Aztec Empire in the 15th century[1] until it was captured by the Spanish in 1521.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt its peak, it was the largest city in the Pre-Columbian Americas. It subsequently became a cabecera of the Viceroyalty of New Spain.

However, one attestation in the late 16th-century manuscript known as \\"the Bancroft dialogues\\" suggest the second vowel was short, so that the true etymology remains uncertain.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nTenochtitlan covered an estimated 8 to 13.5?km2 (3.1 to 5.2?sq?mi), situated on the western side of the shallow Lake Texcoco.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of Spanish conquests, Mexico City comprised both Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco. The city extended from north to south, from the north border of Tlatelolco to the swamps, which by that time were gradually disappearing to the west; the city ended more or less at the present location of Avenida Bucareli.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city was connected to the mainland by bridges and causeways leading to the north, south, and west. The causeways were interrupted by bridges that allowed canoes and other water traffic to pass freely. The bridges could be pulled away, if necessary, to defend the city. The city was interlaced with a series of canals, so that all sections of the city could be visited either on foot or via canoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nLake Texcoco was the largest of five interconnected lakes. Since it formed in an endorheic basin, Lake Texcoco was brackish. During the reign of Moctezuma I, the \\"levee of Nezahualcoyotl\\" was constructed, reputedly designed by Nezahualcoyotl. Estimated to be 12 to 16?km (7.5 to 9.9?mi) in length, the levee was completed circa 1453. The levee kept fresh spring-fed water in the waters around Tenochtitlan and kept the brackish waters beyond the dike, to the east.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo double aqueducts, each more than 4?km (2.5?mi) long and made of terracotta,[3] provided the city with fresh water from the springs at Chapultepec. This was intended mainly for cleaning and washing. For drinking, water from mountain springs was preferred. Most of the population liked to bathe twice a day; Moctezuma was said to take four baths a day. According to the context of Aztec culture in literature, the soap that they most likely used was the root of a plant called copalxocotl (Saponaria americana),[4] and to clean their clothes they used the root of metl (Agave americana). Also, the upper classes and pregnant women washed themselves in a temzcalli, similar to a sauna bath, which is still used in the south of Mexico. This was also popular in other Mesoamerican cultures.\\r\\n\\r\\n When we saw so many cities and villages built in the water and other great towns on dry land we were amazed and said that it was like the enchantments (...) on account of the great towers and cues and buildings rising from the water, and all built of masonry. And some of our soldiers even asked whether the things that we saw were not a dream? (...) I do not know how to describe it, seeing things as we did that had never been heard of or seen before, not even dreamed about.\\r\\nThe city was divided into four zones, or camps; each camp was divided into 20 districts (calpullis, Nahuatl calplli); and each calpulli, or 'big house', was crossed by streets or tlaxilcalli. There were three main streets that crossed the city, each leading to one of the three causeways to the mainland of Tepeyac, Ixtapalpa, and Tlacopan.[6] Bernal Daz del Castillo reported that they were wide enough for ten horses. Surrounding the raised causeways were artificial floating gardens with canal waterways and gardens of plants, shrubs, and trees.[7] The calpullis were divided by channels used for transportation, with wood bridges that were removed at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest European images of the city were woodcuts published in Augsburg around 1522.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach calpulli (from Classical Nahuatl calplli, Nahuatl pronunciation: [ka??po?l?i], meaning \\"large house\\") had its own tiyanquiztli (marketplace), but there was also a main marketplace in Tlatelolco √ø Tenochtitlan's sister city. Corts estimated it was twice the size of the city of Salamanca with about 60,000 people trading daily. Bernardino de Sahag~n provides a more conservative population estimate of 20,000 on ordinary days and 40,000 on feast days. There were also specialized markets in the other central Mexican cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the center of the city were the public buildings, temples, and palaces. Inside a walled square, 500 meters to a side, was the ceremonial center. There were about 45 public buildings, including: the Templo Mayor, which was dedicated to the Aztec patron deity Huitzilopochtli and the Rain God Tlaloc; the temple of Quetzalcoatl; the tlachtli (ball game court) with the tzompantli or rack of skulls; the Sun Temple, which was dedicated to Tonatiuh; the Eagle's House, which was associated with warriors and the ancient power of rulers; the platforms for the gladiatorial sacrifice; and some minor temples.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside was the palace of Moctezuma with 100 rooms, each with its own bath, for the lords and ambassadors of allies and conquered people. Also located nearby was the cuicalli, or house of the songs, and the calmecac.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city had great symmetry. All constructions had to be approved by the calmimilocatl, a functionary in charge of the city planning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe palace of Montezuma II also had two houses or zoos, one for birds of prey and another for other birds, reptiles, and mammals. About 300 people were dedicated to the care of the animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was also a botanical garden and an aquarium. The aquarium had ten ponds of salt water and ten ponds of fresh water, containing various fish and aquatic birds. Places like this also existed in Texcoco, Chapultepec, Huaxtepec (now called Oaxtepec), and Texcotzingo.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nTenochtitlan can be considered the most complex society in Mesoamerica in regard to social stratification.  The complex system involved many social classes. The macehualtin were commoners who lived outside the island city of Tenochtitlan. The pipiltin were noblemen who were relatives of leaders and former leaders, and lived in the confines of the island.  Cuauhipiltin, or eagle nobles, were commoners who impressed the nobles with their martial prowess, and were treated as nobles.[6] Teteuctin were the highest class, rulers of various parts of the empire, including the king. Tlacohtin were individuals who chose to enslave themselves to pay back a debt; they were not slaves forever and were not treated as badly as typical slaves seen in other ancient civilizations worldwide. Finally, the pochteca were merchants who traveled all of Mesoamerica trading.  The membership of this class was based on heredity.  Pochteca could become very rich because they did not pay taxes, but they had to sponsor the ritual feast of Xocotl Huetzi from the wealth that they obtained from their trade expeditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nStatus was displayed by location and type of house where a person lived.  Ordinary people lived in houses made of reeds plastered with mud and roofed with thatch. People who were better off had houses of adobe brick with flat roofs.[6] The wealthy had houses of stone masonry with flat roofs. They most likely made up the house complexes that were arranged around the inner court.  The higher officials in Tenochtitlan lived in the great palace complexes that made up the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdding even more complexity to Aztec social stratification was the calpolli. Calpolli, meaning big house is a group of families related by either kinship or proximity. These groups consist of both elite members of Aztec society and commoners.  Elites provided commoners with arable land and nonagricultural occupations, and commoners performed services for chiefs and gave tribute.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nTenochtitlan was the capital of the Mexican civilization of the Mexica people, founded in 1325. The state religion of the Mexica civilization awaited the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy: the wandering tribes would find the destined site for a great city whose location would be signaled by an eagle with a snake in its beak perched atop a (Opuntia) cactus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mexica saw this vision on what was then a small swampy island in Lake Texcoco, a vision that is now immortalized in Mexico's coat of arms and on the Mexican flag. Not deterred by the unfavourable terrain, they set about building their city, using the chinampa system (misnamed as \\"floating gardens\\") for agriculture and to dry and expand the island.\\r\\n\\r\\nA thriving culture developed, and the Mexica civilization came to dominate other tribes around Mexico. The small natural island was perpetually enlarged as Tenochtitlan grew to become the largest and most powerful city in Mesoamerica. Commercial routes were developed that brought goods from places as far as the Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific Ocean and perhaps even the Inca Empire.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a flood of Lake Texcoco, the city was rebuilt under the rule of Ahuitzotl in a style that made it one of the grandest ever in Mesoamerica.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpanish conquistador Hernn Corts arrived in Tenochtitlan on November 8, 1519. With an estimated population between 200,000 and 300,000, many[who?] scholars believe Tenochtitlan to have been among the largest cities in the world at that time.[14] Compared to the cities of Europe, only Paris, Venice and Constantinople might have rivaled it. It was five times the size of the London of Henry VIII.[6] In a letter to the Spanish king, Corts wrote that Tenochtitlan was as large as Seville or C‹árdoba. Cortes' men were in awe at the sight of the splendid city and many wondered if they were dreaming.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough some popular sources put the number as high as 350,000,[16] the most common estimates of the population are of over 200,000 people. One of the few comprehensive academic surveys of Mesoamerican city and town sizes arrived at a population of 212,500 living on 13.5?km2 (5.2?sq?mi),[17] It is also said that at one time, Moctezuma had rule over an empire of almost five million people in central and southern Mexico because he had extended his rule to surrounding territories to gain tribute and prisoners to sacrifice to the gods.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Corts and his men arrived in Tenochtitlan, Moctezuma II, who precariously ruled over a large empire, chose to welcome Corts as an honored guest, rather than risk a war which might quickly be joined by aggrieved indigenous people. Moctezuma may have feared that Corts was the returning god Quetzalcoat, because the Spanish arrival coincided with the close of an Aztec calendar cycle consistent with such a return. This claim is found in the Florentine Codex, among other early sources, and accepted as true in many later histories. However, some scholars doubt it.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Corts approached Tenochtitlan, the natives celebrated Toxcatl. At this event the most prominent warriors of altepetl[clarification needed] would dance in front of a huge statue of Huitzilopochtli. The Spanish leader, Pedro de Alvarado, who was left in charge, worried that the natives  planned a surprise attack. He captured three natives and tortured them until they said that this[clarification needed] was indeed true. There was no proof, however, but Alvarado decided to attack first. During the festival, the Spaniards came heavily armed and closed off every exit from the courtyard so that no one would escape. This happened during their last days in Tenochtitlan.[19].  \\r\\n\\r\\nNobles lined each side of the city's main causeway, which extended about a league.  Walking down the center came Moctezuma II, with two lords at his side, one his brother, the ruler of Iztapalapa. Corts dismounted and was greeted by the ruler and his lords, but forbidden to touch him. Corts gave him a necklace of crystals, placing it over his neck.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were then brought to a large house that would serve as their home for their stay in the city. Once they were settled, Moctezuma himself sat down and spoke with Corts. The great ruler declared that anything that they needed would be theirs to have.[21] He was thrilled to have visitors of such stature.  Although the Spaniards were seeking gold, Moctezuma expressed that he had very little of the sort, but all of it was to be given to Corts if he desired it.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince arriving in Tenochtitlan, Corts faced early trouble.  Leaving a post in Vera Cruz, the officer left in charge received a letter from Qualpopoca, the leader of Almera, asking to become a vassal of the Spaniards. He requested that officials be sent to him so that he could confirm his submission. To reach the province, the officers would have to travel through hostile land. The officer in charge of Vera Cruz decided to send four officers to meet with Qualpopoca.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they arrived, they were captured and two were killed, the other two escaping through the woods. Upon their return to Vera Cruz, the officer in charge was infuriated, and led troops to storm Almera. Here they learned that Moctezuma was supposedly the one who ordered the officers executed.[24] Back in Tenochtitlan, Corts detained Moctezuma and questioned him.[25] Though no serious conclusions were reached, this started the relationship between Moctezuma and the Spaniards on a bad note.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nCorts subsequently besieged Tenochtitlan for 75 days, causing a famine;[7] directed the systematic destruction and leveling of the city;[27] and began its rebuilding, despite opposition, with a central area designated for Spanish use (the traza). The outer Indian section, now dubbed San Juan Tenochtitlan, continued to be governed by the previous indigenous elite and was divided into the same subdivisions as before.[28] While the people of Tenochtitlan were celebrating the few Spaniards who were not able to escape and were killed, the city was in great ruins.[clarification needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people of Tenochtitlan were exposed to diseases. Someone who was exposed would not feel it for the first ten days, then the disease would spread throughout the body, causing many sores, pain in the body and high fever. People were weak to the point that they could not move, nor  obtain food and water. They couldn't cook or bury the remaining dead bodies from the conquest. The population of the people of Tenochtitlan began to starve and weaken. The death toll rose steadily over the course of the next 60 days.[29][when?]\\r\\n\\r\\nCorts founded the Spanish capital of Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan. Despite the extensive damage to the built environment, the site retained symbolic power and legitimacy as the capital of the Aztec empire, which Corts sought to appropriate. For a time this ciudad de espa?oles, the highest rank in the Spanish hierarchy of settlement designation, was called Mexico-Tenochtitlan. Charles Gibson devotes the final chapter of his classic work, The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule, to what he called \\"The City,\\"[30] with later historians building on his work.[31] The Spaniards established a cabildo or town council, which had jurisdiction over the Spanish residents. The Spanish established a Europeans-only zone in the center of the city, an area of 13 blocks in each direction of the central plaza, which was the traza.  Although many native residents died during the siege of Tenochtitlan, the indigenous still had a strong presence in the city, and were settled in two main areas of the island, designated San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco, each with a municipal council that functioned the entire colonial period. San Juan Tenochtitlan was a Spanish administrative creation, which amalgamated four indigenous sections, with each losing territory to the Spanish traza.  The Spanish laid out the streets of the traza in a checker board pattern, with straight streets and plazas at intervals, whereas the indigenous portions of the city were irregular in layout and built of modest materials. In the colonial period both San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco retained jurisdiction over settlements on the mainland that they could draw on for labor and tribute demanded by the Spanish, but increasingly those subordinate settlements (sujetos) were able to gain their autonomy with their own rulers and separate relationship with the Spanish rulers.[32] Concern about the health of the indigenous population in early post-conquest Mexico-Tenochtilan led to the founding of a royal hospital for indigenous residents.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a number of colonial-era pictorial manuscripts dealing with Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco, which shed light on litigation between Spaniards and indigenous over property.[34] An account with information about the war of Tenochtitlan against its neighbor Tlatelolco in 1473 and the Spanish conquest in 1521 is the Anales de Mexico y Tlatelolco, 1473, 1521-22.[35] Anthropologist Susan Kellogg has studied colonial-era inheritance patterns of Nahuas in Mexico City, using Nahuatl- and Spanish-language testaments.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nTenochtitlan's main temple complex, the Templo Mayor, was dismantled and the central district of the Spanish colonial city was constructed on top of it. The great temple was destroyed by the Spanish during the construction of a cathedral. The location of the Templo Mayor was rediscovered in the early 20th century, but major excavations did not take place until 1978√ø1982, after utility workers came across a massive stone disc depicting the nude dismembered body of the moon goddess Coyolxauhqui.  The disc is 3.25 meters (10?ft 8?in) in diameter, and is held at the Templo Mayor Museum.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ruins, constructed over seven periods, were built on top of each other.  The resulting weight of the structures caused them to sink into the sediment of Lake Texcoco; the ruins now rest at an angle instead of horizontally.\\r\\n\\r\\nMexico City's Z‹ácalo, the Plaza de la Constituci‹án, is located at the site of Tenochtitlan's original central plaza and market, and many of the original calzadas still correspond to modern city streets. The Aztec calendar stone was located in the ruins. This stone is 4 meters (13?ft 1?in) in diameter and weighs over 20 short tons (17.9 long tons; 18.1 metric tons). It was once located half-way up the great pyramid. This sculpture was carved around 1470 under the rule of King Axayacatl, the predecessor of Tizoc, and is said to tell the history of the Mexicas and to prophesy the future.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1987, archaeologists discovered a mix of 1,789 human bones five meters (16?ft 5?in) below street level in Mexico City.[39] The burial dates back to the 1480s and lies at the foot of the main temple in the sacred ceremonial precinct of the Aztec capital. The bones are from children, teenagers and adults. A complete skeleton of a young woman was also found at the site.[39]","input":"Where was the village that later became tenochtitlan built?"},{"output":"Rickey Henderson","context":"In baseball statistics, a stolen base is credited to a baserunner when he successfully advances to the next base while the pitcher is throwing the ball to home plate. Under Rule 7.01 of Major League Baseball's (MLB) Official Rules, a runner acquires the right to an unoccupied base when he touches it before he is out.[1] Stolen bases were more common in baseball's dead-ball era, when teams relied more on stolen bases and hit and run plays than on home runs.[2]\\r\\nAs of September 2017[update], Rickey Henderson holds the MLB career stolen base record with 1,406.[3] He is the only MLB player to have reached the 1,000 stolen bases milestone in his career.[3] Following Henderson is Lou Brock with 938 stolen bases;[3] Billy Hamilton is third on the all-time steals listing.

Vitale, 370 U.S. 421 (1962), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case that ruled it is unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and encourage its recitation in public schools.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe case was brought by a group of families of public school students in New Hyde Park, New York, who complained that the voluntary prayer written by the state board of regents to \\"Almighty God\\" contradicted their religious beliefs. Led by Steven Engel, a Jewish man,[1] the plaintiffs sought to challenge the constitutionality of the state's prayer in school policy. They were supported by groups opposed to the school prayer including rabbinical organizations, Ethical Culture, and Jewish organizations. The acting parties were not members of one particular religion; despite being listed in the court papers as an atheist, plaintiff Lawrence Roth later denied that and described himself as religious but uncomfortable with prayer.[2] The five plaintiffs were made up of three Jews and two self-proclaimed \\"spiritual\\" people who did not belong to any one organized religion. The prayer in question was:\\r\\nAlmighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our country. Amen.[3]\\r\\nThe plaintiffs argued that opening the school day with such a prayer violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (as applied to the states through the Fourteenth), which says in part, \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\\" The governments of twenty-two states signed on to an amicus curiae brief urging affirmance of the New York Court of Appeals decision that upheld the constitutionality of the prayer.[4] The American Jewish Committee, the Synagogue Council of America, and the American Ethical Union each submitted briefs urging the Court to instead reverse and rule that the prayer was unconstitutional.[5]\\r\\nIn an opinion delivered by Justice Hugo Black, the Court ruled that government-written prayers were not to be recited in public schools and were a violation of the U.S. Constitution and the Establishment Clause of the first amendment. This was decided in a vote of 6-1, but before the decision could be announced, Justice Felix Frankfurter suffered a cerebral stroke that forced him to retire, and Justice Byron White took no part in the case.[6]\\r\\nThe Court explained the importance of separation between church and state by giving a lengthy history of the issue, beginning with the 16th century in England. It then stated that school's prayer is a religious activity by the very nature of it being a prayer, and that prescribing such a religious activity for school children violates the Establishment Clause. The program, created by government officials to promote a religious belief, was therefore constitutionally impermissible.\\r\\nThe Court rejected the defendant's arguments that people are not asked to respect any specific established religion; and that the prayer is voluntary. The Court held that the mere promotion of a religion is sufficient to establish a violation, even if that promotion is not coercive. The Court further held that the fact that the prayer is vaguely worded enough not to promote any particular religion is not a sufficient defense, as it still promotes a family of religions (those that recognize \\"Almighty God\\"), which still violates the Establishment Clause.\\r\\nEngel became the basis for several subsequent decisions limiting government-directed prayer in school. In Wallace v. Jaffree (1985), the Supreme Court ruled Alabama's law permitting one minute for prayer or meditation was unconstitutional. In Lee v. Weisman (1992), the court prohibited clergy-led prayer at middle school graduation ceremonies. Lee v. Weisman, in turn, was a basis for Santa Fe ISD v. Doe (2000), in which the Court extended the ban to school-organized student-led prayer at high school football games.","input":"What was the engel v. vitale case about?"},{"output":"English","context":"Coordinates: 1525N 6120W? / ?15.417N 61.333W? / 15.417; -61.333\\r\\nin the Caribbean??(light yellow)\\r\\nDominica (/d??m??n?k?/ or /?d?m??ni?k?/; French: Dominique; Island Carib: Waitu kubuli), officially the Commonwealth of Dominica, is a sovereign island country.[8] The capital, Roseau, is located on the leeward side of the island. It is part of the Windward Islands in the Lesser Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean Sea. The island lies south-southeast of Guadeloupe and northwest of Martinique. Its area is 750?km2 (290?sq?mi), and the highest point is Morne Diablotins, at 1,447?m (4,747?ft) in elevation. The population was 71,293 at the 2011 census.[5]\\r\\nThe island was originally inhabited by the Kalinago and later colonised by Europeans, predominantly by the French from the 1690s to 1763. Columbus is said to have passed the island on Sunday, 3 November 1493, and the island's name is derived from the Latin for \\"Sunday\\". Great Britain took possession in 1763 after its defeat of France in the Seven Years' War, and it gradually established English as the official language. The island republic gained independence in 1978.\\r\\nIts name is pronounced with stress falling either on second syllable of the word, after the Latin word d?m?n?c? \\"lordly\\", or on the third syllable, after the French name Dominique. Dominica has been nicknamed the \\"Nature Isle of the Caribbean\\" for its natural environment.[9] It is the youngest island in the Lesser Antilles, still being formed by geothermal-volcanic activity, as evidenced by the world's second-largest hot spring, called Boiling Lake. The island has lush mountainous rainforests, and is the home of many rare plants, animals, and bird species. There are xeric areas in some of the western coastal regions, but heavy rainfall occurs inland. The Sisserou parrot, also known as the imperial amazon and found only on Dominica, is the island's national bird and featured on the national flag. Dominica's economy depends on tourism and agriculture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe precolonial inhabitants were the Island Caribs. Its pre-Columbian name by the Caribs was Waitu kubuli, which means \\"Tall is her body\\".[10] The island was named from the Latin word dies Dominica for Sunday, the day on which the island was spotted by Christopher Columbus in November 1493. Some Spanish settled here. But, as European explorers and settlers entered the region, indigenous refugees from surrounding islands settled Dominica and pushed out the Spanish settlers. They went to other areas that were easier to control and had more natural resources.\\r\\nSpain had little success in colonising Dominica. In 1632, the French Compagnie des ?les de l'Amrique claimed it and other \\"Petites Antilles\\" for France, but no physical occupation took place. Between 1642 and 1650, French missionary Raymond Breton became the first regular European visitor to the island.\\r\\nIn 1660, the French and English agreed that Dominica and St. Vincent should not be settled, but left to the Caribs as neutral territory. But its natural resources attracted expeditions of English and French foresters, who began harvesting timber.[11] In 1690, the French established their first permanent settlements. French woodcutters from Martinique and Guadeloupe began to set up timber camps to supply the French islands with wood, and they gradually became permanent settlers. They brought the first enslaved Africans from West Africa to Dominique, as they called it.\\r\\nIn 1715, a revolt of \\"poor white\\" smallholders in the north of Martinique, known as La Gaoul,[12] caused settlers to migrate to southern Dominique, where they set up smallholdings. Meanwhile, French families and others from Guadeloupe settled in the north. In 1727, the first French commander, M. Le Grand, took charge of the island with a basic French government; Dominique formally became a colony of France, and the island was divided into districts or \\"quarters\\".[13] Already installed in Martinique and Guadeloupe, where they cultivated sugarcane on large plantations with enslaved workers, the French gradually developed plantations in Dominique for coffee. They imported so many African slaves to fill the labour demands that the population became predominantly African in ethnicity.\\r\\nIn 1761, during the Seven Years' War in Europe, a British expedition against Dominica led by Andrew Rollo conquered the island, along with several other Caribbean islands. In 1763, France had lost the war and ceded the island to Great Britain under the Treaty of Paris. The same year, the British established a legislative assembly, representing only European colonists. French remained the official language, but Antillean Creole, which had developed from it, was spoken by most of the population. In 1778 the French, with the active co-operation of the population, began the Invasion of Dominica. This was ended by the Treaty of Paris (1783). French invasions in 1795 and 1805 ended in failure.[11]\\r\\nGreat Britain established a small colony in 1805. It used Dominica as part of the triangular trade, by which slaves were brought to the islands as part of a trade that included shipping sugar and coffee to Europe. The best documented slave estate on the island is Hillsborough Estate, which had 71 male and 68 female slaves. The Greg family were notable: Thomas Hodgson, a brother-in-law, owned a slave ship, and Thomas Greg and his son John Greg part owned sugar plantations on Dominica. In January 1814, 20 slaves absconded. They were recorded as recaptured and punished with 100 lashes applied to the males and 50 for the females. The slaves believed that one of their people had died in the plantation hospital, and they believed he had been poisoned.[14][15]\\r\\nIn 1831, reflecting a liberalisation of official British racial attitudes, the Brown Privilege Bill[16] conferred political and social rights on free blacks (mostly free people of colour, who generally were of mixed race). With the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833, Britain ended the institution of slavery throughout its empire, except in India, where it was considered part of the culture.\\r\\nWith freedom came enfranchisement. In 1835, the first three men of African descent were elected to the legislative assembly. Many slaves from the neighbouring French colonial islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique fled to Dominica. In 1838, Dominica became the first colony of the British West Indies to have an elected legislature controlled by an ethnic African majority. Most of these legislators had been free people of color and smallholders or merchants before the abolition of slavery. Their economic and social views were different from the interests of the small, wealthy English planter class. Reacting to a perceived threat to their power, the planters lobbied for more direct British rule.[11]\\r\\nIn 1865, after much agitation and tension, the colonial office replaced the elective assembly with one that had half its members elected and one-half who were appointed. Planters allied with colonial administrators outmaneuvered the elected legislators on many occasions. In 1871, Dominica became part of the British Leeward Islands. The political power of the ethnic African population progressively eroded. Crown colony government was re-established in 1896. All political rights were curtailed for people of colour and blacks, who were the overwhelming majority of the population. Development aid, offered as compensation for disfranchisement, resulted in negligible improvements in conditions for most ethnic Africans.[11]\\r\\nIn World War I, many Dominicans, mainly the sons of small farmers, volunteered to fight in Europe for the British Empire. After the war, an upsurge of political consciousness throughout the Caribbean led to the formation of the Representative Government Association. Marshaling public frustration with the lack of a voice in governing Dominica, this group won one-third of the popularly elected seats of the legislative assembly in 1924, and one-half in 1936. Shortly thereafter, Dominica was transferred from the Leeward Island Administration.[11] During World War II, some Dominicans volunteered in British and Caribbean forces. Thousands of Free French refugees from Martinique and Guadeloupe escaped to Dominica from the Vichy-controlled French islands. They stayed in Roseau and villages.\\r\\nUntil 1958, Dominica was governed as part of the British Windward Islands. Caribbean islands sought independence from 1958 to 1962, and Dominica became a province of the short-lived West Indies Federation.[11] After the federation dissolved, Dominica in 1967 became an associated state of the United Kingdom, which formally took responsibility for its internal affairs. On 3 November 1978, the Commonwealth of Dominica was granted independence becoming a republic.[17][11] The British Crown was no longer the head of state.\\r\\nIn mid-1979, political discontent led to the formation of an interim government. After the 1980 elections, it was replaced by a government led by the Dominica Freedom Party under Prime Minister Eugenia Charles. She was the Caribbean's first female prime minister. Chronic economic problems were compounded by the severe damages of hurricanes in 1979 and in 1980.\\r\\nIn 1981, Dominica was threatened with a takeover by mercenaries[18] of Operation Red Dog, led by Mike Perdue of Houston and Wolfgang Droege of Toronto. They tried to overthrow the Charles government. These North American mercenaries were to help ex-Prime Minister Patrick John and his Dominica Defence Force regain control of the island, in exchange for control over its future development. The United States FBI was tipped off, and the ship hired to transport the mercenaries never left dock. The mercenaries lacked formal military experience or training, and most of the crew had been misled into joining by the ringleader Mike Perdue. White supremacist Don Black was also jailed for his part in the attempt, which violated US neutrality laws.[19]\\r\\nBy the end of the 1980s, the economy recovered. It weakened again in the 1990s due to a decrease in banana prices and worldwide recession.[11]\\r\\nIn the January 2000 elections, the Edison James United Workers Party (UWP) was defeated by the Dominican Labour Party (DLP), led by Roosevelt P. \\"Rosie\\" Douglas. Douglas died after only a few months in office. He was replaced by Pierre Charles, who died in office in January 2004. Roosevelt Skerrit, also of the DLP, replaced Charles as Prime Minister. Under Prime Minister Skerrit's leadership, the DLP won elections in May 2005 that gave the party 12 seats in the 21-member Parliament, to the UWP's 8 seats. An independent candidate affiliated with the DLP won a seat as well. Later, the independent candidate joined the government and one UWP member crossed the aisle, making the total 14 seats for the DLP and 7 for the UWP.[11]\\r\\nIn the December 2009 elections, DLP won 18 of 21 seats. UWP claimed campaign improprieties and boycotted Parliament; by-elections were conducted for two of its seats in July 2010, and the UWP again won the seats.[20] On 17 September 2012 Eliud Thaddeus Williams was sworn in as President, replacing Dr Nicholas Liverpool who was reportedly removed from office due to ill health. On 30 September 2013, former Trade Union Leader and agitator Charles Savarin was elected President having only days before resigned as a Minister of Government.\\r\\nOn 18 September 2017, Dominica suffered a direct landfall from Category 5 Hurricane Maria.[21] Early estimates of damage suggested 90% of the buildings on the island had been destroyed. The infrastructure is also in ruins.[22][23] Britain, France and the Netherlands have set up shipping and air lifts to take aid to the island, but the scale of destruction has left most people homeless and desperate.\\r\\nDominica is an island nation in the Caribbean Sea, the northernmost of the Windward Islands (though it is sometimes considered the southernmost of the Leeward Islands). The size of the country is about 289.5 square miles (750?km2).\\r\\nDominica is largely covered by rainforest and is home to the world's second-largest hot spring, Boiling Lake.[24] Dominica has many waterfalls, springs, and rivers. The Calibishie area in the country's northeast has sandy beaches.[25] Some plants and animals thought to be extinct on surrounding islands can still be found in Dominica's forests.[26] The island has several protected areas, including Cabrits National Park, as well as 365 rivers.\\r\\nMorne Trois Pitons National Park is a tropical forest blended with volcanic features.[27] It was recognised as a World Heritage Site on 4 April 1995, a distinction it shares with four other Caribbean islands.[28]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica is engaged in a long-running dispute with Venezuela over Venezuela's territorial claims to the sea surrounding Isla Aves (literally Bird Island, but in fact called Bird Rock by Dominica authorities),[29] a tiny islet located 140 miles (225?km) west of the island of Dominica.\\r\\nDuring a visit to Venezuela, Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit, in June 2006, stated that Aves Island belongs to Venezuela, ending the territorial claim but not a maritime claim.\\r\\nThere are two primary population centres: Roseau (with 14,725 inhabitants in 2011) and Portsmouth (with 4,167 inhabitants in 2011).\\r\\nDominica, known as \\"The Nature Island of the Caribbean\\" due to its spectacular, lush, and varied flora and fauna, which are protected by an extensive natural park system; the most mountainous of the Lesser Antilles, its volcanic peaks are cones of lava craters and include Boiling Lake, the second-largest, thermally active lake in the world possesses the most pristine wilderness in the Caribbean.[30] Originally, it was protected by sheer mountains which led the European powers to build ports and agricultural settlements on other islands. More recently,[when?] the citizens of this island have sought to preserve the natural environment by discouraging the type of high-impact tourism which has damaged nature in other parts of the Caribbean.[citation needed]\\r\\nVisitors can find large tropical forests, including one which is on the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites, hundreds of streams, coastlines and coral reefs.\\r\\nDominica is home to local artisans and traditional craftsman who cater to tourists, although not a thriving high end art scene.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Sisserou parrot (Amazona imperialis) is Dominica's national bird and is endemic to its mountain forests. A related species, the Jaco or red-necked parrot (A. arausiaca), is also a Dominican endemic. Both birds are rare and protected, though some forest is still threatened by logging in addition to the long-standing threat of hurricanes.\\r\\nThe Caribbean Sea offshore of the island of Dominica is home to many cetaceans. Most notably a group of sperm whales live in this area year-round. Other cetaceans commonly seen in the area include spinner dolphins, pantropical spotted dolphins and bottlenose dolphins. Less commonly seen animals include killer whales, false killer whales, pygmy sperm whales, dwarf sperm whales, Risso's dolphins, common dolphins, Atlantic spotted dolphins, humpback whales and Bryde's whales. This makes Dominica a destination for tourists interested in whale-watching.\\r\\nDominica is especially vulnerable to hurricanes as the island is located in what is referred to as the hurricane region. In 1979, Hurricane David struck the island as a Category?4 hurricane, causing widespread and extreme damage. On 17 August 2007, Hurricane Dean, a Category?1 hurricane at the time, hit the island. A mother and her seven-year-old son died when a landslide caused by the heavy rains crushed their house.[31] In another incident two people were injured when a tree fell on their house.[32] Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit estimated that 100 to 125 homes were damaged, and that the agricultural sector was extensively damaged, in particular the banana crop.[33] In August 2015, Tropical Storm Erika caused extensive flooding and landslides across the island. Multiple communities were evacuated and upwards of 30 people were killed.[34] According to a Rapid Damage and Impact Assessment prepared for Dominica by the World Bank, the total damage and losses from the storm were US $484.82 million or 90% of Dominica's yearly GDP.[35] Category 5 Hurricane Maria struck the island in 2017.[36]\\r\\nDominica is a parliamentary democracy within the Commonwealth of Nations.[8] The capital is Roseau. The Commonwealth of Dominica is one of the Caribbean's few republics. The president is the head of state, while executive power rests with the cabinet, headed by the prime minister.[8] The unicameral parliament consists of the 30-member House of Assembly, which consists of 21 directly elected members and nine senators, who may either be appointed by the president or elected by the other members of the House of Assembly.[8]\\r\\nUnlike other former British colonies in the region, Dominica was never a Commonwealth realm, instead becoming a republic on independence. Dominica is a full and participating member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).\\r\\nDominica is also a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the US military, as covered under Article 98. In January 2008 Dominica joined the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas.[citation needed]\\r\\nDominica is divided into 10 parishes, given below with their 2011 Census populations:\\r\\nDominica's currency is the East Caribbean Dollar. In 2008, Dominica had one of the lowest per capita gross domestic product (GDP) rates of Eastern Caribbean states.[37][38] The country nearly had a financial crisis in 2003 and 2004, but Dominica's economy grew by 3.5% in 2005 and 4.0% in 2006, following a decade of poor performance. Growth in 2006 was attributed to gains in tourism, construction, offshore and other services, and some sub-sectors of the banana industry. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently praised the Government of Dominica for its successful macroeconomic reforms. The IMF also pointed out remaining challenges, including the need for further reductions in public debt, increased financial sector regulation, and market diversification.[11]\\r\\nBananas and other agriculture dominate Dominica's economy, and nearly one-third of the labour force works in agriculture. This sector, however, is highly vulnerable to weather conditions and to external events affecting commodity prices. In 2007, Hurricane Dean caused significant damage to the agricultural sector as well as the country's infrastructure, especially roads. In response to reduced European Union (EU) banana trade preferences, the government has diversified the agricultural sector by promoting the production of coffee, patchouli, aloe vera, cut flowers, and exotic fruits such as mango, guava, and papaya.\\r\\nThe expected increase of Dominicas Citizenship by Investment (CBI) fees has been suspended with no implementation date in sight, as announced by Hon. Prime Minister of Dominica, Roosevelt Skerrit, in the 2016 budget speech.[39]\\r\\nDominica is a beneficiary of the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) that grants duty-free entry into the United States for many goods. Dominica also belongs to the predominantly English-speaking Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME), and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).[11]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica is becoming in recent years a major international financial centre. The largest sectors are \\"offshore banking, payment processing companies, and general corporate activities\\". Regulation and supervision of the financial services industry is the responsibility of the Financial Service Unit of the Commonwealth of Dominica (FSU) under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance. There are a number of service providers. These include global financial institutions including Scotiabank, Royal Bank of Canada, Cathedral Investment Bank, First Caribbean International Bank, and The Interoceanic Bank of the Caribbean.\\r\\nStarting in the mid-late 1990s, offshore financial centres, such as the Commonwealth of Dominica, came under increasing pressure from the OECD for their allegedly harmful tax regimes, where the OECD wished to prevent low-tax regimes from having an advantage in the global marketplace. The OECD threatened to place the Commonwealth of Dominica and other financial centres on a \\"black list\\" and impose sanctions against them.[40] However, the Commonwealth of Dominica successfully avoided being placed on the OECD black list by committing to regulatory reform to improve transparency and begin information exchange with OECD member countries about their citizens.[40]\\r\\nDominica supposedly offers tax-free status to companies locating from abroad. It is not known how many companies benefit from the tax-free status because of the strict confidentiality the government enforces, although it is known many Internet businesses and hedge funds utilise Dominica for this reason. However, on 12 July 2012 Dominica signed an agreement with Poland to exchange tax information.[41]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica offers an official and legally mandated economic citizenship to those seeking a valid second passport. The nationality law of Dominica authorises the government to waive the normal requirement of seven years of legal residence to acquire citizenship in exchange for a cash contribution. Total costs excluding all fees for a single applicant are US$100,000, with a discount for additional passports for spouses and children. Alternatively, since 2014, applicants can make a US$200,000 real estate investment, in which case the cost of citizenship is US$50,000.[42] According to officials, the citizenship programme was an economic and fiscal \\"lifeline\\" in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Erika, and its new investment option had become the main source of Foreign Direct Investment into Dominica by early 2016.[43] The Dominica passport holders can travel without a visa, or obtain a visa upon entry, to over 100 countries and territories, including the United Kingdom and the Schengen zone. Applying for Dominica citizenship requires interacting with official Government Approved Economic Citizenship Agents.[44]\\r\\nThe government's management of the economic citizenship programme and a perceived lack of transparency in the use of the revenues generated are a frequent topic of heated domestic political controversy. Referring to the opposition, Prime Minister Skerrit in 2016 stated that \\"If they can discredit the Citizenship by Investment Program and make Dominica an unattractive place to obtain citizenship, then revenues would fall and the government would not be able to rebuild the country. Or, the government would then have to increase taxes on the people; making itself unpopular in their sight.\\"[45] Lennox Linton, leader of the opposition United Workers Party, has stated that if elected, he would continue the citizenship programme while making its operations more transparent.[46]\\r\\nDominica is mostly volcanic and has few beaches; therefore, tourism has developed more slowly than on neighbouring islands. Nevertheless, Dominica's mountains, rainforests, freshwater lakes, hot springs, waterfalls, and diving spots make it an attractive eco-tourism destination. Cruise ship stopovers have increased following the development of modern docking and waterfront facilities in Roseau, the capital.[11] Out of 22 Caribbean islands tracked, Dominica had the fewest visitors in 2008 (55,800 or 0.3% of the total). This was about half as many as visited Haiti.[47] The volcanic nature of the island has attracted scuba divers.\\r\\nThere are two regional airports on the island, but no international airports. Therefore, flying to Dominica requires travelling through San Juan, Puerto Rico or other nearby islands in the Caribbean such as Martinique. The primary airport, Douglas-Charles Airport (DOM), is on the northeast coast and is about a 45-minute drive from Portsmouth (1 hour from Roseau). The second is Canefield Airport (DCF), about 15 minutes from Roseau on the southwest coast. Douglas-Charles Airport is suitable for limited use of commercial jets because of runway length. Douglas-Charles currently has regular service by Air Sunshine, Winair, Seaborne Airlines and LIAT using twin turboprop aircraft like the ATR & Saab 340, as well as Conviasa and Amerijet, which, using Boeing 727 Freighters, is the only airline with jet service to the republic. A runway extension and service upgrade project began at Douglas-Charles Airport around 2006 and was finished in 2010. In March 2013, airline American Eagle halted flights to the island citing high labour costs.[48]\\r\\nDominica's road network runs primarily along the coastline and along river valleys. Major roads are two-lane highways which connect the capital, Roseau, with Portsmouth (Edward Oliver Leblanc Highway) and the Douglas Charles Airport (Dr. Nicholas Liverpool Highway). It takes about 45 minutes to drive from Portsmouth to Roseau. Private minibuses form the major public transport system. These major roads were recently reconstructed with assistance from the People's Republic of China and the European Union.[49][50]\\r\\nDue to Tropical Storm Erika, several road surfaces and bridges were damaged by flooding and landslides, including on the newly completed E.O. LeBlanc (Roseau to Portsmouth) and Dr. Nicholas Liverpool Highways (Pont Cass to Douglas Charles Airport).[51]\\r\\nDominica's electricity sector includes power from hydroelectricity, solar energy, and geothermal energy.[52]\\r\\nThe vast majority of Dominicans are of African descent. There is a growing mixed population along with a small European origin minority (descendants of French and British colonists along with some people of Irish descent) and there are small numbers of Lebanese, Syrians and Asians. Dominica is also the only Eastern Caribbean island that still has a population of pre-Columbian native Kalinago (previously called Caribs), who were exterminated or driven from neighbouring islands. As of 2014[update] there are more than 3,000 Kalinago remaining. They live in eight villages on the east coast of Dominica. This special Carib Territory (now Kalinago Territory) was granted by the British Crown in 1903.[53] There are also about 1,000 medical students from the United States and Canada who study at the Ross University School of Medicine in Portsmouth.\\r\\nThe population growth rate of Dominica is very low, due primarily to emigration to other countries. In the early 21st century, emigrant numbers for the most popular countries are as follows: the United States (8,560), the United Kingdom (6,739), Canada (605) and France (394).\\r\\nDominica has a relatively large number of centenarians. As of March 2007, there are 22 centenarians out of the island's 70,000 inhabitantsthree times the average incidence of centenarianism in developed countries.[54] The reasons for this are the subject of current research being undertaken at Ross University School of Medicine.\\r\\nDominica was partially integrated into the federal colony of the Leeward Islands in 1832. Later, in 1871, it became a full part of the Federation of the Leeward Islands. From the start it was a peculiar relationship for previously Dominica had played no part in the political or cultural traditions of the other more Anglophone islands of the federation. Now, as a Leeward Island, this much larger territory, with thousands of acres of forested unclaimed land, was open to the people of Montserrat and Antigua. At the beginning of the 20th century the Rose's Company, which produced Rose's lime juice, saw demand for its product outgrow its ability to supply the product from Montserrat. Their response to the situation was to buy land on Dominica and encourage Montserrat farm labourers to relocate. As a result, there came to be two linguistic communities in Dominica, Wesley and Marigot.\\r\\nIn 1902, on 8 May, the Mount Pele volcano on Martinique erupted destroying the city of Saint-Pierre. Refugees from Martinique arrived in boats to the southern villages of Dominica and some remained permanently on the island.\\r\\nEnglish is the official language of Dominica and is universally spoken and understood. In addition, Dominican Creole French, an Antillean Creole based on French, is widely spoken. This is due to French occupation of the island during different times in history, and its location between the two French-speaking departments of Martinique and Guadeloupe. Since 1979, Dominica has been a member of La Francophonie. Dominican Creole is particularly used among the older generation, which also speaks a patois language. Because of a decline in the use of Creole by the younger generation, initiatives have been set up in an effort to increase usage and promote this unique part of the nation's history and culture.\\r\\nAlong with Creole, a dialect known as Kokoy (or Cockoy) is spoken.[55] It is a type of pidgin English which is a mix of Leeward Island English Creole and Dominican Creole,[56] and is mainly spoken in the north-eastern villages of Marigot and Wesley, by the descendants of immigrants from Montserrat and Antigua. Over time there has been much intermarrying, but there are still traces of difference in origin.[57] As a result of this mixture of languages and heritage, Dominica is a member of both the French-speaking Francophonie and the English-speaking Commonwealth of Nations.\\r\\nIsland Carib, also known as Igneri (I?eri, Ig?eri, Inyeri), was an Arawakan language historically spoken by the Island Caribs of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean. The Island Caribs lived throughout the southern Lesser Antilles such as Dominica, St Vincent and Trinidad, supposedly having conquered them from their previous inhabitants, the Igneri. Island Carib became extinct about 1920, but an offshoot survives as Garifuna, primarily in Central America.\\r\\nAbout 80% of the population is Roman Catholic,[citation needed] though in recent years a number of Protestant churches have been established.[citation needed] About 10√ø12% of the population belongs to one of the 7th day (Saturday) denominations, which includes Yahweh Congregation, Church of God (Seventh-Day) and the Seventh-day Adventist Church.[58]\\r\\nAccording to the Association of Religion Data Archives, in 2010 the World Christian Database reported that the largest non-Christian religious groups included: spiritualism followed by 2.6% of the population; Bahai followed by 1.7%; Agnosticism followed by 0.5%; Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam followed by 0.1% each; and Chinese folk religion, Neoreligions, and Atheism each followed by non-negligible (i.e. <0.1%) of the population.[59] The nation's first mosque was built recently near Ross University.[citation needed]\\r\\nSchool in Dominica is mandatory up to secondary school. After pre-school, pupils attend primary school for six or seven years, and are admitted into secondary school on the basis of a Common Entrance Exam. After five years the students take the General Certificate of Education (GCE), widely replaced by the current Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC or CXC) administered by the Caribbean Examination Council (a 15-member confederation of the Caribbean community (CARICOM). The more advanced version of this examination (CAPE) can be taken upon completion of two years of community college. The island has its own state college, formerly named Clifton Dupigny Community College. Some Dominicans attend universities in Cuba on scholarships offered by its government. Others go to the University of the West Indies or to universities in the United Kingdom, the United States, or other countries. Ross University,[60] a medical school, is located at Portsmouth. Ross has been operating in Dominica since the 1980s. Archbold Tropical Research and Education Center (ATREC),[61] a biological field station owned by Clemson University,[62] is located at Springfield Estate between Canefield and Pond Cass. In 2006, All Saints University School of Medicine[63] opened in temporary facilities in Loubire, with a permanent campus being constructed in Grand Bay. Currently All Saints is located in Roseau, Dominica. A marine biology institute in Mahaut, ITME (Institute for Tropical Marine Ecology), closed in 2009.\\r\\nDominica is home to a wide range of people. Although it was historically occupied by several native tribes, the Arawaks (Tainos) and Carib (Kalinago) tribes occupied it at the time European settlers reached the island. \\"Massacre\\" is a name of a river dedicated to the murders of the Native villagers by English settlers.[64] Both the French and British tried to claim the island and imported slaves from Africa for labour. The remaining Caribs now live on a 3,700-acre (15?km2) territory on the east coast of the island. They elect their own chief. This mix of cultures has produced the current culture.\\r\\nMusic and dance are important facets of Dominica's culture. The annual independence celebrations display a variety of traditional song and dance. Since 1997, there have also been weeks of Creole festivals, such as \\"Creole in the Park\\" and the \\"World Creole Music Festival\\".\\r\\nDominica gained prominence on the international music stage when in 1973, Gordon Henderson founded the group Exile One and an original musical genre, which he coined \\"Cadence-lypso\\". This paved the way for modern Creole music. Other musical genres include \\"Jing ping\\" and \\"Cadence\\". Jing ping features the accordion and is native to the island. Dominica's music is a melange of Haitian, Afro-Cuban, African and European traditions. Popular artists over the years include Chubby and the Midnight Groovers, Bells Combo, the Gaylords, WCK, and Triple Kay.\\r\\nThe 11th annual World Creole Music Festival was held in 2007, part of the island's celebration of independence from Great Britain on 3 November. A year-long reunion celebration began in January 2008, marking 30 years of independence.\\r\\nDominica is often seen as a society that is migrating from collectivism to that of individualism. The economy is a developing one that previously depended on agriculture. Signs of collectivism are evident in the small towns and villages which are spread across the island.\\r\\nThe famed novelist Jean Rhys was born and raised in Dominica. The island is obliquely depicted in her best-known book, Wide Sargasso Sea. Rhys's friend, the political activist and writer Phyllis Shand Allfrey, set her 1954 novel, The Orchid House (ISBN?0-8135-2332-X), in Dominica.\\r\\nMuch of the Walt Disney film Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (the second in the series, released on 7 July 2006), was shot on location on Dominica (though in the film it was known as \\"Pelegosto,\\" a fictional island), along with some shooting for the third film in the series, At World's End (released on 2 May 2007).\\r\\nDominica's cuisine is similar to that of other Caribbean islands, particularly Jamaica, Saint Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago. Like other Commonwealth Caribbean islands, Dominicans have developed a distinct twist to their cuisine. Breakfast is an important daily meal, typically including saltfish, dried and salted codfish, and \\"bakes\\" (fried dough). Saltfish and bakes are combined for a fast food snack that can be eaten throughout the day; vendors on Dominica's streets sell these snacks to passersby, together with fried chicken, fish and fruit and yogurt \\"smoothies\\". Other breakfast meals include cornmeal porridge, which is made with fine cornmeal or polenta, milk and condensed milk and sugar to sweeten. Traditional British-influenced dishes, such as eggs, bacon and toast, are also popular, as are fried fish and plantains.\\r\\nCommon vegetables include plantains, tanias (a root vegetable), yams, potatoes, rice and peas. Meat and poultry typically eaten include chicken (which is very popular), beef, and fish. These are often prepared in stews with onions, carrots, garlic, ginger and herbs like thyme. The vegetables and meat are browned to create a rich dark sauce. Popular meals include rice and peas, brown stew chicken, stew beef, fried and stewed fish, and many different types of hearty fish broths and soups. These are filled with dumplings, carrots and ground provisions.\\r\\nCricket is a popular sport on the island, and Dominica competes in test cricket as part of the West Indies cricket team. In West Indies domestic first-class cricket, Dominica participates as part of the Windward Islands cricket team, although they are often considered a part of the Leeward Islands geographically. This is due to being part of the British Windward Islands colony from 1940 until independence; its cricket federation remains a part of the Windward Islands Cricket Board of Control.\\r\\nOn 24 October 2007, the 8,000-seat Windsor cricket stadium was completed with a donation of EC$33?million (US$17?million, ?12?million) from the government of the People's Republic of China.\\r\\nNetball, Basketball, Rugby, tennis and football or soccer are gaining popularity as well.\\r\\nDuring the 2014 Winter Olympics, a husband and wife team of Gary di Silvestri and Angela Morrone di Silvestri spent US$175,000 to register as Dominican citizens and enter the 15?km men's and 10?km women's cross-country skiing events, respectively. Angela did not start her race, and Gary pulled out several hundred meters into his race. To date, they are Dominica's only Winter Olympic athletes.[65]\\r\\nDominica has two major newspapers, The Sun and The Chronicle. There are two national television stations and a few radio stations, including Stations include: ZBC-AM 590, the first private local radio station is called Radio En Ba Mango 93.5/96.9FM in the Village of Berricoa Grand Bay and is owned by Urban Dangleben, ZGBC-AM 740, ZGBC-FM 90.7 (Portsmouth), ZGBC-FM 102.1 (Roseau) and ZGBC-FM 106.1 (Marigot), Q95 FM,[66] the Dominica Broadcasting Corporation, and Kairi FM.[67] Before 2004, there were two telecommunication companies Cable and Wireless and Marpin TV[68] founded by Dominican, Ronald Bernard Maroni Abraham. In 2005, Digicel and a UK-based company Orange started to offer service to the island. There are a number of mobile networks operating on the island; LIME and Digicel compete for most of Dominica's wireless customers. Orange shut down in 2010 and is no longer operating on the island of Dominica.\\r\\nVillage of Scotts Head at southwestern tip\\r\\nRoseau photographed from a docked cruise ship\\r\\nTypical landscape near the sea along the eastern coast\\r\\nTypical inland scenery\\r\\nCalibishie beach landscape\\r\\nClick on a coloured area to see an article about English in that country or region","input":"What language do they speak in the island of dominica?"},{"output":"William Howe","context":"War of the Austrian Succession\\r\\nSeven Years' War\\r\\nAmerican War of Independence\\r\\nGeneral William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe, KB, PC (10 August 1729 √ø 12 July 1814) was a British Army officer who rose to become Commander-in-Chief of British forces during the American War of Independence. Howe was one of three brothers who had distinguished military careers.\\r\\nHaving joined the army in 1746, Howe saw extensive service in the War of the Austrian Succession and Seven Years' War. He became known for his role in the capture of Quebec in 1759 when he led a British force to capture the cliffs at Anse-au-Foulon, allowing James Wolfe to land his army and engage the French in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. Howe also participated in the campaigns to take Louisbourg, Belle ?le and Havana. He was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Wight, a post he would hold until 1795.\\r\\nHowe was sent to North America in March 1775, arriving in May after the American War of Independence broke out. After leading British troops to a costly victory in the Battle of Bunker Hill, Howe took command of all British forces in America from Thomas Gage in September of that year. Howe's record in North America was marked by the successful capture of both New York City and Philadelphia. However, poor British campaign planning for 1777 contributed to the failure of John Burgoyne's Saratoga campaign, which played a major role in the entry of France into the war. Howe's role in developing those plans and the degree to which he was responsible for British failures that year (despite his personal success at Philadelphia) have both been subjects of contemporary and historic debate.\\r\\nHe was knighted after his successes in 1776. He resigned his post as Commander in Chief, North America, in 1777, and the next year returned to England, where he was at times active in the defence of the British Isles. He sat in the House of Commons from 1758 to 1780. He inherited the Viscountcy of Howe upon the death of his brother Richard in 1799. He married, but had no children, and the viscountcy was extinguished with his death in 1814.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Howe was born in England, the third son of Emanuel Howe, 2nd Viscount Howe and Charlotte, the daughter of Sophia von Kielmansegg, Countess of Leinster and Darlington, an acknowledged illegitimate half-sister of King George I.[1][2] His mother was a regular in the courts of George II and George III.[2] This connection with the crown may have improved the careers of all four sons, but all were also very capable officers.[3] His father was a politician, who served as Governor of Barbados where he died in 1735.[1] William's eldest brother, General George Howe, was killed just before the 1758 Battle of Carillon at Fort Ticonderoga. Another brother, Admiral Richard Howe, rose to become one of Britain's leading naval commanders.[4] A third brother, Thomas, commanded ships for the East India Company, Winchelsea in 1762√ø4 and Nottingham in 1766, and made observations on Madeira[5] and on the Comoro Islands.[6]\\r\\nWilliam entered the army when he was 17 by buying a cornet's commission in the Duke of Cumberland's Dragoons in 1746. He then served for two years in Flanders during the War of the Austrian Succession. After the war he was transferred to the 20th Regiment of Foot, where he became a friend of James Wolfe.[7]\\r\\nDuring the Seven Years' War Howe's service first brought him to America, and did much to raise his reputation. He joined the newly formed 58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot in February 1757, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in December of that year.[8] He commanded the regiment at the Siege of Louisbourg in 1758, leading an amphibious landing under heavy enemy fire. This action won the attackers a flanking position and earned Howe a commendation from Wolfe.[9]\\r\\nHowe commanded a light infantry battalion under General Wolfe during the 1759 Siege of Quebec. He was in the Battle of Beaufort, and was chosen by Wolfe to lead the ascent from the Saint Lawrence River up to the Plains of Abraham that led to the British victory in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham on 13 September 1759.[7] After spending the winter in the defence of Quebec City,[8] his regiment fought in the April 1760 Battle of Sainte-Foy, and led a brigade in the capture of Montreal under Jeffery Amherst before returning to England. Howe led a brigade in the 1761 Capture of Belle ?le, off the French coast, and turned down the opportunity to become military governor after its capture so that he might continue in active service.[10] He served as adjutant general of the force that captured Havana in 1762, playing a part in a skirmish at Guanabacoa.[11]\\r\\nIn 1758, Howe was elected a member of parliament for Nottingham, succeeding to the seat vacated by his brother George's death. His election was assisted by the influence of his mother, who campaigned on behalf of her son while he was away at war,[8] and may very well have been undertaken because service in Parliament was seen as a common way to improve one's prospects for advancement in the military.[12] In 1764 he was promoted to colonel of the 46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot, and in 1768 he was appointed lieutenant governor of the Isle of Wight.[8] As tensions rose between Britain and the colonies in the 1770s, Howe continued to rise through the ranks, and came to be widely regarded as one of the best officers in the army.[10] He was promoted to major general in 1772, and in 1774 introduced new training drills for light infantry companies.[8]\\r\\nIn Parliament he was generally sympathetic to the American colonies. He publicly opposed the collection of legislation intended to punish the Thirteen Colonies known as Intolerable Acts, and in 1774 assured his constituents that he would resist active duty against the Americans and asserted that the entire British army could not conquer America.[13] He also let government ministers know privately that he was prepared to serve in America as second in command to Thomas Gage, whom he knew was unpopular in government circles.[14] In early 1775, when King George called on him to serve, he accepted, claiming publicly that if he did not, he would suffer \\"the odious name of backwardness to serve my country in distress.\\"[15] He sailed for America in March 1775, accompanied by Major Generals Henry Clinton and John Burgoyne.[16] In May 1775 his colonelcy was transferred to the 23rd Fusiliers.[17]\\r\\nAlong with fellow British Army Generals Clinton and Burgoyne, Howe arrived at Boston aboard the HMS?Cerberus on 25 May 1775, having learned en route that war had broken out with the skirmishes at the marches to Lexington and Concord in April.[18] It provided naval reinforcement at the Battle of Bunker Hill.[18] He led a force of 4,000 troops sent to reinforce the 5,000 troops under General Thomas Gage who were besieged in the city after those battles.[16] Gage, Howe, and Generals Clinton and Burgoyne discussed plans to break the siege. They formulated a plan to seize high ground around Boston and attack the besieging colonial militia forces, setting its execution for 18 June.[19] However, the colonists learned of the plan and fortified the heights of Breed's Hill and nearby Bunker Hill on the Charlestown peninsula across the Charles River from Boston on the night of 16√ø17 June,[20] forcing the British leadership to rethink their strategy.\\r\\nIn a war council held early on 17 June, the generals developed a plan calling for a direct assault on the colonial fortification, and Gage gave Howe command of the operation. Despite a sense of urgency (the colonists were still working on the fortifications at the time of the council), the attack, now known as the Battle of Bunker Hill, did not begin until that afternoon.[21] With Howe personally leading the right wing of the attack, the first two assaults were firmly repulsed by the colonial defenders. Howe's third assault gained the objective, but the cost of the day's battle was appallingly heavy.[22] The British casualties, more than 1,000 killed or wounded, were the highest of any engagement in the war.[23] Howe described it as a \\"success ... too dearly bought.\\"[24] Although Howe exhibited courage on the battlefield, his tactics and overwhelming confidence were criticised. One subordinate wrote that Howe's \\"absurd and destructive confidence\\" played a role in the number of casualties incurred.[24]\\r\\nAlthough Howe was not injured in the battle, it had a pronounced effect on his spirit. According to British historian George Otto Trevelyan, the battle \\"exercised a permanent and most potent influence\\" especially on Howe's behaviour, and that Howe's military skills thereafter \\"were apt to fail him at the very moment when they were especially wanted.\\"[25] Despite an outward appearance of confidence and popularity with his troops, the \\"genial six-footer with a face some people described as 'coarse'\\", privately often exhibited a lack of self-confidence, and in later campaigns became somewhat dependent on his older brother Richard (the admiral in the Royal Navy, also on station in the Colonies) for advice and approval.[26]\\r\\nOn 11 October 1775, General Gage sailed for England, and Howe took over as Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in America.[27] British military planners in London had, with the outbreak of hostilities, begun planning a massive reinforcement of the troops in North America. Their plans, made with recommendations from Howe, called for the abandonment of Boston and the establishment of bases in New York and Newport, Rhode Island in an attempt to isolate the rebellion to New England.[28] When orders arrived in November to execute these plans, Howe opted to remain in Boston for the winter and begin the campaign in 1776.[24] As a result, the remainder of the Siege of Boston was largely a stalemate. Howe never attempted a major engagement with the Continental Army, which had come under the command of Major General George Washington.[29] He did, however, spend a fair amount of time at the gambling tables, and allegedly established a relationship with Elizabeth Lloyd Loring, the wife of Loyalist Joshua Loring, Jr. Loring apparently acquiesced to this arrangement, and was rewarded by Howe with the position of commissary of prisoners.[30] Contemporaries and historians have criticised Howe for both his gambling and the amount of time he supposedly spent with Mrs. Loring, with some going so far as to level accusations that this behaviour interfered with his military activities; historian John Alden does not give these ideas credence.[31] The alleged relationship is also mentioned in The Battle of the Kegs, an American propaganda ballad written by Francis Hopkinson. In January 1776 Howe's role as commander in chief was cemented with a promotion to full general in North America.[32]\\r\\nThe siege was broken in March 1776 when Continental Army Colonel Henry Knox brought heavy artillery from Fort Ticonderoga to Boston during the winter, and General Washington used them to fortify Dorchester Heights, overlooking Boston and its harbour.[33] Howe at first planned an assault on this position, but a snowstorm interfered, and he eventually decided to withdraw from Boston.[34] On 17 March, British troops and Loyalists evacuated the city, and sailed for Halifax, Nova Scotia.[29]\\r\\nHowe and his troops began to arrive outside New York Harbour and made an uncontested landing on Staten Island to the west in early July.[35] Howe, whose orders from Lord George Germain, the Secretary of State responsible for directing the war from Westminster, were fairly clear that he should avoid conflict before the arrival of reinforcements, then waited until those reinforcements arrived in mid-August, along with the naval commander, his brother Richard.[36][37] This delay proved to be somewhat costly, since the Americans used this time to improve fortifications on northwestern Long Island (at Brooklyn Heights along the East River shoreline) and increased the size of their Continental Army with additional militia.[37] After moving most of his army by amphibious barges across the Verazzano Narrows to southwestern Long Island without opposition, he attacked the American positions on 27 August in what became known as the Battle of Long Island. In a well-executed manoeuvre, a large column led by Howe and Clinton passed around the American left flank, through the lightly guarded Jamaica Pass far to the east, (a ridge of hills running east to west bisected the island, with a series of lower entrances that were all guarded by Continentals except inexplicably to the farthest east at Jamaica), catching the Patriots off-guard and routing the Americans from their forward positions back into the entrenchments on Brooklyn Heights. Despite the urging of Clinton and others, Howe decided against an immediate assault on these fortifications, claiming \\"the Troops had for that day done handsomely enough.\\"[38] He instead began siege operations, methodically advancing on the entrenched Americans.[39] This decision allowed General Washington to successfully orchestrate a nighttime strategic withdrawal across the East River on the night of 29√ø30 August, aided by a thick morning fog.[40] Historian George Bilias notes that had Howe attacked Brooklyn Heights, the capture of even half of Washington's army, and possibly Washington himself, might have had a significant effect on the rebellion.[38] Some officers, notably General Clinton, were critical of Howe's decision not to storm the American works.[41] Howe was knighted as a reward for his victory on Long Island.[32]\\r\\nHowe and his brother Richard had, as part of their instructions, been assigned roles as peace commissioners, with limited authority to treat with the rebels. After Long Island, they pursued an attempt at reconciliation, sending the captured General John Sullivan to Philadelphia with a proposal for a peace conference. The meeting that resulted, conducted by Admiral Howe, was unsuccessful. The Howes had been given limited powers, as had the Congressional representatives, and the latter were insistent that the British recognise the recently declared colonial independence. This was not within the Howes' powers, so the conference failed, and Howe then continued the campaign.[42] He first landed troops on Manhattan on 15 September, and occupied New York City (which then occupied only Lower Manhattan), although his advance northward on Manhattan was checked the next day at Harlem Heights.[43] He then paused, spending nearly one month consolidating control of New York City and awaiting reinforcements.[44] During this time he ordered the execution of Nathan Hale for espionage, and had to deal with the effects of a major fire in the city.[45] He then attempted a landing on the mainland at Throgs Neck, intending to flank Washington's position at Harlem Heights. However, the narrow causeway between the beach and the mainland was well-defended, and he ended up withdrawing the troops.[46] He then made a successful landing of troops at Pell's Point in Westchester County; Washington managed to avoid being flanked, retreating to White Plains.[47] Howe successfully forced Washington out of the New York area in the 28 October Battle of White Plains, and then turned his attention to consolidate British hold on Manhattan.[48] In November he attacked the remaining Continental Army stronghold in the Battle of Fort Washington, taking several thousand prisoners.[49]\\r\\nWashington then retreated across New Jersey, followed by Howe's advance forces under Charles Cornwallis.[50] At this point, Howe prepared troops under the command of General Clinton for embarkation to occupy Newport, the other major goal of his plan. Clinton proposed that these troops instead be landed in New Jersey, either opposite Staten Island or on the Delaware River, trapping Washington or even capturing the seat of the Continental Congress, Philadelphia.[51] Howe rejected these proposals, despatching Clinton and General Hugh, Earl Percy, two vocal critics of his leadership, to take Newport.[52] In early December Howe came to Trenton, New Jersey to arrange the disposition of his troops for the winter. Washington had retreated all the way across the Delaware, and Howe returned to New York, believing the campaign to be ended for the season.[53] When Washington attacked the Hessian quarters at Trenton on 26 December 1776, Howe sent Cornwallis to reform the army in New Jersey and chase after Washington.[54] Cornwallis was frustrated in this, with Washington gaining a second victory at Trenton and a third at Princeton. Howe recalled the army to positions much closer to New York for the winter.[55]\\r\\nHowe has been criticised by contemporaries and historians for failing to decisively defeat the Continental Army during the New York campaign. Contemporaries complained that his landing in Westchester failed to trap Washington, but failed to understand that his goal in the campaign was to secure Manhattan, and not necessarily to defeat Washington.[56] However, historian George Billias observes that Howe's overly rigid adherence to his plans meant that he was unable to capitalise on the opportunities that arose during the campaign for a decisive action.[57]\\r\\nOn 30 November 1776, as Washington was retreating across New Jersey, Howe had written to Germain with plans for the 1777 campaign season. He proposed to send a 10,000-man force up the Hudson River to capture Albany, New York, in conjunction with an expedition sent south from Province of Quebec. He again wrote to Germain on 20 December 1776 with more elaborate proposals for 1777. These again included operations to gain control of the Hudson River, and included expanded operations from the base at Newport, and an expedition to take Philadelphia. The latter Howe saw as attractive, since Washington was then just north of the city: Howe wrote that he was \\"persuaded the Principal Army should act offensively [against Philadelphia], where the enemy's chief strength lies.\\"[58] Germain acknowledged that this plan was particularly \\"well digested\\", but it called for more men that Germain was prepared to provide.[59] After the setbacks in New Jersey, Howe in mid-January 1777 proposed operations against Philadelphia that included an overland expedition and a sea-based attack, thinking this might lead to a decisive victory over the Continental Army.[60] This plan was developed to the extent that in April, Howe's army was seen constructing pontoon bridges; Washington, lodged in his winter quarters at Morristown, New Jersey, thought they were for eventual use on the Delaware River.[61] However, by mid-May Howe had apparently abandoned the idea of an overland expedition: \\"I propose to invade Pennsylvania by sea ... we must probably abandon the Jersies.\\"[62]\\r\\nWhen the campaign season opened in May 1777, General Washington moved most of his army from its winter quarters in Morristown, New Jersey to a strongly fortified position in the Watchung Mountains.[63] In June 1777, Howe began a series of odd moves in New Jersey, apparently in an attempt to draw Washington and his army out of that position onto terrain more favourable for a general engagement.[64] His motives for this are uncertain; historian John Buchanan argues that Howe was determined to attempt to draw Washington into a major engagement while both were in northern New Jersey, writing that \\"Washington's shift in position had whetted Howe's appetite for a major action when, if everything went right, he would finally accomplish what he and his brother's policies had denied him the previous year: the destruction of the Continental Army\\",[65] but that Howe's underlying campaign goal for the season was Philadelphia.[66] One British major wrote that \\"[t]he report circulated by those in power is that it was thought necessary to march to Hilsborough [sic] to offer Washington battle.\\"[67] Americans like Henry Knox were perplexed but also concluded that was its purpose: \\"It was unaccountable that [the British] should stop short when they had gone only nine miles ... In the course of a day or two [we] discovered that they ... had come out with an intention of drawing us into the plain.\\"[67] Washington had intelligence that Howe had moved without taking the heavy river-crossing equipment, and was apparently not fooled at all.[68]\\r\\nWhen Washington failed to take the bait, Howe withdrew the army to Perth Amboy, under harassment by Colonel Daniel Morgan's elite light unit, Morgan's Riflemen, who used their superior weapons to snipe at and harry his forces as they moved. Washington moved down to a more exposed position, assuming Howe was going to embark his army on ships. Howe then launched a lightning strike designed to cut Washington's retreat off. This attempt was foiled by the Battle of Short Hills, which gave Washington time to retreat to a more secure position. Howe then did in fact embark his army and sailed south with his brother's fleet. Howe maintained an effective secrecy surrounding the fleet's destination: not only did Washington not know where it was going, neither did many British rank and file.[69]\\r\\nHowe's campaign for Philadelphia began with an amphibious landing at Head of Elk, Maryland, southwest of the city in late August. Although Howe would have preferred to make a landing on the Delaware River below Philadelphia, reports of well-prepared defences dissuaded him, and the fleet spent almost an entire extra month at sea to reach Head of Elk.[70] Howe's army left Head of Elk early on 3 September 1777 and pushed back an advance guard of American light infantry at Cooch's Bridge. On 11 September 1777, Howe's army met Washington's near Chadds Ford along the Brandywine Creek in the Battle of Brandywine. Howe established his headquarters at the Gilpin Homestead, where it stayed until the morning of 16 September.[71] In a reprise of earlier battles, Howe once again flanked the Continental Army position and forced Washington to retreat after inflicting heavy casualties.[72]\\r\\nAfter two weeks of manoeuvre and engagements (including The Battle of the Clouds, The Paoli Massacre, and an engagement at Valley Forge where Alexander Hamilton was nearly lost), Howe triumphantly entered the city on 26 September.[73] The reception the British received was not quite what they had expected, however. They had been led to believe that \\"Friends thicker than Woods\\" would greet them upon their arrival; they instead were greeted by women, children, and many deserted houses.[74] Despite Howe's best attempts to minimise the plundering by his army (he authorised the execution of violators of his orders against it), this activity by the army had a significant negative effect on popular support.[75]\\r\\nOne week after Howe entered Philadelphia, on 4 October, Washington made a dawn attack on the British garrison at Germantown. He very nearly won the battle before being repulsed by late-arriving reinforcements sent from the city.[76] This forced Howe to withdraw his troops a little closer to the city, where they were also needed to help clear the American Delaware River defences, which were preventing the navy from resupplying the army. It was late November before this task was accomplished, which included a poorly executed attack on Fort Mercer by a division of Hessians.[77]\\r\\nConcomitant with Howe's campaign, General Burgoyne led his expedition south from Montreal to capture Albany.[78] Burgoyne's advance was stopped in the Battles of Saratoga in September and October, and he surrendered his army on 17 October. Burgoyne's surrender, coupled with Howe's near defeat at Germantown, dramatically altered the strategic balance of the conflict.[79][80] Support for the Continental Congress, suffering from Howe's successful occupation of Philadelphia, was strengthened, and the victory encouraged France to enter the war against Britain.[81] Burgoyne's loss also further weakened the British government of Lord North.[82]\\r\\nBurgoyne made his advance under the assumption that he would be met in Albany by Howe or troops sent by Howe.[78] Burgoyne was apparently not aware that Howe's plans had evolved as they had. Although Germain knew what Howe's plans were, whether he communicated them to Burgoyne is unclear. Some sources claim he did[83] while others state that Burgoyne was not notified of the changes until the campaign was well underway.[78] Whether Germain, Howe and Burgoyne had the same expectations about the degree to which Howe was supposed to support the invasion from Quebec is also unclear. Some historians argue that Howe failed to follow instructions and essentially abandoned Burgoyne's army, while others suggest that Burgoyne failed on his own and then tried to shift the blame to Howe and Clinton.[84]\\r\\nHowe's decision to focus his own activity on an expedition to Philadelphia may have been motivated by competition with General Burgoyne, who was given command of the northern force despite lobbying by Howe for its command to be given to Clinton.[85] John Alden notes the jealousies among the British leaders, saying, \\"It is likely that [Howe] was as jealous of Burgoyne as Burgoyne was of him and that he was not eager to do anything which might assist his junior up the ladder of military renown.\\"[86] Along the same lines historian Don Higginbotham concludes that in Howe's view, \\"It [the northern campaign] was Burgoyne's whole show, and consequently he [Howe] wanted little to do with it. With regard to Burgoyne's army, he would do only what was required of him (virtually nothing).\\"[87]\\r\\nHowe himself wrote to Burgoyne on 17 July that he intended to stay close to Washington: \\"My intention is for Pennsylvania, where I expect to meet Washington, but if he goes to the northward contrary to my expectations, and you can keep him at bay, be assured I shall soon be after him to relieve you.\\" This suggested that Howe would follow Washington if he went north to assist in the defence of the Hudson.[88] Howe, however, sailed from New York on 23 July.[89] On 30 August, shortly after his arrival at Head of Elk, Howe wrote to Germain that he would be unable to assist Burgoyne, citing a lack of Loyalist support in the Philadelphia area.[90] A small force sent north from New York by General Clinton in early October was also unable to assist Burgoyne.[91]\\r\\nIn October 1777 Howe sent his letter of resignation to London, complaining that he had been inadequately supported in that year's campaigns.[8] He was finally notified in April 1778 that his resignation was accepted. A grand party, known as the \\"Mischianza\\", was thrown for the departing general on 18 May. Organized by his aides John Andr and Oliver De Lancey Jr., the party featured a grand parade, fireworks, and dancing until dawn.[92] Washington, aware that the British were planning to evacuate Philadelphia, sent the Marquis de Lafayette out with a small force on the night of the party to determine British movements. This movement was noticed by alert British troops, and Howe ordered a column out to entrap the marquis. In the Battle of Barren Hill, Lafayette escaped the trap with minimal casualties.[93]\\r\\nOn 24 May, the day Howe sailed for England, General Clinton took over as commander-in-chief of British armies in America, and made preparations for an overland march to New York.[94] Howe arrived back in England on 1 July,[95] where he and his brother faced censure for their actions in North America. It is likely that the resignation of both William and his brother Richard was due to their desire to hurry home to vindicate their conduct during the campaign.[96] In 1779 Howe and his brother demanded a parliamentary inquiry into their actions. The inquiry that followed was unable to confirm any charges of impropriety or mismanagement levelled against either of them.[8] Because of the inconclusive nature of the inquiry, attacks continued to be made against Howe in pamphlets and the press, and in 1780 he published a response to accusations levelled by Loyalist Joseph Galloway,[97] who issued a reply that harshly criticized the general's conduct and accused him of deliberately undermining the war effort for the benefit of the anti-war Whig faction in Parliament.[98]\\r\\nIn 1780 Howe lost in his bid to be re-elected to the House of Commons.[99] In 1782 he was named lieutenant general of the ordnance and appointed to the Privy Council. His colonelcy was transferred from the 23rd Fusiliers to the 19th Light Dragoons in 1786.[100] He resumed limited active duty in 1789, when a crisis with Spain over territorial claims in northwestern North America threatened to boil over into war. The crisis was resolved, and Howe did not see further action until 1793, when the French Revolutionary Wars involved Britain. He was promoted to full general in 1793, and commanded Northern District from 1793 and Eastern District from 1795.[8] In 1795 he was also appointed governor of Berwick-on-Tweed.[99]\\r\\nWhen his brother Richard died in 1799 without surviving male issue, Howe inherited the Irish titles and became the 5th Viscount Howe and Baron Clenawly.[101] In 1803 he resigned as lieutenant general of the ordnance, citing poor health. In 1805 he was appointed governor of Plymouth, and died at Twickenham in 1814 after a long illness.[8][102] He was married in 1765 to Frances Connolly, but the marriage was childless, and his titles died with him.[8] His wife survived him by three years; both are buried in Twickenham.[103]\\r\\nHowe appears as an antagonist in the supernatural TV series Sleepy Hollow, depicted in flashbacks by Nicholas Guest and described in the present as being notorious for his brilliant tactics and ruthless cruelty. In his historical role as the British military leader in the War for Independence, Howe was acquainted with Ichabod Crane (Tom Mison) before Crane defected to America; his first major flashback appearance sees him offer Crane a chance to return to Britain if he identifies Washington's spies in the British forces, with Crane feeling guilty that he was briefly tempted by the offer. Howe also plays a key role in the crossover episodes between Sleepy Hollow and crime drama Bones; his body is discovered in a small American church in the present (characters noting that he is recorded as being buried in Twickenham), with his skull being identified as the 'murder weapon' in Bones episode \\"The Resurrection in the Remains\\", and he is resurrected as a zombie-like warrior in the following Sleepy Hollow episode \\"Dead Men Tell No Tales\\", requiring Crane to destroy him with Greek fire.[104][105]","input":"Who was the commander of the british forces in boston?"},{"output":"1992","context":"Dolores Janney \\"Jenni\\" Rivera Saavedra[3][4] (July 2, 1969 √ø December 9, 2012) was an American singer, songwriter, actress, television producer, spokesperson, philanthropist and entrepreneur known for her work within the Banda and ranchera music genres. In life and death, several media outlets including CNN, Billboard, Fox News, and The New York Times have labeled her as the most important female figure and top selling female artist in the Mexican music genre. Billboard magazine named her the \\"top Latin artist of 2013\\", and the \\"best selling Latin artist of 2013\\".\\r\\nRivera began recording music in 1992. Her recordings often had themes of social issues, infidelity, and relationships. Rivera released her first studio album, Si Quieres Verme Llorar, in the late 1990s, failing to attain commercial success; however, she rose to prominence in the United States and Mexico with her major-label debut, Parrandera, Rebelde y Atrevida. In the early 2000s, she was often criticized and was refused bookings at venues across California for performing Banda musica male-dominated music genre. However, her popularity grew after she won the Lo Nuestro Award for Regional Mexican Female Artist of the Year in 2007, which she won nine consecutive times. Her tenth studio album, Jenni (2008) became her first No.1 record on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart in the United States. In 2010, she appeared in and produced the reality TV show Jenni Rivera Presents: Chiquis & Raq-C. She also appeared in and produced I Love Jenni starting in 2011 through 2013 and Chiquis 'n Control in 2012. Her acting debut was in the film Filly Brown, which was released in 2013.\\r\\nRivera garnered nominations and awards from Latin music's most prestigious accolades. Over the course of her career she was awarded two Oye! Awards (Mexico's equivalent to the United States' Grammy Awards), two Billboard Music Awards, twenty-two Billboard Latin Music Awards, eleven Billboard Mexican Music Awards and eighteen Lo Nuestro Awards. She received four Latin Grammy nominations. She has a star on the Las Vegas Walk of Stars, and she is one of the best-selling regional Mexican artists of all time, having sold more than 20 million records worldwide, also making her the highest-earning banda singer of all time.\\r\\nAside from music, she was active in her community and donated her time to civic causes. The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence appointed her its spokesperson in the United States. A proclamation was given officially naming August 6 Jenni Rivera Day by the Los Angeles City Council for all her charity work and community involvement.\\r\\nRivera, along with six others, died in a plane crash near Iturbide, Nuevo Le‹án on December 9, 2012. Her death made international headlines for weeks. In December 2014, the Mexican Director of Civil Aviation, Gilberto G‹ámez Meyer, stated that the results of the plane crash came back inconclusive and that they are unable to determine the exact cause of the crash. Lawsuits involving the owners of the plane, Rivera's estate, and family members of those on board with Rivera were filed\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRivera was born and raised in Long Beach, California, to Rosa Saavedra and Pedro Rivera, who were from Mexico.[5][6] Her parents raised Rivera and her sister and four brothers in a tight-knit, musical household; her brother Lupillo is also a regional Mexican musician.[7] Rivera spoke both English and Spanish fluently.[6] Her family introduced her to traditional Mexican music, including the genres of banda, norte?a, and ranchera.[6] Her father was a bartender and businessman who created the record label Cintas Acuario in 1987, which launched the career of Mexican singer and songwriter Chalino Snchez.[8]\\r\\nRivera earned straight A's in school until her sophomore year, when at 15 she became pregnant with the first of her five children, Janney \\"Chiquis\\" Marn-Rivera.[9] She supported the two of them by selling CDs at flea markets,[8][10] while working toward her GED at a continuation school and graduating as class valedictorian.[9] Speaking in 2003 of her experiences as a teenage mother, Rivera explained, \\"Usually, when a young girl is pregnant, she drops out of school and concentrates on being a mother. I thought that's what I had to do, but my counselors told me there was no way they would let me drop out. I had too much promise.\\"[8] She attended California State University, Long Beach,[11] and obtained a college degree in business administration and worked in real estate before going to work for her father's record label.[12]\\r\\nRivera made her first recording in 1992 as a Father's Day present to her father; she made more recordings and signed to Capitol/EMI's Latin division.[6][8] Her first album, Chacalosa (slang for \\"party girl\\"), was released in 1995.[6][13]\\r\\nAt the onset of her musical career, she was told many times she would not make it. At that time and still today, the genre known as regional Mexican music was and is dominated by men. In a 2011 interview with Billboard magazine, she stated, \\"It was hard knocking on those doors to get my music played. One radio programmer in L.A., the meanest son of a bitch in the world, threw my CD in the trash right in my face.\\" Those were the kind of issues Rivera faced as a female trying to crack the regional Mexican genre.[14] She then released the albums We are Rivera and Farewell to Selena independently, the latter a tribute album to Tejano music singer Selena who was murdered in 1995.[15][16]\\r\\nShe signed to Sony Music in the late 1990s, and then with Fonovisa Records in 1999; in the same year, Rivera released her first commercial album with Fonovisa, titled Que Me Entierren Con la Banda, featuring local hit \\"Las Malandrinas\\".[6] Rivera stated that she wrote \\"Las Malandrinas\\" to pay homage to her female fans. She also said, \\"The song blew up. People became interested. That's when Jenni Rivera the artist was actually born.\\"[14]\\r\\nIn 2001, she released the records Dejate Amar and Se las Voy a Dar a Otro, which garnered her, her first Latin Grammy nomination for Best Banda Album.[6] She became the first Americanborn artist to be nominated for the award in 2003.[17] Her 2003 release Homenaje a Las Grandes (in English \\"Homage to the Great Ones\\") was a tribute album to female Mexican singers.[6]\\r\\nIn 2004, she released her first compilation disc titled Simplemente... La Mejor, which became her first record to detonate a chart in the United States.[18]\\r\\nShe began to attain more substantial success with the record Parrandera, Rebelde y Atrevida, released in 2005, which peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart, since its release it has been certified double-platinum in the Latin field by the Recording Industry Association of America.[16][19] The second single released from the album, \\"De Contrabando\\" became her first and only numberone song to hit the Latin Regional Mexican Airplay in the United States.[20] It is also said to be one of her most known songs.[21][22]\\r\\nIn 2007, she released Mi Vida Loca, which debuted at number 1 on the Regional Mexican Albums chart and number 2 on the Top Latin Albums chart in the United States, the album garnered an award for Regional Mexican Album of the Year at the 2008 Latin Billboard Music Awards.[23] In a 2011 interview with Billboard magazine she stated, \\"That was more of Jenni telling her story through music. My life has been so put out there by the media that I figured I might as well put it out there myself, in my own words and through my music. I wanted to clear up speculations about my private life.\\" The album also garnered Rivera her first Lo Nuestro Award for Regional Mexican Female Artist of the Year, an award she would dominate for the rest of her life.[24][25] The same year she released La Diva en Vivo, a live album that consisted of songs recorded with a mariachi band, which garnered her, her second Latin Grammy nomination for Best Ranchero Album. That year she was the only female singer nominated in that category.

She went on to say there are certain nationalities that will listen to mariachi and not banda. Those were the people that she was going after. She also stated, \\"Commercializing a ranchera album is much harder. There had not been a successful female mariachi artist in a long time. It was a big risk, but it was a risk that I was willing to take. La Gran Se?ora ended up being the biggest-selling [regional Mexican] album of 2010.\\"[14][30][31]\\r\\nIn 2010, she announced she would be going on tour to promote her album latest album La Gran Se?ora.

Banda music originated in the state of Sinaloa and the music sound is primarily instruments such as tuba, clarinets and trumpets, i.e. Banda El Recodo; Banda La Costena.[19][69] However, according to Leila Cobo of Billboard, her music contained a \\"contemporary, outspoken flair\\".[19] She sang in both Spanish and English and often addressed personal themes such as her struggles with domestic violence, divorce, and her weight.[69]\\r\\nRivera described speaking openly with her fans about her personal issues as a \\"primary part\\" of her career.[70] Discussing her unconventional approach and her single \\"Las Malandrinas\\", Rivera explained, \\"It was the late 1990s and the early 2000s and the female singers were singing ballads and romantic fare. So I figured, I'm not typical at all in any way, so I'm going to do what the guys do but in a different voice.\\"[71] She was given names such as \\"La Diva de la Banda\\" and \\"La Primera Dama del Corrido\\" for her work in the banda and corrido genre.[6][72]\\r\\nAlthough banda was her main focus, she also released albums in norte?o and mariachi.[59][73][74][75][76]\\r\\nRivera was married three times and had five children. She gave birth to her first child, Janney (born 1985), while still in high school. She later married the baby's father, Jos Trinidad Marn, and they had two more children: Jacqueline (born 1989) and Michael (born 1991), but she ended the marriage in 1992 citing physical and emotional abuse.[77] In 1997 her younger sister Rosie confessed that Jenni's ex-husband (Marn) used to sexually molest her, and was now doing the same to Chiquis, physical examination showed he'd done the same with Jacqie. The molestation case was opened in 1997 and Marn spent 9 years as a fugitive before he was apprehended in April 2006, convicted of sexual assault and rape and sentenced to more than 31 years in prison without parole.[78][79]\\r\\nRivera married her second husband, Juan L‹ápez, in 1997. They had daughter Jenicka in 1997 and son Juan Angel in 2001 before they divorced in 2003.[80] In 2007, L‹ápez was convicted of selling drugs. He died from complications of pneumonia while in prison in 2009.[81]\\r\\nRivera married baseball player Esteban Loaiza in 2010. They filed for divorce in 2012 just months before her death, but it was never finalized.[82]\\r\\nOn August 6, 2010 Rivera was named spokeswoman for the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. A proclamation was given \\"officially naming\\" August 6 Jenni Rivera Day by the Los Angeles City Council for all her charity work and community involvement. Rivera was a Christian and her brother Pedro Rivera Jr. is the pastor of the Primer Amor Church in Whittier, California.[83]\\r\\nIn June 2008, Univisi‹án reported that Rivera was arrested after a concert in Raleigh, North Carolina, for allegedly hitting a fan. Media reports state the incident occurred after Rivera was hit on her right leg with a beer can that was thrown by someone in the crowd. Rivera made the culprit climb up on stage, and allegedly started assaulting him physically and verbally. After the altercation, the fan called the police, and Rivera was arrested after wrapping up the concert. Rivera was detained for a few hours, but released shortly after paying $3,000 bail.[84][85]\\r\\nIn October 2008, a sex video featuring Rivera began circulating.[86] Rivera was arrested on May 18, 2009 by customs authorities at the international airport in Mexico City. She failed to declare $52,467 cash in her purse. Rivera later paid a fine of $8,400 and was released.[87][88] According to New York Daily News, Rivera worked as a performer for drug cartel parties in 2009.[89]\\r\\nIn late 2014, controversy and accusations continued to surround the circumstances of her death. Her widower, Esteban Loaiza, has sued Starwood for wrongful death. A request by his attorneys to dismiss the case was granted in late October, court records show. Loiaza's suit contended the pilots flying Rivera.[90]\\r\\nRivera's estate have launched a copyright lawsuit against her former manager Laura Lucio. The plaintiffs are asking a judge to instruct law enforcement officials to confiscate Rivera's writings and interviews from Lucio so she cannot use them for a book project. In January 2014, Lucio filed a lawsuit claiming Rivera's estate published a biography of Rivera using the writings and interviews that she helped put together before Rivera passed. Lucio alleged her book project, Mi Vida Loca, which she claimed to have written with Rivera, was shelved following Rivera's death but was later published under a new title, Unbreakable: My Story, My Way, without her permission. Rivera's estate subsequently had the lawsuit moved out of a state court and into federal court, but in September 2014, U.S. District Judge George Wu granted Lucio's request to have the case moved back to state court. She then published the materials and Rivera's estate are now claiming they are the rightful owners of them. The lawsuit reads, \\"Defendant even falsely listed herself as the author of these copyrighted works, created by Jenni Rivera and/or owned by Jenni Rivera Enterprises, in a registration of a manuscript titled Jenni Rivera, Mi Vida Loca (My Crazy Life) as told to Laura Lucio; with the Writer's Guild of America's Intellectual Property Registry.[91]\\r\\nOn December 9, 2014, the estate of Rivera sued the owners of the plane that was carrying her. The negligence case is against Starwood Management Inc., which owned the Learjet 25 jet that crashed in northern Mexico, after plunging more than 28,000 feet. The case is also against the companies that serviced the aircraft, Bombardier Inc. and Learjet Inc. Rivera's parents and five of her children, two of whom are still minors, are plaintiffs in the case. The suit seeks unspecified damages on their behalf. Rivera's estate has also been sued along with Starwood by relatives of those killed in the crash, including her attorney, hairstylist, publicist and makeup artist and one of the plane's pilots.[92][93]\\r\\nRivera was in Mexico performing a concert at Monterrey Arena on December 8, 2012, in Monterrey, Nuevo Le‹án. At 2:00?a.m. local time (Central Time Zone, CST) on December 9, after the show ended, she held a press conference at the same venue. She left the arena along with her staff and travelled to Monterrey International Airport. She was one of five passengers and two crew that took off from the airport at 3:00?a.m. CST in a 43-year-old Learjet 25 (a small business jet) registered in the US as N345MC. At approximately 3:20?a.m. CST, air traffic controllers lost contact with the Learjet as it was flying near Iturbide, Nuevo Le‹án.[94] The aircraft was en route to Toluca for an appearance by Rivera on La Voz... Mxico.[15][95][96]\\r\\nAll on board were presumed dead by Mexican authorities when the wreckage was found later that day. Jenni Rivera's father, Pedro, confirmed in a Telemundo interview that his daughter had died in the crash. Mexican aviation authorities declared in the media that her aircraft had disintegrated on impact, with fragments spread across 300 metres (980?ft). The impact of the crash was so severe that it is believed the aircraft went down in a nosedive at speeds of up to 700?mph (1,100?km/h). Because the Learjet was a US-registered aircraft, and had American citizens on board (Jenni Rivera and one other) the US National Transportation Safety Board sent a team of investigators to assist their Mexican counterparts.[97] The aircraft had reportedly been involved in a 2005 fuel system incident.[98]\\r\\nRivera was finally buried on December 31, 2012 at All Souls Cemetery in Long Beach, California. Her father told Telemundo that legal issues had caused this delay.[99] Her death made international headlines for weeks.[100]\\r\\nIn December 2014, Mexican authorities closed the investigation into the crash. Mexican Director of Civil Aviation, Gilberto G‹ámez Meyer, stated that the results of the investigation were inconclusive and that it was not possible to determine the exact cause of the crash. Meyer declared to the American Spanish-language entertainment news show El Gordo y la Flaca, \\"We haven't been able to [find out what happened] and the investigation is over... The impact was so violent, the velocity of the impact was, surely, supersonic. It was so big that the only thing we could find ... that was identifiable from the black box of the recorder was the covering, or the outer layer.\\"[101][102]\\r\\nStories of Rivera's disappearance and death appeared on Telemundo and Univision, the United States' leading Spanish-language networks, as well as CNN, MSNBC, ABC and near the top of The New York Times website. Shortly after her death, CNN en Espa?ol reported that Rivera started to become more known internationally, with her name trending on Twitter worldwide and a surge of sales in her albums being bought from people outside of Mexico and the United States.[103]\\r\\nUniversal Music Group (Fonovisa's Parent Company) also released a statement, saying: \\"The entire Universal Music Group family is deeply saddened by the sudden loss of our dear friend Jenni Rivera. The world rarely sees someone who has had such a profound impact on so many. From her incredibly versatile talent to the way she embraced her fans around the world, Jenni was simply incomparable. Her talent will be missed; but her gift of music will be with us always.\\"[104] United States Senator Marco Rubio made a statement about Riveras life and death on the Senate floor, where he said Rivera was \\"a real American success story\\".[105] Celebrities such as Mario Lopez to Gloria Estefan tweeted their condolences to Rivera's family.[106][107]\\r\\nOn July 2, 2013, Rivera's family released Unbreakable: My Story, My Way by Rivera. A New York Times bestseller, the Spanish language paperback sold over 9000 copies in its first week with the English language hardcover and paperback editions selling over 10,000 copies combined.[108]\\r\\nOn the 25th anniversary of Premio Lo Nuestro, Univision dedicated the awards ceremony to her.

The spokesman also stated that this was the very first exhibition that the museum has devoted entirely to a Latino or Latin American artist.[112][113] The exhibit was closed on May 11, 2014.[111]\\r\\nOn October 8, 2014, Long Beach, California Councilman Dee Andrews pushed to name a park in memorial of Rivera. Andrews proposed to name a public right of way park in central Long Beach at Walnut Avenue and 20th Street the Jenni Rivera Memorial Park. The request was heard at the following City Council's meeting. The agenda item was cosponsored by Councilwoman Suzie Price and Councilman Roberto Uranga. Councilman Andrews said, \\"Jenni was an inspiration to us all.

Andrews office released a written statement from the Rivera family in regard to the park name proposal stating. We are honored and humbled to have a great community asset named after our mother, daughter and sister in the greatest City of the world. Jenni always considered herself a chic from Long Beach with pride, no matter how many millions of albums she sold. She always knew shed return to her hometown, but this exceeded her dreams.

Closing out the series' 11th season, the 2 hour episode first aired on CBS on February 28, 1983, ending the series' original run. The episode was written by a large number of collaborators, including series star Alan Alda, who also directed.\\r\\nThe episode's plot chronicles the final days of the Korean War at the 4077th MASH, and features several storylines intended to show the war's effects on the individual personnel of the unit, and to bring closure to the series. After the ceasefire goes into effect, the members of the 4077th throw a party before taking down the camp for the last time. After tear-filled goodbyes, the main characters go their separate ways, leading to the final scene of the series.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs peace negotiations continue during the Korean War, Hawkeye Pierce is being treated by Dr. Sidney Freedman at a mental hospital for a nervous breakdown.[1] Sidney is trying to get Hawkeye to release repressed memories of an outing most of the 4077th staff attended at a beach near Incheon which appears to have led to the breakdown. At the beginning of the episode, Hawkeye remembers the trip home as having a party-like atmosphere with him calling for a bottle of whiskey to be passed to a person who \\"can't wait\\" to drink it. Sidney's questioning gets Hawkeye to remember that the person in question was actually a soldier who needed the bottle. Then he remembers that the bottle did not contain whiskey, but plasma, and the soldier was severely wounded. Hawkeye was actually yelling impatiently that \\"this guy can't wait\\".\\r\\nThrough repeated counseling sessions, Hawkeye recalls that they picked up some refugees and wounded soldiers farther up the road as an enemy patrol was coming. The bus had to hide off the road and the occupants were forced to remain quiet. Hawkeye refuses to tell Sidney anything further, but then lashes out at two of his fellow patients for getting into a loud argument. Hawkeye says they were screaming like chickens and jokes about chickens taking the bus. Using that as a clue, Sidney digs deeper and Hawkeye remembers a refugee woman who boarded the bus carrying a chicken that would not stop clucking.\\r\\nSidney begins to piece together what led to Hawkeye's breakdown. Hawkeye insists that he is perfectly fine, but Freedman reminds him that after returning to the 4077th, Hawkeye had accused an anesthesiologist of trying to smother a patient and then drove a Jeep through a wall in the officers' club and ordered a double bourbon. After more questioning, Hawkeye remembers telling the refugee to make the chicken be quiet, but when it suddenly stopped making noise, Hawkeye realized that the woman had killed the chicken to silence it. Hawkeye then breaks down sobbing as he remembers that the refugee woman was not carrying a chicken, but her infant child and had smothered her baby to death to silence it as Hawkeye had insisted. Hawkeye is initially angry at Sidney for making him remember, but Sidney tells him, \\"You had to get it out in the open. Now we're halfway home.\\" Hawkeye initially believes he will be sent home to Maine, but after more sessions, Sidney informs him he must go back to the 4077th and promises to check in on him.\\r\\nBack at the 4077th, the camp is helping to shelter some of the North Korean and Chinese troops surrendering in the final days of the war. Charles Winchester, who is suffering from diarrhea, possibly dysentery, encounters a group of Chinese soldiers on a motorcycle when he is forced to relieve himself in a local creek after the camp's latrine is destroyed by a runaway tank. The soldiers surrender to him and reveal themselves to be musicians. Winchester brings the soldiers back to camp along with the motorcycle, which B.J. Hunnicutt decides to take for himself and paint yellow. As Winchester is trying to listen to music (Mozart, Clarinet Quintet in A, K. 581), the Chinese musicians annoy him with their own playing. When Winchester tells them to stop, they recognize the name Mozart and one of the musicians begins playing the same piece to which Winchester was listening. An impressed Winchester decides to teach them how to play it properly, eventually forming a bond with the Chinese POWs.\\r\\nWinchester is also distressed over the future of his career after the end of the war. He tells Margaret Houlihan that he has applied to be chief of thoracic surgery at Mercy Hospital in Boston, which he regards as \\"the finest in New England\\", but has been notified by a friend that another, less surgically qualified, but more politically connected surgeon might get the position, instead. Margaret decides to assist Winchester in his application, as a friend of her father's is the chief of staff at Mercy Hospital. Winchester receives a letter days later that tells him the good news. However, he is told by Klinger that Margaret assisted him, and angry that he did not get it through his own efforts, storms off, and is curt and rude to Houlihan.\\r\\nKlinger has fallen in love with Soon-Lee Han, a local Korean refugee at the camp. Soon-Lee has been searching for her parents, who have gone missing, and has been told they are in Chorwon nearby. Chorwon, however, is the site of ongoing fighting and Klinger does not want Soon-Lee going there. Eventually, he finds out that she has left and chases after her, hoping that she will come back. After she initially refuses, he declares his feelings for her and takes her back to camp.\\r\\nB.J. Hunnicutt has received discharge papers and is excited about going home to finally see his daughter, Erin, whom he has not seen since she was born. Col. Potter is initially unhappy about being without two of his surgeons as Hawkeye has not yet left the mental hospital. However, the colonel agrees after B.J. tells him that he knows of a surgeon who will take his place.\\r\\nAlmost immediately thereafter, the camp is attacked with mortars. Several POWs, locked in a makeshift pen in the compound, are stuck in the line of fire and Father Mulcahy goes to let them out. A mortar explodes directly in front of him and knocks him out. B.J. examines Mulcahy and finds that he is suffering from tinnitus and could potentially lose his hearing. Mulcahy, knowing that deafness could result in him being discharged, demands B.J. keep it a secret from the camp, as he does not want to abandon the local orphans for whom he has been caring.\\r\\nThe mortar attacks continue and Potter, believing it is because of the abandoned tank that destroyed the latrine and remains in the compound, calls I Corps headquarters, demanding answers. He is told that the tank has to stay at the 4077th until the unit to which it belonged comes back and claims it. Klinger decides to help by draping a tent over the tank so the North Koreans will not see it, but it proves only to be a temporary fix, as the enemy knows the tank is still there and continues to attack.\\r\\nAs B.J. is leaving the camp by helicopter, Klinger opens that day's mail and informs Potter that B.J.'s discharge was rescinded. Potter decides to ignore this, telling Klinger to put any mail on his desk and that he will look at it later. Hawkeye returns shortly thereafter to find a new batch of wounded in the camp and that his roommate and best friend has gone home. Potter calls headquarters while operating and asks where the new surgeon is. The mortar attacks on the 4077th resume worse than before. As everyone is pinned down in the operating room (OR), Hawkeye decides to run out to move the tank. He turns it around, before hitting the OR tent, smashing through the newly built latrine, and finally running the tank into the camp garbage dump, deflecting the shelling away from the hospital. Potter is not amused by this and decides that Hawkeye needs to see Sidney again.\\r\\nThat night, an incendiary bomb attack sparks a fire in the nearby forest and the 4077th is in its path, forcing the camp to evacuate and move operations (\\"bug out\\"). Once the new camp is set up, Potter's replacement surgeon arrives. To his surprise, it is B.J., who tells Potter that he got about \\"a third of the way home\\" before word of his recall to the 4077th got to him in Guam. He apologizes to Hawkeye for not leaving him a note, as he was so rushed the day he left, but Hawkeye brushes it off.\\r\\nSidney arrives at the new camp site in the middle of a celebration, as the 4077th decides to throw a party in absentia for B.J.'s daughter, who is turning two. A two-year-old orphan girl is picked to take the place of Erin Hunnicutt and B.J. is touched. Hawkeye, however, is saddened and walks off. Sidney follows him, telling him that his tank stunt was the most sensible thing to do, that he should not be afraid of his job anymore, that he is overthinking things, and that his failures might make him a better doctor.\\r\\nA POW exchange takes place later that day, which includes the five Chinese musicians. Winchester tries to keep them with him, but is turned away by a soldier. As the truck taking them leaves, the musicians bid farewell to Winchester by playing the Mozart piece correctly. Moments later, an announcement is relayed to the camp: a ceasefire has been agreed to and, at 10:00 that evening, the United States' involvement in the Korean War will come to an end. Almost on cue, a new batch of wounded arrives at the camp. Potter informs the doctors that this is to be the last set of wounded operated on at the new camp, as headquarters has ordered them back to their original site at Uijeongbu.\\r\\nOnce they return, a new batch of wounded arrives at the compound on top of the one they were working on and Winchester is dispatched to perform triage outside. He discovers that one of the deceased patients is one of the Chinese musicians. Winchester also learns that everyone else in the truck carrying the POWs was killed in an attack. Winchester, still in disbelief, returns to the Swamp and listens to his Mozart record, but after a few seconds, he pulls it out of the player and smashes it to bits in anger.\\r\\nAs he is finished operating, Hawkeye's next patient is a young girl who was apparently wounded in a round of shelling. With Sidney observing, Hawkeye hesitates in performing the operation. Although Potter offers to switch with him, Hawkeye decides to operate on the little girl himself. With Hawkeye now apparently back to normal, Sidney decides to depart the 4077th for the last time and Hawkeye thanks him for his treatment. As Sidney leaves, he echoes a statement he made to the doctors in one of his first visits years earlier: \\"Ladies and gentlemen, take my advice. Pull down your pants and slide on the ice.\\" Once Sidney is out of the OR, the announcement of the ceasefire and the end of the shelling comes over the radio. The doctors pause in wonder at the new peace, then continue operating on the remaining wounded.\\r\\nThe camp spends its last night together at a party in the mess tent. Colonel Potter decides to have everyone talk about what they will be doing after the war. Potter is heading home to his wife Mildred in Hannibal, Missouri, where he will still practice medicine part-time. Hawkeye says that he originally wanted to work in a city hospital, but instead everything that has happened to him has changed his mind and that he plans to open a practice in his hometown of Crabapple Cove, Maine. B.J. jokes that he has run off with somebody at the airport bar in Guam, but is really headed back to San Francisco to be reunited with his family. Winchester tells the camp of his new position at Mercy Hospital, but because of the deaths of the Chinese musicians he helped teach, the music that he loved and sought out as a refuge is to remain a reminder of the horrors of war. Margaret was offered two positions abroad through her father's influence, but has decided to refuse them and take a job in America working in a hospital. Mulcahy has decided to begin working with the deaf and hard-of-hearing, having been inspired by his accident. Klinger surprises everyone by announcing that, after years of trying to receive a section-eight discharge and go home, he is staying in Korea to marry Soon-Lee, who will not leave the country until she finds her parents.\\r\\nThe next morning, Father Mulcahy presides over Klinger and Soon-Lee's wedding with Potter as the best man and Margaret as the matron of honor. After the wedding, the camp starts to be disassembled and various members remove their hometown signs from the camp signpost. Father Mulcahy leaves for the 8063rd, with B.J. continuing to protect the secret of Mulcahy's hearing loss until the time he leaves. Winchester and Margaret are to leave in the same jeep, but Winchester cannot get on because it is overloaded with Margaret's belongings. Margaret, still upset at Winchester for his ingratitude, decides to disembark, but Winchester tells her to stay and orders Sgt. Rizzo to find him another ride. Winchester makes peace with Margaret and allows her to keep one of his treasured poetry books. She then says goodbye to B.J., Potter, and Hawkeye, who gives her a long, passionate kiss.\\r\\nAfter Margaret leaves, the Swamp is struck down as its occupants sarcastically mock its demise. Winchester leaves in a garbage truck, the last vehicle Rizzo has, but not before telling Potter that he hopes to guide his charges in the way Potter guided him and the rest of the camp. He then bids farewell to his tentmates, telling Hawkeye and B.J. that they showed him \\"what going home is all about\\". Winchester then boards the garbage truck, commenting, \\"what better way to leave a garbage dump\\", and leaves.\\r\\nThe next to leave is the colonel, who rides out of camp one last time on his beloved horse Sophie. Once he reaches the 8063rd, he boards a waiting jeep to head towards his flight home, and donates Sophie to the orphanage for the children. Before he goes, he tells B.J. and Hawkeye that he was glad that they all worked together and that he will miss the good laughs they all shared, appreciating them because Hawkeye and B.J. always managed to give him joy when he needed it the most. After Potter climbs onto Sophie, Hawkeye and B.J. offer Potter a salute in appreciation of him. The colonel rides off into the distance, leaving the two Swampmates as the last people at the camp.\\r\\nA chopper then arrives at the helipad to take Hawkeye to his next stop. B.J. offers him a ride on the motorcycle he claimed from the Chinese musicians and takes him up the hill to the helipad. While there, Hawkeye and B.J. have one final conversation. Hawkeye says that he will never be able to \\"shake\\" B.J., and the two tell each other that things at home will remind them of each other. The two embrace and say they will miss each other, and Hawkeye boards the chopper.\\r\\nEarlier, Hawkeye had been irritated with B.J. for his apparent inability to say \\"goodbye\\" as the two would probably never see each other again. Just before B.J. rides off for the last time, he says to Hawkeye that though he will try to find him once they get back to the states, he left Hawkeye a note just in case. The chopper takes off and as it gains altitude, Hawkeye sees that B.J. has arranged a large number of stones to read \\"GOODBYE\\" on the helipad. Upon seeing that, he smiles, knowing that B.J. was capable of saying goodbye after all, and the chopper flies away from what is left of the 4077th for the last time. The original theme song \\"Suicide is Painless\\" (from the 1970 film) is then played in its entirety.\\r\\nThe anticipation before the airing of Goodbye, Farewell and Amen was almost unprecedented, especially for a regular television series (in contrast to awards shows, sporting events, or special events). Interest from advertisers prompted CBS, the network broadcasting M*A*S*H, to sell 30-second commercial blocks for $450,000 (over $1,000,000 in 2016 dollars) eachcostlier than even for NBC's airing of the Super Bowl of that year.[2][3]\\r\\nOn the night the episode aired, large areas of California (particularly the San Francisco Bay Area) suffered power outages due to unusually stormy winter weather, which prevented many viewers from watching the series finale. Three weeks later, on March 21, KPIX, the CBS affiliate in San Francisco, reaired the episode.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe episode drew 105.97?million total viewers[4] and a total audience of 121.6?million,[5] more than both Super Bowl XVII and the Roots miniseries. The episode surpassed the single-episode ratings record that had been set by the Dallas episode that resolved the \\"Who Shot J.R.?\\" cliffhanger. From 1983 until 2010, Goodbye, Farewell and Amen remained the most watched television broadcast in American history,[2] passed only in total viewership (but not in ratings or share) in February 2010 by Super Bowl XLIV. It still stands as the most-watched finale of any television series.[4]\\r\\nAs M*A*S*H was one of the most successful shows in TV history, in order not to completely lose the franchise, CBS quickly created a new series, AfterMASH, that followed the postwar adventures of Colonel Potter, Max Klinger, and Father Mulcahy in a stateside hospital. Despite wide popularity in its premiere episodes, script problems and constant character changes led to a sharp decline in viewers, and the show was cancelled by CBS after only two seasons. Another would be spin-off, W*A*L*T*E*R, was a pilot made in 1984 that was never picked up. It starred Gary Burghoff, who reprised his M*A*S*H character.\\r\\nGoodbye, Farewell and Amen was not initially included in the syndication package for M*A*S*H's final season. However, in 1992, the episode made its syndication premiere in time for its 10th anniversary. Local stations aired it as a part of a Movie of the Week.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen M*A*S*H was shown on FX and Hallmark Channel, they aired Goodbye, Farewell and Amen occasionally. Hallmark Channel showed it twice a year, February and August, before dropping M*A*S*H from its schedule. TV Land and MeTV have also shown the episode sporadically, including a Veterans Day broadcast on November 11, 2015. In Canada, the cable channel History Television shows the episode in its entirety annually on the Labor Day holiday.\\r\\nIn 2011, the TV Guide Network special TV's Most Unforgettable Finales ranked this finale as the best.[citation needed]","input":"When was the last episode of mash aired?"},{"output":"Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria","context":"The military of the United States is deployed in more than 150 countries around the world, with over 300,000 of its active-duty personnel serving outside the United States and its territories.[1]\\r\\nUS personnel are engaged in active combat in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.

For instance, the Ultimate Fighting Championship introduced two weight classes at UFC 12: heavyweight, which grouped competitors above 200?lb (91?kg), and lightweight, which grouped competitors under 200?lb.\\r\\nWeight divisions underwent many changes in the ensuing years, but the ability of promotions to autonomously decide their own weight classes eventually disappeared after athletic commissions began supervising mixed martial arts.\\r\\nIn 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were codified by the New Jersey State Athletic Commission. The California State Athletic Commission had worked extensively on regulation, but their sanctioning of MMA was not implemented due to state governmental issues surrounding the process.[1] California officially sanctioned MMA on December 28, 2005, using the ruleset it helped devise five years previously.[2]\\r\\nSince then, to create uniformity, all state commissions in the United States that regulate mixed martial arts have assimilated these rules into their existing unarmed combat competition rules and statutes. For a promotion to hold mixed martial arts events in a state-sanctioned venue, the promotion must abide by the state athletic commission's body of rules for weight limits.\\r\\nThe Unified Rules designate limits for fourteen different weight classes in mixed martial arts; all definitions and measurements are in pounds.[3] The strawweight class was added in 2015.[4] The super lightweight, super welterweight, super middleweight, and cruiserweight classes were added in July 2017.[5]\\r\\nWith no state or government laws regarding weight class restrictions, organizations in other countries are free to schedule bouts with little regard for weight differential. However, due to the increasingly competitive and international nature of the sport, weight limits have been set by the promotions themselves usually in alignment with the Unified Rules, as maintaining standard weight classes is seen as fair and standard for all competitors.\\r\\nWeight limits in women's MMA mostly follow the Unified Rules' limits, but organizations that recognize women's championships usually only have titles at the lower end of the table. UFC, for example, recognizes women's titles in the strawweight, flyweight, bantamweight and featherweight classes. Some organizations that recognize women's championships also sanction a separate atomweight title with a 105 pounds (48?kg) limit.","input":"When were weight classes introduced to the ufc?"},{"output":"the sinoatrial node","context":"The electrical conduction system of the heart transmits signals generated usually by the sinoatrial node to cause contraction of the heart muscle. The pacemaking signal generated in the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium to the atrioventricular node, along the Bundle of His and through bundle branches to cause contraction of the heart muscle. This signal stimulates contraction first of the right and left atrium, and then the right and left ventricles. This process allows blood to be pumped throughout the body.\\r\\nThe conduction system consists of specialised heart muscle cells, and is situated within the myocardium. There is a skeleton of fibrous tissue that surrounds the conduction system which can be seen on an ECG. Dysfunction of the conduction system can cause irregular, fast, or slow heart rhythms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElectrical signals arising in the SA node (located in the right atrium) stimulate the atria to contract and travel to the atrioventricular node (AV node), which is located in the interatrial septum. After a delay, the stimulus diverges and is conducted through the left and right bundle of His to the respective Purkinje fibers for each side of the heart, as well as to the endocardium at the apex of the heart, then finally to the ventricular epicardium.[1]\\r\\nOn the microscopic level, the wave of depolarization propagates to adjacent cells via gap junctions located on the intercalated disc. The heart is a functional syncytium (not to be confused with a true \\"syncytium\\" in which all the cells are fused together, sharing the same plasma membrane as in skeletal muscle). In a functional syncytium, electrical impulses propagate freely between cells in every direction, so that the myocardium functions as a single contractile unit. This property allows rapid, synchronous depolarization of the myocardium. While advantageous under normal circumstances, this property can be detrimental, as it has potential to allow the propagation of incorrect electrical signals. These gap junctions can close to isolate damaged or dying tissue, as in a myocardial infarction (heart attack).\\r\\nEmbryologic evidence of generation of the cardiac conduction system illuminates the respective roles of this specialized set of cells. Innervation of the heart begins with a brain only centered parasympathetic cholinergic first order. It is then followed by rapid growth of a second order sympathetic adrenergic system arising from the formation of the thoracic spinal ganglia. The third order of electrical influence of the heart is derived from the vagus nerve as the other peripheral organs form.[2]\\r\\nCardiac muscle has some similarities to neurons and skeletal muscle, as well as important unique properties. Like a neuron, a given myocardial cell has a negative membrane potential when at rest. Stimulation above a threshold value induces the opening of voltage-gated ion channels and a flood of cations into the cell. The positively charged ions entering the cell cause the depolarization characteristic of an action potential. Like skeletal muscle, depolarization causes the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels and release of Ca2+ from the t-tubules. This influx of calcium causes calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and free Ca2+ causes muscle contraction. After a delay, potassium channels reopen, and the resulting flow of K+ out of the cell causes repolarization to the resting state.[3][4]\\r\\nThere are important physiological differences between nodal cells and ventricular cells; the specific differences in ion channels and mechanisms of polarization give rise to unique properties of SA node cells, most important, the spontaneous depolarizations necessary for the SA node's pacemaker activity.\\r\\nIn order to maximize efficiency of contractions and cardiac output, the conduction system of the heart has:\\r\\nAn electrocardiogram is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart.\\r\\nUnder normal conditions, electrical activity is spontaneously generated by the SA node, the cardiac pacemaker. This electrical impulse is propagated throughout the right atrium, and through Bachmann's bundle to the left atrium, stimulating the myocardium of the atria to contract. The conduction of the electrical impulses throughout the atria is seen on the ECG as the P wave.[3][5]\\r\\nAs the electrical activity is spreading throughout the atria, it travels via specialized pathways, known as internodal tracts, from the SA node to the AV node.\\r\\nThe AV node functions as a critical delay in the conduction system. Without this delay, the atria and ventricles would contract at the same time, and blood wouldn't flow effectively from the atria to the ventricles. The delay in the AV node forms much of the PR segment on the ECG, and part of atrial repolarization can be represented by PR segment.\\r\\nThe distal portion of the AV node is known as the bundle of His.[6] The bundle of His splits into two branches in the interventricular septum: the left bundle branch and the right bundle branch. The left bundle branch activates the left ventricle, while the right bundle branch activates the right ventricle.\\r\\nThe left bundle branch is short, splitting into the left anterior fascicle and the left posterior fascicle. The left posterior fascicle is relatively short and broad, with dual blood supply, making it particularly resistant to ischemic damage. The left posterior fascicle transmits impulses to the papillary muscles, leading to mitral valve closure. As the left posterior fascicle is shorter and broader than the right, impulses reach the papillary muscles just prior to depolarization, and therefore contraction, of the left ventricle myocardium. This allows pre-tensioning of the chordae tendinae, increasing the resistance to flow through the mitral valve during left ventricular contraction.[3] This mechanism works in the same manner as pre-tensioning of car seatbelts.\\r\\nThe two bundle branches taper out to produce numerous Purkinje fibers, which stimulate individual groups of myocardial cells to contract.[3]\\r\\nThe spread of electrical activity through the ventricular myocardium produces the QRS complex on the ECG.\\r\\nAtrial repolarization occurs and is masked during the QRS complex by ventricular depolarization on the ECG.\\r\\nThe last event of the cycle is the repolarization of the ventricles. It is the restoring of the resting state. In the ECG, repolarization includes the J point, ST-segment, and T- and U-waves.[7]\\r\\nThe transthoracically measured PQRS portion of an electrocardiogram is chiefly influenced by the sympathetic nervous system. The T (and occasionally U) waves are chiefly influenced by the parasympathetic nervous system guided by integrated brainstem control from the vagus nerve and the thoracic spinal accessory ganglia.\\r\\nAn impulse (action potential) that originates from the SA node at a relative rate of 60 - 100bpm is known as normal sinus rhythm. If SA nodal impulses occur at a rate less than 60bpm, the heart rhythm is known as sinus bradycardia. If SA nodal impulses occur at a rate exceeding 100bpm, the consequent rapid heart rate is sinus tachycardia. These conditions are not necessarily bad symptoms, however. Trained athletes, for example, usually show heart rates slower than 60bpm when not exercising. If the SA node fails to initialize, the AV junction can take over as the main pacemaker of the heart. The AV junction consists of the AV node, the bundle of His and the surrounding area; it has a regular rate of 40 to 60bpm. These \\"junctional\\" rhythms are characterized by a missing or inverted P-Wave. If both the SA node and the AV junction fail to initialize the electrical impulse, the ventricles can fire the electrical impulses themselves at a rate of 20 to 40bpm and will have a QRS complex of greater than 120 ms. This is necessary for the heart to be in good function.\\r\\nAn 'arrhythmia' refers to an abnormal rhythm or speed of rhythm of the heartbeat. An abnormal rhythm or speed is defined as one which is not physiological.\\r\\nA resting heart that beats slower than 60 beats per minute, or faster than 100 beats per minute, is regarded as having an arrhythmia. A heartbeat slower than 60 beats per minute is known as bradycardia, and a heartbeat faster than 100 is known as a tachycardia.\\r\\nSome individuals, for example trained athletes, may have heart beats slower than 60 beats per minute when not exercising. If the SA node fails to initialize, the AV junction can take over as the main pacemaker of the heart. The AV junction \\"surrounds\\" the AV node (the AV node is not able to initialize its own impulses) and has a regular rate of 40 to 60 bpm. These \\"junctional\\" rhythms are characterized by a missing or inverted P-Wave. If both the SA node and the AV junction fail to initialize the electrical impulse, the ventricles can fire the electrical impulses themselves at a rate of 20 to 40 bpm and will have a QRS complex of greater than 120 ms.\\r\\nIn the event of arrhythmia, a pacemaker may be surgically inserted into the conduction system.","input":"What is the electrical part of your heart?"},{"output":"Sanga, on the border of the Bhaktapur and Kavrepalanchwok districts in Nepal","context":"\\r\\nKailashnath Mahadev Statue (Nepali: ???????? ??????) is the world's tallest Shiva statue.[1][2] It is situated in Sanga, on the border of the Bhaktapur and Kavrepalanchwok districts in Nepal, about 20?km from Kathmandu.\\r\\nThe statue is 144 feet (44?m) in height, and was made using copper, zinc, concrete, and steel.

It was conducted at Stanford University between August 14√ø20, 1971, by a research group led by psychology professor Philip Zimbardo using college students.[1] It was funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research[2] as an investigation into the causes of difficulties between guards and prisoners in the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. The experiment is a topic covered in most introductory (social) psychology textbooks.[3]\\r\\nGuards and prisoners had been chosen randomly from the volunteering college students. Some participants developed their roles as the officers and enforced authoritarian measures and ultimately subjected some prisoners to psychological torture. Many of the prisoners passively accepted psychological abuse and, by the officers' request, actively harassed other prisoners who tried to stop it. Zimbardo, in his role as the superintendent, allowed abuse to continue.[4][5] Two of the prisoners left mid-experiment, and the whole exercise was abandoned after six days following the objections of graduate student Christina Maslach, whom Zimbardo was dating (and later married). Certain portions of the experiment were filmed, and excerpts of footage are publicly available.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nZimbardo and his team aimed to test the hypothesis that the inherent personality traits of prisoners and guards are the chief cause of abusive behavior in prison. Participants were recruited and told they would participate in a two-week prison simulation. The team selected the 24 males whom they deemed to be the most psychologically stable and healthy.[6] These participants were predominantly white[7] and of the middle class.[8] The racial and fiscal demographics of the prisoners is currently unknown. The group was intentionally selected to exclude those with criminal backgrounds, psychological impairments, or medical problems. They all agreed to participate in a 7- to 14-day period and received $15 per day (approximately $94 in 2018).[9]\\r\\nThe experiment was conducted in a 35-foot (10.5 m) section of a basement of Jordan Hall (Stanford's psychology building). The prison had two fabricated walls, one at the entrance, and one at the cell wall to block observation. Each cell (6 G 9 feet, or 1.8 G 2.7 m), contained only a cot for the prisoners.[10] In contrast, the guards lived in a very different environment, separated from the prisoners. They were given rest and relaxation areas, and other comforts.\\r\\nTwelve of the 24 participants were assigned the role of prisoner (9 plus 3 alternates), while the other 12 were assigned the role of guard (also 9 plus 3 alternates). Zimbardo took on the role of the superintendent, and an undergraduate research assistant the role of the warden. Zimbardo designed the experiment in order to induce disorientation, depersonalization, and deindividuation in the participants.\\r\\nThe researchers held an orientation session for guards the day before the experiment, during which guards were instructed not to physically harm the prisoners or withhold food or drink. In the footage of the study, Zimbardo can be seen talking to the guards: \\"You can create in the prisoners feelings of boredom, a sense of fear to some degree, you can create a notion of arbitrariness that their life is totally controlled by us, by the system, you, me, and they'll have no privacy ... We're going to take away their individuality in various ways. In general what all this leads to is a sense of powerlessness. That is, in this situation we'll have all the power and they'll have none.\\"[11]\\r\\nThe researchers provided the guards with wooden batons to establish their status,[12] clothing similar to that of an actual prison guard (khaki shirt and pants from a local military surplus store), and mirrored sunglasses to prevent eye contact. Prisoners wore uncomfortable, ill-fitting smocks and stocking caps, as well as a chain around one ankle. Guards were instructed to call prisoners by their assigned numbers, sewn on their uniforms, instead of by name.\\r\\nThe prisoners were \\"arrested\\" at their homes and \\"charged\\" with armed robbery. The local Palo Alto police department assisted Zimbardo with the arrests and conducted full booking procedures on the prisoners, which included fingerprinting and taking mug shots. The prisoners were transported to the mock prison from the police station, where they were strip searched and given their new identities.\\r\\nThe small mock prison cells were set up to hold three prisoners each. There was a small corridor for the prison yard, a closet for solitary confinement, and a bigger room across from the prisoners for the guards and warden. The prisoners were to stay in their cells and the yard all day and night until the end of the study. The guards worked in teams of three for eight-hour shifts. The guards were not required to stay on site after their shift.\\r\\nAfter a relatively uneventful first day, on the second day the prisoners in Cell 1 blockaded their cell door with their beds and took off their stocking caps, refusing to come out or follow the guards' instructions. Guards from other shifts volunteered to work extra hours, to assist in subduing the revolt, and subsequently attacked the prisoners with fire extinguishers without being supervised by the research staff. Finding that handling nine cell mates with only three guards per shift was challenging, one of the guards suggested they use psychological tactics to control them. They set up a \\"privilege cell\\" in which prisoners who were not involved in the riot were treated with special rewards, such as higher quality meals. The \\"privileged\\" inmates chose not to eat the meal in commiseration with their fellow prisoners.\\r\\nAfter only 36 hours, one prisoner began to act \\"crazy\\", as Zimbardo described: \\"#8612 then began to act crazy, to scream, to curse, to go into a rage that seemed out of control. It took quite a while before we became convinced that he was really suffering and that we had to release him.\\" Guards forced the prisoners to repeat their assigned numbers[13] to reinforce the idea that this was their new identity. Guards soon used these prisoner counts to harass the prisoners, using physical punishment such as protracted exercise for errors in the prisoner count. Sanitary conditions declined rapidly, exacerbated by the guards' refusal to allow some prisoners to urinate or defecate anywhere but in a bucket placed in their cell. As punishment, the guards would not let the prisoners empty the sanitation bucket. Mattresses were a valued item in the prison, so the guards would punish prisoners by removing their mattresses, leaving them to sleep on concrete. Some prisoners were forced to be naked as a method of degradation. Several guards became increasingly cruel as the experiment continued; experimenters reported that approximately one-third of the guards exhibited genuine sadistic tendencies. Most of the guards were upset when the experiment was halted after only six days.\\r\\nZimbardo mentions his own absorption in the experiment. On the fourth day, some of the guards stated they heard a rumor that the released prisoner was going to come back with his friends and free the remaining inmates. Zimbardo and the guards disassembled the prison and moved it onto a different floor of the building. Zimbardo himself waited in the basement, in case the released prisoner showed up, and planned to tell him that the experiment had been terminated. The released prisoner never returned, and the prison was rebuilt in the basement.\\r\\nZimbardo argued that the prisoners had internalized their roles, since some had stated they would accept \\"parole\\" even if it would mean forfeiting their pay, despite the fact that quitting would have achieved the same result without the delay involved in waiting for their parole requests to be granted or denied.[14] Zimbardo argued they had no reason for continued participation in the experiment after having lost all monetary compensation, yet they did, because they had internalized the prisoner identity.\\r\\nPrisoner No. 416, a newly admitted stand-by prisoner, expressed concern about the treatment of the other prisoners. The guards responded with more abuse. When he refused to eat his sausages, saying he was on a hunger strike, guards confined him to \\"solitary confinement\\", a dark closet: \\"the guards then instructed the other prisoners to repeatedly punch on the door while shouting at 416.\\"[15] The guards said he would be released from solitary confinement only if the prisoners gave up their blankets and slept on their bare mattresses, which all but one refused to do.\\r\\nZimbardo aborted the experiment early when Christina Maslach, a graduate student in psychology whom he was dating (and later married),[16] objected to the conditions of the prison after she was introduced to the experiment to conduct interviews. Zimbardo noted that, of more than 50 people who had observed the experiment, Maslach was the only one who questioned its morality. After only six days of a planned two weeks' duration, the experiment was discontinued.[14]\\r\\nOn August 20, 1971, Zimbardo announced the end of the experiment to the participants.\\r\\nThe experiment's results favor situational attribution of behavior over dispositional attribution (a result caused by internal characteristics). It seemed that the situation, rather than their individual personalities, caused the participants' behavior. Using this interpretation, the results are compatible with those of the Milgram experiment, where random participants complied with orders to administer seemingly dangerous and potentially lethal electric shocks to a shill.[17]\\r\\nThe experiment has also been used to illustrate cognitive dissonance theory and the power of authority.\\r\\nShortly after the study was completed, there were bloody revolts at both the San Quentin and Attica prison facilities, and Zimbardo reported his findings on the experiment to the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary.\\r\\nParticipants' behavior was modified due to the fact that they were watched as opposed to a lurking variable (Hawthorne effect).[18] Even knowing they were being observed, guards and prisoners acted differently than normal. Some guards felt the need to show their dominance even when it was not necessary.[citation needed]\\r\\nZimbardo instructed the guards before the experiment to disrespect the prisoners in various ways. For example, they had to refer to prisoners by number rather than by name. This, according to Zimbardo, was intended to diminish the prisoners' individuality.[19] With no control, prisoners learned they had little effect on what happened to them, ultimately causing them to stop responding, and give up.[10] Quick to realize that the guards were the highest in the hierarchy, prisoners began to accept their roles as less important human beings.\\r\\nA strength of the study is that it has altered the way US prisons are run. For example, juveniles accused of federal crimes are no longer housed before trial with adult prisoners, due to the risk of violence against them.[18]\\r\\nSome of the guards' behaviour led to dangerous and psychologically damaging situations. One third of the guards were judged to have exhibited \\"genuine sadistic tendencies\\", while many prisoners were emotionally traumatized; five of them had to be removed from the experiment early. After Maslach confronted Zimbardo and persuaded him that he had been passively allowing unethical acts to be performed under his supervision, Zimbardo concluded that both prisoners and guards had become grossly absorbed in their roles and realized that he had likewise become as grossly absorbed in his own, and he terminated the experiment.[20] Ethical concerns surrounding the experiment often draw comparisons to a similar experiment, conducted ten years earlier in 1961 at Yale University by Stanley Milgram.[17]\\r\\nBecause of the nature and questionable ethics of the experiment, Zimbardo found it impossible to keep traditional scientific controls in place. He was unable to remain a neutral observer, since he influenced the direction of the experiment as the prison's superintendent. Conclusions and observations drawn by the experimenters were largely subjective and anecdotal, and the experiment is practically impossible for other researchers to accurately reproduce. Erich Fromm claimed to see generalizations in the experiment's results and argued that the personality of an individual does affect behavior when imprisoned. This ran counter to the study's conclusion that the prison situation itself controls the individual's behavior. Fromm also argued that the amount of sadism in the \\"normal\\" subjects could not be determined with the methods employed to screen them.[21][22][23]\\r\\n\\"John Wayne\\" (the real-life Dave Eshelman), one of the guards in the experiment, said the study placed undue emphasis on the cruelty of the guards, and that he caused the escalation of events between guards and prisoners after he began to emulate a character from the 1967 film Cool Hand Luke. He further intensified his actions because he was nicknamed \\"John Wayne\\" by the other participants, even though he was trying to mimic actor Strother Martin, who had played the role of the sadistic prison Captain in the movie.[24]\\r\\nWhat came over me was not an accident. It was planned. I set out with a definite plan in mind, to try to force the action, force something to happen, so that the researchers would have something to work with. After all, what could they possibly learn from guys sitting around like it was a country club? So I consciously created this persona. I was in all kinds of drama productions in high school and college. It was something I was very familiar with: to take on another personality before you step out on the stage. I was kind of running my own experiment in there, by saying, \\"How far can I push these things and how much abuse will these people take before they say, 'knock it off?'\\" But the other guards didn't stop me. They seemed to join in. They were taking my lead. Not a single guard said, \\"I don't think we should do this.\\" David Eshelman[25]\\r\\nAlso, researchers from Western Kentucky University argued that selection bias may have played a role in the results. The researchers recruited students for a study using an advertisement similar to the one used in the Stanford Prison Experiment, with some ads saying \\"a psychological study\\" (the control group), and some with the words \\"prison life\\" as originally worded in Dr. Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment. It was found that students who responded to the classified advertisement for the \\"prison study\\" were higher in traits such as social dominance, aggression, authoritarianism, etc. and were lower in traits related to empathy and altruism when statistically compared to the control group participants.[26]\\r\\nThe study has been criticized for demand characteristics by psychologist Peter Gray. He argues that participants in psychological experiments are more likely to do what they believe the researchers want them to do. The guards were essentially told to be cruel. However, it could be argued that it was precisely this willingness to comply with the experiment's questionable practices that showed how little was needed for the students to engage in such practices.[27]\\r\\nSkeptical author Brian Dunning states:\\r\\nMost of the Stanford guards did not exhibit any cruel or unusual behavior, often being friendly and doing favors for the prisoners...The statistical validity of the sample of participants, 24 male Stanford students of about the same age, has been called into question as being too small and restrictive to be generally applicable to the population at large...(and the fact that) Zimbardo has dedicated much of his career to the promotion of the idea that bad environments drive bad behavior.[28]\\r\\nGuards and prisoners were playing the role of their authority, which is subjective.[18] They may have not acted the same in real life situations. In particular, the environment and authority roles they found themselves in changed their actions.\\r\\nCritics contend that not only was the sample size too minimal for extrapolation, but also having all of the experimental subjects be US male students gravely undercut the experiment's validity. In other words, it's entirely conceivable that replicating the experiment using a diverse group of people (with different objectives and views in life)[18] would have produced radically distinct results; that is, had the test subjects come from divergent socio-economic and psychological groups, different experimental results may well have resulted.\\r\\nEven Carlo Prescott, who was Zimbardo's \\"prison consultant\\" during the experiment by virtue of having served 17 years in San Quentin for attempted murder, spoke out against the experiment publicly in an article he contributed to the Stanford Daily, after he has read about the various ways in which Zimbardo and others used the experiment to explain atrocities having taken place in real prisons. In the 2005 article, entitled \\"The Lie of the Stanford Prison Experiment\\",[29] Prescott wrote:\\r\\n[...] ideas such as bags being placed over the heads of prisoners, inmates being bound together with chains and buckets being used in place of toilets in their cells were all experiences of mine at the old \\"Spanish Jail\\" section of San Quentin and which I dutifully shared with the Stanford Prison Experiment braintrust months before the experiment started. To allege that all these carefully tested, psychologically solid, upper-middle-class Caucasian \\"guards\\" dreamed this up on their own is absurd. How can Zimbardo and, by proxy, Maverick Entertainment express horror at the behavior of the \\"guards\\" when they were merely doing what Zimbardo and others, myself included, encouraged them to do at the outset or frankly established as ground rules?\\r\\nLike Zimbardo, Prescott has also spoken before Congress on issues of prison reform.\\r\\nA French reasearcher, Thibault Le Texier, after investigation of archives and testimonies published in 2018 his conclusion that the staging could not be meaningfully described as an experiment and there were no real results to speak of.[30]\\r\\nWhen acts of prisoner torture and abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq were publicized in March 2004, Zimbardo himself, who paid close attention to the details of the story, was struck by the similarity with his own experiment. He was dismayed by official military and government representatives' shifting the blame for the torture and abuses in the Abu Ghraib American military prison onto \\"a few bad apples\\" rather than acknowledging the possibly systemic problems of a formally established military incarceration system.\\r\\nEventually, Zimbardo became involved with the defense team of lawyers representing one of the Abu Ghraib prison guards, Staff Sergeant Ivan \\"Chip\\" Frederick. He was granted full access to all investigation and background reports, and testified as an expert witness in SSG Frederick's court martial, which resulted in an eight-year prison sentence for Frederick in October 2004.\\r\\nZimbardo drew from his participation in the Frederick case to write the book The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil, published by Random House in 2007, which deals with the similarities between his own Stanford Prison Experiment and the Abu Ghraib abuses.[15]\\r\\nThe experiment was perceived by many to involve questionable ethics, the most serious concern being that it was continued even after participants expressed their desire to withdraw. Despite the fact that participants were told they had the right to leave at any time, Zimbardo did not allow this during the experiment.[18] Zimbardo was faced with the ethical dilemma that the experiment could possibly return outstanding results if continued, but it might also adversely affect the participants' well-being if not halted.\\r\\nSince the time of the Stanford experiment, ethical guidelines have been established for experiments involving human subjects.[31][32][33] The Stanford Prison Experiment led to the implementation of rules to preclude any harmful treatment of participants. Before they are implemented, human studies must now be reviewed and found by an institutional review board (US) or ethics committee (UK) to be in accordance with ethical guidelines set by the American Psychological Association.[18] These guidelines involve consideration of whether the potential benefit for science outweighs the possible risk for physical and psychological harm.\\r\\nA post-experimental debriefing is now considered an important ethical consideration to ensure that participants are not harmed in any way by their experience in an experiment. Though Zimbardo did conduct debriefing sessions, they were several years after the Stanford Prison Experiment. By that time numerous details were forgotten; nonetheless, many participants reported that they experienced no lasting negative effects.[18] Current standards specify that the debriefing process should occur as soon as possible to assess what psychological harm, if any, may have been done and to rehabilitate participants, if necessary. If there is an unavoidable delay in debriefing, the researcher is obligated to take steps to minimize harm.[34]\\r\\nPsychologists Alex Haslam and Steve Reicher conducted the BBC Prison Study in 2002 and published the results in 2006.[35] This was a partial replication of the Stanford prison experiment conducted with the assistance of the BBC, which broadcast events in the study in a documentary series called The Experiment. Their results and conclusions differed from Zimbardo's and led to a number of publications on tyranny, stress, and leadership. The results were published in leading academic journals such as British Journal of Social Psychology, Journal of Applied Psychology, Social Psychology Quarterly, and Personality and Social Psychology Review. The BBC Prison Study is now taught as a core study on the UK A-level Psychology OCR syllabus.\\r\\nWhile Haslam and Reicher's procedure was not a direct replication of Zimbardo's, their study casts further doubt on the generality of his conclusions. Specifically, it questions the notion that people slip mindlessly into role and the idea that the dynamics of evil are in any way banal. Their research also points to the importance of leadership in the emergence of tyranny of the form displayed by Zimbardo when briefing guards in the Stanford experiment.[36][37]\\r\\nThe Stanford prison experiment was in part a response to the Milgram experiment at Yale beginning in 1961 and published in 1963.[38]\\r\\nThe Third Wave experiment involved the use of authoritarian dynamics similar to Nazi Party methods of mass control in a classroom setting by high school teacher Ron Jones in Palo Alto, California, in 1976 with the goal of demonstrating to the class in a vivid way how the German public in World War II could have acted in the way it did.[39] Although the veracity of Jones' accounts has been questioned,[40][unreliable source?] several participants in the study have gone on record to confirm the events.[41]\\r\\nIn both experiments, participants found it difficult to leave the study due to the roles they were assigned. Both studies examine human nature and the effects of authority. Personalities of the subjects had little influence on both experiments despite the test prior to the prison experiment.[42]\\r\\nIn the Milgram and the Zimbardo studies, participants conform to social pressures. Conformity is strengthened by allowing some participants to feel more or less powerful than others.[42] In both experiments, behavior is altered to match the group stereotype.\\r\\nAbu Ghraib and the experiment:","input":"What was the objective of the stanford prison experiment?"},{"output":"poetry","context":"Edgar Allan Poe (/po?/; born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809?√ø October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction.[1] He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.[2]\\r\\nPoe was born in Boston, the second child of two actors. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the following year. Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but Poe was with them well into young adulthood. Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar repeatedly clashed over debts, including those incurred by gambling, and the cost of secondary education for the young man. Poe attended the University of Virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money. Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name. It was at this time that his publishing career began, albeit humbly, with the anonymous collection of poems Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827), credited only to \\"a Bostonian\\". With the death of Frances Allan in 1829, Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement. However, Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and he ultimately parted ways with John Allan.\\r\\nPoe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move among several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In Richmond in 1836, he married Virginia Clemm, his 13-year-old cousin. In January 1845, Poe published his poem \\"The Raven\\" to instant success. His wife died of tuberculosis two years after its publication. For years, he had been planning to produce his own journal The Penn (later renamed The Stylus), though he died before it could be produced. Poe died in Baltimore on October 7, 1849, at age 40; the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol, brain congestion, cholera, drugs, heart disease, rabies, suicide, tuberculosis, and other agents.[3]\\r\\nPoe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world, as well as in specialized fields such as cosmology and cryptography. Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today. The Mystery Writers of America present an annual award known as the Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was born Edgar Poe in Boston on January 19, 1809, the second child of English-born actress Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe and actor David Poe, Jr.. He had an elder brother William Henry Leonard Poe, and a younger sister Rosalie Poe.[5] Their grandfather David Poe Sr. had emigrated from Cavan, Ireland to America around the year 1750.[6] Edgar may have been named after a character in William Shakespeare's King Lear, a play that the couple were performing in 1809.[7] His father abandoned their family in 1810,[8] and his mother died a year later from consumption (pulmonary tuberculosis). Poe was then taken into the home of John Allan, a successful Scottish merchant in Richmond, Virginia who dealt in a variety of goods, including tobacco, cloth, wheat, tombstones, and slaves.[9] The Allans served as a foster family and gave him the name \\"Edgar Allan Poe\\",[10] though they never formally adopted him.[11]\\r\\nThe Allan family had Poe baptized in the Episcopal Church in 1812. John Allan alternately spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster son.[10] The family sailed to Britain in 1815, and Poe attended the grammar school for a short period in Irvine, Scotland (where John Allan was born) before rejoining the family in London in 1816. There he studied at a boarding school in Chelsea until summer 1817. He was subsequently entered at the Reverend John Bransby's Manor House School at Stoke Newington, then a suburb 4 miles (6.4?km) north of London.[12]\\r\\nPoe moved with the Allans back to Richmond, Virginia in 1820. In 1824, Poe served as the lieutenant of the Richmond youth honor guard as Richmond celebrated the visit of the Marquis de Lafayette.[13] In March 1825, John Allan's uncle and business benefactor William Galt, said to be one of the wealthiest men in Richmond, died,[14] leaving Allan several acres of real estate. The inheritance was estimated at $750,000. By summer 1825, Allan celebrated his expansive wealth by purchasing a two-story brick home named Moldavia.[15]\\r\\nPoe may have become engaged to Sarah Elmira Royster before he registered at the one-year-old University of Virginia in February 1826 to study ancient and modern languages.[16][17] The university, in its infancy, was established on the ideals of its founder Thomas Jefferson. It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, but these rules were generally ignored. Jefferson had enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students to choose their own studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high dropout rate.[18] During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. Poe claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe's debts increased.[19] Poe gave up on the university after a year, not feeling welcome in Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married Alexander Shelton. He traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer.[20] At some point, he started using the pseudonym Henri Le Rennet.[21]\\r\\nPoe was unable to support himself, so he enlisted in the United States Army as a private on May 27, 1827, using the name \\"Edgar A. Perry\\". He claimed that he was 22 years old even though he was 18.[22] He first served at Fort Independence in Boston Harbor for five?dollars a month.[20] That same year, he released his first book, a 40-page collection of poetry titled Tamerlane and Other Poems, attributed with the byline \\"by a Bostonian\\". Only 50?copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention.[23] Poe's regiment was posted to Fort Moultrie in Charleston, South Carolina and traveled by ship on the brig Waltham on November 8, 1827. Poe was promoted to \\"artificer\\", an enlisted tradesman who prepared shells for artillery, and had his monthly pay doubled.[24] He served for two?years and attained the rank of Sergeant Major for Artillery (the highest rank that a noncommissioned officer could achieve); he then sought to end his five-year enlistment early. He revealed his real name and his circumstances to his commanding officer, Lieutenant Howard. Howard would only allow Poe to be discharged if he reconciled with John Allan and wrote a letter to Allan, who was unsympathetic. Several months passed and pleas to Allan were ignored; Allan may not have written to Poe even to make him aware of his foster mother's illness. Frances Allan died on February 28, 1829, and Poe visited the day after her burial. Perhaps softened by his wife's death, John Allan agreed to support Poe's attempt to be discharged in order to receive an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point.[25]\\r\\nPoe finally was discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlisted term for him.[26] Before entering West Point, Poe moved back to Baltimore for a time to stay with his widowed aunt Maria Clemm, her daughter Virginia Eliza Clemm (Poe's first cousin), his brother Henry, and his invalid grandmother Elizabeth Cairnes Poe.[27] Meanwhile, Poe published his second book Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems in Baltimore in 1829.[28]\\r\\nPoe traveled to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830.[29] In October 1830, John Allan married his second wife Louisa Patterson.[30] The marriage and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of affairs led to the foster father finally disowning Poe.[31] Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting court-martialed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. Poe tactically pleaded not guilty to induce dismissal, knowing that he would be found guilty.[32]\\r\\nHe left for New York in February 1831 and released a third volume of poems, simply titled Poems. The book was financed with help from his fellow cadets at West Point, many of whom donated 75?cents to the cause, raising a total of $170. They may have been expecting verses similar to the satirical ones that Poe had been writing about commanding officers.[33] It was printed by Elam Bliss of New York, labeled as \\"Second Edition,\\" and including a page saying, \\"To the U.S. Corps of Cadets this volume is respectfully dedicated\\". The book once again reprinted the long poems \\"Tamerlane\\" and \\"Al Aaraaf\\" but also six previously unpublished poems, including early versions of \\"To Helen\\", \\"Israfel\\", and \\"The City in the Sea\\".[34] He returned to Baltimore to his aunt, brother, and cousin in March 1831. His elder brother Henry had been in ill health, in part due to problems with alcoholism, and he died on August 1, 1831.[35]\\r\\nAfter his brother's death, Poe began more earnest attempts to start his career as a writer. He chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so.[36] He was the first well-known American to try to live by writing alone[2][37] and was hampered by the lack of an international copyright law.[38] Publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans.[37] The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837.[39] There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues[40] and publishers often refused to pay their writers, or paid them much later than they promised.[41] Throughout his attempts to live as a writer, Poe repeatedly had to resort to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.[42]\\r\\nAfter his early attempts at poetry, Poe had turned his attention to prose. He placed a few stories with a Philadelphia publication and began work on his only drama Politian. The Baltimore Saturday Visiter awarded Poe a prize in October 1833 for his short story \\"MS. Found in a Bottle\\".[43] The story brought him to the attention of John P. Kennedy, a Baltimorean of considerable means. He helped Poe place some of his stories, and introduced him to Thomas W. White, editor of the Southern Literary Messenger in Richmond. Poe became assistant editor of the periodical in August 1835,[44] but was discharged within a few weeks for having been caught drunk by his boss.[45] Returning to Baltimore, Poe obtained a license to marry his cousin Virginia on September 22, 1835, though it is unknown if they were married at that time.[46] He was 26 and she was 13.\\r\\nHe was reinstated by White after promising good behavior, and went back to Richmond with Virginia and her mother. He remained at the Messenger until January 1837. During this period, Poe claimed that its circulation increased from 700 to 3,500.[5] He published several poems, book reviews, critiques, and stories in the paper. On May 16, 1836, he and Virginia Clemm held a Presbyterian wedding ceremony at their Richmond boarding house, with a witness falsely attesting Clemm's age as 21.[46][47]\\r\\nThe Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket was published and widely reviewed in 1838.[48] In the summer of 1839, Poe became assistant editor of Burton's Gentleman's Magazine. He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing his reputation as a trenchant critic which he had established at the Southern Literary Messenger. Also in 1839, the collection Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque was published in two?volumes, though he made little money from it and it received mixed reviews.[49] Poe left Burton's after about a year and found a position as assistant at Graham's Magazine.[50]\\r\\nIn June 1840, Poe published a prospectus announcing his intentions to start his own journal called The Stylus.[51] Originally, Poe intended to call the journal The Penn, as it would have been based in Philadelphia. In the June 6, 1840 issue of Philadelphia's Saturday Evening Post, Poe bought advertising space for his prospectus: \\"Prospectus of the Penn Magazine, a Monthly Literary journal to be edited and published in the city of Philadelphia by Edgar A. Poe.\\"[52] The journal was never produced before Poe's death.\\r\\nAround this time, he attempted to secure a position with the Tyler administration, claiming that he was a member of the Whig Party.[53] He hoped to be appointed to the Custom House in Philadelphia with help from President Tyler's son Robert,[54] an acquaintance of Poe's friend Frederick Thomas.[55] Poe failed to show up for a meeting with Thomas to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to have been sick, though Thomas believed that he had been drunk.[56] Though he was promised an appointment, all positions were filled by others.[57]\\r\\nOne evening in January 1842, Virginia showed the first signs of consumption, now known as tuberculosis, while singing and playing the piano. Poe described it as breaking a blood vessel in her throat.[58] She only partially recovered. Poe began to drink more heavily under the stress of Virginia's illness. He left Graham's and attempted to find a new position, for a time angling for a government post. He returned to New York where he worked briefly at the Evening Mirror before becoming editor of the Broadway Journal and, later, sole owner.[59] There he alienated himself from other writers by publicly accusing Henry Wadsworth Longfellow of plagiarism, though Longfellow never responded.[60] On January 29, 1845, his poem \\"The Raven\\" appeared in the Evening Mirror and became a popular sensation. It made Poe a household name almost instantly,[61] though he was paid only $9 for its publication.[62] It was concurrently published in The American Review: A Whig Journal under the pseudonym \\"Quarles\\".[63]\\r\\nThe Broadway Journal failed in 1846.[59] Poe moved to a cottage in Fordham, New York, in what is now the Bronx. That home is known today as the \\"Poe Cottage\\" on the southeast corner of the Grand Concourse and Kingsbridge Road, where he befriended the Jesuits at St. John's College nearby (now Fordham University).[64] Virginia died there on January 30, 1847.[65] Biographers and critics often suggest that Poe's frequent theme of the \\"death of a beautiful woman\\" stems from the repeated loss of women throughout his life, including his wife.[66]\\r\\nPoe was increasingly unstable after his wife's death. He attempted to court poet Sarah Helen Whitman who lived in Providence, Rhode Island. Their engagement failed, purportedly because of Poe's drinking and erratic behavior. There is also strong evidence that Whitman's mother intervened and did much to derail their relationship.[67] Poe then returned to Richmond and resumed a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster.[68]\\r\\nOn October 3, 1849, Poe was found delirious on the streets of Baltimore, \\"in great distress, and... in need of immediate assistance\\", according to Joseph W. Walker who found him.[69] He was taken to the Washington Medical College where he died on Sunday, October 7, 1849 at 5:00 in the morning.[70] Poe was never coherent long enough to explain how he came to be in his dire condition and, oddly, was wearing clothes that were not his own. He is said to have repeatedly called out the name \\"Reynolds\\" on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring. Some sources say that Poe's final words were \\"Lord help my poor soul\\".[70] All medical records have been lost, including his death certificate.[71]\\r\\nNewspapers at the time reported Poe's death as \\"congestion of the brain\\" or \\"cerebral inflammation\\", common euphemisms for deaths from disreputable causes such as alcoholism.[72] The actual cause of death remains a mystery.[73] Speculation has included delirium tremens, heart disease, epilepsy, syphilis, meningeal inflammation,[3] cholera,[74] and rabies.[75] One theory dating from 1872 suggests that cooping was the cause of Poe's death, a form of electoral fraud in which citizens were forced to vote for a particular candidate, sometimes leading to violence and even murder.[76]\\r\\nThe day that Edgar Allan Poe was buried, a long obituary appeared in the New York Tribune signed \\"Ludwig\\". It was soon published throughout the country. The piece began, \\"Edgar Allan Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore the day before yesterday. This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved by it.\\"[77] \\"Ludwig\\" was soon identified as Rufus Wilmot Griswold, an editor, critic, and anthologist who had borne a grudge against Poe since 1842. Griswold somehow became Poe's literary executor and attempted to destroy his enemy's reputation after his death.[78]\\r\\nRufus Griswold wrote a biographical article of Poe called \\"Memoir of the Author\\", which he included in an 1850 volume of the collected works. Griswold depicted Poe as a depraved, drunken, drug-addled madman and included Poe's letters as evidence.[78] Many of his claims were either lies or distorted half-truths. For example, it is now known that Poe was not a drug addict.[79] Griswold's book was denounced by those who knew Poe well,[80] but it became a popularly accepted one. This occurred in part because it was the only full biography available and was widely reprinted, and in part because readers thrilled at the thought of reading works by an \\"evil\\" man.[81] Letters that Griswold presented as proof of this depiction of Poe were later revealed as forgeries.[82]\\r\\nPoe's best known fiction works are Gothic,[83] a genre that he followed to appease the public taste.[84] His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning.[85] Many of his works are generally considered part of the dark romanticism genre, a literary reaction to transcendentalism[86] which Poe strongly disliked.[87] He referred to followers of the transcendental movement as \\"Frog-Pondians\\", after the pond on Boston Common,[88][89] and ridiculed their writings as \\"metaphorrun mad,\\"[90] lapsing into \\"obscurity for obscurity's sake\\" or \\"mysticism for mysticism's sake\\".[87] Poe once wrote in a letter to Thomas Holley Chivers that he did not dislike Transcendentalists, \\"only the pretenders and sophists among them\\".[91]\\r\\nBeyond horror, Poe also wrote satires, humor tales, and hoaxes. For comic effect, he used irony and ludicrous extravagance, often in an attempt to liberate the reader from cultural conformity.[84] \\"Metzengerstein\\" is the first story that Poe is known to have published[92] and his first foray into horror, but it was originally intended as a burlesque satirizing the popular genre.[93] Poe also reinvented science fiction, responding in his writing to emerging technologies such as hot air balloons in \\"The Balloon-Hoax\\".[94]\\r\\nPoe wrote much of his work using themes aimed specifically at mass-market tastes.[95] To that end, his fiction often included elements of popular pseudosciences, such as phrenology[96] and physiognomy.[97]\\r\\nPoe's writing reflects his literary theories, which he presented in his criticism and also in essays such as \\"The Poetic Principle\\".[98] He disliked didacticism[99] and allegory,[100] though he believed that meaning in literature should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface. Works with obvious meanings, he wrote, cease to be art.[101] He believed that work of quality should be brief and focus on a specific single effect.[98] To that end, he believed that the writer should carefully calculate every sentiment and idea.[102]\\r\\nPoe describes his method in writing \\"The Raven\\" in the essay \\"The Philosophy of Composition\\", and he claims to have strictly followed this method. It has been questioned whether he really followed this system, however. T. S. Eliot said: \\"It is difficult for us to read that essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method.\\"[103] Biographer Joseph Wood Krutch described the essay as \\"a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization\\".[104]\\r\\nDuring his lifetime, Poe was mostly recognized as a literary critic. Fellow critic James Russell Lowell called him \\"the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in America\\", suggestingrhetoricallythat he occasionally used prussic acid instead of ink.[105] Poe's caustic reviews earned him the reputation of being a \\"tomahawk man\\".[106] A favorite target of Poe's criticism was Boston's acclaimed poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who was often defended by his literary friends in what was later called \\"The Longfellow War\\". Poe accused Longfellow of \\"the heresy of the didactic\\", writing poetry that was preachy, derivative, and thematically plagiarized.[107] Poe correctly predicted that Longfellow's reputation and style of poetry would decline, concluding, \\"We grant him high qualities, but deny him the Future\\".[108]\\r\\nPoe was also known as a writer of fiction and became one of the first American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States.[109] Poe is particularly respected in France, in part due to early translations by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire's translations became definitive renditions of Poe's work throughout Europe.[110]\\r\\nPoe's early detective fiction tales featuring C. Auguste Dupin laid the groundwork for future detectives in literature. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, \\"Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed.... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\\"[111] The Mystery Writers of America have named their awards for excellence in the genre the \\"Edgars\\".[112] Poe's work also influenced science fiction, notably Jules Verne, who wrote a sequel to Poe's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket called An Antarctic Mystery, also known as The Sphinx of the Ice Fields.[113] Science fiction author H. G. Wells noted, \\"Pym tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago.\\"[114] In 2013, The Guardian cited The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket as one of the greatest novels ever written in the English language, and noted its influence on later authors such as Henry James, Arthur Conan Doyle, B. Traven, and David Morrell.[115]\\r\\nLike many famous artists, Poe's works have spawned imitators.[116] One trend among imitators of Poe has been claims by clairvoyants or psychics to be \\"channeling\\" poems from Poe's spirit. One of the most notable of these was Lizzie Doten, who published Poems from the Inner Life in 1863, in which she claimed to have \\"received\\" new compositions by Poe's spirit. The compositions were re-workings of famous Poe poems such as \\"The Bells\\", but which reflected a new, positive outlook.[117]\\r\\nEven so, Poe has received not only praise, but criticism as well. This is partly because of the negative perception of his personal character and its influence upon his reputation.[109] William Butler Yeats was occasionally critical of Poe and once called him \\"vulgar\\".[118] Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson reacted to \\"The Raven\\" by saying, \\"I see nothing in it\\",[119] and derisively referred to Poe as \\"the jingle man\\".[120] Aldous Huxley wrote that Poe's writing \\"falls into vulgarity\\" by being \\"too poetical\\"the equivalent of wearing a diamond ring on every finger.[121]\\r\\nIt is believed that only 12 copies have survived of Poe's first book Tamerlane and Other Poems. In December 2009, one copy sold at Christie's, New York for $662,500, a record price paid for a work of American literature.[122]\\r\\nEureka: A Prose Poem, an essay written in 1848, included a cosmological theory that presaged the Big Bang theory by 80 years,[123][124] as well as the first plausible solution to Olbers' paradox.[125][126] Poe eschewed the scientific method in Eureka and instead wrote from pure intuition.[127] For this reason, he considered it a work of art, not science,[127] but insisted that it was still true[128] and considered it to be his career masterpiece.[129] Even so, Eureka is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions ignored Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets.[130]\\r\\nPoe had a keen interest in cryptography. He had placed a notice of his abilities in the Philadelphia paper Alexander's Weekly (Express) Messenger, inviting submissions of ciphers which he proceeded to solve.[131] In July 1841, Poe had published an essay called \\"A Few Words on Secret Writing\\" in Graham's Magazine. Capitalizing on public interest in the topic, he wrote \\"The Gold-Bug\\" incorporating ciphers as an essential part of the story.[132] Poe's success with cryptography relied not so much on his deep knowledge of that field (his method was limited to the simple substitution cryptogram) as on his knowledge of the magazine and newspaper culture. His keen analytical abilities, which were so evident in his detective stories, allowed him to see that the general public was largely ignorant of the methods by which a simple substitution cryptogram can be solved, and he used this to his advantage.[131] The sensation that Poe created with his cryptography stunts played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines.[133]\\r\\nPoe had an influence on cryptography beyond increasing public interest during his lifetime. William Friedman, America's foremost cryptologist, was heavily influenced by Poe.[134] Friedman's initial interest in cryptography came from reading \\"The Gold-Bug\\" as a child, an interest that he later put to use in deciphering Japan's PURPLE code during World War II.[135]\\r\\nThe historical Edgar Allan Poe has appeared as a fictionalized character, often representing the \\"mad genius\\" or \\"tormented artist\\" and exploiting his personal struggles.[136] Many such depictions also blend in with characters from his stories, suggesting that Poe and his characters share identities.[137] Often, fictional depictions of Poe use his mystery-solving skills in such novels as The Poe Shadow by Matthew Pearl.[138]\\r\\n\\r\\nNo childhood home of Poe is still standing, including the Allan family's Moldavia estate. The oldest standing home in Richmond, the Old Stone House, is in use as the Edgar Allan Poe Museum, though Poe never lived there. The collection includes many items that Poe used during his time with the Allan family, and also features several rare first printings of Poe works. 13 West Range is the dorm room that Poe is believed to have used while studying at the University of Virginia in 1826; it is preserved and available for visits. Its upkeep is now overseen by a group of students and staff known as the Raven Society.[139]\\r\\nThe earliest surviving home in which Poe lived is in Baltimore, preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum. Poe is believed to have lived in the home at the age of 23 when he first lived with Maria Clemm and Virginia (as well as his grandmother and possibly his brother William Henry Leonard Poe).[140] It is open to the public and is also the home of the Edgar Allan Poe Society. Of the several homes that Poe, his wife Virginia, and his mother-in-law Maria rented in Philadelphia, only the last house has survived. The Spring Garden home, where the author lived in 1843√ø1844, is today preserved by the National Park Service as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site.[141] Poe's final home is preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage in the Bronx.[65]\\r\\nIn Boston, a commemorative plaque on Boylston Street is several blocks away from the actual location of Poe's birth.[4][142][143][144] The house which was his birthplace at 62 Carver Street no longer exists; also, the street has since been renamed \\"Charles Street South\\".[145][146] A \\"square\\" at the intersection of Broadway, Fayette, and Carver Streets had once been named in his honor,[147] but it disappeared when the streets were rearranged. In 2009, the intersection of Charles and Boylston Streets (two blocks north of his birthplace) was designated \\"Edgar Allan Poe Square\\".[148] In March 2014, fundraising was completed for construction of a permanent memorial sculpture at this location. The winning design by Stefanie Rocknak depicts a life-sized Poe striding against the wind, accompanied by a flying raven; his suitcase lid has fallen open, leaving a \\"paper trail\\" of literary works embedded in the sidewalk behind him.[149][150][151] The public unveiling on October 5, 2014 was attended by former US poet laureate Robert Pinsky.[152]\\r\\nOther Poe landmarks include a building in the Upper West Side where Poe temporarily lived when he first moved to New York. A plaque suggests that Poe wrote \\"The Raven\\" here. The bar still stands where legend says that Poe was last seen drinking before his death, in Fells Point in Baltimore. The drinking establishment is now known as \\"The Horse You Came In On\\", and local lore insists that a ghost whom they call \\"Edgar\\" haunts the rooms above.[153]\\r\\nFor decades, every January 19, a bottle of cognac and three roses were left at Poe's original grave marker by an unknown visitor affectionately referred to as the \\"Poe Toaster\\". On August 15, 2007, Sam Porpora, a former historian at the Westminster Church in Baltimore where Poe is buried, claimed that he had started the tradition in 1949. Porpora said that the tradition began in order to raise money and enhance the profile of the church. His story has not been confirmed,[154] and some details which he gave to the press are factually inaccurate.[155] The Poe Toaster's last appearance was on January 19, 2009, the day of Poe's bicentennial.[156]\\r\\nTales\\r\\nPoetry\\r\\nOther works","input":"What type of stories did edgar allan poe write?"},{"output":"over eighty years old","context":"The story of  Daniel in the lions' den (chapter 6 in the Book of Daniel) tells how Daniel is raised to high office by his royal master Darius the Mede, but jealous rivals trick Darius into issuing a decree which condemns Daniel to death.

Daniel continues to pray to the God of Israel, and the king, although deeply distressed, must condemn Daniel to death, for the edicts of the Medes and Persians cannot be altered.  Hoping for Daniel's deliverance, he has him cast into the pit. At daybreak the king hurries to the place and cries out anxiously, asking if God had saved his friend. Daniel replies that his God had sent an angel to close the jaws of the lions, \\"because I was found blameless before him.\\" The king commands that those who had conspired against Daniel should be thrown to the lions in his place, along with their wives and children, and writes to all the people of the whole world commanding that all should tremble and fear before the God of Daniel.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is generally accepted that the Book of Daniel originated as a collection of folktales among the Babylonian diaspora, the Jewish community living in Babylon and Mesopotamia in the Persian and Hellenistic periods (5th to 2nd centuries BC).[8] Chapters 4√ø6, which includes the tale of Daniel in the lions' den, may belong to the earliest stage, as these differ quite markedly in the oldest texts.[9] Although the entire book is traditionally ascribed to Daniel the seer, the tales of chapters 1-6, including the story of the lion's den, are the voice of an anonymous narrator (except for chapter 4 which is in the form of a letter from king Nebuchadnezzar).[10] It is possible that the name of Daniel was chosen for the hero because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nChapters 2-7 are in Aramaic, and are in the clear form of a chiasm (a poetic structure in which the main point or message of a passage is placed in the centre and framed by further repetitions on either side):[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of Daniel in the lions' den in chapter 6 is paired with the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and the \\"fiery furnace\\" in Daniel 3. The parallels include the jealousy of non-Jews, an imperial edict requiring Jews to compromise their religion on pain of death, and divine deliverance. Each story climaxes with the king confessing the greatness of the God of the Jews and issuing an edict of royal protection. In each case life is preserved through divine presence in the fire or the pit.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe structure of Daniel 6 itself is also in the form of a chiasm:[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Josippon, \\"the beasts in the den received Daniel as faithful dogs might receive their returning master, wagging their tails and licking him.\\"  The Midrash Tehillim says that \\"the mouth of the den was closed with a huge stone, which had rolled of itself from Palestine to Babylon for that purpose\\" and that \\"upon this stone sat an angel in the shape of a lion, so that Daniel's enemies might not harass him.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Daniel is sometimes depicted as a young man in illustrations of the incident, James Montgomery Boice points out that he would have been over eighty years old at the time.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nPainters who have depicted this incident include:","input":"How old was daniel when he went into the lion's den?"},{"output":"6 April 1652","context":"","input":"When did white settlers arrived in south africa?"},{"output":"from one to six months depending on weather conditions","context":"The Middle Passage was the stage of the triangular trade in which millions of Africans[1] were shipped to the New World as part of the Atlantic slave trade. Ships departed Europe for African markets with manufactured goods, which were traded for purchased or kidnapped Africans, who were transported across the Atlantic as slaves; the slaves were then sold or traded for raw materials,[2] which would be transported back to Europe to complete the voyage. Voyages on the Middle Passage were large financial undertakings, generally organized by companies or groups of investors rather than individuals.[3]\\r\\nThe \\"Middle Passage\\" was considered a time of in-betweenness for those being traded from Africa to America. The close quarters and intentional division of pre-established African communities by the ship crew motivated captive Africans to forge bonds of kinship which then created forced transatlantic communities.[4]\\r\\nTraders from the Americas and Caribbean received the enslaved Africans. European powers such as Portugal, England, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Denmark√øNorway, Sweden, and Brandenburg, as well as traders from Brazil and North America, took part in this trade. The enslaved Africans came mostly from eight regions: Senegambia, Upper Guinea, Windward Coast, Gold Coast, Bight of Benin, Bight of Biafra, West Central Africa and Southeastern Africa.[5]\\r\\nAn estimated 15% of the Africans died at sea, with mortality rates considerably higher in Africa itself in the process of capturing and transporting indigenous people to the ships.[6] The total number of African deaths directly attributable to the Middle Passage voyage is estimated at up to two million; a broader look at African deaths directly attributable to the institution of slavery from 1500 to 1900 suggests up to four million African deaths.[7]\\r\\nFor two hundred years, 1440√ø1640, Portuguese slavers had a near monopoly on the export of slaves from Africa. During the 18th century, when the slave trade transported about 6 million Africans, British slavers carried almost 2.5 million.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe duration of the transatlantic voyage varied widely,[2] from one to six months depending on weather conditions. The journey became more efficient over the centuries; while an average transatlantic journey of the early 16th century lasted several months, by the 19th century the crossing often required fewer than six weeks.[9]\\r\\nIt is believed that African kings, warlords and private kidnappers sold captives to Europeans who held several coastal forts. The captives were usually force-marched to these ports along the western coast of Africa, where they were held for sale to the European or American slave traders in the barracoons. Typical slave ships contained several hundred slaves with about 30 crew members.[10]\\r\\nThe male captives were normally chained together in pairs to save space; right leg to the next man's left leg  while the women and children may have had somewhat more room. The chains or hand and leg cuffs were known as bilboes, which were among the many tools of the slave trade, and which were always in short supply. Bilboes were mainly used on men, and they consisted of two iron shackles locked on a post and were usually fastened around the ankles of two men.[11] At best, captives were fed beans, corn, yams, rice, and palm oil. Slaves were fed one meal a day with water, if at all. When food was scarce, slaveholders would get priority over the slaves.[citation needed] Sometimes captives were allowed to move around during the day, but many ships kept the shackles on throughout the arduous journey. Aboard certain French ships, slaves were brought on deck to periodically receive fresh air. While female slaves were typically permitted to be on deck more frequently, male slaves would be watched closely to prevent revolt when above deck.[12]\\r\\nSlaves below the decks lived for months in conditions of squalor and indescribable horror. Disease spread and ill health was one of the biggest killers. Mortality rates were high, and death made these conditions below the decks even worse. Even though the corpses were thrown overboard, many crew members avoided going into the hold. The slaves who had already been ill ridden were not always found immediately. Many of the living slaves could have been shackled to someone that was dead for hours and sometimes days.[11]\\r\\nMost contemporary historians estimate that between 9.4 and 12 million Africans arrived in the New World.[13][14] Disease and starvation due to the length of the passage were the main contributors to the death toll with amoebic dysentery and scurvy causing the majority of deaths.[citation needed] Additionally, outbreaks of smallpox, syphilis, measles, and other diseases spread rapidly in the close-quarter compartments.\\r\\nThe rate of death increased with the length of the voyage, since the incidence of dysentery and of scurvy increased with longer stints at sea as the quality and amount of food and water diminished. In addition to physical sickness, many slaves became too depressed to eat or function efficiently due to loss of freedom, family, security, and their own humanity.\\r\\nThe need for profits in the 18th century's Atlantic market economy drove changes in ship designs and in managing human cargo, which included enslaved Africans and the mostly white crew. Improvements in air flow on board the ships helped to decrease the infamous mortality rate that these ships had become known for throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The new designs that allowed ships to navigate faster and into rivers' mouths ensured access to many more enslaving posts along the West African coast.[15] The monetary value of enslaved Africans on any given American auction-block during the mid-18th century ranged between $800 and $1,200, which in modern times would be equivalent to $32,000√ø48,000 apiece ($100 then is now worth $4,000 due to inflation). Therefore, ship captains and investors sought technologies that would protect their human cargo.[16]\\r\\nThroughout the height of the Atlantic slave trade (1570√ø1808), slave ships were normally smaller than traditional cargo ships, with most slave ships weighing between 150 and 250 tons. This equated to about 350 to 450 enslaved Africans on each slave ship, or 1.5 to 2.4 per ton. The English ships of the time normally fell on the larger side of this spectrum and the French on the smaller side. Ships purposely designed to be smaller and more maneuverable were meant to navigate the African coastal rivers into farther inland ports; these ships therefore increased the effects of the slave trade on Africa. Additionally, the ships' sizes increased slightly throughout the 1700s; however the number of enslaved Africans per ship remained the same. This reduction in the ratio of enslaved Africans to ship tonnage was designed to increase the amount of space per person and thus improve the survival chances of everyone on board. These ships also had temporary storage decks which were separated by an open latticework or grate bulkhead, Ship masters would presumably use these chambers to divide enslaved Africans and help prevent mutiny. Some ships developed by the turn of the 19th century even had ventilation ports built into the sides and between gun ports (with hatches to keep inclement weather out). These open deck designs increased airflow and thus helped improve survival rates, diminishing potential investment losses.[15]\\r\\nAnother major factor in \\"cargo protection\\" was the increase in knowledge of diseases and medicines (along with the inclusion of a variety of medicines on the ships). First the Dutch East India Company in the 18th century, followed by some other countries and companies in the late 18th early 19th centuries, realized that the inclusion of surgeons and other medical practitioners aboard their ships was an endeavor that proved too costly for the benefits. So instead of including medical personnel they just stocked the ships with a large variety of medicines; while this was better than no medicines, and given the fact that many crew members at least had some idea of how disease was spread, without the inclusion of medical personnel the mortality rate was still very high in the 18th century.[17]\\r\\nSlaves' treatment was horrific because the captured African men and women were considered less than human; they were \\"cargo\\", or \\"goods\\", and treated as such; they were transported for marketing. Women with children were not as desirable for they took up too much space and toddlers were not wanted because of everyday maintenance.[18] For example, the Zong, a British slaver, took too many slaves on a voyage to the New World in 1781. Overcrowding combined with malnutrition and disease killed several crew members and around 60 slaves. Bad weather made the Zong's voyage slow and lack of drinking water became a concern. The crew decided to drown some slaves at sea, to conserve water and allow the owners to collect insurance for lost cargo. About 130 slaves were killed and a number chose to kill themselves in defiance, by jumping into the water willingly. The Zong incident became fuel for the abolitionist movement and a major court case, as the insurance company refused to compensate for the loss.\\r\\nWhile slaves were generally kept fed and supplied with drink as healthy slaves were more valuable, if resources ran low on the long, unpredictable voyages, the crew received preferential treatment. Slave punishment and torture was very common, as on the voyage the crew had to turn independent people into obedient slaves.[citation needed] Whipping and use of the cat o' nine tails were a common occurrence; sometimes slaves were beaten for \\"melancholy\\".[citation needed] Pregnant women on the ships who delivered their babies aboard risked the chance of their children being killed in order for the mothers to be sold.[18] The worst punishments were for rebelling; in one instance a captain punished a failed rebellion by killing one involved slave immediately, and forcing two other slaves to eat his heart and liver.[19]\\r\\nAs a way to counteract disease and suicide attempts, the crew would force the slaves onto the deck of the ship for exercise, usually resulting in beatings because the slaves would be unwilling to dance for them or interact.[20] These beatings would often be severe and could result in the slave dying or becoming more susceptible to diseases.\\r\\nSlaves resisted in many ways. The two most common types of resistance were refusal to eat and suicide. Suicide was a frequent occurrence, often by refusal of food or medicine or jumping overboard, as well as by a variety of other opportunistic means.[21] If a slave jumped overboard, they would often be left to drown or shot from the boat.[22] Over the centuries, some African peoples, such as the Kru, came to be understood as holding substandard value as slaves, because they developed a reputation for being too proud for slavery, and for attempting suicide immediately upon losing their freedom.[23]\\r\\nBoth suicide and self-starving were prevented as much as possible by slaver crews; slaves were often force-fed or tortured until they ate, though some still managed to starve themselves to death; slaves were kept away from means of suicide, and the sides of the deck were often netted.[citation needed] Slaves were still successful, especially at jumping overboard. Often when an uprising failed, the mutineers would jump en masse into the sea. Slaves generally believed that if they jumped overboard, they would be returned to their family and friends in their village or to their ancestors in the afterlife.[24]\\r\\nSuicide by jumping overboard was such a problem that captains had to address it directly in many cases. They used the sharks that followed the ships as a terror weapon. One captain, who had a rash of suicides on his ship, took a woman and lowered her into the water on a rope, and pulled her out as fast as possible. When she came in view, the sharks had already killed herand bitten off the lower half of her body.[25]\\r\\nIn order to interact with each other on the voyage, slaves created a communication system unbeknownst to Europeans: They would construct choruses on the passages using their voices, bodies, and ships themselves; the hollow design of the ships allowed slaves to use them as percussive instruments and to amplify their songs. This combination of \\"instruments\\" was both a way for slaves to communicate as well as create a new identity since slavers attempted to strip them of that. Although most slaves were from various regions around Africa, their situation allowed them to come together and create a new culture and identity aboard the ships with a common language and method of communication:\\r\\n[C]all and response soundings allowed men and women speaking different languages to communicate about the conditions of their captivity. In fact, on board the Hubridas, what began as murmurs and morphed into song erupted before long into the shouts and cries of coordinated revolt.[26]\\r\\nThis communication was a direct subversion of European authority and allowed slaves to have a form of power and identity otherwise prohibited. Furthermore, such organization and coming together enabled revolts and uprisings to actually be coordinated and successful at times.\\r\\nAboard ships, the captives were not always willing to follow orders. Sometimes they reacted in violence. Slave ships were designed and operated to try to prevent the slaves from revolting. Resistance among the slaves usually ended in failure and participants in the rebellion were punished severely. About one out of ten ships experienced some sort of rebellion.[27]\\r\\nOttobah Cugoano, who was taken from Africa as a slave when he was a child, later described an uprising aboard the ship on which he was transported to the West Indies:\\r\\nWhen we found ourselves at last taken away, death was more preferable than life, and a plan was concerted amongst us, that we might burn and blow up the ship, and to perish all together in the flames.[28]\\r\\nThe number of rebels varied widely; often the uprisings would end with the death of a few slaves and crew. Surviving rebels were punished or executed as examples to the other slaves on board.\\r\\nSlaves also resisted through certain manifestations of their religions and mythology. They would appeal to their gods for protection and vengeance upon their captors, and would also try to curse and otherwise harm the crew using idols and fetishes. One crew found fetishes in their water supply, placed by slaves who believed they would kill all who drank from it.[24]\\r\\nWhile the owners and captains of slave ships could expect vast profits, the sailors were often badly paid and subject to brutal discipline. A crew mortality rate of around 20% was expected during a voyage, with sailors dying as a result of disease, flogging or slave uprisings.[29]\\r\\nThe sailors were often employed through coercion as they generally knew about and hated the slave trade. In port towns, recruiters and tavern owners would induce sailors to become very drunk (and indebted) and then offer to relieve their debt if they signed contracts with slave ships. If they did not, they would be imprisoned. Sailors in prison had a hard time getting jobs outside of the slave ship industry since most other maritime industries would not hire \\"jail-birds\\", so they were forced to go to the slave ships anyway.[30]","input":"How long was the atlantic slave trade journey?"},{"output":"epiphysis","context":"The long bones are those that are longer than they are wide. They are one of five types of bones: long, short, flat, irregular and sesamoid. Long bones, especially the femur and tibia, are subjected to most of the load during daily activities and they are crucial for skeletal mobility. They grow primarily by elongation of the diaphysis, with an epiphysis at each end of the growing bone. The ends of epiphyses are covered with hyaline cartilage (\\"articular cartilage\\"). The longitudinal growth of long bones is a result of endochondral ossification at the epiphyseal plate. Bone growth in length is stimulated by the production of growth hormone (GH), a secretion of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland.\\r\\nThe long bones include the femora, tibiae, and fibulae of the legs; the humeri, radii, and ulnae of the arms; metacarpals and metatarsals of the hands and feet, the phalanges of the fingers and toes, and the clavicles or collar bones. The long bones of the human leg comprise nearly half of adult height. The other primary skeletal component of height are the vertebrae and skull.\\r\\nThe outside of the bone consists of a layer of connective tissue called the periosteum.

The Promenade was decorated with what was described as \\"festoons of garland lamps\\" using about 10,000 light bulbs. The local Chamber of trade as well as other local businesses requested Blackpool Council to stage the event in September of the same year. The subsequent event was such a success that in 1913 the council were again asked to stage the Princess Parade lights as an end of season event. With the outbreak of World War I there were no further displays until 1925 when the lights were again on display and extended to run from Manchester Square to Cocker Square. In 1932 animated tableaux were erected running along the cliffs from North Shore to Bispham, and the Illuminations were extended to its current length running from Starr Gate to Red Bank Road at Bispham. The Illuminations were ready to shine in 1939 but the outbreak of World War II again interrupted the annual display and post war austerity meant the lights were not switched on again until 1949.[6]\\r\\nEvery year there is also the Festival of Light which features interactive installations and is described as being \\"a contemporary look at the concept of light and art working together to create entertainment\\".[3]\\r\\nThe Illuminations have been used in modern culture in households around the United Kingdom, mainly with people quoting the following saying: \\"Turn the lights off, it's like Blackpool illuminations in here\\".\\r\\nEach year the opening night of the Illuminations, The Big Switch On, held in a specially erected arena with a celebrity pulling a switch to turn on the six miles of lights.[3] The first switch on ceremony was held in 1934 when Lord Derby flicked the switch to turn on the Illuminations.[9] In 1993 BBC Radio 1 first broadcast the switch on ceremony live when Status Quo were the guest celebrities, before in 1997 BBC Radio 2 started to cover it which continued until 2010, when GMG Radio, under its Real Radio and Smooth Radio brands took over the broadcasting of the switch on.[10] Each year one main celebrity pulls the switch while there are performances in the Radio 2 arena with a pre-switch on concert featuring pop bands, singers and comedians.\\r\\nMost visitors drive through the Illuminations by car, coach or bus.

At Bispham there is a special walkway for the tableaux which also includes mixed media in the various large tableaux displays.[11] The Illuminations cost S1.9M each year to stage.[2]\\r\\nFor the 2007 Illuminations, Interior designer and television personality Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen best known for his appearances on the BBC television programme, Changing Rooms was commissioned to create special feature on Central Promenade outside Blackpool Tower, named Decodance.[11] Llewelyn-Bowen had stated that he fell in love with what he called \\"Blackpool's high-kicking glamour and historical reputation for giddy glitz\\" while filming for the Holiday programme.[12]\\r\\nThe displays at the cliffs from North Shore to Bispham contain forty large tableaux holding more than 5,000 square metres in surface area. There is a pedestrian walkway running the length of the tableaux displays which are set back from the Promenade beyond the tramway. Blackpool Tramway runs along the entire length of the Illuminations and there are over one million lamps in the display.[8] In 2007 the Egyptian tableau which includes Egyptian sarcophagus, which eerily opens to reveal a mummified secret, returned after an overhaul. Also at Bispham on the clifftop was a new BBC Portal video screen.[13]\\r\\nAlso in 2007 a new Doctor Who display appeared with monsters from the last three series of the show. In January 2008, it was stated that this section had been the most successful feature ever built in the Illuminations.[2] And at Gynn Square on Gynn Island, a Space Invasion with an opalescent mothership hovering more than 40?ft in the air, battling it out with eight spaceships arranged in formation defending their territory. The display which used colour-changing LEDs, was created from the popular alien craft which used to adorn the Promenade.[13]\\r\\nIn October 2007, a laser beam installed on the tower for the duration of the annual Illuminations was criticised by Astronomer and presenter of The Sky at Night television programme, Patrick Moore who said, \\"Light pollution is a huge problem. I am not saying we should turn all the lights out, that is not practical, but there are some things which are very unnecessary. The Blackpool Tower light is certainly something I do not think we should be doing. I very much oppose it.\\" The beam could be seen 30 miles away. Moore called for the beam to be stopped. The Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston said the laser has added to a spiraling problem affecting astronomy.[14]\\r\\nAt the sixth annual Banquet and Ball on 9 January 2008, organised by the holiday trade umbrella group, Blackpool Combined Association, to raise funds for the Lights,[15] the new Head of Illuminations, Michael Wilcock revealed new plans for the future of the Illuminations.[2] These include,\\r\\nEach year in conjunction with the Illuminations the Blackpool Festival of Light, a fusion of art and light events and installations, is staged. In 2007 the Festival started on 31 August with various lighting displays throughout the town with displays by artists and also Blackpool and The Fylde College. These included a mixed media display entitled \\"Donkey Fest\\" on the cliffs at North Shore, \\"Water is Everywhere\\" by Creatmosphere at the Water Tower in North Shore which was an architectural light projection depicting moving water reflections, animating and highlighting the Water Tower building. Also, \\"Hypodoch\\" by artist Ann Carragher, an expression of the artists personal relationship between life, natural processes, and the female 'space & voice' of architecture throughout the ages. The light installation consisted of water and light was exhibited at a town centre art gallery.[16] Also there was the United Kingdom's first Illuminated Art Car Parade on 21 October[17][18] as well as the return of the Honda Goldwing Light Parade.[11]\\r\\nThere are a variety of rebuilt single deck cars, of different designs, all of which were rebuilt as illuminated theme trams. These run along the illuminated part of the Promenade during the Illuminations.[19] A campaign by the local newspaper, the Blackpool Gazette in 2006 to get one of the Illuminated trams, Western Train, back on track,[20] resulted in a S278,000 Heritage Lottery Fund grant to restore the tramcar which first ran in 1962. It was withdrawn from service in 1999 and had stood derelict at the Rigby Road depot.[21] The tramcar is due to return during the Illuminations Switch-On in 2008.[22] In January 2008 it was revealed that another iconic illuminated tram, the Rocket tram, which had been in service between 1961 and 1999 but which had since then stood idle, is also due to be restored with expectation being that it would return to service for the Illuminations in 2009 at a cost of about S150,000 and with the help of the Friends of the Illuminations group.[23]\\r\\nIt takes twenty two weeks for all the lights to be erected in time for the Switch on each year and nine weeks to dismantle them after the display has finished. Most of the display is now operated on low voltage (12 V and 24 V) and in 2003 the Illuminations cut electricity consumption by 11% using new technology. Then in 2004 wind turbines at the Solarium on New South Promenade contributed to powering the Illuminations for the first time.[8] The Illuminations now only use green electricity from renewable resources, comprising wind power, small-scale hydropower and Biogas. The aim is for the display to be carbon neutral by 2010.[1]\\r\\nIn January 2008 Blackpool Council announced plans to start a Friends of the Illuminations stating that they saw the future of the Illuminations as being more interactive, and that \\"the group would help us shape the future of one of the country's best, free attractions.\\" and would also encourage worldwide support.[2][23]\\r\\nSeparate from the Illuminations, as part of the Festival of Light, Blackpool Christmas Lights are switched on every year in November in a very similar fashion to the Illuminations. They are located on various streets leading out of The Promenade. On Christmas Eve, and New Year's Eve, the Illuminations are switched on non-commercially to accompany the Christmas Lights.\\r\\nCoordinates: 534908N 30321W? / ?53.81889N 3.05583W? / 53.81889; -3.05583","input":"When were the blackpool illuminations first switched on?"},{"output":"the academic discipline to which an undergraduate student formally commits","context":"An academic major is the academic discipline to which an undergraduate student formally commits. A student who successfully completes all courses required for the major qualifies for an undergraduate degree. The word \\"major\\" is also sometimes used administratively to refer to the academic discipline pursued by a graduate student or postgraduate student in a master's or doctoral program.\\r\\nAn academic major typically requires completion of a combination of prescribed and elective courses in the chosen discipline. In addition, most colleges and universities require that all students take a general core curriculum in the liberal arts. The latitude a student has in choosing courses varies from program to program.[1] An academic major is administered by select faculty in an academic department. A major administered by more than one academic department is called an interdisciplinary major. In some settings, students may be permitted to design their own major, subject to faculty approval.\\r\\nIn the US, students are usually not required to choose their major discipline when first enrolling as an undergraduate. Normally students are required to commit by the end of their second academic year at latest, and some schools even disallow students from declaring a major until this time. A student who declares two academic majors is said to have a double major. A coordinate major is an ancillary major designed to complement the primary one. A coordinate major requires fewer course credits to complete.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe roots of the academic major as we now know it first surfaced in the 19th century as \\"alternative components of the undergraduate degree\\".[2] Before that, all students receiving an undergraduate degree would be required to study the same slate of courses geared at a comprehensive \\"liberal education\\".[2]\\r\\nIn 1825, the University of Virginia initiated an educational approach that would allow students to choose, from eight options, an area of focus (ex: ancient languages, anatomy, medicine) and higher educational systems in Europe after the American civil war developed further into a stricter specialization approach to studies.[2]\\r\\nIn the United States, in the second half of the 19th century, concentrated foci at the undergraduate level began to prosper and popularize, but the familiar term \\"major\\" did not appear until 1877 in a Johns Hopkins University catalogue. The major generally required 2 years of study. The minor, required one.\\r\\nFrom 1880 to 1910, Baccalaureate granting American institutions vastly embraced a free-elective system, where students were endowed with a greater freedom to explore intellectual curiosities.\\r\\nThe 1930s witnessed the appearance of first interdisciplinary major: American studies. Culture was the grounding concept and orchestrating principle for its courses.[2] 1960s to 1970s experienced a new tide of interdisciplinary majors and a relaxation of curriculum and graduation requirements. (Civil Rights Movement spawned Womens studies and Black Studies, for example.) [3] In the 1980s and 1990s, \\"interdisciplinary studies, multiculturalism, feminist pedagogy, and a renewed concern for the coherence and direction of the undergraduate program began to assail the Baccalaureate degree dominated by the academic major.\\"[2]\\r\\nThe academic major is considered a defining and dominant characteristic of the undergraduate degree. \\"The ascendancy of the disciplines in the late nineteenth century and their continuing dominance throughout the twentieth century have left an indelible imprint on the shape and direction of the academic major\\" and research affirms that the academic major is the strongest and clearest curricular link to gains in student learning.[2] While general education is considered to be the breadth component of an undergraduate education, the major is commonly deemed as the depth aspect.[2]\\r\\nThrough its development, scholars, academics, and educators have disagreed on the purpose and nature of the undergraduate major. Generally, proponents of the major and departmental system \\"argue that they enable an academic community to foster the development, conservation and diffusion of knowledge.\\" While critics \\"claim that they promote intellectual tribalism, where specialization receives favor over the mastery of multiple epistemologies, where broader values of liberal learning and of campus unity are lost, and where innovation is inhibited due to parochial opposition to new subspecialties and research methods.\\"[2]\\r\\nIn many universities, an academic concentration is a focus within a specific academic major, that is a field of study within a specific academic major. For example, interdisciplinary programs in humanities or social sciences will require a student to pick a specific academic concentration as a focus within his academic major, such as an academic major in Interdisciplinary Humanities with an academic concentration in Film or an academic major in Interdisciplinary Social Sciences with an academic concentration in Geography. At several art schools and liberal arts colleges, an academic concentration serves a similar function to an academic minor at other universities, that is an academic discipline outside of the student's academic major in which he or she takes a small number of classes. At Brown University and Harvard University, concentrations serve the same function as majors at other institutions.\\r\\nAt the doctoral studies level, an academic major or major field refers to a student's primary focus within their degree program while a minor or minor field refers to his or her secondary focus. For example, a doctoral student studying History might pursue their degree in History with a major field in War and Society and a minor field in Postcolonial Studies.\\r\\nAn impacted major is a major for which more students apply for than the school can accommodate, a classic example of demand exceeding supply. When that occurs, the major becomes impacted and so is susceptible to higher standards of admission.\\r\\nFor example, suppose that assume a school has minimum requirements are SATs of 1100 and a GPA of 3.0.\\r\\nIf a person applies to an impacted major, the school can raise the minimum requirements as much as needed to weed out the students that it is unable to accommodate.\\r\\nIn some cases, it is a better idea to apply to a school as \\"Undeclared\\".\\r\\nFor example, if the school implements requirements of SATs of 1300 and a GPA of 3.4 for the impacted major, it would be better to apply as \\"Undeclared\\" if the student meets only the minimum requirements. The student will then have a better chance of being accepted and generally has the option of changing his/her major at a later date.","input":"What is a major in a bachelor degree?"},{"output":"The Classic period","context":"","input":"When did the mayan civilization reached its peak?"},{"output":"30 March 2002","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon (4 August 1900 √ø 30 March 2002) was the wife of King George VI and the mother of Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. She was Queen consort of the United Kingdom and the Dominions from her husband's accession in 1936 until his death in 1952, after which she was known as Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother,[2] to avoid confusion with her daughter. She was the last Empress of India.\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn into a family of British nobility, she came to prominence in 1923 when she married the Duke of York, the second son of King George V and Queen Mary. The couple and their daughters embodied traditional ideas of family and public service.[3] She undertook a variety of public engagements and became known for her consistently cheerful countenance.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1936, her husband unexpectedly became king when his brother, Edward VIII, abdicated in order to marry the American divorce Wallis Simpson. Elizabeth then became queen. She accompanied her husband on diplomatic tours to France and North America before the start of the Second World War. During the war, her seemingly indomitable spirit provided moral support to the British public. In recognition of her role as an asset to British interests, Adolf Hitler described her as \\"the most dangerous woman in Europe\\".[5] After the war, her husband's health deteriorated and she was widowed at the age of 51. Her elder daughter, aged 25, became the new queen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the death of Queen Mary in 1953, Elizabeth was viewed as the matriarch of the British royal family. In her later years, she was a consistently popular member of the family, even when other members were suffering from low levels of public approval.[6] She continued an active public life until just a few months before her death at the age of 101, seven weeks after the death of her younger daughter, Princess Margaret.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was the youngest daughter and the ninth of ten children of Claude Bowes-Lyon, Lord Glamis (later the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne in the Peerage of Scotland), and his wife, Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck. Her mother was descended from British Prime Minister William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, and Governor-General of India Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, who was the elder brother of another Prime Minister, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.[b]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location of her birth remains uncertain, but reputedly she was born either in her parents' Westminster home at Belgrave Mansions, Grosvenor Gardens, or in a horse-drawn ambulance on the way to a hospital.[9] Other possible locations include Forbes House in Ham, London, the home of her maternal grandmother, Louisa Scott.[10] Her birth was registered at Hitchin, Hertfordshire,[11] near the Strathmores' English country house, St Paul's Walden Bury, which was also given as her birthplace in the census the following year.[12] She was christened there on 23 September 1900, in the local parish church, All Saints, and her godparents included her paternal aunt Lady Maud Bowes-Lyon and cousin Venetia James.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spent much of her childhood at St Paul's Walden and at Glamis Castle, the Earl's ancestral home in Scotland. She was educated at home by a governess until the age of eight, and was fond of field sports, ponies and dogs.[14] When she started school in London, she astonished her teachers by precociously beginning an essay with two Greek words from Xenophon's Anabasis. Her best subjects were literature and scripture. After returning to private education under a German Jewish governess, K?the Kbler, she passed the Oxford Local Examination with distinction at age thirteen.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn her fourteenth birthday, Britain declared war on Germany. Four of her brothers served in the army. Her elder brother, Fergus, an officer in the Black Watch Regiment, was killed in action at the Battle of Loos in 1915. Another brother, Michael, was reported missing in action on 28 April 1917.[16] Three weeks later, the family discovered he had been captured after being wounded. He remained in a prisoner of war camp for the rest of the war. Glamis was turned into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers, which Elizabeth helped to run. She was particularly instrumental in organising the rescue of the castle's contents during a serious fire on 16 September 1916.[17] One of the soldiers she treated wrote in her autograph book that she was to be \\"Hung, drawn, & quartered?... Hung in diamonds, drawn in a coach and four, and quartered in the best house in the land.\\"[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrince Albert, Duke of York\\"Bertie\\" to the familywas the second son of King George V. He initially proposed to Elizabeth in 1921, but she turned him down, being \\"afraid never, never again to be free to think, speak and act as I feel I really ought to\\".[19] When he declared he would marry no other, his mother, Queen Mary, visited Glamis to see for herself the girl who had stolen her son's heart. She became convinced that Elizabeth was \\"the one girl who could make Bertie happy\\", but nevertheless refused to interfere.[20] At the same time, Elizabeth was courted by James Stuart, Albert's equerry, until he left the Prince's service for a better-paid job in the American oil business.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1922, Elizabeth was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Albert's sister, Princess Mary, to Viscount Lascelles.[22] The following month, Albert proposed again, but she refused him once more.[23] Eventually, in January 1923, Elizabeth agreed to marry Albert, despite her misgivings about royal life.[24] Albert's freedom in choosing Elizabeth, not a member of a royal family, though the daughter of a peer, was considered a gesture in favour of political modernisation; previously, princes were expected to marry princesses from other royal families.[25] They selected a platinum engagement ring featuring a Kashmir sapphire with two diamonds adorning its sides.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey married on 26 April 1923, at Westminster Abbey. Unexpectedly,[27] Elizabeth laid her bouquet at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior on her way into the Abbey,[28] in memory of her brother Fergus.[29] Elizabeth became styled Her Royal Highness The Duchess of York.[30] Following a wedding breakfast at Buckingham Palace prepared by chef Gabriel Tschumi, the new Duchess and her husband honeymooned at Polesden Lacey, a manor house in Surrey, and then went to Scotland, where she caught \\"unromantic\\" whooping cough.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a successful visit to Northern Ireland in July 1924, the Labour government agreed that Albert and Elizabeth could tour East Africa from December 1924 to April 1925.[32] The Labour government was defeated by the Conservatives in a general election in November (which Elizabeth described as \\"marvellous\\" to her mother)[33] and the Governor-General of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Sir Lee Stack, was assassinated three weeks later. Despite this, the tour went ahead, and they visited Aden, Kenya, Uganda, and Sudan, but Egypt was avoided because of political tensions.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbert had a stammer, which affected his ability to deliver speeches, and after October 1925, Elizabeth assisted in helping him through the therapy devised by Lionel Logue, an episode portrayed in the 2010 film The King's Speech. In 1926, the couple had their first child, Princess Elizabeth\\"Lilibet\\" to the familywho would later become Queen Elizabeth II. Another daughter, Princess Margaret Rose, was born four years later. Albert and Elizabeth, without their child, travelled to Australia to open Parliament House in Canberra in 1927.[35] She was, in her own words, \\"very miserable at leaving the baby\\".[36] Their journey by sea took them via Jamaica, the Panama Canal and the Pacific; Elizabeth fretted constantly over her baby back in Britain, but their journey was a public relations success.[37] She charmed the public in Fiji when, shaking hands with a long line of official guests, a stray dog walked in on the ceremony and she shook its paw as well.[38] In New Zealand she fell ill with a cold and missed some engagements, but enjoyed the local fishing[39] in the Bay of Islands accompanied by Australian sports fisherman Harry Andreas.[40] On the return journey, via Mauritius, the Suez Canal, Malta and Gibraltar, their transport, HMS?Renown, caught fire and they prepared to abandon ship before the fire was brought under control.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 20 January 1936, King George V died and Albert's brother, Edward, Prince of Wales, became King Edward VIII. George had expressed private reservations about his successor, saying, \\"I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne.\\"[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nJust months into his reign, Edward forced a constitutional crisis by insisting on marrying the American divorce Wallis Simpson. Although legally Edward could have married Simpson, as King he was also head of the Church of England, which at that time did not allow divorced people to remarry. Edward's ministers believed that the people would never accept Simpson as Queen and advised against the marriage. As a constitutional monarch, Edward was obliged to follow ministerial advice.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nRather than abandon his plans to marry Simpson, he chose to abdicate in favour of Albert,[44] who reluctantly became King in his place on 11 December 1936 under the regnal name of George VI. George VI and Elizabeth were crowned King and Queen of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions, and Emperor and Empress of India in Westminster Abbey on 12 May 1937, the date previously scheduled for Edward VIII. Elizabeth's crown was made of platinum and was set with the Koh-i-Noor diamond.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward and Simpson married and became the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, but while Edward was a Royal Highness, George VI withheld the style from the Duchess, a decision that Elizabeth supported.[46] Elizabeth was later quoted as referring to the Duchess as \\"that woman\\",[47] and the Duchess referred to Elizabeth as \\"Cookie\\", because of her supposed resemblance to a fat Scots cook.[6] Claims that Elizabeth remained embittered towards the Duchess were denied by her close friends; the Duke of Grafton wrote that she \\"never said anything nasty about the Duchess of Windsor, except to say she really hadn't got a clue what she was dealing with.\\"[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summer 1938, a state visit to France by the King and Queen was postponed for three weeks because of the death of the Queen's mother, Lady Strathmore. In two weeks, Norman Hartnell created an all-white trousseau for the Queen, who could not wear colours as she was still in mourning.[49] The visit was designed to bolster Anglo-French solidarity in the face of aggression from Nazi Germany.[50] The French press praised the demeanour and charm of the royal couple during the delayed but successful visit, augmented by Hartnell's wardrobe.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, Nazi aggression continued, and the government prepared for war. After the Munich Agreement of 1938 appeared to forestall the advent of armed conflict, the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was invited onto the balcony of Buckingham Palace with the King and Queen to receive acclamation from a crowd of well-wishers.[52] While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the House of Commons, which led historian John Grigg to describe the King's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as \\"the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century\\".[53] However, historians argue that the King only ever followed ministerial advice and acted as he was constitutionally bound to do.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May and June 1939, Elizabeth and her husband toured Canada from coast to coast and back, and visited the United States, spending time with President Roosevelt at the White House and his Hudson Valley estate.[55][56][57][58] U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt said that Elizabeth was \\"perfect as a Queen, gracious, informed, saying the right thing & kind but a little self-consciously regal\\".[59] The tour was designed to bolster trans-Atlantic support in the event of war, and to affirm Canada's status as an independent kingdom sharing with Britain the same person as monarch.[60][61][62][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to an often-told story, during one of the earliest of the royal couple's repeated encounters with the crowds, a Boer War veteran asked Elizabeth, \\"Are you Scots or are you English?\\" She replied, \\"I am a Canadian!\\"[64] Their reception by the Canadian and U.S. public was extremely enthusiastic,[65] and largely dissipated any residual feeling that George and Elizabeth were a lesser substitute for Edward.[66] Elizabeth told Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, \\"that tour made us\\",[67] and she returned to Canada frequently both on official tours and privately.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Second World War, the King and Queen became symbols of the fight against fascism.[69] Shortly after the declaration of war, The Queen's Book of the Red Cross was conceived. Fifty authors and artists contributed to the book, which was fronted by Cecil Beaton's portrait of the Queen and was sold in aid of the Red Cross.[70] Elizabeth publicly refused to leave London or send the children to Canada, even during the Blitz, when she was advised by the Cabinet to do so. She declared, \\"The children won't go without me. I won't leave the King. And the King will never leave.\\"[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth visited troops, hospitals, factories, and parts of Britain that were targeted by the German Luftwaffe, in particular the East End, near London's docks. Her visits initially provoked hostility; rubbish was thrown at her and the crowds jeered,[6] in part because she wore expensive clothes that served to alienate her from people suffering the deprivations of war. She explained that if the public came to see her they would wear their best clothes, so she should reciprocate in kind; Norman Hartnell dressed her in gentle colours and avoided black to represent \\"the rainbow of hope\\".[72] When Buckingham Palace itself took several hits during the height of the bombing, Elizabeth was able to say, \\"I'm glad we've been bombed. It makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.\\"[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the King and Queen spent the working day at Buckingham Palace, partly for security and family reasons they stayed at night at Windsor Castle about 20 miles (32?km) west of central London with the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. The Palace had lost much of its staff to the army, and most of the rooms were shut.[74] The windows were shattered by bomb blasts, and had to be boarded up.[75] During the \\"Phoney War\\" the Queen was given revolver training because of fears of imminent invasion.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdolf Hitler is said to have called her \\"the most dangerous woman in Europe\\" because he viewed her popularity as a threat to German interests.[5] However, before the war both she and her husband, like most of Parliament and the British public, had supported appeasement and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, believing after the experience of the First World War that war had to be avoided at all costs. After the resignation of Chamberlain, the King asked Winston Churchill to form a government. Although the King was initially suspicious of Churchill's character and motives, in due course both the King and Queen came to respect and admire him.[77][78]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1945 British general election, Churchill's Conservative party was soundly defeated by the Labour party of Clement Attlee. Elizabeth's political views were rarely disclosed,[79] but a letter she wrote in 1947 described Attlee's \\"high hopes of a socialist heaven on earth\\" as fading and presumably describes those who voted for him as \\"poor people, so many half-educated and bemused. I do love them.\\"[80] Woodrow Wyatt thought her \\"much more pro-Conservative\\" than other members of the royal family,[81] but she later told him, \\"I like the dear old Labour Party.\\"[82] She also told the Duchess of Grafton, \\"I love communists\\".[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1947 royal tour of South Africa, Elizabeth's serene public behaviour was broken, exceptionally, when she rose from the royal car to strike an admirer with her umbrella because she had mistaken his enthusiasm for hostility.[84] The 1948 royal tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed because of the King's declining health. In March 1949, he had a successful operation to improve the circulation in his right leg.[85] In summer 1951, the Queen and her daughters fulfilled the King's public engagements in his place. In September, he was diagnosed with lung cancer.[86] After a lung resection, he appeared to recover, but the delayed trip to Australia and New Zealand was altered so that Princess Elizabeth and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, went in the King and Queen's place, in January 1952.[87] The King died in his sleep on 6 February 1952 while Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were in Kenya en route to the southern hemisphere, and they returned immediately to London, as queen and prince consort.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after George VI's death, Elizabeth began to be styled as Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother because the normal style for the widow of a king, \\"Queen Elizabeth\\", would have been too similar to the style of her elder daughter, now Queen Elizabeth II.[88] Popularly, she became the \\"Queen Mother\\" or the \\"Queen Mum\\".[89] She was devastated by her husband's death and retired to Scotland. However, after a meeting with the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, she broke her retirement and resumed her public duties.[90] Eventually she became just as busy as queen mother as she had been as queen consort. In July 1953, she undertook her first overseas visit since the funeral when she visited the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland with Princess Margaret. She laid the foundation stone of the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland √ø the current University of Zimbabwe.[91] Upon her return to the region in 1957, Elizabeth was inaugurated as the College's President, and attended other events that were deliberately designed to be multi-racial.[92] During her daughter's extensive tour of the Commonwealth over 1953√ø54, Elizabeth acted as a Counsellor of State and looked after her grandchildren, Charles and Anne.[93] In February 1959, she visited Kenya and Uganda.[94][95]\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth oversaw the restoration of the remote Castle of Mey, on the north coast of Scotland, which she used to \\"get away from everything\\"[96] for three weeks in August and ten days in October each year.[97] She developed her interest in horse racing, particularly steeplechasing, which had been inspired by the amateur jockey Lord Mildmay in 1949.[98] She owned the winners of approximately 500 races. Her distinctive colours of blue with buff stripes were carried by horses such as Special Cargo, the winner of the 1984 Whitbread Gold Cup, and Devon Loch, which spectacularly halted just short of the winning post at the 1956 Grand National[99] and whose jockey Dick Francis later had a successful career as the writer of racing-themed detective stories. Peter Cazalet was her trainer for over 20 years. Although (contrary to rumour) she never placed bets, she did have the racing commentaries piped direct to her London residence, Clarence House, so she could follow the races.[100] As an art collector, she purchased works by Claude Monet, Augustus John and Peter Carl Faberg, among others.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1964, Elizabeth had an emergency appendectomy, which led to the postponement of a planned tour of Australia, New Zealand and Fiji until 1966.[102] She recuperated during a Caribbean cruise aboard the royal yacht, Britannia.[103] In December 1966, she underwent an operation to remove a tumour after she was diagnosed with colon cancer. Contrary to rumours, she did not have a colostomy.[104][105] She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1984 and a lump was removed from her breast. Her bouts with cancer were never made public during her lifetime.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1982, Queen Elizabeth was rushed to hospital when a fish bone became stuck in her throat, and had an operation to remove it. Being a keen angler, she calmly joked afterwards, \\"The salmon have got their own back.\\"[107] Similar incidents occurred at Balmoral in August 1986, when she was hospitalised at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary overnight but no operation was needed,[108] and May 1993, when she was admitted to the Infirmary for surgery under general anaesthetic.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1975, Queen Elizabeth visited Iran at the invitation of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The British ambassador and his wife, Anthony and Sheila Parsons, noted how the Iranians were bemused by her habit of speaking to everyone regardless of status or importance, and hoped the Shah's entourage would learn from the visit to pay more attention to ordinary people.[110] Between 1976 and 1984, she made annual summer visits to France,[111] which were among 22 private trips to continental Europe between 1963 and 1992.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1987, Queen Elizabeth was criticised when it emerged that two of her nieces, Katherine and Nerissa Bowes-Lyon, had both been committed to a psychiatric hospital because they were severely handicapped. However, Burke's Peerage had listed the sisters as dead, apparently because their mother, Fenella (the Queen Mother's sister-in-law), \\"was 'extremely vague' when it came to filling in forms and might not have completed the paperwork for the family entry correctly\\".[113] When Nerissa died the year before, her grave was originally marked with a plastic tag and a serial number. The Queen Mother said that the news of their institutionalisation came as a surprise to her.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her later years, the Queen Mother became known for her longevity. Her 90th birthday4 August 1990was celebrated by a parade on 27 June that involved many of the 300 organisations of which she was patron.[115] In 1995, she attended events commemorating the end of the war fifty years before, and had two operations: one to remove a cataract in her left eye, and one to replace her right hip.[116] In 1998, her left hip was replaced after it was broken when she slipped and fell during a visit to Sandringham stables.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen Elizabeth's 100th birthday was celebrated in a number of ways: a parade that celebrated the highlights of her life included contributions from Sir Norman Wisdom and Sir John Mills;[118] her image appeared on a special commemorative S20 note issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland;[119] and she attended a lunch at the Guildhall, London, at which George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, accidentally attempted to drink her glass of wine. Her quick admonition of \\"That's mine!\\" caused widespread amusement.[120] In November 2000, she broke her collarbone in a fall that kept her recuperating at home over Christmas and the New Year.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 August 2001, Queen Elizabeth had a blood transfusion for anaemia after suffering from mild heat exhaustion, though she was well enough to make her traditional appearance outside Clarence House three days later to celebrate her 101st birthday.[122][123] Her final public engagements included planting a cross at the Field of Remembrance on 8 November 2001;[124] a reception at the Guildhall, London, for the reformation of the 600 Squadron, Royal Auxiliary Air Force on 15 November;[125] and attending the re-commissioning of HMS?Ark Royal on 22 November.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2001, aged 101, Elizabeth fractured her pelvis in a fall. Even so, she insisted on standing for the National Anthem during the memorial service for her husband on 6 February the following year.[127] Just three days later, her second daughter Princess Margaret died. On 13 February 2002, the Queen Mother fell and cut her arm in her sitting room at Sandringham House; an ambulance and doctor were called, and the wound was dressed.[128] She was still determined to attend Margaret's funeral at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, two days later on the Friday of that week,[129] even though the Queen and the rest of the royal family were concerned about the journey the Queen Mother would face to get from Norfolk to Windsor;[130] she was also rumoured to be hardly eating. Nevertheless, she flew to Windsor by helicopter, and so that no photographs of her in a wheelchair could be takenshe insisted that she be shielded from the press[130]she travelled to the service in a people carrier with blacked√øout windows,[131][132] which had been previously used by Margaret.[130][133]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 March 2002, Queen Elizabeth was present at the luncheon of the annual lawn party of the Eton Beagles, and watched the Cheltenham Races on television; however, her health began to deteriorate precipitately during her last weeks after retreating to Royal Lodge for the final time.[134]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 March 2002, at 15:15 (GMT), the Queen Mother died in her sleep at the Royal Lodge, Windsor Great Park, with her surviving daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, at her bedside. She had been suffering from a cold for the previous four months.[128] At 101?years and 238?days old she was the longest-lived member of the royal family in British history. Her last surviving sister-in-law Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester,[135] exceeded that, dying aged 102 on 29 October 2004.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth grew camellias in every one of her gardens, and before her flag-draped coffin was taken from Windsor to lie in state at Westminster Hall, an arrangement of camellias from her own gardens was placed on top.[137] An estimated 200,000 people over three days filed past as she lay in state in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster.[138] Members of the household cavalry and other branches of the armed forces stood guard at the four corners of the catafalque. At one point, her four grandsons Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Viscount Linley mounted the guard as a mark of respectan honour similar to the Vigil of the Princes at the lying in state of King George V.[139][140]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day of her funeral, 9 April, the Governor General of Canada issued a proclamation asking Canadians to honour Elizabeth's memory that day.[141] In Australia, the Governor-General read the lesson at a memorial service held in St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney.[142]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn London, more than a million people filled the area outside Westminster Abbey and along the 23-mile (37?km) route from central London to Elizabeth's final resting place beside her husband and younger daughter in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[143] At her request, after her funeral the wreath that had lain atop her coffin was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, in a gesture that echoed her wedding-day tribute 79 years before.[144]\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabethknown for her personal and public charm[19]was one of the most popular members of the royal family,[145] and helped to stabilise the popularity of the monarchy as a whole.[146][147]\\r\\n\\r\\nCritics included Kitty Kelley, who falsely alleged that during the Second World War Elizabeth did not abide by the rationing regulations.[148][149] This, however, was contradicted by the official records,[150][151] and Eleanor Roosevelt during her wartime stay at Buckingham Palace reported expressly on the rationed food served in the Palace and the limited bathwater that was permitted.[152][153] Claims that Elizabeth used racist slurs to refer to black people[148] were strongly denied by Major Colin Burgess,[154] the husband of Elizabeth Burgess, a mixed-race secretary who accused members of the Prince of Wales's Household of racial abuse.[155] Queen Elizabeth made no public comments on race, but according to Robert Rhodes James in private she \\"abhorred racial discrimination\\" and decried apartheid as \\"dreadful\\".[156] Woodrow Wyatt records in his diary that when he expressed the view that non-white countries have nothing in common with \\"us\\", she told him, \\"I am very keen on the Commonwealth. They're all like us.\\"[157] However, she did distrust Germans; she told Woodrow Wyatt, \\"Never trust them, never trust them.\\"[158] While she may have held such views, it has been argued that they were normal for British people of her generation and upbringing, who had experienced two vicious wars with Germany.[159]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his official biography, William Shawcross portrays Elizabeth as a person whose indomitable optimism, zest for life, good manners, mischievous sense of humour, and interest in people and subjects of all kinds contributed to her exceptional popularity and to her longevity. Sir Hugh Casson said Elizabeth was like \\"a wave breaking on a rock, because although she is sweet and pretty and charming, she also has a basic streak of toughness and tenacity.?... when a wave breaks on a rock, it showers and sparkles with a brilliant play of foam and droplets in the sun, yet beneath is really hard, tough rock, fused, in her case, from strong principles, physical courage and a sense of duty.\\"[160] Sir Peter Ustinov described her during a student demonstration at the University of Dundee in 1968:\\r\\nAs we arrived in a solemn procession the students pelted us with toilet rolls. They kept hold of one end, like streamers at a ball, and threw the other end. The Queen Mother stopped and picked these up as though somebody had misplaced them. [Returning them to the students she said,] 'Was this yours? Oh, could you take it?' And it was her sang-froid and her absolute refusal to be shocked by this, which immediately silenced all the students. She knows instinctively what to do on those occasions. She doesn't rise to being heckled at all; she just pretends it must be an oversight on the part of the people doing it. The way she reacted not only showed her presence of mind, but was so charming and so disarming, even to the most rabid element, that she brought peace to troubled waters.[161]\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was well known for her dry witticisms. On hearing that Edwina Mountbatten was buried at sea, she said: \\"Dear Edwina, she always liked to make a splash.\\"[107] Accompanied by the gay writer Sir No?l Coward at a gala, she mounted a staircase lined with Guards. Noticing Coward's eyes flicker momentarily across the soldiers, she murmured to him: \\"I wouldn't if I were you, No?l; they count them before they put them out.\\"[162]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being advised by a Conservative Minister in the 1970s not to employ homosexuals, the Queen Mother observed that without them, \\"we'd have to go self-service\\".[162] On the fate of a gift of a nebuchadnezzar of champagne (20 bottles' worth) even if her family did not come for the holidays, she said, \\"I'll polish it off myself.\\"[163] Emine Saner of The Guardian suggests that with a gin and Dubonnet at noon, red wine with lunch, a port and martini at 6?pm and two glasses of champagne at dinner, \\"a conservative estimate puts the number of alcohol units she drank at 70 a week\\".[164] Her lifestyle amused journalists, particularly when it was revealed she had a multi-million pound overdraft with Coutts Bank.[165]\\r\\n\\r\\nHer habits were parodied by the satirical 1980s television programme Spitting Image.[166] This was the first satirical depiction on television; the makers initially demurred from featuring her, fearing that it would be considered off-limits by most of the viewing public.[167] In the end, she was portrayed as a perpetually tipsy Beryl Reid soundalike.[168] She was portrayed by Juliet Aubrey in Bertie and Elizabeth, Sylvia Syms in The Queen, Natalie Dormer in W.E., Olivia Colman in Hyde Park on Hudson, Victoria Hamilton in The Crown, and in The King's Speech by Helena Bonham Carter, who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal.[169][170]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cunard White Star Line's RMS Queen Elizabeth was named after her. She launched the ship on 27 September 1938 in Clydebank, Scotland. Supposedly, the liner started to slide into the water before Elizabeth could officially launch her, and acting sharply, she managed to smash a bottle of Australian red over the liner's bow just before it slid out of reach.[171] In 1954, Queen Elizabeth sailed to New York on her namesake.[172]\\r\\n\\r\\nA statue of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother by sculptor Philip Jackson was unveiled in front of the George VI Memorial, off The Mall, London, on 24 February 2009, creating the George VI and Queen Elizabeth Memorial.[173]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2011, her eclectic musical taste was revealed when details of her small record collection kept at the Castle of Mey were made public. Her records included ska, local folk, Scottish reels and the musicals Oklahoma! and The King and I, and artists such as yodeller Montana Slim, Tony Hancock, The Goons and No?l Coward.[174]\\r\\n\\r\\nEight years before her death, she had reportedly placed two-thirds of her money (an estimated S19 million)[175] into trusts, for the benefit of her great-grandchildren.[176] In her lifetime, she received S643,000 a year from the Civil List, and spent an estimated S1√ø2 million annually to run her household.[177] By the end of the 1990s, her overdraft was said to be around S4 million.[175][177] She left the bulk of her estate, estimated to be worth between S50 and S70?million, including paintings, Faberg eggs, jewellery, and horses, to her surviving daughter, Queen Elizabeth II.[176][178] Under an agreement reached in 1993,[179] property passing from monarch to monarch is exempt from inheritance tax, as is property passing from the consort of a former monarch to the current monarch, so a tax liability estimated at S28?million (40 percent of the value of the estate) was not incurred.[180] The most important pieces of art were transferred to the Royal Collection by Elizabeth II.[176] Following her death, the Queen successfully applied to the High Court so that details of her mother's will would be kept secret.[181] This brought criticism from the Labour Party politicians and segments of the public, and the Queen eventually released the outlines of her mother's will.[178]\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen Elizabeth's coat of arms was the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom (in either the English or the Scottish version) impaled with the arms of her father, the Earl of Strathmore; the latter being: 1st and 4th quarters, Argent, a lion rampant Azure, armed and langued Gules, within a double tressure flory-counter-flory of the second (Lyon); 2nd and 3rd quarters, Ermine, three bows stringed paleways proper (Bowes).[182] The shield is surmounted by the imperial crown, and supported by the crowned lion of England and a lion rampant per fess Or and Gules.[183]","input":"How old was the quuen mother when she died?"},{"output":"Bhisham Sahni","context":"Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho!

Earth and the Moon orbit about their barycentre (common center of mass), which lies about 4,600?km (2,900?mi) from Earth's center (about 3/4 of the radius of Earth). On average, the distance to the Moon is about 385,000?km (239,000?mi) from Earth's centre, which corresponds to about 60 Earth radii. With a mean orbital velocity of 1.022?km/s (2,290?mph),[8] the Moon appears to move relative to the stars each hour by an amount roughly equal to its angular diameter, or by about half a degree. The Moon differs from most satellites of other planets in that its orbit is close to the plane of the ecliptic, and not to Earth's equatorial plane. The plane of the lunar orbit is inclined to the ecliptic by about 5, whereas the Moon's equatorial plane is inclined by only 1.5 to the ecliptic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe properties of the orbit described in this section are approximations. The Moon's orbit around Earth has many irregularities (perturbations), whose study (lunar theory) has a long history.[9]\\r\\nThe orbit of the Moon is distinctly elliptical, with an average eccentricity of 0.0549. The non-circular form of the lunar orbit causes variations in the Moon's angular speed and apparent size as it moves towards and away from an observer on Earth. The mean angular movement relative to an imaginary observer at the barycentre is 7001131760000000000?13.176 per day to the east (Julian day 2000).\\r\\nThe Moon's elongation is its angular distance east of the Sun at any time. At new moon, it is zero and the Moon is said to be in conjunction. At full moon, the elongation is 180 and it is said to be in opposition. In both cases, the Moon is in syzygy, that is, the Sun, Moon and Earth are nearly aligned. When elongation is either 90 or 270, the Moon is said to be in quadrature.\\r\\nThe orientation of the orbit is not fixed in space, but rotates over time. This orbital precession is also called apsidal precession and is the rotation of the Moon's orbit within the orbital plane, i.e. the axes of the ellipse change direction. The Moon's major axis √ø the longest diameter of the orbit, joining its nearest and farthest points, the perigee and apogee, respectively √ø makes one complete revolution every 8.85 Earth years, or 3,232.6054 days, as it rotates slowly in the same direction as the Moon itself (direct motion). The Moon's apsidal precession is distinct from, and should not be confused with its axial precession.\\r\\nThe mean inclination of the lunar orbit to the ecliptic plane is 5.145. The rotational axis of the Moon is also not perpendicular to its orbital plane, so the lunar equator is not in the plane of its orbit, but is inclined to it by a constant value of 6.688 (this is the obliquity). This does not mean that, as a result of the precession of the Moon's orbital plane, the angle between the lunar equator and the ecliptic would vary between the sum (11.833) and difference (1.543) of these two angles, but, as was discovered by Jacques Cassini in 1722, the rotational axis of the Moon precesses with the same rate as its orbital plane, but is 180 out of phase (see Cassini's Laws). Therefore, the angle between the ecliptic and the lunar equator is always 1.543, even though the rotational axis of the Moon is not fixed with respect to the stars.[10]\\r\\nBecause of the inclination of the moon's orbit, the moon is above the horizon at the North and South Pole for almost two weeks every month, even though the sun is below the horizon for six months at a time. The period from moonrise to moonrise at the poles is quite close to the sidereal period, or 27.3 days. When the sun is the furthest below the horizon (winter solstice), the moon will be full when it is at its highest point.\\r\\nThe nodes are points at which the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic. The Moon crosses the same node every 27.2122 days, an interval called the draconic or draconitic month. The line of nodes, the intersection between the two respective planes, has a retrograde motion: for an observer on Earth it rotates westward along the ecliptic with a period of 18.60 years, or 19.3549 per year. When viewed from celestial north, the nodes move clockwise around Earth, opposite to Earth's own spin and its revolution around the Sun. Lunar and solar eclipses can occur when the nodes align with the Sun, roughly every 173.3 days. Lunar orbit inclination also determines eclipses; shadows cross when nodes coincide with full and new moon, when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align in three dimensions.\\r\\nIn effect, this means that the \\"tropical year\\" on the moon is only 347 days long. This is called the draconic year or eclipse year. The \\"seasons\\" on the moon fit into this period. For about half of this draconic year, the sun is north of the lunar equator (but at most 1.543), and for the other half it is south of the lunar equator. Obviously the effect of these seasons is very minor compared to the difference between lunar night and lunar day. At the poles, there are not days and nights of about 15 Earth days, but rather the sun will be \\"up\\" for 173 days at a time. \\"Up\\" here means that the centre of the sun is above the horizon. The sunrise and sunset at the poles each take about 18 days.[11] These polar sunrises and sunsets occur around the time of eclipses (solar or lunar). For example, at the Solar eclipse of March 9, 2016, the moon was near its descending node, and the sun was near the point in the sky where the equator of the moon crosses the ecliptic. When the sun reached that point, the centre of the sun set at the north pole and rose at the south pole.\\r\\nEvery 18.6 years, the angle between the moon's orbit and the Earth's equator reaches a maximum of 2836 (the sum of the Earth's inclination 2327 and the Moon's inclination 509). This is called major lunar standstill. Around this time, the moon's latitude will vary from ?2836 to +2836. 9.3 years later, the angle between the moon's orbit and the Earth's equator reaches its minimum, 1820. This is called a minor lunar standstill.\\r\\nWhen the inclination of the moon's orbit to the Earth's equator is at its minimum of 1820, the centre of the moon's disk will be above the horizon every day as far north and as far south as 90?1820' or 7140' latitude, whereas when the inclination is at its maximum of 2836' the centre of the moon's disk will only be above the horizon every day for latitudes less than 90?2836' or 6124'. At higher latitudes there will be a period of at least a day each month when the moon does not rise, but there will also be a period of at least a day each month during which the moon does not set. This is similar to the behaviour of the sun, but with a period of 27.3 days instead of 365 days. Note that a point on the moon can actually be visible when it is below the horizon by about 34 arc minutes, due to refraction (see Sunrise).\\r\\nScale model of the Earth√øMoon system: Sizes and distances are to scale.\\r\\nAbout 1000 BC, the Babylonians were the first human civilization known to have kept a consistent record of lunar observations. Clay tablets from that period, which have been found over the territory of present-day Iraq, are inscribed with cuneiform writing recording the times and dates of moonrises and moonsets, the stars that the Moon passed close by, and the time differences between rising and setting of both the Sun and the Moon around the time of the full moon. Babylonian astronomy discovered the three main periods of the Moon's motion and used data analysis to build lunar calendars that extended well into the future.[9] This use of detailed, systematic observations to make predictions based on experimental data may be classified as the first scientific study in human history. However, the Babylonians seem to have lacked any geometrical or physical interpretation of their data, and they could not predict future lunar eclipses (although \\"warnings\\" were issued before likely eclipse times).\\r\\nAncient Greek astronomers were the first to introduce and analyze mathematical models of the motion of objects in the sky. Ptolemy described lunar motion by using a well-defined geometric model of epicycles and evection.[9]\\r\\nIsaac Newton was the first to develop a complete theory of motion, mechanics. The sheer wealth of humanity's observations of the lunar motion was the main testbed of his theory.[9]\\r\\nThere are several different periods associated with the lunar orbit.[12] The sidereal month is the time it takes to make one complete orbit around Earth with respect to the fixed stars. It is about 27.32 days. The synodic month is the time it takes the Moon to reach the same visual phase. This varies notably throughout the year,[13] but averages around 29.53 days. The synodic period is longer than the sidereal period because the Earth√øMoon system moves in its orbit around the Sun during each sidereal month, hence a longer period is required to achieve a similar alignment of Earth, the Sun, and the Moon. The anomalistic month is the time between perigees and is about 27.55 days. The Earth√øMoon separation determines the strength of the lunar tide raising force.\\r\\nThe draconic month is the time from ascending node to ascending node. The time between two successive passes of the same ecliptic longitude is called the tropical month. The latter three periods are slightly different from the sidereal month.\\r\\nThe average length of a calendar month (a twelfth of a year) is about 30.4 days. This is not a lunar period, though the calendar month is historically related to the visible lunar phase.\\r\\nThe gravitational attraction that the Moon exerts on Earth is the cause of tides in the sea; the Sun has a lesser tidal influence. If Earth had a global ocean of uniform depth, the Moon would act to deform both the solid Earth (by a small amount) and the ocean in the shape of an ellipsoid with the high points roughly beneath the Moon and on the opposite side of Earth. However, because of the presence of the continents, Earth's much faster rotation and varying ocean depths, this simplistic visualisation does not happen. Although the tidal flow period is generally synchronized to the Moon's orbit around Earth, its relative timing varies greatly. In some places on Earth, there is only one high tide per day, whereas others have four, though this is somewhat rare.\\r\\nThe notional tidal bulges are carried ahead of the Earth√øMoon axis by the continents as a result of Earth's rotation. The eccentric mass of each bulge exerts a small amount of gravitational attraction on the Moon, with the bulge on the side of Earth closest to the Moon pulling in a direction slightly forward along the Moon's orbit (because Earth's rotation has carried the bulge forward). The bulge on the side furthest from the Moon has the opposite effect, but because the gravitational attraction varies inversely with the square of distance, the effect is stronger for the near-side bulge. As a result, some of Earth's angular (or rotational) momentum is gradually being transferred to the rotation of the Earth√øMoon pair around their mutual centre of mass, called the barycentre. This slightly faster rotation causes the Earth√øMoon distance to increase at approximately 38 millimetres per year. Conservation of angular momentum means that Earth's axial rotation is gradually slowing, and because of this its day lengthens by approximately 23 microseconds every year (excluding glacial rebound). Both figures are valid only for the current configuration of the continents. Tidal rhythmites from 620 million years ago show that, over hundreds of millions of years, the Moon receded at an average rate of 22?mm (0.87?in) per year and the day lengthened at an average rate of 12 microseconds per year, both about half of their current values. See tidal acceleration for a more detailed description and references.\\r\\nThe Moon is gradually receding from Earth into a higher orbit, and calculations suggest that this would continue for about 50 billion years.[14][15] By that time, Earth and the Moon would be in a mutual spin√øorbit resonance or tidal locking, in which the Moon will orbit Earth in about 47 days (currently 27 days), and both the Moon and Earth would rotate around their axes in the same time, always facing each other with the same side. This has already happened to the Moonthe same side always faces Earthand is also slowly happening to the Earth. However, the slowdown of Earth's rotation is not occurring fast enough for the rotation to lengthen to a month before other effects change the situation: approximately 2.3 billion years from now, the increase of the Sun's radiation will have caused Earth's oceans to evaporate,[16] removing the bulk of the tidal friction and acceleration.\\r\\nThe Moon is in synchronous rotation, meaning that it keeps the same face toward Earth at all times. This synchronous rotation is only true on average, because the Moon's orbit has a definite eccentricity. As a result, the angular velocity of the Moon varies as it orbits Earth and hence is not always equal to the Moon's rotational velocity. When the Moon is at its perigee, its rotation is slower than its orbital motion, and this allows us to see up to eight degrees of longitude of its eastern (right) far side. Conversely, when the Moon reaches its apogee, its rotation is faster than its orbital motion and this reveals eight degrees of longitude of its western (left) far side. This is referred to as longitudinal libration.\\r\\nBecause the lunar orbit is also inclined to Earth's ecliptic plane by 5.1, the rotational axis of the Moon seems to rotate towards and away from Earth during one complete orbit. This is referred to as latitudinal libration, which allows one to see almost 7 of latitude beyond the pole on the far side. Finally, because the Moon is only about 60 Earth radii away from Earth's centre of mass, an observer at the equator who observes the Moon throughout the night moves laterally by one Earth diameter. This gives rise to a diurnal libration, which allows one to view an additional one degree's worth of lunar longitude. For the same reason, observers at both of Earth's geographical poles would be able to see one additional degree's worth of libration in latitude.\\r\\nWhen viewed from the north celestial pole, i.e. from the approximate direction of the star Polaris, the Moon orbits Earth anticlockwise and Earth orbits the Sun anticlockwise, and the Moon and Earth rotate on their own axes anticlockwise.\\r\\nThe right-hand rule can be used to indicate the direction of the angular velocity. If the thumb of the right hand points to the north celestial pole, its fingers curl in the direction that the Moon orbits Earth, Earth orbits the Sun, and the Moon and Earth rotate on their own axes.\\r\\nIn representations of the Solar System, it is common to draw the trajectory of Earth from the point of view of the Sun, and the trajectory of the Moon from the point of view of Earth. This could give the impression that the Moon orbits Earth in such a way that sometimes it goes backwards when viewed from the Sun's perspective. Because the orbital velocity of the Moon around Earth (1?km/s) is small compared to the orbital velocity of Earth about the Sun (30?km/s), this never happens. There are no rearward loops in the Moon's solar orbit.\\r\\nConsidering the Earth√øMoon system as a binary planet, its centre of gravity is within Earth, about 4,624?km (2,873?mi) or 72.6% of the Earth's radius from the centre of the Earth. This centre of gravity remains on the line between the centres of the Earth and Moon as the Earth completes its diurnal rotation. The path of the Earth√øMoon system in its solar orbit is defined as the movement of this mutual centre of gravity around the sun. Consequently, Earth's centre veers inside and outside the solar orbital path during each synodic month as the Moon moves in its orbit around the common centre of gravity.[18]\\r\\nThe Sun's gravitational effect on the Moon is more than twice that of Earth's on the Moon; consequently, the Moon's trajectory is always convex[18][19] (as seen when looking Sunward at the entire Sun√øEarth√øMoon system from a great distance outside Earth√øMoon solar orbit), and is nowhere concave (from the same perspective) or looped.[17][18][20] That is, the region enclosed by the Moon's orbit of the Sun is a convex set.","input":"How many days does it take for the moon to rotate around the earth?"},{"output":"4,049","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Forks, population 4,049, is a city in the Boundary Country of the West Kootenay region of British Columbia, Canada. It is located at the confluence of the Granby River and Kettle River, a tributary of the Columbia. The city is just north of the US-Canada border, approximately 500?km from Vancouver, British Columbia and 200?km from Kelowna, British Columbia and 23?km west of the resort area of Christina Lake by road.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Forks was established in the late 19th century when copper mining dominated Boundary and Kootenay regions of BC. The city was laid out in 1895 and Grand Forks was officially established as a city on 15 April 1897. The adjacent City of Columbia was incorporated on May 4, 1899.[2] By 1900, Grand Forks boasted three railways, lumber mills, a smelter, mines, a post office, a school and a hospital. Grand Forks and Columbia amalgamated in 1903.[3][4] In 1907, it was the home of a local branch of the Western Federation of Miners.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn both 1908 and 1911, fires leveled the downtown core, mainly due to the number of wood frame buildings and stores. Between the years of 1909 and 1913, a group of pacifist Russian immigrants known as Doukhobors settled in the area because of the fertile farm land. Today, many residents of Grand Forks are descendants of the Doukhobors. In 1991, the CP Railway Co. abandoned the railway through Grand Forks and the former right of way became part of the Trans-Canada Trail. Over the years, Grand Forks has continued to expand in size and now has around 4,000 residents, with another 10,000 in the area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe City of Grand Forks is represented by a seven-person elected council, with Frank Konrad currently serving as mayor.\\r\\nThe incumbent councillors are:\\r\\nJulia Butler,\\r\\nChris Hammett,\\r\\nNeil Krog,\\r\\nColleen Ross,\\r\\nChristine Thompson,\\r\\nand Beverly Tripp.\\r\\nGrand Forks currently has six councillors until an upcoming by-election. \\r\\nProvincially, Grand Forks is located in the constituency of Boundary-Similkameen, where it is represented by MLA Linda Larson and federally it is located in the South OkanaganWest Kootenay riding and represented by MP Richard Cannings\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Forks experiences a humid continental climate (K?ppen climate classification Dfb) with relatively mild, moderately cold winters and hot summers. Grand Forks has a very similar climate to the Okanagan Valley just to the West, but usually receives slightly colder and snowier winters and slightly hotter Summer temperatures due to being away from any lakes. Daytime highs during the Summer often top 30?C and surpass 40?C at least once every ten years. During the winter, the blocking barriers of the Rockies and the Columbia Mountains tend to moderate the climate, but cold Arctic air can penetrate into the city for fairly short periods. Typically Grand Forks has a moderate snow cover from early December to late February, but it can disappear for periods of time, especially during milder winters. Precipitation is higher than many other drier Southern Interior locations, but still fairly low.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary vegetation in the Grand Forks area indicates a semi arid climate with Sagebrush, Prickly Pear Cactus, Ponderosa Pine and Douglas-fir. More mountainous tree species such as Lodgepole Pine, Western Larch and Englemann Spruce can be found in shady areas and places near the Kettle River.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchools in the region are operated by School District 51 Boundary which has its main office in Grand Forks but also serves Midway, Greenwood, Beaverdell, and Rock Creek.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two elementary (Dr. D. A. Perley Elementary School, and John A. Hutton Elementary School) and one secondary school (Grand Forks Secondary School). The District also operates an alternate learning centre in Grand Forks (Walker Development Centre).\\r\\n\\r\\nSelkirk College, based in Castlegar, British Columbia, has a small community campus in Grand Forks. Established in 1966, Selkirk College is BC's oldest community college and offers over 60 accredited programs. Students studying in Grand Forks have access to a variety of courses at both the High School and College level.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor industries in Grand Forks are limited and have become less over the past decade with the loss of major industries such as pope&talbot however the industries in Grand Forks are logging, agriculture, rock wool manufacturing, fabrication (metal) and tourism. The town is close to the site of the former Phoenix copper mine, which closed in 1935. The slag piles on the Granby River just outside town are remnants of a large copper smelting operation. The sawmill in Grand Forks is very small and is operated by Interfor (formerly Pope and Talbot) and ships forest products into the United States via rail. Tourism has died off in Grand Forks due to lack of tourist options, however, it does have a pleasant climate and close proximity to the Okanagan. Christina Lake, which is 20 minutes east of Grand Forks, is home to many resorts and summer homes and its year round population of 1000 swells to 6000 during the Summer. The slag from the piles at the north end of town is owned by Pacific Abrasives, who sells it to the US Navy and ships it by rail to San Diego, California to use for sandblasting ships.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe short-line Grand Forks Railway is based out of Grand Forks. The company owns just 3.5 miles of track, which connects Roxul and Interfor with the Grand Forks Junction at the south end of town. It is the shortest railway in Canada and possibly North America.

The term \\"Swiss Army knife\\" was coined by American soldiers after World War II due to the difficulty they had in pronouncing \\"Offiziersmesser\\", the German name.[2]\\r\\nThe Swiss Army knife generally has a main spearpoint blade, as well as various tools, such as screwdrivers, a can opener, and many others. These attachments are stowed inside the handle of the knife through a pivot point mechanism. The handle is usually in its stereotypical red color, and features a Victorinox or Wenger \\"cross\\" logo or, for Swiss military issue knives, the coat of arms of Switzerland.\\r\\nOriginating in Ibach, Switzerland, the Swiss Army knife was first produced in 1891 after the company, Karl Elsener, which later became Victorinox, won the contract to produce the Swiss Army's Modell 1890 knife from the previous German manufacturer. In 1893, the Swiss cutlery company Paul Bochat & Cie, which later became Wenger, received its first contract from the Swiss military to produce model 1890 knives; the two companies split the contract for provision of the knives from 1908 until Victorinox acquired Wenger in 2005. A cultural icon of Switzerland, the design of the knife and its versatility have both led to worldwide recognition.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the late 1880s, the Swiss Army decided to purchase a new folding pocket knife for their soldiers. This knife was to be suitable for use by the army in opening canned food and disassembling the Swiss service rifle, the Schmidt√øRubin, which required a screwdriver for assembly.\\r\\nThe Swiss Army Knife was not the first multi use pocket knife. In 1851 in \\"Moby Dick\\" (chapter 107), Melville references the \\"Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior - though a little swelled - of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers.\\"\\r\\nIn January 1891, the knife received the official designation Modell 1890. The knife had a blade, reamer, can-opener, screwdriver, and grips made out of dark oak wood that some say was later partly replaced with ebony wood. At that time no Swiss company had the necessary production capacity, so the initial order for 15,000 knives was placed with the German knife manufacturer Wester & Co. from Solingen, Germany. These knives were delivered in October 1891.\\r\\nIn 1891, Karl Elsener, then owner of a company that made surgical equipment, set out to manufacture the knives in Switzerland itself. At the end of 1891 Elsener began production of the Modell 1890 knives. Elsener then wanted to make a pocketknife more suitable to an Officer. In 1896, Elsener succeeded in attaching tools on both sides of the handle using a special spring mechanism: this allowed him to use the same spring to hold them in place, an innovation at the time.[4] This allowed Elsener to put twice as many features on the knife. On 12 June 1897, this knife featuring a second smaller cutting blade, corkscrew, and wood fiber grips was originally registered with the patent office as The Officer's and Sports Knife, though it was never part of a military contract.[5]\\r\\nKarl Elsener used the cross and shield to identify his knives, the symbol still used today on Victorinox-branded versions. When his mother died in 1909, Elsener decided to name his company \\"Victoria\\" in her memory. In 1921 the company started using stainless steel to make the Swiss Army Knife. Stainless steel is also known as \\"inox\\", short for the French term \\"acier inoxydable\\".[6] \\"Victoria\\" and \\"inox\\" were then combined to create the company name \\"Victorinox\\".[7] Victorinox's headquarters and show room are located in the Swiss town of Ibach.\\r\\nElsener, through his company Victorinox, managed to control the market until 1893, when the second industrial cutler of Switzerland, Paul Bochat & Cie, headquartered in Delmont in the French-speaking region of Jura, started selling a similar product. This company was later acquired by its then General Manager, Thodore Wenger, and renamed the Wenger Company. In 1908 the Swiss government, wanting to prevent an issue over regional favouritism, but perhaps wanting a bit of competition in hopes of lowering prices, split the contract with Victorinox and Wenger, each getting half of the orders placed. By mutual agreement, Wenger has advertised as the Genuine Swiss Army Knife and Victorinox used the slogan, the Original Swiss Army Knife.\\r\\nOn April 26, 2005, Victorinox acquired Wenger, once again becoming the sole supplier of knives to the Military of Switzerland. Victorinox had kept both consumer brands intact, but on January 30, 2013, Wenger and Victorinox announced that the separate knife brands were going to be merged into one brand: Victorinox. Wenger's watch and licensing business will continue as a separate brand.[8]\\r\\nUp to 2008 Victorinox AG and Wenger SA supplied about 50,000 knives to the military of Switzerland each year, and manufactured many more for export, mostly to the United States. Many commercial Victorinox and Wenger Swiss Army knives can be immediately distinguished by the cross logos depicted on their grips; the Victorinox cross logo is surrounded by a shield while the Wenger cross logo is surrounded by a slightly rounded square.\\r\\nOn January 30, 2013, Wenger and Victorinox announced that the separate knife brands were going to be merged into one brand: Victorinox. The press release stated that Wenger's factory in Delemont would continue to produce knives and all employees at this site will retain their jobs. They further elaborated that an assortment of items from the Wenger line-up will remain in production under the Victorinox brand name. Wenger's US headquarters will be merged with Victorinox's location in Monroe, Connecticut. Wenger's watch and licensing business will continue as a separate brand: Swiss Gear.[8]\\r\\nMany other companies manufacture similar-looking folding knives in a wide range of quality and prices. The cross-and-shield emblem and the words SWISS ARMY are registered trademarks of Victorinox AG and its related companies.[9]\\r\\nIn 2007, the Swiss Government made a request for new updated soldier knives for the Swiss military for distribution in late 2008. The evaluation phase of the new soldier knife began in February 2008, when Armasuisse issued an invitation to tender. A total of seven suppliers from Switzerland and other countries were invited to participate in the evaluation process. Functional models submitted by suppliers underwent practical testing by military personnel in July 2008, while laboratory tests were used to assess compliance with technical requirements. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted and the model with the best price/performance ratio was awarded the contract. The order for 75,000 soldier knives plus cases was worth 1.38 million SFr.. This equates to a purchase price of 18.40 SFr., ?12.12, GBS17.99 in October 2009 per knife plus case.\\r\\nVictorinox won the contest with a knife based on the One-Hand Germany Army Knife as issued by the German Bundeswehr and released in the civilian model lineup with the addition of a toothpick and tweezers stored in the nylon grip scales (side cover plates) as the One-Hand Trekker/Trailmaster model. Mass production of the new Soldatenmesser 08 (Soldier Knife 08) for the Swiss Armed Forces was started in December 2008.[10]\\r\\nThere are various models of the Swiss Army Knife with different tool combinations. Though Victorinox doesn't provide custom knives, they have produced many variations to suit individual users.[11]\\r\\nMain tools:\\r\\nSmaller tools:\\r\\nScale tools:\\r\\nThree Victorinox SAK models featured a butane lighter: the Swissflame, Campflame, and Swisschamp XXLT, first introduced in 2002 and then discontinued in 2005. The models were never sold in the United States due to lack of safety features. They used a standard piezoelectric ignition system for easy and quick ignition with adjustable flame, and were designed for operation at altitudes up to 1,500 metres (4,900?ft) above sea level and continuous operation of 10 minutes.[12]\\r\\nIn January 2010, Victorinox announced the Presentation Master models, released in April 2010. The technological tools included a laser pointer, and detachable flash drive with fingerprint reader. Victorinox now sells an updated version called the Slim Jetsetter, with \\"a premium software package that provides ultra secure data encryption, automatic backup functionality, secure web surfing capabilities, file and email synchronization between the drive and multiple computers, Bluetooth pairing and much more. On the hardware side of things, biometric fingerprint technology, laser pointers, LED lights, Bluetooth remote control and of course, the original Swiss Army Knife implements √ø blade, scissors, nail file, screwdriver, key ring and ballpoint pen are standard. **Not every feature is available on every model within the collection.\\"[13]\\r\\nIn 2006, Wenger produced a knife called \\"The Giant\\" that included every implement the company ever made, with 87 tools and 141 different functions. It was recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's most multifunctional penknife.[14] It retails for about ?798 or $US1000, though some vendors charge much higher prices.\\r\\nIn the same year, Victorinox released the SwissChamp XAVT, consisting of 118 parts and 80 functions with a retail price of $425.[15] The Guinness Book of Records recognizes a unique 314-blade Swiss Army-style knife made in 1991 by Master Cutler Hans Meister as the world's largest penknife, weighing 11 pounds.[3]\\r\\nSome Swiss Army knives feature locking blades to prevent accidental closure. Wenger was the first to offer a PackLock for the main blade on several of their standard 85mm models. Several large Wenger and Victorinox models feature a locking blade secured by a slide lock that is operated with an unlocking-button integrated in the scales. Some Victorinox 111 mm series knives feature a double liner lock that secures the cutting blade and large slotted screwdriver/cap opener/wire stripper combination tool designed towards prying.[16]\\r\\nRivets and flanged bushings made from brass hold all machined steel parts and other tools, separators and the scales together. The rivets are made by cutting and pointing appropriately sized bars of solid brass.\\r\\nThe separators between the tools have been made from aluminium alloy since 1951. This makes the knives lighter. Previously these separating layers were made of nickel-silver.[17]\\r\\nThe martensitic stainless steel alloy used for the cutting blades is optimized for high toughness and corrosion resistance and has a composition of 15% chromium, 0.60% silicon, 0.52% carbon, 0.50% molybdenum, and 0.45% manganese and is designated X55CrMo14 or DIN 1.4110 according to Victorinox.[18] After a hardening process at 1040 C and annealing at 160?C the blades achieve an average hardness of 56 HRC. This steel hardness is suitable for practical use and easy resharpening, but less than achieved in stainless steel alloys used for blades optimized for high wear resistance. According to Victorinox the martensitic stainless steel alloy used for the other parts is X39Cr13 (aka DIN 1.4031, AISI/ASTM 420) and for the springs X20Cr13 (aka DIN 1.4021, but still within AISI/ASTM 420).[19][20]\\r\\nThe steel used for the wood saws, scissors and nail files has a steel hardness of HRC 53, the screwdrivers, tin openers and awls have a hardness of HRC 52, and the corkscrew and springs have a hardness of HRC 49.[19][citation needed]\\r\\nThe metal saws and files, in addition to the special case hardening, are also subjected to a hard chromium plating process so that iron and steel can also be filed and cut.[17][21]\\r\\nAlthough red Cellulose Acetate Butyrate (CAB) (generally known trade names are Cellidor, Tenite and Tenex) scaled Swiss Army Knives are most common, there are many colors and alternative materials like nylon and aluminum for the scales available.[22][23] Many textures, colors and shapes now appear in the Swiss Army Knife. Since 2006 the scales on some knife models can have textured rubber non-slip inlays incorporated, intended for sufficient grip with moist or wet hands. A modding community has also developed from professionally-produced custom models combining novel materials, colors, finishes [24] and occasionally new tools such firesteels [25] or tool 'blades' mounting replaceable surgical scalpel blades [26] to replacement of standard scales (handles) with new versions in natural materials such as buffalo horn.[27] In addition to 'limited edition' productions runs, numerous examples from basic to professional-level customizations of standard knives - such as retrofitting pocket clips, one-off scales created using 3D printing techniques, decoration using anodization and new scale materials - can be found by searching for 'SAK mods'.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring assembly, all components are placed on several brass rivets. The first components are generally an aluminum separator and a flat steel spring. Once a layer of tools is installed, another separator and spring are placed for the next layer of tools. This process is repeated until all the desired tool layers and the finishing separator are installed. Once the knife is built, the metal parts are fastened by adding brass flanged bushings to the rivets. The excess length of the rivets is then cut off to make them flush with the bushings. Finally the remaining length of the rivets is flattened into the flanged bushings.\\r\\nAfter the assembly of the metal parts, the blades are sharpened to a 15 angle, resulting in a 30 V-shaped steel cutting edge. The blades are then checked with a laser reflecting goniometer to verify the angle of the cutting edges.\\r\\nFinally scales are applied. Slightly undersized holes incorporated into the inner surface enclose the bushings, which have truncated cone cross-section and are slightly undercut, forming a one-way interference fit when pressed into the generally softer and more elastic scale material. The result is a tight adhesive-free connection that nonetheless permits new identical-pattern scales to be quickly and easily applied.

The thickness of the knives varies depending on the number of tool layers included. The 91?mm (3.6?in) models offer the most variety in tool configurations in the Victorinox model line with as many as 15 layers.[29]\\r\\nWenger models are available in 65?mm (2.6?in), 75?mm (3.0?in), 85?mm (3.3?in) 93?mm (3.7?in), 100?mm (3.9?in), 120?mm (4.7?in) and 130?mm (5.1?in) lengths when closed. Thickness varies depending on the number of tool layers included. The 85?mm (3.3?in) models offer the most variety in tool configurations in the Wenger model line, with as many as 10 layers.[30]\\r\\nSince the first issue as personal equipment in 1891 the Soldatenmesser (Soldier Knives) issued by the Swiss Armed Forces have been revised several times. There are five different main Modelle (models). Their model numbers refer to the year of introduction in the military supply chain. Several main models have been revised over time and therefore exist in different Ausfhrungen (executions), also denoted by the year of introduction. The issued models of the Swiss Armed Forces are:[31]\\r\\nSoldier Knives are issued to every recruit or member of the Swiss Armed Forces and the knives issued to officers have never differed from those issued to non-commissioned officers or privates.[32] A model incorporating a corkscrew and scissors was produced as an officer's tool, but was deemed not \\"essential for survival\\", leaving officers to purchase it individually.[3]\\r\\nThe Soldier Knife model 1890 had a spear point blade, reamer, can-opener, screwdriver and grips made out of oak wood scales (handles) that were treated with rapeseed oil for greater toughness and water-repellency, which made them black in color. The wooden grips of the Modell 1890 tended to crack and chip so in 1901 these were changed to a hard reddish-brown fiber similar in appearance to wood. The knife was 100?mm (3.9?in) long, 20.5?mm (0.81?in) thick and weighed 144?g (5.1?oz).[33]\\r\\nThe Soldier Knife model 1908 had a clip-point blade rather than the 1890s spear point blade, still with the fiber scales, carbon steel tools, nickel-silver bolster, liners, and divider. The knife was 100?mm (3.9?in) long, 16.5?mm (0.65?in) thick and weighed 125?g (4.4?oz). The contract with the Swiss Army split production equally between the Victorinox and Wenger companies.[33]\\r\\nThe soldier Knife model 1951 had fiber scales, nickel-silver bolsters, liners, and divider, and a spear point blade. This was the first Swiss Armed Forces issue model where the tools were made of stainless steel. The screwdriver now had a scraper arc on one edge. The knife was 93?mm (3.7?in) long, 13.5?mm (0.53?in) thick and weighed 90?g (3.2?oz).\\r\\nThe Soldier Knife model 1961 has a 93?mm (3.7?in) long knurled alox handle with the Swiss crest, a drop point blade, a reamer, a blade combining bottle opener, screwdriver, and wire stripper, and a combined can-opener and small screwdriver. The knife was 12?mm (0.47?in) thick and weighed 72?g (2.5?oz)\\r\\nThis official Swiss military model also contains a brass spacer, which allows the knife, with the screwdriver and the reamer extended simultaneously, to be used to assemble the SIG 550 and SIG 510 assault rifles: the knife serves as a restraint to the firing pin during assembly of the lock. The Soldier Knife model 1961 was manufactured only by Victorinox and Wenger and was the first issued knife bearing the Swiss Coat of Arms on the handle.\\r\\nThe Soldier Knife 08 was first issued to the Swiss Armed Forces beginning with the first basic training sessions of 2009.[34]\\r\\nThe Soldier Knife 08 features an 111?mm (4.4?in) long ergonomic handle with polymer-textured non-slip inlays incorporated in the nylon grip shells and a double liner locking system, one-hand 86?mm (3.4?in) long locking partly serrated chisel ground drop point blade, wood saw, can opener with small 3?mm (0.12?in) slotted screwdriver, locking bottle opener with large 7?mm (0.28?in) slotted screwdriver and wire stripper/bender, reamer, Phillips (PH2) screwdriver and 12?mm (0.47?in) diameter split keyring. The Soldier Knife 08 width is 34.5?mm (1.36?in), thickness is 18?mm (0.71?in), overall length opened is 197?mm (7.8?in) and it weighs 131?g (4.6?oz). The Soldier Knife 08 is manufactured only by Victorinox.\\r\\nThe armed forces of more than 20 different nations have issued or approved the use of various versions of Swiss army knives made by Victorinox, among them the forces of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Malaysia and the United States (NSN 1095-01-653-1166 Knife, Combat).[35][36]\\r\\nWest German Army knife, 1985\\r\\nNew German Army knife, since 2003\\r\\nMalaysian Army knife\\r\\nThe Swiss Army knife has been present in space missions carried out by NASA since the late 1970s. In 1978, NASA sent a letter of confirmation to Victorinox regarding a purchase of 50 knives known as the Master Craftsman model. In 1985, Edward M. Payton, brother of astronaut Gary E. Payton, sent a letter to Victorinox, asking about getting a Master Craftsman knife after seeing the one his brother used in space. There are other stories as well of repairs conducted in space using a Swiss Army knife.[37]\\r\\nThe Swiss Army knife has been added to the collection of the New York Museum of Modern Art and Munich's State Museum of Applied Art for its design. The term \\"Swiss Army\\" currently is a registered trademark owned by Victorinox AG and its subsidiary, Wenger SA.[9]\\r\\nThe television show MacGyver features Angus MacGyver, who frequently uses different Swiss Army knives in various episodes to solve problems and construct simple objects.\\r\\nIn the TV show Psych Shawn Spencer and his dad always carry large Swiss Army knives to work their way through occasional problems.\\r\\nThe term \\"Swiss Army knife\\" has entered popular culture as a metaphor for usefulness and adaptability.[38] The multi-purpose nature of the tool has also inspired a number of other gadgets.[39]\\r\\nOf these books, regularly available at this time (as for example on the Amazon web site) are Jackson's Collector's Companion, Lubkemann's Whittling Book, and Young's Owner's Manual.

(pronounced?[?t ?tu? ?bru?t?]) is a Latin phrase meaning \\"even you, Brutus?\\", made famous by its occurrence in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, where it is uttered by the Roman dictator Julius Caesar to his friend Marcus Brutus at the moment of the former's assassination. The Latin expression first occurs in Elizabethan literary texts.[1] The quotation is widely used in the English-speaking world to signify the unexpected betrayal by a person, such as a friend.\\r\\nCaesar utters these words in Act III, scene 2, as he is being stabbed to death, having recognized his friend and protg Brutus among the assassins. However, there is no evidence that the historic Caesar had ever spoken these words.[2][3]\\r\\nThe name \\"Brutus\\", a second declension masculine noun, appears in the phrase in the vocative case, and so the -us ending of the nominative case is replaced by -e.[4]\\r\\nOn March 15 (the Ides of March), 44 BCE, the historic Caesar was attacked by a group of senators, including Marcus Junius Brutus, Caesar's friend and protg. Caesar initially resisted his attackers, but when he saw Brutus, he supposedly responded as he died.\\r\\nThe historical Caesar's last words are not known with certainty. The Roman historian Suetonius, a century and a half after the incident, claims Caesar said nothing as he died, but that others reported that Caesar's last words were the Greek phrase \\"œ´? ?, ?;\\".[5][6] The phrase means \\"You too, child?\\" or \\"You too, young man?\\".[7] Sometimes this is rendered translated into Latin as \\"Tu quoque, Brute, fili mi\\".\\r\\nPlutarch also reports that Caesar said nothing, but merely pulled his toga over his head when he saw Brutus among the conspirators.[8]\\r\\nIn the play Julius Caesar (1599), Caesar says \\"Et tu, Brute? Then fall, Caesar!\\"[9] Shakespeare was making use of a phrase already in use: for example it is said, by Edmond Malone, to have appeared in a work that has been lost: Richard Eedes's Latin play Caesar Interfectus of 1582. It also occurs in The True Tragedie of Richard Duke of Yorke, and the death of good King Henrie the Sixt, with the Whole Contention betweene the two Houses Lancaster and Yorke of 1595, which is the earliest printed version of Shakespeare's play Henry VI, Part 3.[10][11]\\r\\nIt has been argued that the phrase can be interpreted as a curse or threat.[12] One theory states that the historic Caesar adapted the words of a Greek sentence which to the Romans had long since become proverbial: The complete phrase is said to have been \\"You too, my son, will have a taste of power,\\" of which Caesar only needed to invoke the opening words to foreshadow Brutus' own violent death, in response to his assassination.[13] There is a poem by Horace, Satires; Book I, Satire 7, written approximately 30 BC, that mentions Brutus and his tyrannicide; in discussing that poem, author John Henderson considers that the expression \\"E-t t-u Br-u-t-e\\", (as he hyphenates it), can be interpreted as a complaint containing a \\"suggestion of mimetic compulsion\\".[1]","input":"Who said et tu brute in julius caesar?"},{"output":"Three","context":"Tales of Dunk and Egg is a series of fantasy novellas by George R.

Miller, produced by Roaring Studios (now Dabel Brothers Productions) and published by Image Comics and Devil's Due between August 2003 and May 2004. Devil's Due published the complete limited series as a graphic novel in June 2004.[2] Following the termination of the partnership between Dabel Brothers and Devil's Due, the graphic novel has been republished in various editions.\\r\\nUpon the death of a nomadic 'hedge knight', Ser Arlan of Pennytree, his squire Dunk adopts Ser Arlan's armor as his own, as well as his equipment, three horses, and remaining money, in hope of becoming a knight at the town of Ashford, under the name of 'Ser Duncan the Tall'. En route, he gains his own squire in a boy nicknamed 'Egg'. At Ashford, Dunk sells one of his horses for a suit of armor by the smith Pate, and befriends Ser Steffon Fossoway's squire and cousin, Raymun Fossoway. Without proof of his knighthood, he is nearly barred from competition until Prince Baelor Targaryen vouches for him. Forbidden to use Ser Arlan's coat of arms, Dunk commissions an attractive young puppeteer named Tanselle to paint a new one. Dunk watches the first day of competition, with Egg on his shoulders. After several spectacular tilts, Baelor's nephew, Prince Aerion Targaryen, disgraces himself by killing Ser Humfrey Hardyng's horse.\\r\\nWhen Dunk retires into the Fossoways' tent to drink with Raymun, Egg reveals that Tanselle is being beaten by Prince Aerion. Dunk rushes to defend Tanselle [called Tanselle Too-Tall] attacks Aerion; and when the royal guard arrests Dunk, Egg identifies himself as Aerion's brother, Prince Aegon. After meeting Prince Baelor again, Dunk chooses trial by combat rather than mutilation for his attack on Aerion, who demands a 'Trial of Seven' (in which two parties of seven knights contend on horseback). Steffon and Raymun, and later Aegon, promise to acquire Duncan's partisans; and Aerion's brother Prince Daeron, called the Drunken, warns Dunk that his father will have three knights of the Kingsguard fight in the trial.\\r\\nDunk is met again by Pate, who presents him with a new shield, originally an old one that was re-rimmed in new steel by Pate and that Tanselle has painted in his chosen sigil - an elm tree silhouetted against the sunset with a shooting star - and left for him. At the morning of the trial, Raymun brings Ser Humfrey Hardyng and Ser Humfrey Beesbury to Duncan's side; and Aegon brings Ser Robyn Rhysling and Ser Lyonel Baratheon (called the \\"Laughing Storm\\"). Steffon sides with the accusers for the reward of a lordship; and Raymun begs to be knighted and fight in Steffon's place. Dunk hesitates, because his own knighthood is dubious, and Lyonel grants Raymun his knighthood. Finally, Prince Baelor announces that he will champion Dunk himself. In the resulting joust, Dunk is unhorsed by Aerion, but beats him into submission, and Aerion recants his accusation. The fighting costs the lives of both Humfreys; and Baelor himself dies of a blow to the head. Prince Maekar later offers Dunk a position in his household to train Aegon; but Dunk insists on permission to travel, and takes Aegon as his squire, under his former alias of 'Egg'. Thereafter Dunk and Egg set out to Dorne.\\r\\nThe second novella was published in 2003 in the Legends II anthology, also edited by Robert Silverberg.[3] The story has been adapted to a graphic novel by Ben Avery and drawn by Mike S. Miller, in cooperation with publisher and distributor Marvel Comics. The graphic novel was released on June 18, 2008, with the first comic released on June 20, 2007.[4]\\r\\nThe story begins in the Reach with Duncan the Tall sworn to Ser Eustace Osgrey of Standfast, and illuminates several aspects of the feudal system of Westeros. A series of flashbacks narrated by Ser Eustace relate the events of the Blackfyre Rebellion and its conclusion at the Battle of the Redgrass Field.\\r\\nAt the fort of Standfast, Dunk and Ser Eustace's other sworn sword, Ser Bennis the Brown, discover that a dam has been built across the local stream, by peasants in service to Lady Rohanne Webber of Coldmoat. Bennis reacts angrily, cutting the cheek of one of the peasants. Upon hearing the news, Ser Eustace realizes that Lady Webber will be angered by Bennis's actions against her servants, and orders Dunk and Bennis to train levies from his three villages. For a peaceful solution, Eustace sends Dunk to Coldmoat, where Dunk learns that Lady Rohanne stands to lose her lands to a male cousin if she does not take a fifth husband by the second anniversary of her father's death. Her castellan, the haughty Ser Lucas Inchfield (known as the \\"Long Inch\\" for his 6-foot 7-inch height), is her most insistent suitor, but she has already refused him. Dunk fails to change the Lady's mind on either the dam's construction or seeking justice for her servant, and Rohanne informs him that Ser Eustace is a former traitor, who supported the usurper Daemon Blackfyre, and has therefore been stripped of most of his lands; whereas she was once in love with his youngest son, who died at Redgrass Field.\\r\\nShocked by the news of Ser Eustace's past treason, Dunk returns to Standfast to leave the old knight's service. That night, Ser Eustace's forest is burned, and Duncan recalls Lady Rohanne's threat of \\"fire and sword\\" to destroy Standfast. He therefore disperses the levies, and promises to oppose Lady Rohanne himself. At the river, Dunk rides into the ford to parley with Lady Rohanne where the noise of the water will prevent anyone on either bank from overhearing them. Before he enters the stream, Ser Eustace suggests that Dunk should kill Lady Rohanne at this meeting. Instead, Dunk offers his own blood to Lady Rohanne by slicing his cheek. This pays the debt for the wounded peasant; and for the claim that Lady Rohanne had the forest burned, she demands an apology or vindication, and all agree upon trial by combat between Dunk and Ser Lucas, to be fought in the stream as the only neutral ground present. In the fight, Dunk is nearly outfought by Ser Lucas, but drowns him and nearly drowns himself, but is resuscitated by Lady Rohanne's maester. When he awakens, Dunk learns that Ser Eustace and Lady Rohanne are now married, to reconcile their debts. Before Dunk leaves, Rohanne offers him her finest mare to make amends; and when he refuses, Lady Rohanne insists that he take something to remember her by, and he pulls her into a passionate kiss, and takes a length of her hair as a keepsake. Thereafter he and Egg ride to the Wall.\\r\\nThe third novella was published in 2010 in the anthology Warriors, edited by George R. R. Martin and Gardner Dozois.[5]\\r\\nLike The Sworn Sword, the book takes place during the reign of Aerys I and the aftermath of the Blackfyre Rebellion is examined in more detail.\\r\\nThe story begins with Dunk and Egg leaving Stoney Sept, to ask service with Lord Beron Stark against Greyjoy raids on the northern coast. On the way they encounter a septon beheaded for preaching treason; and later a group of knights and minor lords traveling to a tourney in honor of the wedding of Lord Butterwell of Whitewalls to a Frey of the Crossing, wherein the victor's prize is a dragon egg. Dunk takes a dislike to Gorman Peake, whom he believes the killer of his own mentor's former squire. Egg tells Dunk that Peake's arms of three castles on an orange field is because the Peake family owned three castles, but forfeited two to the Crown when Peake sided with Blackfyre. During the journey Dunk befriends three other itinerant knights: Ser Maynard Plumm, Ser Kyle the Cat of Misty Moor, and Ser Glendon Ball who claims to be the bastard son of the famous knight Quentyn \\"Fireball\\" Ball, who fought for Daemon Blackfyre.\\r\\nThe wedding is set at Whitewalls and Lord Frey arrives with his four-year-old heir, Walder Frey, and his fifteen-year-old daughter, who weds Lord Butterwell. Egg becomes increasingly suspicious when he sees that most of the competitors belonged to the rebel party. During the wedding Dunk is drafted by John the Fiddler to carry the bride to the bedchamber. Dunk does so and later hears from John that the latter once saw Duncan himself, in a dream, in the armor of the royal guard. Dunk enters the first match of the joust under the name of 'Gallows Knight' (for a new shield acquired after the loss of his own); but is defeated in the first tilt by Ser Uthor Underleaf, known as the Snail Knight for his sigil. Duncan later gives Underleaf his armor and horse as forfeit, and Underleaf informs Dunk that someone bribed him to kill Dunk in the final tilt. Before the jousting continues, word spreads through the castle that the dragon egg is missing, and the blame is placed on Ser Glendon Ball, who is imprisoned by Peake. In search of the absent Egg, Duncan is wounded by Alyn Cockshaw, who claims to have bribed Uthor Underleaf, and throws him into a well. Maynard Plumm comes to Duncan's aid, and it is discovered that Plumm is one of Bloodraven's many spies (or possibly Bloodraven himself), and that John the Fiddler is the eponymous son of Daemon Blackfyre. Dunk finds Egg in the sept with the cowering Lord Butterwell, who on discovering Egg's true identity is terrified for his life. Lord Butterwell's son-in-law Black Tom Heddle tries to kill Egg to incite a war, and is killed by Duncan, who thereupon tells Egg to flee with Butterwell. To buy time for Egg's escape Dunk confronts the younger Daemon Blackfyre, and accuses Gorman Peake of falsely charging Ball with the theft of the dragon egg.\\r\\nDaemon allows Ball to prove his innocence in trial by combat, in which Ser Glendon soundly defeats Daemon. By this time a large army under the King's Hand Brynden Rivers encircles Whitewalls, and Daemon is captured. Dunk and Egg meet Bloodraven, and Egg demands that Bloodraven reward Glendon, Duncan, and the other hedge knights. For surrendering to Bloodraven without a fight, Lord Butterwell is spared his life and allowed a tenth of his wealth; but his fortress is forfeit to the Iron Throne and torn down. Bloodraven, at Egg's request, gives Dunk the gold to ransom his armor. When Dunk asks Bloodraven what became of the dragon egg, Bloodraven tells Dunk it was taken by an agent of his (implied to be one of the performing dwarfs at the wedding).\\r\\nMartin has said that he would like to write a number of these stories (varying from six to twelve from interview to interview) covering the entire lives of these two characters. He has talked about an unfinished fourth novella with the working title The She-Wolves of Winterfell, which was originally to be included in the 2013 anthology Dangerous Women. As of late 2013, work on the story has been postponed while Martin completes The Winds of Winter. In April 2014, Martin also announced that he had roughed out another Dunk and Egg story with the working title The Village Hero which would be set in the Riverlands. He noted that he was not sure which of these two would be completed first.[6] In 2015, Martin noted that in addition to She-Wolves and The Village Hero he had notes and fairly specific ideas for a number of further installments, including The Sellsword, The Champion, The Kingsguard, and The Lord Commander, taking the planned series total to as many as nine novellas.[7]\\r\\nSer Duncan the Tall is listed among notable Commanders of the Kingsguard in A Storm of Swords, chapter 67. In the same chapter it is mentioned that Barristan Selmy defeated Ser Duncan the Tall in the winter tourney of King's Landing.[8]\\r\\nThe genealogy chart of Targaryens in the reference section of A Game of Thrones, shows that Egg became King Aegon V (the Unlikely) and ruled from 233-259.[9] This was confirmed in A Clash of Kings, wherein Maester Aemon is identified as his brother.[10]\\r\\nIn A Storm of Swords, Prince Oberyn Martell remarks that \\"In the days of the Targaryens, a man who struck one of the blood royal would lose the hand he struck him with\\": a punishment evaded in The Hedge Knight.[11]\\r\\nIn A Feast for Crows, Brienne has her shield painted with arms that match Dunk's, copied from a shield in her father's armory. In the same novel, Brienne arrives at an inn owned by a possible descendant of Black Tom Heddle.[12]\\r\\nIn A Feast for Crows, it is revealed that one of Egg's daughters married a son of House Baratheon and became the mother of Lord Steffon Baratheon, and thus the grandmother of Robert, Renly, and Stannis Baratheon. Aemon mentions that when he went to the wall, \\"He [Egg] sent me north aboard the Golden Dragon, and insisted that his friend Ser Duncan see me safe to Eastwatch\\". In the bonus features for Season One of Game of Thrones (on Blu-ray), Robert Baratheon states that this heritage allowed him to lay claim to the Iron Throne.[12]\\r\\nIn A Dance with Dragons, the memories of Ser Barristan Selmy reveal that the sons of Aegon V, as well as Aegon himself, had chosen their own wives, rather than accept matches for political advantage. According to Ser Barristan Selmy, this stimulated resentment and treason amongst the lords, and ultimately caused the \\"tragedy of Summerhall\\".[13]\\r\\nIn the 2014 companion book The World of Ice & Fire, mention is made of \\"Kingsguard knight Ser Duncan the Tall\\" during the reign of King Aegon V Targaryen (Aegon the Unlikely). In the Battle of Wendwater Bridge, during the Fourth Blackfyre Rebellion, Daemon III Blackfyre is slain by \\"Ser Duncan, the hedge knight for whom 'Egg' had served as a squire\\". During the rebellion of Lord Lyonel Baratheon (the Laughing Storm), it is noted that Ser Duncan had defeated Lord Lyonel in single combat.[14]\\r\\nThe first and second novellas were adapted as graphic novels:\\r\\nIn 2013, Martin confirmed that the third novel The Mystery Knight would also be adapted by Ben Avery and Mike S. Miller, and would be published by Jet City Comics and Random House.[6] In December 2016 Martin revealed the planned publication date to be July 4, 2017.[15]\\r\\nMartin wrote in 2014 that film or TV adaptations of the novellas are being discussed. He suggested that because HBO owns the TV rights to the setting of Westeros (if not to the characters of the novellas), it would be preferable to have HBO adapt the novellas as well.[6]","input":"How many dunk and egg stories are there?"},{"output":"Washington, D.C., formally the District of Columbia","context":"","input":"What is the full form of wasington d.c?"},{"output":"Cincinnati Reds","context":"The Pensacola Blue Wahoos are a minor league baseball team based in Pensacola, Florida.

The team was known as the Columbus Astros from 1970 to 1988, when it became an affiliate of the Houston Astros. Following the 1988 season, new owner Steve Bryant held a contest among season ticket holders to rename the team, and as a result, in 1989 the team became the Columbus Mudcats. In 1991, Bryant moved the club to Zebulon, North Carolina and renamed them the Carolina Mudcats.[1][2]\\r\\nIn Zebulon the team played in Five County Stadium and won Southern League championships in 1995 and 2003. In 2010 Quint Studer, owner of the Pensacola Pelicans independent baseball team, acquired the Mudcats franchise in a complicated series of moves and purchases designed to bring affiliated Double-A baseball to Pensacola. First, he sold the Pelicans to a group in Amarillo, Texas, where they became the Amarillo Sox in 2011. General manager of the Pelicans, J. C. Evers, provided the success that would prove Pensacola a viable minor league town. Studer then bought the Carolina Mudcats franchise. However, to settle this purchase, he had to facilitate the move of the Kinston Indians to Zebulon, where they assumed the Carolina Mudcats name and branding. Additionally, as Pensacola is within the franchise territory of the Mobile Bay Bears, Studer paid that team a sum. The arrangements cost a total of $2 million.[3][4]\\r\\nThe Blue Wahoos nickname was decided in a fan contest run by Wendy's in conjunction with the Pensacola News Journal.

She outlived her husband, who was 32 years her senior, by over 35 years.\\r\\nLady Baden-Powell became Chief Guide for Britain in 1918. Later the same year, at the Swanwick conference for Commissioners in October, she was presented with a gold Silver Fish,[2] one of only two ever made. She was elected World Chief Guide in 1930. As well as making a major contribution to the development of the Guide / Girl Scout movements, she visited 111 countries during her life, attending Jamborees and national Guide and Scout associations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in Chesterfield, England, her father was a brewery owner and artist Harold Soames (13 Aug 1855 √ø 25 Dec 1918), who descended[3] paternally from a landed gentry family, and maternally from a self-made man, Joseph Gilstrap / Gelthorpe,[4] quondam Mayor of Newark, Nottinghamshire.\\r\\nOlave's mother was Katharine (ne Hill; 4 Dec 1851 √ø 4 Feb 1932), one of eleven children descended from a line of Russian merchants on her father's (Hill) side. Katharine's mother was Georgina Marian Wilkins (Jul 1827 √ø 13 Dec 1894), one of fifteen children of George Wilkins and his wife Amelia Auriol Hay-Drummond (11 September 1794 √ø 31 January 1871), who was the daughter of Edward Hay-Drummond, with whom (as a Curate) George Wilkins had lodged √ø and eloped with the daughter to Gretna Green, where they were married on 2 September 1811, ten days before her 17th birthday. The couple then returned to live in the parental home in Hadleigh. Edward Hay-Drummond was a son of Robert Hay Drummond, who was a son of the 8th Earl of Kinnoull (23 June 1689 √ø 1 September 1709).[5][6]\\r\\nOlave Soames was the third child and youngest daughter of her parents. She was educated by her parents and by a number of governesses at home. She lived in seventeen homes in the first 23 years of her life. Olave became keen on outdoor sports including tennis, swimming, football, skating and canoeing, and also played the violin.[7]\\r\\nIn January 1912, Olave met Second Boer War hero and founder of the Scouts, Robert Baden-Powell, on an ocean liner (RMSP Arcadian) on the way via the Caribbean to New York to start a lecture tour. She was 23, he was 55, and they shared the same birthday. They became engaged in September of the same year, causing a media sensation. They married on 30 October 1912 in a very private ceremony, in St. Peter's Church, Parkstone, her Parish Church. She was given away by her father; apart from clergy, the only other people present were his brother and sister and Robert Kekewich, a close friend of his, her mother & brother, her brother-in-law and Miss Sie Bower, a close friend of hers.[8]\\r\\nThe Scouts and Guides of England each donated a penny to buy the Baden-Powells a wedding gift of a car (note that this is not the Rolls-Royce known as \\"Jam-Roll\\"[9] that was presented to them in 1929). Olave's father assisted financially with the purchase of Pax Hill near Bentley, Hampshire, as a family home where she lived with her husband from 29 January 1919 until 25 October 1938.[10]\\r\\nThe Baden-Powells had three children? a son and two daughters (who took the courtesy titles of Honourable in 1929; the son later succeeding his father as the 2nd Lord Baden-Powell upon his father's death in 1941):\\r\\nIn addition, when Olave's sister, Auriol Davidson ne Soames, died in 1919, Olave took her three nieces, Christian (1912√ø1975), Clare (1913√ø1980), and Yvonne, (1918-2000), into her family and brought them up as her own children.\\r\\nDuring 1915 and 1916, with World War I in progress, Olave assisted directly with the war effort in France. Robert had seen the usefulness of the YMCA's recreational huts for the soldiers and persuaded the Mercers' Company (of which he had been Master in 1912) to pay for such a hut at Val-de-Lievres, Calais. It was to be staffed by adults connected with Scouting. Olave was one of the team of five men and three women that staffed the hut at the start. She persuaded her mother to look after the children for the time she would be away.[14]\\r\\nOlave left for France on 7 October 1915, when her second child was five months old. Her regular work in the Mercers' hut included serving cocoa and cigarettes and chatting to those who came in. She also recalled in her autobiography playing her violin and singing at the Christmas Concert. Olave also adopted a number of stray animals during her time in Val-de-Lievres.[14]\\r\\nDuring this time, Robert had organised the Scouts to sponsor another recreational hut. Olave and two others started this hut at taples after Christmas 1915. At the end of January, Olave was ordered home due to sickness, ending her three months in France.[14]\\r\\nOlave and Robert moved into Ewhurst Place (see photograph on the right), outside Robertsbridge in Sussex in April 1913. In June of that year, the 1st Ewhurst Scout Troop was inaugurated.[15] Olave was the warranted Scoutmaster of this troop, assisted by the family's housemaid and the gardener.[15] Olave accompanied Robert on many of his Scouting tours and to events. She also typed letters for him. In 1915, the Baden-Powell's bought a small car, and after Robert taught her to drive, Olave often drove him to engagements.[14]\\r\\nAlthough most famously connected with the Girl Guides, Olave's first offer to help them in 1914 was turned down.The Girl Guide Movement had started following pressure from girls who wanted to become Scouts; the Movement was set up by Robert Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell. After the reorganisation of the Girl Guides in 1915, Olave again offered to help, this time successfully, and she started organising Guiding in Sussex. She became the County Commissioner for Sussex in March 1916.[16] In October 1916, the first conference for County Commissioners was held and it was here that the Commissioners unanimously requested that Olave take the role of Chief Commissioner √ø she was just pregnant with her third child. Shortly before this she had organised a great number of women in other parts of Britain to take up roles in Guiding.[2][16] In 1918, Olave was acclaimed Chief Guide, a title she much preferred to Chief Commissioner.[2]\\r\\nIn 1932, she was awarded the Dame Grand Cross of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (GBE) by King George V, in recognition of her volunteer work. Finland awarded her the Order of the White Rose of Finland, and Peru the Order of the Sun. In 1957 she was awarded both the 14th Bronze Wolf, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting,[17] and the highest distinction of the Scout Association of Japan, the Golden Pheasant Award.[18]\\r\\nOlave Baden-Powell was presented with a personal standard by the UK Girl Guide's County Commissioners. It was designed by Mrs Zigomala. Miss Kay-Shuttleworth supervised the making of the standard.[2]\\r\\nThe Standard of Lady Baden-Powell, Chief Guide of the World, is blue (azure) from the hoist to the fly. Nearest the hoist is the gold (or) trefoil; then come two small hemispheres, showing a coloured map of the world, indicating her post as Chief Guide. These are placed high to the left of the main fly, which is divided throughout its length by two silver (argent) waves, amongst which are shown three ships with black hulls and white sails, four dolphins and the Gold Fish of the Chief Guide. Then between two red (gules) motto bands on which are embroidered the Baden-Powell and Girl Guide mottoes in gold letters, there is a section alluding to the outdoor life, showing white tents on a green (vert) field. In the extreme fly the Baden-Powell crests are embroidered.[2]\\r\\nIn October 1938, Olave moved to the Outspan Hotel, Nyeri, Kenya with her husband, where he died on 8 January 1941. She received thousands of letters of condolence. She was helped to reply to them all by Bertha Hines, the wife of David Hines who was away fighting the Italian army that had invaded Ethiopia and Somalia √ø often Olave would mind Bertha's baby daughter Penny while Bertha typed letters.[19]\\r\\nIn 1942 she braved U-boat attacks to return to the UK, and as she had no home to return to, was allocated a grace and favour apartment in Hampton Court Palace (in which she lived from 1943 to 1976) (her own home, Pax Hill, had been commandeered and taken over by the Canadian military). Through World War II she toured the United Kingdom. Fortunately she was on a visit when a V2 missile damaged her Hampton Court apartment in 1944. As soon as she could after D-Day, she went to France, toured throughout Europe as the war ended to help revive Guiding and Scouting.\\r\\nOlave led the Guide Movement worldwide for forty years, travelling all over the globe helping to establish and to encourage the Guide Movements in other countries, and bringing membership to over six and a half million worldwide. Olave was present in Washington, DC in 1962 for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the American Girl Scouts.[20]\\r\\nHaving suffered a heart attack in Australia in 1961, she was finally banned from travelling by her doctor at the age of 80 in 1970 when she was diagnosed with diabetes from which she eventually died.\\r\\nIn 1968 the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) had given Olave a credit card to defray her travel costs.[21] When she stopped travelling, the BSA asked her to use the card for 'keeping in touch'.[21] This included paying for over 2000 Christmas cards she sent to those personally known to her.[21]\\r\\nOlave died on 25 June 1977 at Birtley House, Bramley in Surrey, UK.[22] Her ashes were taken to Kenya to be buried in the same grave as her husband's remains. She was survived by her two daughters, her son having predeceased her.\\r\\nThe Olave Centre for Guides was built in north London in Olave's memory. This has the World Bureau and Pax Lodge in its grounds. Pax Lodge is one of WAGGGS' four World Centres.\\r\\nScouts and Guides mark 22 February as B.-P. Day or Thinking Day, the joint birthdays of Robert and Olave Baden-Powell, to remember and celebrate the work of the Chief Scout and Chief Guide of the World. On that day in 2011, a Blue Plaque was unveiled near the site of the house in Chesterfield where she lived, by Derbyshire County Council following an Internet poll in which she received 18,026 votes out of 25,080 (72%), cf. 1,231 (5%) for George Stephenson (runner-up).[23]\\r\\nThe Olave Baden-Powell Bursary Fund was set up in 1979 from voluntary contributions in memory of Olave B-P. Annually awarded bursaries aim to allow girls in Girlguiding UK to further their interests and hobbies and realise their dreams.\\r\\nAs a child, Olave learned the violin; her first violin she called Diana. It was a copy of a Stradivarius made by Messrs. Hill for the Paris Exhibition and many years later it was presented to the Guide Association. It is still available on loan to Guides who are seriously learning to play the violin prior to them acquiring their own instrument.

After the 1901 assassination of President William McKinley, Congress also directed the Secret Service to protect the President of the United States.\\r\\nThe Secret Service is authorized by law to protect:[6]\\r\\nAny of these individuals may decline Secret Service protection except the President, the Vice President (or other officer next in the order of succession to the Office of President), the President-elect, and the Vice President-elect.[6]\\r\\nWhen Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State in 2009, the Secret Service continued to protect her at home; however the Diplomatic Security Service protected her while she was performing her duties as the Secretary of State, including foreign travel.\\r\\nThe Secret Service investigates thousands of incidents each year of individuals threatening the President of the United States.\\r\\nIn the face of budget pressure, hiring challenges and some high-profile lapses in its protective service role in 2014, the Brookings Institution and some members of Congress are asking whether the agency's focus should shift more to the protective mission, leaving more of its original mission to other agencies.[11][12]\\r\\nWith a reported one third of the currency in circulation being counterfeit at the time,[13] the Secret Service was created on July 5, 1865 in Washington, D.C., to suppress counterfeit currency. Chief William P. Wood was sworn in by Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCulloch. It was commissioned in Washington, D.C. as the \\"Secret Service Division\\" of the Department of the Treasury with the mission of suppressing counterfeiting. The legislation creating the agency was on Abraham Lincoln's desk the night he was assassinated.[14] At the time, the only other federal law enforcement agencies were the United States Park Police, the U.S. Post Office Department's Office of Instructions and Mail Depredations (now known as the United States Postal Inspection Service), and the U.S. Marshals Service. The Marshals did not have the manpower to investigate all crime under federal jurisdiction, so the Secret Service began to investigate everything from murder to bank robbery to illegal gambling. After the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901, Congress informally requested that the Secret Service provide presidential protection. A year later, the Secret Service assumed full-time responsibility for presidential protection. In 1902, William Craig became the first Secret Service agent to die while serving, in a road accident while riding in the presidential carriage.\\r\\nThe Secret Service was the first U.S. domestic intelligence and counterintelligence agency. Domestic intelligence collection and counterintelligence responsibilities were vested in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) upon the FBI's creation in 1908.\\r\\nThe Secret Service assisted in arresting Japanese American leaders and in the Japanese American internment during World War II.[15] The U.S. Secret Service is not a part of the U.S. Intelligence Community.[16]\\r\\nIn 1909, President William H. Taft agreed to meet with Mexican President Porfirio Daz in El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Jurez, Mexico, the first meeting between a U.S. and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president visited Mexico.[17] But the historic summit resulted in serious assassination threats and other security concerns for the then small Secret Service, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, BOI agents, U.S. marshals, and an additional 250 private security detail led by Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, were all called in by Chief John Wilkie to provide added security.[18][19] On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route.[20] Burnham signaled a Texas Ranger, Private C.R. Moore, and the two men captured and disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Daz and Taft, preventing the shooting of both Presidents.[21]\\r\\nIn 1950, President Harry S. Truman was residing in Blair House while the White House, across the street, was undergoing renovations. On November 1, 1950, two Puerto Rican nationalists, Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola, approached Blair House with the intent to assassinate President Truman. Collazo and Torresola opened fire on Private Leslie Coffelt and other White House Police officers. Though mortally wounded by three shots from a 9 mm German Luger to his chest and abdomen, Private Coffelt returned fire, killing Torresola with a single shot to his head. As of 2017[update], Coffelt is the only member of the Secret Service killed while protecting a US president against an assassination attempt (Special Agent Tim McCarthy stepped in front of President Ronald Reagan during the assassination attempt of March 30, 1981, and took a bullet to the abdomen but made a full recovery). Collazo was also shot, but survived his injuries and served 29 years in prison before returning to Puerto Rico in late 1979.\\r\\nIn 1968, as a result of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination, Congress authorized protection of major presidential and vice presidential candidates and nominees.[22] In 1965 and 1968, Congress also authorized lifetime protection of the spouses of deceased presidents unless they remarry and of the children of former presidents until age 16.[3]\\r\\nThe Secret Service Presidential Protective Division safeguards the President of the United States and his immediate family. They work with other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies and the military to safeguard the President when he travels in Air Force One, Marine One and by limousine in motorcades.\\r\\nAlthough the most visible role of the Secret Service today, personal protection is an anomaly in the responsibilities of an agency focused on fraud and counterfeiting.\\r\\nIn 1984, the US Congress passed the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, which extended the Secret Service's jurisdiction over credit card fraud and computer fraud.\\r\\nIn 1990, the Secret Service initiated Operation Sundevil, which they originally intended as a sting against malicious hackers, allegedly responsible for disrupting telephone services across the entire United States. The operation, which was later described by Bruce Sterling in his book The Hacker Crackdown, affected a great number of people unrelated to hacking, and led to no convictions. The Secret Service, however, was sued and required to pay damages.\\r\\nIn 1994 and 1995, it ran an undercover sting called Operation Cybersnare.[23] The Secret Service has concurrent jurisdiction with the FBI over certain violations of federal computer crime laws. They have created 24 Electronic Crimes Task Forces (ECTFs) across the United States. These task forces are partnerships between the Service, federal/state and local law enforcement, the private sector and academia aimed at combating technology-based crimes.\\r\\nIn 1998, President Bill Clinton signed Presidential Decision Directive 62, which established National Special Security Events (NSSE). That directive made the Secret Service responsible for security at designated events. In 1999, the United States Secret Service Memorial Building was dedicated in DC, granting the agency its first headquarters. Prior to this, the agency's different departments were based in office space around the DC area.[24]\\r\\nThe New York City Field office was located at 7 World Trade Center. Immediately after the World Trade Center was attacked as part of the September 11 attacks, Special Agents and other New York Field office employees were among the first to respond with first aid. Sixty-seven Special Agents in New York City, at and near the New York Field Office, helped to set up triage areas and evacuate the towers. One Secret Service employee, Master Special Officer Craig Miller,[25] died during the rescue efforts. On August 20, 2002, Director Brian L. Stafford awarded the Director's Valor Award to employees who assisted in the rescue attempts.[26]\\r\\nEffective March 1, 2003, the Secret Service transferred from the Treasury to the newly established Department of Homeland Security.\\r\\nThe USA Patriot Act, signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001, mandated the Secret Service to establish a nationwide network of ECTFs in addition to the one already active in New York. As such, this mandate expanded on the agency's first ECTFthe New York Electronic Crimes Task Force, formed in 1995which brought together federal, state and local law enforcement, prosecutors, private-industry companies, and academia. These bodies collectively provide necessary support and resources to field investigations that meet any one of the following criteria: significant economic or community impact; participation of organized criminal groups involving multiple districts or transnational organizations; or use of schemes involving new technology.[27][28]\\r\\nThe network prioritizes investigations that meet the following criteria:\\r\\nInvestigations conducted by ECTFs include crimes such as computer generated counterfeit currency; bank fraud; virus and worm proliferation; access device fraud; telecommunications fraud; Internet threats; computer system intrusions and cyber-attacks; phishing/spoofing; assistance with Internet-related child pornography and exploitation; and identity theft.[29]\\r\\nThe network includes ECTFs in the following 28 U.S. cities:\\r\\nOn July 6, 2009, the U.S. Secret Service expanded its fight on cyber-crime by creating the first European Electronic Crime Task Force, based on the successful U.S. domestic model, through a memorandum of understanding with Italian police and postal officials. Over a year later, on August 9, 2010, the agency expanded its European involvement by creating its second overseas ECTF in the United Kingdom.[32][33]\\r\\nBoth task forces are said to concentrate on a wide range of \\"computer-based criminal activity,\\" including:\\r\\nThe overseas network includes ECTFs in the following European cities:\\r\\nAs of 2010, the Service had over 6,500 employees: 3,200 Special Agents, 1,300 Uniformed Division Officers, and 2,000 technical and administrative employees.[34] Special agents serve on protective details and investigate financial, cyber, and homeland security-related crimes.\\r\\nIn September 2014, the United States Secret Service came under criticism following two high-profile incidents involving intruders at the White House. One such intruder entered the East Room of the White House through an unlocked door.[35]\\r\\nAnother incident involved a violation of procedure in which an armed security guard for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rode in the same elevator as President Barack Obama during a visit to that agency's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, to discuss U.S. response to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. The guard used his phone to record a video of Obama and refused to comply with a request to stop.[36] The guard had been arrested multiple times in the past, but had never been convicted of a crime.[37]\\r\\nSince the 1960s, Presidents John F. Kennedy (killed), Gerald Ford (twice attacked, but uninjured) and Ronald Reagan (seriously wounded) have been attacked while appearing in public.[38][39] Agents on scene though not injured during attacks on Presidents include William Greer and Roy Kellerman. One of the agents was Robert DeProspero, the Special Agent In Charge (SAIC) of Reagan's Presidential Protective Division (PPD) from January 1982 to April 1985. DeProspero was deputy to Jerry Parr, the SAIC of PPD during the Reagan assassination attempt on March 30, 1981.[40][41]\\r\\nThe Kennedy assassination spotlighted the bravery of two Secret Service agents. First, an agent protecting Mrs. Kennedy, Clint Hill, was riding in the car directly behind the presidential limousine when the attack began. While the shooting continued, Hill leapt from the running board of the car he was riding on and jumped onto the back of the President's moving car and guided Mrs. Kennedy from the trunk back into the rear seat of the car. He then shielded the President and the First Lady with his body until the car arrived at the hospital.\\r\\nRufus Youngblood was riding in the vice-presidential car. When the shots were fired, he vaulted over the front seat and threw his body over Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson.[42] That evening, Johnson called Secret Service Chief James J. Rowley and cited Youngblood's bravery.[43][44] Youngblood would later recall some of this in his memoir, Twenty Years in the Secret Service.\\r\\nThe period following the Kennedy assassination was the most difficult in the modern history of the agency. Press reports indicated that morale among the agents was \\"low\\" for months following the assassination.[45][46] The agency overhauled its procedures in the wake of the Kennedy killing. Training, which until that time had been confined largely to \\"on-the-job\\" efforts, was systematized and regularized.\\r\\nThe Reagan assassination attempt also highlighted the bravery of several Secret Service agents, particularly agent Tim McCarthy, who spread his stance to protect Reagan as six bullets were being fired by the would-be assassin, John Hinckley, Jr.[47] McCarthy survived a .22-caliber round in the abdomen. For his bravery, McCarthy received the NCAA Award of Valor in 1982.[48] Jerry Parr, the agent who pushed President Reagan into the limousine, and made the critical decision to divert the presidential motorcade to George Washington University Hospital instead of returning to the White House, was also honored with U.S. Congress commendations for his actions that day.[49] After the near-successful assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan, it was clear that the Secret Service needed to increase its efficiency to protect the President.[citation needed]\\r\\nArrest and indictment of Max Ray Butler, co-founder of the Carders Market carding website. Butler was indicted by a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after his September 5, 2007 arrest, on wire fraud and identity theft charges. According to the indictment, Butler hacked over the Internet into computers at financial institutions and credit card processing centers and sold the tens of thousands of credit card numbers that he acquired in the process.[50]\\r\\nOperation Firewall: In October 2004, 28 suspectslocated across eight U.S. states and six countrieswere arrested on charges of identity theft, computer fraud, credit-card fraud, and conspiracy. Nearly 30 national and foreign field offices of the U.S. Secret Service, including the newly established national ECTFs, and countless local enforcement agencies from around the globe, were involved in this operation. Collectively, the arrested suspects trafficked in at least 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers, which amounted to $4.3 million of losses to financial institutions. However, authorities estimated that prevented loss to the industry was in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The operation, which started in July 2003 and lasted for more than a year, led investigators to identify three cyber-criminal groups: Shadowcrew, Carderplanet, and Darkprofits.[51]\\r\\nArrest and indictment of Albert \\"Segvec\\" Gonzalez and 11 individuals; three U.S. citizens, one from Estonia, three from Ukraine, two from the People's Republic of China, one from Belarus, and one known only by an online alias. They were arrested on August 5, 2008, for the theft and sale of more than 40 million credit and debit card numbers from major U.S. retailers, including TJX Companies, BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21, and DSW. Gonzalez, the main organizer of the scheme, was charged with computer fraud, wire fraud, access device fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy for his leading role in the crime.[52]\\r\\n---\\r\\nThe Secret Service special agent position is highly competitive. In 2011, the Service accepted less than 1% of its 15,600 special agent applicants.[53] While the Secret Service has always been a popular career path for former military and law enforcement personnel, the Service seeks to hire agents from a diverse range of backgrounds in fulfilling its dual mission, including accountants, lawyers, scientists, engineers, and foreign language specialists.\\r\\nAt a minimum, a prospective agent must be a U.S. citizen, possess a current valid driver's license, be in excellent health and physical condition, possess visual acuity no worse than 20/60 uncorrected, correctable to 20/20 in each eye, and be between the ages of 21 and 37 at the time of appointment.[54] However, preference eligible veterans may apply after age 37. In 2009, the Office of Personnel Management issued implementation guidance on the Isabella v. Department of State court decision: OPM Letter.[55]\\r\\nProspective agents must also qualify for a TS/SCI (Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information) clearance, and undergo an extensive background investigation, to include in-depth interviews, drug screening, medical diagnosis, and full-scope polygraph examination.[54]\\r\\nSpecial agents receive training in two locations, totaling approximately 7 months. The first phase, the Criminal Investigator Training Program (CITP) is conducted at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) at Glynco, GA, lasting approximately 12 weeks. The second phase, the Special Agent Training Course (SATC) is conducted at the Secret Service Academy, James J. Rowley Training Center (JJRTC), just outside Washington, D.C in Laurel, Maryland, lasting approximately 18 weeks.[56]\\r\\nA typical special agent career path, depending upon performance and promotions that affect individual assignments, begins with the first six to eight years on the job assigned to a field office. Applicants are directed to list their office location preference during the application process, and upon receiving a final job offer, usually have several locations to choose from.[54]\\r\\nAfter their field office experience, agents are usually transferred to a protective assignment where they will stay for three to five years. Following their protective assignment, many agents return to a field office for the rest of their careers, or opt for a headquarters based assignment located in Washington, D.C. During their careers, agents also have the opportunity to work overseas in one of the agency's international field offices. This typically requires foreign language training to ensure language proficiency when working alongside the agency's foreign law enforcement counterparts.[54]\\r\\nSpecial agents are hired at either the GL-07 or GL-09 grade level, depending on individual qualifications and/or education.[54] Agents are eligible for promotion on a yearly basis, from GL-07, to GL-09, to GS-11, to GS-12, to GS-13 (GL-08 and GS-10 grade levels are skipped). The full performance grade level for a journeyman agent is GS-13, which a GL-07 and GL-09 agent may reach in as little as four and three years respectively. GS-13 agents are eligible for competitive promotion to supervisory agent positions, which compasses the GS-14, GS-15, and SES grade levels. GS-13 agents who wish to remain as field agents continue to advance the GS-13 step level on a near yearly basis, capping at GS-13 Step-10.\\r\\nSpecial agents also qualify for Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP), a type of premium overtime pay which provides agents with an additional 25% bonus pay on top of their salary, given that they work an average workweek of 50 hours as opposed to 40. [57] A newly hired GL-07 and GL-09 agent, and newly promoted GS-11, GS-12, GS-13 Step-1, and GS-13 Step-10 agent living in the San Francisco Bay area and qualifying for LEAP pay, will earn approximately $69k, $77k, $90k, $108k, $129k, and $162k respectively.[58]\\r\\nDue to the nature of their work and unique among their federal law enforcement counterparts (e.g. FBI, DEA, ATF, ICE), Secret Service agents are regularly eligible for scheduled overtime pay (SOT pay) in addition to LEAP overtime pay for hours worked beyond 50 per week, the pay of which is not to exceed Level II of the Executive Schedule (currently capped at $187k per year).[59]\\r\\nThe Secret Service Uniformed Division is a security police similar to the U.S. Capitol Police or DHS Federal Protective Service and is in charge of protecting the physical White House grounds and foreign diplomatic missions in the Washington, D.C. area. Established in 1922 as the White House Police, this organization was fully integrated into the Secret Service in 1930. In 1970, the protection of foreign diplomatic missions was added to the force's responsibilities, and its name was changed to the Executive Protective Service. The name United States Secret Service Uniformed Division was adopted in 1977.\\r\\nSecret Service Uniformed Division officers provide protection for the White House Complex, the Vice President's residence, the main Treasury Building and Annex, and foreign diplomatic missions and embassies in the Washington, D.C., area. Additionally, Uniformed Division officers travel in support of presidential, vice presidential and foreign head of state government missions.[60] Officers may, as their careers progress, be selected to participate in one of several specialized units, including the:\\r\\nSecret Service special officers (not to be confused with Uniformed Division Officers) are federal agents who work within the Special Agent Division and perform a wide range of security functions and support assignments as part of the protective mission for the Secret Service. Whereas special agents alternate between protection and investigative assignments, special officers are hired only to work protection details. They must have a familiarity with all phases of protective responsibilities sufficient to assist in protective movements, cover designated security posts and drive protective vehicles.\\r\\nAssignments may include\\r\\nSpecial officers are sworn law enforcement officers, and are authorized to make arrests in connection with their official duties. They are classified as federal agents but use \\"special officer\\" as their official title much the same way as Deputy US Marshals are special agents but use the title \\"Deputy US Marshal\\".\\r\\nNewly appointed special officers must successfully complete eight (8) weeks of intensive training at the Special Officer Basic Training Course at the Secret Service James J. Rowley Training Center just outside Washington, D.C. The training includes courses such as Criminal Law, Laws of Arrest, Search and Seizure, Control Tactics, Civil Liability, Emergency Medicine, Basic Water Safety, Firearms and Weapons Handling, Radio Communications, Emergency Driving and Physical Fitness Training.\\r\\nSince the agency's inception, a variety of weapons have been carried by its agents.\\r\\nInitially the firearms were privately procured and there was little if any standardization. In the 1930s, the USSS issued the Colt M1911A1 pistol in .45 ACP caliber. In the 1950s and 1960s, Special Agents carried the Smith & Wesson Model 36 and Colt Detective Special .38-Special revolvers.\\r\\nFollowing President Kennedy's assassination, USSS Special Agents were authorized to carry the .357 Magnum Smith & Wesson Model 19 revolver.\\r\\nBetween 1981 and 1991, the Secret Service issued the Smith & Wesson Model 19 and the Smith & Wesson Model 66 .357 Magnum revolvers, with 2.5-inch barrels all the way up to the 4-inch-barreled models, loaded with hollow-point rounds.\\r\\nBy 1992, the standard issue weapon became the SIG Sauer P228 9mm pistol. This weapon stayed in service through 1999.\\r\\nThe Secret Service replaced the Thompson submachine gun with the Uzi submachine gun in the 1970s. Uzis that the Secret Service used have slightly shorter-than-standard barrels so they could to fit inside the standard size Samsonite briefcases that concealed them. They phased out the Uzi in the mid 1990s and replaced it with the H&K MP5. The Secret Service was the last Federal agency to use the Uzi.\\r\\nThe Counter-Assault Team used the M4 carbine from the early 1990s until 2006, when they replaced it with the SR-15 carbine.\\r\\nThe current sidearm for USSS agents is the SIG Sauer P229 chambered in .357 SIG (which entered service in 1999) or FN Five-seveN chambered in FN 5.7x28mm.\\r\\nAgents and officers are trained on standard shoulder weapons that include the FN P90 submachine gun,[61] the 9mm Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun, and the 12-gauge Remington 870 shotgun.[61] The agency has initiated a procurement process to ultimately replace the MP5 with a 5.56mm rifle HK416.[62]\\r\\nAs a non-lethal option, Special Agents, Special Officers, and Uniformed Division Officers are armed with the ASP baton, and Uniformed Division officers carry pepper spray.\\r\\nThe agency uses Motorola XTS and APX radios and surveillance kits in order to maintain communications. These radios are known to use DES encryption keys. When operationally required, members of the Special Operations Division use military grade radios that use Type 1 encryption algorithms.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen transporting the President in a motorcade, the Secret Service uses a fleet of custom-built armored Cadillac Parade Limousines, the newest and largest version of which is known as \\"The Beast\\". Armored Chevrolet Suburbans are also used when logistics require such a vehicle or when a more low profile appearance is required. For official movement the limousine is affixed with U.S. and presidential flags and the presidential seal on the rear doors. For unofficial events the vehicles are left sterile and unadorned.[26]\\r\\nSpecial Agents and Special Officers of the Secret Service wear attire that is appropriate for their surroundings, in order to blend in as much as possible. In most circumstances, the attire of a close protection shift is a conservative suit, but it can range from a tuxedo to casual clothing as required by the environment. Stereotypically Secret Service agents are often portrayed wearing reflective sunglasses and a communication earpiece. Often their attire is customized to conceal the wide array of equipment worn in service. Agents wear a distinctive lapel pin that identifies them to other agents.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe attire for Uniformed Division Officers includes standard police uniforms or utility uniforms and ballistic/identification vests for members of the countersniper team, Emergency Response Team (ERT), and canine officers. The shoulder patch of the Uniformed Division consists of the U.S. coat of arms on white or black, depending on the garment. Also, the shoulder patch is embroidered with \\"U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division Police\\" around the emblem.[63]\\r\\nThe Secret Service has agents assigned to 136 field offices and field agencies, and the headquarters in Washington, D.C. The Service's offices are located in cities throughout the United States and in Brazil (Brasilia), Bulgaria (Sofia), Canada (Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver), Colombia (Bogota), China (Hong Kong), France (Paris, Lyon), Germany (Frankfurt), Italy (Rome), Mexico (Mexico City), Netherlands (The Hague), Romania (Bucharest), Russia (Moscow), South Africa (Pretoria), Spain (Madrid), Thailand (Bangkok), and the United Kingdom (London). The offices in Lyon and The Hague are respectively responsible for liaison with the headquarters of Interpol and Europol, located in those cities.[64]\\r\\nIn April 2012, an incident involving the president's security detail received international press attention. The incident involved 11 agents and personnel from four branches of the U.S. military; they allegedly engaged prostitutes while assigned to protect the U.S. President at the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia. As of April 24, 2012, nine employees had resigned or retired.[65][66]\\r\\nAfter the incident was publicized, the Secret Service implemented new rules for its personnel.[67][68][69][70] The rules prohibit personnel from visiting \\"non-reputable establishments\\"[68] and from consuming alcohol fewer than ten hours before starting work. Additionally, they restrict who is allowed in hotel rooms.[68]\\r\\nA few weeks later, stories emerged of Secret Service agents hiring strippers and prostitutes prior to Obama's 2011 visit to El Salvador.[71]\\r\\nIn 2015, two inebriated senior service agents drove an official car into the White House complex and collided with a barrier. One of the congressmen in the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that investigated that incident was Jason Chaffetz. In September 2015, it was revealed that 18 Secret Service employees or supervisors, including Assistant Director Ed Lowery, accessed an unsuccessful 2003 application by Chaffetz for employment with the agency and discussed leaking the information to the media in retaliation for Chaffetz' investigations of agency misconduct. The confidential personal information was later leaked to The Daily Beast. Agency Director Joe Clancy apologized to Chaffetz and said that disciplinary action would be taken against those responsible.[72]\\r\\nIn March 2017, a member of US Vice President Mike Pence's detail was suspended after he was caught visiting a prostitute at a hotel in Maryland.[73]","input":"What kind of guns does the secret service carry?"},{"output":"Station Casinos","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nPalms Casino Resort is a hotel and casino located near the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada.

It changed the federal legal status of more than 3.5 million enslaved African Americans in the designated areas of the South from slave to free. As soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the former slave became free. Ultimately, the rebel surrender liberated and resulted in the proclamation's application to all of the designated former slaves.  It did not cover slaves in Union areas that were freed by state action (or three years later by the 13th amendment in December 1865). It was issued as a war measure during the American Civil War, directed to all of the areas in rebellion and all segments of the executive branch (including the Army and Navy) of the United States.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Proclamation ordered the freedom of all slaves in ten states.[3] Because it was issued under the president's authority to suppress rebellion (war powers), it necessarily excluded areas not in rebellion, but still applied to more than 3.5 million of the 4 million slaves. The Proclamation was based on the president's constitutional authority as commander in chief of the armed forces;[4] it was not a law passed by Congress. The Proclamation was issued in January 1863 after U.S government issued a series of warnings in the summer of 1862 under the Second Confiscation Act, allowing Southern Confederate supporters 60 days to surrender, or face confiscation of land and slaves. The Proclamation also ordered that suitable persons among those freed could be enrolled into the paid service of United States' forces, and ordered the Union Army (and all segments of the Executive branch) to \\"recognize and maintain the freedom of\\" the ex-slaves. The Proclamation did not compensate the owners, did not outlaw slavery, and did not grant citizenship to the ex-slaves (called freedmen). It made the eradication of slavery an explicit war goal, in addition to the goal of reuniting the Union.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAround 25,000 to 75,000 slaves in regions where the US Army was active were immediately emancipated. It could not be enforced in areas still under rebellion, but, as the Union army took control of Confederate regions, the Proclamation provided the legal framework for freeing more than three and a half million slaves in those regions. Prior to the Proclamation, in accordance with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, escaped slaves were either returned to their masters or held in camps as contraband for later return. The Proclamation applied only to slaves in Confederate-held lands; it did not apply to those in the four slave states that were not in rebellion (Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, and Missouri, which were unnamed), nor to Tennessee (unnamed but occupied by Union troops since 1862) and lower Louisiana (also under occupation), and specifically excluded those counties of Virginia soon to form the state of West Virginia. Also specifically excluded (by name) were some regions already controlled by the Union army. Emancipation in those places would come after separate state actions or the December 1865 ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, which made slavery and indentured servitude, except for those duly convicted of a crime, illegal everywhere subject to United States jurisdiction.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued a preliminary warning that he would order the emancipation of all slaves in any state that did not end its rebellion against the Union by January 1, 1863.[7]  None of the Confederate states restored themselves to the Union, and Lincoln's order was signed and took effect on January 1, 1863. The Emancipation Proclamation outraged white Southerners (and their sympathizers) who envisioned a race war. It angered some Northern Democrats, energized anti-slavery forces, and undermined elements in Europe that wanted to intervene to help the Confederacy.[8] The Proclamation lifted the spirits of African Americans both free and slave. It led many slaves to escape from their masters and get to Union lines to obtain their freedom, and to join the Union Army.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emancipation Proclamation broadened the goals of the Civil War. While slavery had been a major issue that led to the war, Lincoln's only mission at the start of the war was to maintain the Union. The Proclamation made freeing the slaves an explicit goal of the Union war effort. Establishing the abolition of slavery as one of the two primary war goals served to deter intervention by Britain and France.[9] The Emancipation Proclamation was never challenged in court. To ensure the abolition of slavery in all of the U.S., Lincoln pushed for passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, and insisted that Reconstruction plans for Southern states require abolition in new state constitutions. Congress passed the 13th Amendment by the necessary two-thirds vote on January 31, 1865, and it was ratified by the states on December 6, 1865, ending legal slavery.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Constitution of 1787 did not use the word \\"slavery\\" but included several provisions about unfree persons. The Three-Fifths Compromise (in Article I, Section 2) allocated Congressional representation based \\"on the whole Number of free Persons\\" and \\"three fifths of all other Persons\\".[11] Under the Fugitive Slave Clause (Article IV, Section 2), \\"[n]o person held to service or labour in one state\\" would be freed by escaping to another. Article I, Section 9 allowed Congress to pass legislation to outlaw the \\"Importation of Persons\\", but not until 1808.[12] However, for purposes of the Fifth Amendmentwhich states that, \\"No person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\\"slaves were understood as property.[13] Although abolitionists used the Fifth Amendment to argue against slavery, it became part of the legal basis for treating slaves as property with Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857).[14] Socially, slavery was also supported in law and in practice by a pervasive culture of white supremacy.[15] Nonetheless, between 1777 and 1804, every Northern state provided for the immediate or gradual abolition of slavery, except the border states of Maryland and Delaware. Maryland did not abolish slavery until 1864,[16] and Delaware was one of the last states to hold onto slavery; it was still legal in Delaware when the thirteenth amendment was issued.[17]  No Southern state did so, and the slave population of the South continued to grow, peaking at almost four million people at the beginning of the American Civil War, when most slave states sought to break away from the United States.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nLincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery in peacetime was limited by the Constitution which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states.[19] Against the background of the American Civil War, however, Lincoln issued the Proclamation under his authority as \\"Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy\\" under Article II, section 2 of the United States Constitution.[20] As such, he claimed to have the martial power to free persons held as slaves in those states that were in rebellion \\"as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion\\".[21] He did not have Commander-in-Chief authority over the four slave-holding states that were not in rebellion: Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland and Delaware, and so those states were not named in the Proclamation.[23] The fifth border jurisdiction, West Virginia, where slavery remained legal but was in the process of being abolished, was, in January 1863, still part of the legally recognized, \\"reorganized\\" state of Virginia, based in Alexandria, which was in the Union (as opposed to the Confederate state of Virginia, based in Richmond).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Proclamation applied in the ten states that were still in rebellion in 1863, and thus did not cover the nearly 500,000 slaves in the slave-holding border states (Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland or Delaware) which were Union states. Those slaves were freed by later separate state and federal actions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state of Tennessee had already mostly returned to Union control, under a recognized Union government, so it was not named and was exempted. Virginia was named, but exemptions were specified for the 48 counties then in the process of forming the new state of West Virginia, and seven additional counties and two cities in the Union-controlled Tidewater region.[24] Also specifically exempted were New Orleans and 13 named parishes of Louisiana, which were mostly under federal control at the time of the Proclamation. These exemptions left unemancipated an additional 300,000 slaves.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emancipation Proclamation has been ridiculed, notably in an influential passage by Richard Hofstadter for \\"freeing\\" only the slaves over which the Union had no power.[26] These slaves were freed due to Lincoln's \\"war powers\\". This act cleared up the issue of contraband slaves.[27] It automatically clarified the status of over 100,000 now-former slaves. Some 20,000 to 50,000 slaves were freed the day it went into effect[28] in parts of nine of the ten states to which it applied (Texas being the exception).[29] In every Confederate state (except Tennessee and Texas), the Proclamation went into immediate effect in Union-occupied areas and at least 20,000 slaves[28][29] were freed at once on January 1, 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Proclamation provided the legal framework for the emancipation of nearly all four million slaves as the Union armies advanced, and committed the Union to ending slavery, which was a controversial decision even in the North. Hearing of the Proclamation, more slaves quickly escaped to Union lines as the Army units moved South. As the Union armies advanced through the Confederacy, thousands of slaves were freed each day until nearly all (approximately 3.9 million, according to the 1860 Census)[30] were freed by July 1865.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Proclamation had freed most slaves as a war measure, it had not made slavery illegal. Of the states that were exempted from the Proclamation, Maryland,[31] Missouri,[32] Tennessee,[33] and West Virginia[34] prohibited slavery before the war ended. In 1863, President Lincoln proposed a moderate plan for the Reconstruction of the captured Confederate State of Louisiana.[35] Only 10% of the state's electorate had to take the loyalty oath. The state was also required to abolish slavery in its new constitution. Identical Reconstruction plans would be adopted in Arkansas and Tennessee. By December 1864, the Lincoln plan abolishing slavery had been enacted in Louisiana.[36][37] However, in Delaware[38] and Kentucky,[39] slavery continued to be legal until December 18, 1865, when the Thirteenth Amendment went into effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required individuals to return runaway slaves to their owners. During the war, Union generals such as Benjamin Butler declared that slaves in occupied areas were contraband of war and accordingly refused to return them.[40] This decision was controversial because it implied recognition of the Confederacy as a separate, independent sovereign state under international law, a notion that Lincoln steadfastly denied. As a result, he did not promote the contraband designation. In addition, as contraband, these people were legally designated as \\"property\\" when they crossed Union lines and their ultimate status was uncertain.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1861, Lincoln sent his first annual message to Congress (the State of the Union Address, but then typically given in writing and not referred to as such). In it he praised the free labor system, as respecting human rights over property rights; he endorsed legislation to address the status of contraband slaves and slaves in loyal states, possibly through buying their freedom with federal taxes, and also the funding of strictly voluntary colonization efforts.[43] In January 1862, Thaddeus Stevens, the Republican leader in the House, called for total war against the rebellion to include emancipation of slaves, arguing that emancipation, by forcing the loss of enslaved labor, would ruin the rebel economy. On March 13, 1862, Congress approved a \\"Law Enacting an Additional Article of War\\", which stated that from that point onward it was forbidden for Union Army officers to return fugitive slaves to their owners.[44] On April 10, 1862, Congress declared that the federal government would compensate slave owners who freed their slaves. Slaves in the District of Columbia were freed on April 16, 1862, and their owners were compensated.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 19, 1862, Congress prohibited slavery in all current and future United States territories (though not in the states), and President Lincoln quickly signed the legislation. By this act, they repudiated the 1857 opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in the Dred Scott Case that Congress was powerless to regulate slavery in U.S. territories.[45][46]\\r\\nThis joint action by Congress and President Lincoln also rejected the notion of popular sovereignty that had been advanced by Stephen A. Douglas as a solution to the slavery controversy, while completing the effort first legislatively proposed by Thomas Jefferson in 1784 to confine slavery within the borders of existing states.[47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July, Congress passed and Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act of 1862, containing provisions for court proceedings to liberate slaves held by convicted \\"rebels\\", or of slaves of rebels that had escaped to Union lines.[49] The Act applied in cases of criminal convictions and to those who were slaves of \\"disloyal\\" masters.  However, Lincoln's position continued to be that Congress lacked power to free all slaves within the borders of rebel held states, but Lincoln as commander in chief could do so if he deemed it a proper military measure,[50] and that Lincoln had already drafted plans to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbolitionists had long been urging Lincoln to free all slaves. In the summer of 1862, Republican editor Horace Greeley of the highly influential New York Tribune wrote a famous editorial entitled \\"The Prayer of Twenty Millions\\" demanding a more aggressive attack on the Confederacy and faster emancipation of the slaves: \\"On the face of this wide earth, Mr. President, there is not one ... intelligent champion of the Union cause who does not feel ... that the rebellion, if crushed tomorrow, would be renewed if slavery were left in full vigor and that every hour of deference to slavery is an hour of added and deepened peril to the Union.\\"[51] Lincoln responded in his Letter To Horace Greeley from August 22, 1862, in terms of the limits imposed by his duty as president to save the Union:\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.... I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nLincoln scholar Harold Holzer wrote in this context about Lincoln's letter: \\"Unknown to Greeley, Lincoln composed this after he had already drafted a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which he had determined to issue after the next Union military victory. Therefore, this letter, was in truth, an attempt to position the impending announcement in terms of saving the Union, not freeing slaves as a humanitarian gesture. It was one of Lincoln's most skillful public relations efforts, even if it has cast longstanding doubt on his sincerity as a liberator.\\"[53] Historian Richard Striner argues that \\"for years\\" Lincoln's letter has been misread as \\"Lincoln only wanted to save the Union.\\"[54] However, within the context of Lincoln's entire career and pronouncements on slavery this interpretation is wrong, according to Striner. Rather, Lincoln was softening the strong Northern white supremacist opposition to his imminent emancipation by tying it to the cause of the Union. This opposition would fight for the Union but not to end slavery, so Lincoln gave them the means and motivation to do both, at the same time.[54] In his 2014 book, Lincoln's Gamble, journalist and historian Todd Brewster asserted that Lincoln's desire to reassert the saving of the Union as his sole war goal was in fact crucial to his claim of legal authority for emancipation. Since slavery was protected by the Constitution, the only way that he could free the slaves was as a tactic of warnot as the mission itself.[55] But that carried the risk that when the war ended, so would the justification for freeing the slaves. Late in 1862, Lincoln asked his Attorney General, Edward Bates, for an opinion as to whether slaves freed through a war-related proclamation of emancipation could be re-enslaved once the war was over. Bates had to work through the language of the Dred Scott decision to arrive at an answer, but he finally concluded that they could indeed remain free. Still, a complete end to slavery would require a constitutional amendment.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nConflicting advice, to free all slaves, or not free them at all, was presented to Lincoln in public and private. Thomas Nast, a cartoon artist during the Civil War and the late 1800s considered \\"Father of the American Cartoon\\", composed many works including a two-sided spread that showed the transition from slavery into civilization after President Lincoln signed the Proclamation. Nast believed in equal opportunity and equality for all people, including enslaved Africans or free blacks.[57] A mass rally in Chicago on September 7, 1862, demanded an immediate and universal emancipation of slaves. A delegation headed by William W. Patton met the president at the White House on September 13. Lincoln had declared in peacetime that he had no constitutional authority to free the slaves. Even used as a war power, emancipation was a risky political act. Public opinion as a whole was against it.[58] There would be strong opposition among Copperhead Democrats and an uncertain reaction from loyal border states. Delaware and Maryland already had a high percentage of free blacks: 91.2% and 49.7%, respectively, in 1860.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nLincoln first discussed the proclamation with his cabinet in July 1862. He drafted his \\"preliminary proclamation\\" and read it to Secretary of State William Seward, and Secretary of Navy Gideon Welles, on July 13. Seward and Welles were at first speechless, then Seward referred to possible anarchy throughout the South and resulting foreign intervention; Welles apparently said nothing. On July 22, Lincoln presented it to his entire cabinet as something he had determined to do and he asked their opinion on wording.[60] Although Secretary of War Edwin Stanton supported it, Seward advised Lincoln to issue the proclamation after a major Union victory, or else it would appear as if the Union was giving \\"its last shriek of retreat\\".[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1862, the Battle of Antietam gave Lincoln the victory he needed to issue the Emancipation. In the battle, though the Union suffered heavier losses than the Confederates and General McClellan allowed the escape of Robert E. Lee's retreating troops, Union forces turned back a Confederate invasion of Maryland. On September 22, 1862, five days after Antietam occurred, and while living at the Soldier's Home, Lincoln called his cabinet into session and issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation.[62] According to Civil War historian James M. McPherson, Lincoln told Cabinet members that he had made a covenant with God, that if the Union drove the Confederacy out of Maryland, he would issue the Emancipation Proclamation.[63][64] Lincoln had first shown an early draft of the proclamation to Vice President Hannibal Hamlin,[65] an ardent abolitionist, who was more often kept in the dark on presidential decisions. The final proclamation was issued January 1, 1863. Although implicitly granted authority by Congress, Lincoln used his powers as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, \\"as a necessary war measure\\" as the basis of the proclamation, rather than the equivalent of a statute enacted by Congress or a constitutional amendment. Some days after issuing the final Proclamation, Lincoln wrote to Major General John McClernand: \\"After the commencement of hostilities I struggled nearly a year and a half to get along without touching the \\"institution\\"; and when finally I conditionally determined to touch it, I gave a hundred days fair notice of my purpose, to all the States and people, within which time they could have turned it wholly aside, by simply again becoming good citizens of the United States. They chose to disregard it, and I made the peremptory proclamation on what appeared to me to be a military necessity. And being made, it must stand.\\"[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, the Emancipation Proclamation effectively freed only a small percentage of the slaves, those who were behind Union lines in areas not exempted. Most slaves were still behind Confederate lines or in exempted Union-occupied areas. Secretary of State William H. Seward commented, \\"We show our sympathy with slavery by emancipating slaves where we cannot reach them and holding them in bondage where we can set them free.\\" Had any slave state ended its secession attempt before January 1, 1863, it could have kept slavery, at least temporarily. The Proclamation only gave the Lincoln Administration the legal basis to free the slaves in the areas of the South that were still in rebellion on January 1, 1863. It effectively destroyed slavery as the Union armies advanced south and conquered the entire Confederacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emancipation Proclamation also allowed for the enrollment of freed slaves into the United States military. During the war nearly 200,000 blacks, most of them ex-slaves, joined the Union Army.[67] Their contributions gave the North additional manpower that was significant in winning the war. The Confederacy did not allow slaves in their army as soldiers until the last month before its defeat.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the counties of Virginia that were soon to form West Virginia were specifically exempted from the Proclamation (Jefferson County being the only exception), a condition of the state's admittance to the Union was that its constitution provide for the gradual abolition of slavery (an immediate emancipation of all slaves was also adopted there in early 1865). Slaves in the border states of Maryland and Missouri were also emancipated by separate state action before the Civil War ended. In Maryland, a new state constitution abolishing slavery in the state went into effect on November 1, 1864. The Union-occupied counties of eastern Virginia and parishes of Louisiana, which had been exempted from the Proclamation, both adopted state constitutions that abolished slavery in April 1864.[69][70] In early 1865, Tennessee adopted an amendment to its constitution prohibiting slavery.[71][72] Slaves in Kentucky and Delaware were not emancipated until the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Proclamation was issued in two parts. The first part, issued on September 22, 1862, was a preliminary announcement outlining the intent of the second part, which officially went into effect 100 days later on January 1, 1863, during the second year of the Civil War. It was Abraham Lincoln's declaration that all slaves would be permanently freed in all areas of the Confederacy that had not already returned to federal control by January 1863. The ten affected states were individually named in the second part (South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina). Not included were the Union slave states of Maryland, Delaware, Missouri and Kentucky. Also not named was the state of Tennessee, in which a Union-controlled military government had already been set up, based in the capital, Nashville. Specific exemptions were stated for areas also under Union control on January 1, 1863, namely 48 counties that would soon become West Virginia, seven other named counties of Virginia including Berkeley and Hampshire counties,  which were soon added to West Virginia, New Orleans and 13 named parishes nearby.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnion-occupied areas of the Confederate states where the proclamation was put into immediate effect by local commanders included Winchester, Virginia,[73] Corinth, Mississippi,[74] the Sea Islands along the coasts of the Carolinas and Georgia,[75] Key West, Florida,[76] and Port Royal, South Carolina.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been inaccurately claimed that the Emancipation Proclamation did not free a single slave;[78] historian Lerone Bennett, Jr. alleged that the proclamation was a hoax deliberately designed not to free any slaves.[79] However, as a result of the Proclamation, many slaves were freed during the course of the war, beginning with the day it took effect; eyewitness accounts at places such as Hilton Head, South Carolina,[80] and Port Royal, South Carolina[77] record celebrations on January 1 as thousands of blacks were informed of their new legal status of freedom. Estimates of how many thousands of slaves were freed immediately by the Emancipation Proclamation are varied. One contemporary estimate put the 'contraband' population of Union-occupied North Carolina at 10,000, and the Sea Islands of South Carolina also had a substantial population. Those 20,000 slaves were freed immediately by the Emancipation Proclamation.\\"[28] This Union-occupied zone where freedom began at once included parts of eastern North Carolina, the Mississippi Valley, northern Alabama, the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, a large part of Arkansas, and the Sea Islands of Georgia and South Carolina.[81] Although some counties of Union-occupied Virginia were exempted from the Proclamation, the lower Shenandoah Valley, and the area around Alexandria were covered.[28] Emancipation was immediately enforced as Union soldiers advanced into the Confederacy. Slaves fled their masters and were often assisted by Union soldiers.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nBooker T. Washington, as a boy of 9 in Virginia, remembered the day in early 1865:[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the great day drew nearer, there was more singing in the slave quarters than usual. It was bolder, had more ring, and lasted later into the night. Most of the verses of the plantation songs had some reference to freedom. ... Some man who seemed to be a stranger (a United States officer, I presume) made a little speech and then read a rather long paperthe Emancipation Proclamation, I think. After the reading we were told that we were all free, and could go when and where we pleased. My mother, who was standing by my side, leaned over and kissed her children, while tears of joy ran down her cheeks. She explained to us what it all meant, that this was the day for which she had been so long praying, but fearing that she would never live to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmancipation took place without violence by masters or ex-slaves. The Proclamation represented a shift in the war objectives of the Northreuniting the nation was no longer the only goal. It represented a major step toward the ultimate abolition of slavery in the United States and a \\"new birth of freedom\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nRunaway slaves who had escaped to Union lines had previously been held by the Union Army as \\"contraband of war\\" under the Confiscation Acts; when the proclamation took effect, they were told at midnight that they were free to leave. The Sea Islands off the coast of Georgia had been occupied by the Union Navy earlier in the war. The whites had fled to the mainland while the blacks stayed. An early program of Reconstruction was set up for the former slaves, including schools and training. Naval officers read the proclamation and told them they were free.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlaves had been part of the \\"engine of war\\" for the Confederacy. They produced and prepared food; sewed uniforms; repaired railways; worked on farms and in factories, shipping yards, and mines; built fortifications; and served as hospital workers and common laborers. News of the Proclamation spread rapidly by word of mouth, arousing hopes of freedom, creating general confusion, and encouraging thousands to escape to Union lines.[84] George Washington Albright, a teenage slave in Mississippi, recalled that like many of his fellow slaves, his father escaped to join Union forces. According to Albright, plantation owners tried to keep the Proclamation from slaves but news of it came through the \\"grapevine\\". The young slave became a \\"runner\\" for an informal group they called the 4Ls (\\"Lincoln's Legal Loyal League\\") bringing news of the proclamation to secret slave meetings at plantations throughout the region.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert E. Lee saw the Emancipation Proclamation as a way for the Union to bolster the number of soldiers it could place on the field, making it imperative for the Confederacy to increase their own numbers.  Writing on the matter after the sack of Fredericksburg, Lee wrote \\"In view of the vast increase of the forces of the enemy, of the savage and brutal policy he has proclaimed, which leaves us no alternative but success or degradation worse than death, if we would save the honor of our families from pollution, our social system from destruction, let every effort be made, every means be employed, to fill and maintain the ranks of our armies, until God, in his mercy, shall bless us with the establishment of our independence.\\"[86] Lee's request for a drastic increase of troops would go unfulfilled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Proclamation was immediately denounced by Copperhead Democrats who opposed the war and advocated restoring the union by allowing slavery. Horatio Seymour, while running for the governorship of New York, cast the Emancipation Proclamation as a call for slaves to commit extreme acts of violence on all white southerners, saying it was \\"a proposal for the butchery of women and children, for scenes of lust and rapine, and of arson and murder, which would invoke the interference of civilized Europe\\".[91] The Copperheads also saw the Proclamation as an unconstitutional abuse of presidential power. Editor Henry A. Reeves wrote in Greenport's Republican Watchman that \\"In the name of freedom of Negroes, [the proclamation] imperils the liberty of white men; to test a utopian theory of equality of races which Nature, History and Experience alike condemn as monstrous, it overturns the Constitution and Civil Laws and sets up Military Usurpation in their Stead.\\"[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nRacism remained pervasive on both sides of the conflict and many in the North supported the war only as an effort to force the South to stay in the Union. The promises of many Republican politicians that the war was to restore the Union and not about black rights or ending slavery, were now declared lies by their opponents citing the Proclamation. Copperhead David Allen spoke to a rally in Columbiana, Ohio, stating, \\"I have told you that this war is carried on for the Negro. There is the proclamation of the President of the United States. Now fellow Democrats I ask you if you are going to be forced into a war against your Brithren of the Southern States for the Negro. I answer No!\\"[92] The Copperheads saw the Proclamation as irrefutable proof of their position and the beginning of a political rise for their members; in Connecticut, H. B. Whiting wrote that the truth was now plain even to \\"those stupid thick-headed persons who persisted in thinking that the President was a conservative man and that the war was for the restoration of the Union under the Constitution\\".[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nWar Democrats who rejected the Copperhead position within their party, found themselves in a quandary. While throughout the war they had continued to espouse the racist positions of their party and their disdain of the concerns of slaves, they did see the Proclamation as a viable military tool against the South, and worried that opposing it might demoralize troops in the Union army. The question would continue to trouble them and eventually lead to a split within their party as the war progressed.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nLincoln further alienated many in the Union two days after issuing the preliminary copy of the Emancipation Proclamation by suspending habeas corpus. His opponents linked these two actions in their claims that he was becoming a despot. In light of this and a lack of military success for the Union armies, many War Democrat voters who had previously supported Lincoln turned against him and joined the Copperheads in the off-year elections held in October and November.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1862 elections, the Democrats gained 28 seats in the House as well as the governorship of New York. Lincoln's friend Orville Hickman Browning told the president that the Proclamation and the suspension of habeas corpus had been \\"disastrous\\" for his party by handing the Democrats so many weapons. Lincoln made no response. Copperhead William Javis of Connecticut pronounced the election the \\"beginning of the end of the utter downfall of Abolitionism in the United States\\".[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorians James M. McPherson and Allan Nevins state that though the results looked very troubling, they could be seen favorably by Lincoln; his opponents did well only in their historic strongholds and \\"at the national level their gains in the House were the smallest of any minority party's in an off-year election in nearly a generation. Michigan, California, and Iowa all went Republican.... Moreover, the Republicans picked up five seats in the Senate.\\"[91] McPherson states \\"If the election was in any sense a referendum on emancipation and on Lincoln's conduct of the war, a majority of Northern voters endorsed these policies.\\"[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial Confederate response was one of expected outrage. The Proclamation was seen as vindication for the rebellion, and proof that Lincoln would have abolished slavery even if the states had remained in the Union.[93] In an August 1863 letter to President Lincoln, U.S. Army general Ulysses S. Grant observed that the Proclamation, combined with the usage of black soldiers by the U.S. Army, profoundly angered the Confederacy, saying that \\"the emancipation of the Negro, is the heaviest blow yet given the Confederacy. The South rave a great deal about it and profess to be very angry.\\"[94] A few months after the Proclamation took effect, the Confederacy passed a law in May 1863 demanding \\"full and ample retaliation\\" against the U.S. for such measures. The Confederacy stated that the black U.S. soldiers captured while fighting against the Confederacy would be tried as slave insurrectionists in civil courtsa capital offense with automatic sentence of death. Less than a year after the law's passage, the Confederates massacred black U.S. soldiers at Fort Pillow.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, some Confederates welcomed the Proclamation, as they believed it would strengthen pro-slavery sentiment in the Confederacy and, thus, lead to greater enlistment of white men into the Confederate army. According to one Confederate man from Kentucky, \\"The Proclamation is worth three hundred thousand soldiers to our Government at least... It shows exactly what this war was brought about for and the intention of its damnable authors.\\"[96] Even some Union soldiers concurred with this view and expressed reservations about the Proclamation, not on principle, but rather because they were afraid it would increase the Confederacy's determination to fight on and maintain slavery. One Union soldier from New York stated worryingly after the Proclamation's passage, \\"I know enough of the Southern spirit that I think they will fight for the institution of slavery even to extermination.\\"[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the Proclamation, the price of slaves in the Confederacy increased in the months after its issuance, with one Confederate from South Carolina opining in 1865 that \\"now is the time for Uncle to buy some negro women and children.\\"[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Lincoln had hoped, the Proclamation turned foreign popular opinion in favor of the Union by gaining the support of anti-slavery countries and countries that had already abolished slavery (especially the developed countries in Europe). This shift ended the Confederacy's hopes of gaining official recognition.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Emancipation Proclamation made the eradication of slavery an explicit Union war goal, it linked support for the South to support for slavery. Public opinion in Britain would not tolerate direct support for slavery. British companies, however, continued to build and operate blockade runners for the South. As Henry Adams noted, \\"The Emancipation Proclamation has done more for us than all our former victories and all our diplomacy.\\" In Italy, Giuseppe Garibaldi hailed Lincoln as \\"the heir of the aspirations of John Brown\\". On August 6, 1863, Garibaldi wrote to Lincoln: \\"Posterity will call you the great emancipator, a more enviable title than any crown could be, and greater than any merely mundane treasure\\".[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nMayor Abel Haywood, a representative for workers from Manchester, England, wrote to Lincoln saying, \\"We joyfully honor you for many decisive steps toward practically exemplifying your belief in the words of your great founders: 'All men are created free and equal.'\\"[101] The Emancipation Proclamation served to ease tensions with Europe over the North's conduct of the war, and combined with the recent failed Southern offensive at Antietam, to cut off any practical chance for the Confederacy to receive British support in the war.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nLincoln's Gettysburg Address in November 1863 made indirect reference to the Proclamation and the ending of slavery as a war goal with the phrase \\"new birth of freedom\\". The Proclamation solidified Lincoln's support among the rapidly growing abolitionist element of the Republican Party and ensured that they would not block his re-nomination in 1864.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1863, Lincoln issued his Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction, which dealt with the ways the rebel states could reconcile with the Union.  Key provisions required that the states accept the Emancipation Proclamation and thus the freedom of their slaves, and accept the Confiscation Acts, as well as the Act banning of slavery in United States territories.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the end of the war, abolitionists were concerned that the Emancipation Proclamation would be construed solely as a war measure, Lincoln's original intent, and would no longer apply once fighting ended. They were also increasingly anxious to secure the freedom of all slaves, not just those freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Thus pressed, Lincoln staked a large part of his 1864 presidential campaign on a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery uniformly throughout the United States. Lincoln's campaign was bolstered by separate votes in both Maryland and Missouri to abolish slavery in those states. Maryland's new constitution abolishing slavery took effect in November 1864. Slavery in Missouri was ended by executive proclamation of its governor, Thomas C. Fletcher, on January 11, 1865.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinning re-election, Lincoln pressed the lame duck 38th Congress to pass the proposed amendment immediately rather than wait for the incoming 39th Congress to convene. In January 1865, Congress sent to the state legislatures for ratification what became the Thirteenth Amendment, banning slavery in all U.S. states and territories. The amendment was ratified by the legislatures of enough states by December 6, 1865, and proclaimed 12 days later. There were about 40,000 slaves in Kentucky and 1,000 in Delaware who were liberated then.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the years went on and American life continued to be deeply unfair towards blacks, cynicism towards Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation increased. Perhaps the strongest attack was Lerone Bennett's Forced into Glory: Abraham Lincoln's White Dream (2000), which claimed that Lincoln was a white supremacist who issued the Emancipation Proclamation in lieu of the real racial reforms for which radical abolitionists pushed. In his Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, Allen C. Guelzo noted the professional historians' lack of substantial respect for the document, since it has been the subject of few major scholarly studies. He argued that Lincoln was the US \\"last Enlightenment politician\\"[105] and as such was dedicated to removing slavery strictly within the bounds of law.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther historians have given more credit to Lincoln for what he accomplished within the tensions of his cabinet and a society at war, for his own growth in political and moral stature, and for the promise he held out to the slaves.[106] More might have been accomplished if he had not been assassinated. As Eric Foner wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nLincoln was not an abolitionist or Radical Republican, a point Bennett reiterates innumerable times. He did not favor immediate abolition before the war, and held racist views typical of his time. But he was also a man of deep convictions when it came to slavery, and during the Civil War displayed a remarkable capacity for moral and political growth.[107]\\r\\nKal Ashraf wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps in rejecting the critical dualism√øLincoln as individual emancipator pitted against collective self-emancipators√øthere is an opportunity to recognise the greater persuasiveness of the combination. In a sense, yes: a racist, flawed Lincoln did something heroic, and not in lieu of collective participation, but next to, and enabled, by it. To venerate a singular √øGreat Emancipator' may be as reductive as dismissing the significance of Lincoln's actions. Who he was as a man, no one of us can ever really know. So it is that the version of Lincoln we keep is also the version we make.[108]\\r\\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. made many references to the Emancipation Proclamation during the civil rights movement. These include a speech made at an observance of the hundredth anniversary of the issuing of the Proclamation made in New York City on September 12, 1962 where he placed it alongside the Declaration of Independence as an \\"imperishable\\" contribution to civilization, and \\"All tyrants, past, present and future, are powerless to bury the truths in these declarations\\". He lamented that despite a history where the United States \\"proudly professed the basic principles inherent in both documents\\", it \\"sadly practiced the antithesis of these principles\\". He concluded \\"There is but one way to commemorate the Emancipation Proclamation. That is to make its declarations of freedom real; to reach back to the origins of our nation when our message of equality electrified an unfree world, and reaffirm democracy by deeds as bold and daring as the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation.\\"[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nKing's most famous invocation of the Emancipation Proclamation was in a speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom (often referred to as the \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech). King began the speech saying \\"Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity. But one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.\\"[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1960s, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his associates developed a strategy to call on President John F. Kennedy to bypass a Southern segregationist opposition in the Congress by issuing an executive order to put an end to segregation. This envisioned document was referred to as the \\"Second Emancipation Proclamation\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 11, 1963, President Kennedy appeared on national television to address the issue of civil rights. Kennedy, who had been routinely criticized as timid by some of the leaders of the civil rights movement, told Americans that two black students had been peacefully enrolled in the University of Alabama with the aid of the National Guard despite the opposition of Governor George Wallace.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Kennedy called it a \\"moral issue\\"[111] Invoking the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation he said \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the same speech, Kennedy announced he would introduce comprehensive civil rights legislation to the United States Congress which he did a week later (he continued to push for its passage until his assassination in November 1963). Historian Peniel E. Joseph holds Lyndon Johnson's ability to get that bill, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, passed on July 2, 1964 was aided by \\"the moral forcefulness of the June 11 speech\\" which turned \\"the narrative of civil rights from a regional issue into a national story promoting racial equality and democratic renewal\\".[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the civil rights movement of the 1960s, Lyndon B. Johnson invoked the Emancipation Proclamation holding it up as a promise yet to be fully implemented.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Vice President while speaking from Gettysburg on May 30, 1963 (Memorial Day), at the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation, Johnson connected it directly with the ongoing civil rights struggles of the time saying \\"One hundred years ago, the slave was freed. One hundred years later, the Negro remains in bondage to the color of his skin.... In this hour, it is not our respective races which are at stakeit is our nation. Let those who care for their country come forward, North and South, white and Negro, to lead the way through this moment of challenge and decision.... Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with color of men's skins, emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact. To the extent that the proclamation of emancipation is not fulfilled in fact, to that extent we shall have fallen short of assuring freedom to the free.\\"[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs president, Johnson again invoked the proclamation in a speech presenting the Voting Rights Act at a joint session of Congress on Monday, March 15, 1965. This was one week after violence had been inflicted on peaceful civil rights marchers during the Selma to Montgomery marches. Johnson said \\"... it's not just Negroes, but really it's all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome. As a man whose roots go deeply into Southern soil, I know how agonizing racial feelings are. I know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society. But a century has passedmore than 100 yearssince the Negro was freed. And he is not fully free tonight. It was more than 100 years ago that Abraham Lincolna great President of another partysigned the Emancipation Proclamation. But emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact. A century has passedmore than 100 yearssince equality was promised, and yet the Negro is not equal. A century has passed since the day of promise, and the promise is unkept. The time of justice has now come, and I tell you that I believe sincerely that no force can hold it back. It is right in the eyes of man and God that it should come, and when it does, I think that day will brighten the lives of every American.\\"[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn episode 86 of The Andy Griffith Show, Andy asks Barney to explain the Emancipation Proclamation to Opie who is struggling with history at school.[116] Barney brags about his history expertise, yet it is apparent he cannot answer Andy's question.  He finally becomes frustrated and explains it is a proclamation for certain people who wanted emancipation.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, Chef asks the military commander if he has \\"ever heard of the Emancipation Proclamation?\\" To which the military commander replies: \\"I dont listen to hip-hop.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emancipation Proclamation is celebrated around the world including on stamps of nations such as the Republic of Togo.[118] The United States commemorative was issued on August 16, 1963, the opening day of the Century of Negro Progress Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Designed by Georg Olden, an initial printing of 120 million stamps was authorized.[115]","input":"What states were affected by the emancipation proclamation?"},{"output":"to boil or steam rice","context":"A rice cooker or rice steamer is an automated kitchen appliance designed to boil or steam rice. It consists of a heat source, a cooking bowl, and a thermostat. The thermostat measures the temperature of the cooking bowl and controls the heat. Complex rice cookers may have many more sensors and other components, and may be multipurpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term rice cooker formerly applied to non-automated dedicated rice-cooking utensils, which have an ancient history (a ceramic rice steamer dated to 1250 BC is on display in the British Museum). It now applies mostly to automated cookers. Electric rice cookers were developed in Japan, where they are known as pressure cookers suihanki (?).\\r\\nThe cooking bowl is filled with rice and water. During cooking, the rice/water mixture is heated at full power. The water reaches a temperature of 100?C (212?F); it cannot get hotter than its boiling point (all the energy goes into vapourizing the water). At the end of cooking there will be no free water left; most will have been absorbed by the rice, and some boiled off. As heating continues, the temperature can now rise above boiling point; this makes the thermostat trip. Some cookers switch to low-power \\"warming\\" mode, keeping the rice at a safe temperature of approximately 65?C (150?F); simpler models switch off.\\r\\nThis means that if more water is added, the rice will cook for longer.\\r\\nCooking rice has traditionally required constant attention to ensure the rice was cooked properly, and not burnt. Electric rice cookers automate the process by mechanically or electronically controlling heat and timing, thus freeing up a heating element on the cooking range that had to be otherwise occupied for rice cooking. Although the rice cooker does not necessarily speed up the cooking process, with an electric rice cooker the cook's involvement in cooking rice is reduced to simply measuring the rice, preparing the rice properly and using the correct amount of water. Once the rice cooker is set to cook, the rice will be cooked with no further attention.\\r\\nSome types of rice dishes require special ways of preparation and are not suited to the mode of cooking used by electric/gas rice cookers. These recipes include, e.g., risotto, paella, and stuffed peppers (capsicums). They must be cooked by hand.\\r\\nThe rice is measured and added to the inner bowl or washed in a separate bowl in order to remove loosened starch and residual bran. It is not recommended to wash rice in the inner bowl itself so as to preserve the non-stick surface. Strainers are often used in the washing and draining process. For better texture and taste, some types of rice, e.g., Japanese rice or Calrose rice which is suited for absorption method, require pre-cooking water absorption. The water absorption step typically involves letting the rice stand for at least 5 min after draining water from the washing step and soaking the rice in the measured water for at least 15 min (or some claim[who?] it to be 1 hour) before cooking. The water draining step is colloquially believed to make the water measurement more accurate, if the water is measured and added after the initial water absorption that takes place in the washing step. Some people prefer to achieve the water absorption by simply leaving the rice soaking in the rice cooker overnight before starting cooking in the morning. Some other types of rice, e.g., long-grain rice or scented rice such as jasmine rice, do not require washing or the water absorption step. The water for cooking is added to the inner bowl by using measuring cups or simply filling up to the appropriate graduated mark in the inner bowl. Although cold water is normally added, boiling water is used for cooking sushi rice.\\r\\nDifferent kinds of rice require different amounts of water. Usually, there are graduated marks for the right amount of water only for white rice, but sometimes there are separate scales for brown rice (as more water is required) or for cooking other food in the appliance.\\r\\nOnce the lid is closed and the cooking cycle has been activated, the rice cooker does the rest. Most models give a countdown in minutes to the \\"ready time,\\" or beep when done. After cooking cycle is completed, it is recommended that the rice is to \\"rest\\" for 5 minute for post-absorption and then to be stirred to prevent the grains from clinging to each other too hard. Some rice, e.g., long-grain or scented rice, do not seem to require this post-absorption step.\\r\\nSome higher-end models automatically time the soaking (pre-cooking water absorption) and the resting periods, therefore, there is no need to manually manage the water absorption or time these steps.\\r\\nDepending on quantity, it takes about 20 minutes to 1 hour for most electric rice cookers to complete cooking. Some advanced models can back-calculate the cooking start time from given finish time. The time required for cooking rice depends on the amount of rice, the power of the heating elements, and atmospheric pressure, thus it is not constant. Pressure-cooker models are not influenced by atmospheric pressure. The special features distinguish high-end models from lower-cost, simpler models.\\r\\nAutomatic rice cookers may be either gas or electrical appliances. Most dedicated home rice cookers are of the electric type. In commercial or industrial use, there are many varieties, such as large gas or electric rice cookers, a large-scale rice cooker that is called a \\"rice boiler\\", and fully automatic versions which handle the whole process of rice cooking from washing rice to the end of the cooking cycle.\\r\\nMany modern cookers have a heat-insulating casing and a warming mechanism. When the rice is determined to be fully cooked, the unit will automatically switch to the \\"keep warm\\" cycle, thus preventing the rice from being overcooked and keeping the rice warm until it is ready to be served. The degree of insulation provided by the casing can also be used to keep cold solids cold.\\r\\nFor modern home rice cookers, the smallest single-person model cooks 1 rice cup (180?ml), whereas large models can cook 10 cups. Commercial models can cook 20 or more cups. As a possible source of confusion, model specifications and names may list either cooked or uncooked capacity. Rice roughly doubles in size during cooking; therefore, a 10 cup (uncooked) rice cooker can produce up to 20 cups of cooked rice. The prices vary greatly, depending on the capacity, features, materials used, and the country of origin.\\r\\nThe majority of modern electric rice cookers are equipped with a stay-warm or keep-warm feature, which keeps the rice at an optimal temperature for serving without over-cooking it. Some gas cookers also have electric stay-warm mechanism. However, the usefulness of this feature degrades over time, a microwave may be more energy efficient or better suited to reheat rice that will sit longer than four hours.\\r\\nSome rice cookers use induction heating, with one or more induction heaters directly warming the pot. This can improve energy efficiency.\\r\\nMost modern rice cookers use aluminium for the inner cooking bowl. There are some models that use stainless steel instead of aluminium. Various other materials, such as copper, pure carbon, ceramic, and diamond powder coating, may be used for higher heat conductivity or better taste.\\r\\nThe pressure-cooking models can raise the water's boiling point higher, e.g., from 100?C at 1.0?atm up to about 110?C at 1.4?atm, which speeds cooking. The pressure-cooking models can also be used in high altitude areas, where the boiling temperature is below 100 Celsius. Pressure cookers are also suitable for cooking brown rice (which contains oils and bran fiber that cook differently from pure white rice starch). Some pressure rice cookers have a varying pressure control mechanism (named the \\"dual-pressure\\" method) that creates repeated pressure/release cycles during the cooking.\\r\\nThere also exist mechanisms to collect and return the boiled over liquid to the inner rice bowl.\\r\\nMany cookers now have microprocessor-controlled cooking cycles, which are often used to adjust for rice and cooking type.\\r\\nRice cookers are typically used for the preparation of plain or lightly seasoned rice. Each rice cooker model may be optimized to cook a certain type of rice best. For example, most Japanese rice cookers are optimized for cooking Japanese rice and may not be the best for other types of rice[citation needed], although cooking time can be lengthened simply by more water.\\r\\nThe typical method of cooking long grain rice is boil-and-strain and/or steaming method. The absorption method used in Japanese rice cookers will produce slightly different texture and taste, usually stickier rice.\\r\\nBrown rice generally needs longer cooking times than white rice, unless it is broken or flourblasted (which perforates the bran).[1]\\r\\nDifferent varieties of rice need different cooking times, depending on their grain size, grain shape, and grain composition. There are three main types of Asian rice: Oryza sativa subsp. indica, i.e., Indian rice (long grain rice, e.g., basmati rice and Thai jasmine rice), O. sativa subsp. javanica, i.e., Java rice (large grain rice) and O. sativa subsp. japonica, i.e., Japanese rice (medium grain rice, e.g., Calrose rice, short grain rice, e.g., most Japanese rice and risotto rice).\\r\\nAfrican rice, Oryza glaberrima, is an entirely separate species, but can be cooked in the same way. Zizania is not even in the same genus, although it is often called a rice (or \\"water oats\\"); it too can be cooked in a rice cooker.\\r\\nA rice cooker can be used to cook many boiled or steamed granular foods, such as pot barley, bulgar wheat, and dal. Provided the ingredients have similar cooking times, a rice cooker can cook mixtures such as khichdi. Some rice cookers can be used as automated couscoussiers, cooking couscous and a stew simultaneously.\\r\\nSome rice cookers have settings for congee, a type of rice porridge called okayu in Japanese, juk in Korea, and zhou in Chinese.\\r\\nMany models feature an ability to cook sticky rice or porridge as an added value. Most can be used as steamers. Some can be used as slow cookers. Some other models can bake bread or in some cases have an added function to maintain temperatures suitable for fermentation of bread dough or yogurt.\\r\\nMore elaborate recipes are possible using a rice cooker, and there are cookbooks devoted entirely to dishes prepared using a rice cooker. It is possible to cook soups, stews or sponge cakes in electric rice cookers. By simply adding ingredients and setting it to \\"warm\\", a rice cooker cooks the contents at about 65?C (150?F). In a few hours, the stew is fully cooked and ready to eat.\\r\\nSome rice cookers are designed to accommodate a basket to steam vegetables, dumplings, buns, and so on in the steam coming off the rice. If the rice cooker is not suited for such uses, there is a chance that it will damage the appliance. In particular, it is quite possible that the polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) coating becomes scarred by the rough bottom of ceramic wares placed inside the inner cooking bowl. If such cooking is outside indicated usage of the appliance, it typically invalidates the warranty. In some countries, electric rice cookers, including Japanese models, are regarded as automated universal electric cooking pots, and their use in the preparation of a variety of foods is rather standard.[citation needed]\\r\\nGas rice cookers have a significantly larger capacity than home rice cookers (5 to 10 liters) and are more commonly used for commercial purposes. They must be connected directly to a fuel source (either a natural gas line or a portable propane source) and do not require an electrical power supply.\\r\\nWhen cooking in a commercial setting, where quality, quantity, and speed are important factors, gas powered rice cookers offer several benefits. The gas powered flame source heats the cooking pot much more quickly than electrical power sources. Cooking at higher temperatures allows the rice to absorb water faster and cook more quickly, yielding a sweeter and more firm final product. Due to the amount of rice being cooked at one time, electrical powered cookers are not able to heat the cooking pot fast enough. This usually results in uneven cooking of the overall batch of rice-often leading to mushy or burnt rice on the bottom of the pot and sometimes under-cooked rice at the middle and top of the cooking pot. Finally, being able to heat the cooking pot to a higher temperature relatively quickly allows the rice to cook faster and steam properly, resulting in a better quality batch of rice.\\r\\nMost, if not all, gas rice cookers use an heat based automatic shut-off system. The basic principle of these systems is such that gas flow into the burner is halted once a specific temperature is reached, resulting in the burner flame to go out.\\r\\nA relatively new concept is the commercial gas pressure cooker. These cookers use pressure cooking to produce a uniformly cooked batch of rice. Cooking rice in a pressure cooker allows the rice to cook under more optimal conditions.\\r\\nIdeal cooking for rice employs a method of a fast heating source along with a uniform delivery of that heat. A gas powered pressure cooking system is able to use a flame heat source to heat the cooking vessel quickly and the pressure cooker is able to heat the internal cooking environment to higher than the boiling point of water in a uniform manner.\\r\\n In 1937 the Imperial Japanese Army sanctioned a Type 97 automobile-kitchen equipped with a primitive rice cooker. The rice cooker was a rectangular wooden box with two electrodes attached to opposite ends. To cook the rice, the box was filled with washed rice and water, and then a current was applied. This caused the water to boil. When the rice was cooked, the reduction of the water quantity caused an increase in resistance which reduced the power to a stay-warm state. This method, however, was not suitable for different water qualities or degrees of rice washing and as such varied the amount of heat produced and the end results. It also presented a high risk of electrocution, thus it was not suitable for home cooking.[citation needed]\\r\\n In 1945, the Japanese Mitsubishi Electric Corporation was the first company to produce an electric commercial rice cooker. The Mitsubishi product was an aluminium pot with a heating coil inside. It had no automatic turn-off facility, and it required constant monitoring during cooking.\\r\\nIn the early development phase, electric home rice cookers used the simple concept of heating the rice to cook and turning off the heater when the temperature rose to a certain point. This method, however, is influenced too greatly by variation of room temperature and often produced under-cooked rice. Many makers continued to experience failures in their ongoing trial-and-error approaches. At this stage, there was even a trial model which embedded the heating element in a traditional wooden rice container.\\r\\nThe first practical electric rice cooker was invented by Yoshitada Minami,[2][3] who had an association with Toshiba Electric Corporation. It became possible to cook rice practically by employing the triple-chamber rice cooker (that provided heat insulation by air layers).\\r\\n In December 1956, the Toshiba Corporation placed the first commercially successful automated electric rice cookers on the market.[4] It used a double-chamber indirect rice cooking method. Rice was placed into the rice pot, and water into a surrounding container. When the water in the outer pot boiled off, the temperature of the pot rose rapidly. A bimetallic thermostat then activated, and automatically turned off the cooker to prevent burning of the cooked rice. Soon, Toshiba was producing 200,000 rice cookers per month for the Japanese market. Four years later, rice cookers could be found in half of Japanese homes.\\r\\nThe double-chamber indirect cooking model took more time to complete cooking and also consumed more electricity. This model was gradually phased out in the 1960s, but there are some companies, such as Tatung, that still manufacture them. Today, electric rice cookers utilize an insulated outer container and an inner removable bowl, often coated with a non-stick surface, and stamped with water-level graduations marked in cups of rice used. The rice cup measure is normally based on the traditional Japanese measurement system 1?g (), which has its origin in China (Chinese: ; pinyin: g). One g () is 180?ml, or approximately 25% smaller than the American measuring cup of 8 (US) fluid ounces/240?ml, and is regarded as producing enough cooked rice for a single meal for one person.\\r\\n Initial models did not have a keep-warm feature and the cooked rice cooled down too quickly, thus it was often necessary to move the cooked rice to heat-insulated serving containers. In 1965, Zojirushi Thermos company started selling electric rice cookers with a stay-warm function, using a semi-conductor heat regulator. The product sold 2,000,000 units per year. Other makers soon followed suit. The stay-warm function can typically keep rice warm for up to 24 hours at a temperature high enough to suppress growth of Bacillus cereus, a cause of food poisoning. Another notable improvement was the use of electric timers.\\r\\n In simple models, a mechanical thermostat is used to turn off the cooker when the rice is ready. Since the 1980s, higher-end electric rice cookers have used microprocessors to control the cooking process, often incorporating a memory and electronic timer that can be used to set the desired \\"ready time\\". Since the 1990s, many models allow users to select desired cooking results for rice (e.g., soft, medium, firm, etc.), different types of rice, or ingredients other than rice. Some models can be used as steamers.\\r\\nIn the late 1980s, some higher-end electric rice cookers started using induction heating. This type aims to produce tastier cooked rice by controlling the heating process more precisely. Some other pressure-cooking models use 1.2?atm to 1.7?atm (not over 1.4?atm for home appliances) to raise the cooking temperature over 100?C. Expensive models often provide a steam-heating function.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, China started-mass-producing economical electrical rice cookers with limited functions and exporting them to many countries. Japanese makers have been attempting to compete by seeking a niche in models with added values by increasing the number of features of their products.\\r\\n In the 2000s, more deluxe models appeared on the market and attracted much attention. These models are characterized by non-metallic materials for inner cooking bowls to employ thermal far-infrared radiation in order to improve the taste of cooked rice. In 2006 Japanese Mitsubishi Electric corporation produced an expensive cooker which used an inner cooking bowl called honsumigama (t) made of hand-carved pure carbon, with a better heat-generating profile with induction cooking. Despite the high price (115,500, about US$1,400 at the time), it sold 10,000 units within six months after it was introduced.[citation needed] It was a huge success and it set the trend of extremely high-end models in the market. There is also a product which uses pottery, e.g., Arita-yaki, for the inner cooking bowl. There have been pottery-based electric cooking appliances in China since the 1980s, and in recent years rice cookers have been also produced. Some other materials used for luxurious rice bowls are pure copper, ceramic-iron layers, and diamond coating. These rice cooker makers research what the best cooked rice means (in taste and texture) and attempt to realize \\"the best cooked rice\\" in electric rice cookers by using various inventions. Most regard rice cooked either in a traditional rice cooker used in hearth or in a gas pressure cooker as references, and attempt to achieve or exceed the same.\\r\\nRestaurants that serve a lot of rice, particularly those specializing in Asian cuisine, often use industrial-sized rice cookers (often they are gas pressure cookers, but there are electric models) that quickly and cheaply produce large quantities of cooked rice. A rice cooker is a standard appliance in kitchens in many Asian countries and households.\\r\\nThere were approximately 85 million rice cookers made in 2005. Most of the rice cookers were made in China, South Korea and Japan, with 70% of the production in China. Most of Chinese production was from Zhanjiang City and Lianjiang City in Guangdong Province.[citation needed]\\r\\nSince the 1980s, electric rice cookers were manufactured in China and Korea, who focused on simple feature models because of the market trend which regarded the price competition to be more important than rich features.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome visitors to Japan desired to buy Japanese domestic models as souvenirs, due to their ability to produce better tasting cooked rice and the multiple features. Since the Japanese domestic models use 100 volts only, they cannot be used in most other countries without adapters and power converters. In Akihabara Electric Town, various models that are modified to be able to operate under 110?V/220?V-240?V are sold in boxes that are labeled with English. A few rice cooker makers produce export models for use abroad.[citation needed]","input":"What is the point of a rice cooker?"},{"output":"17,000","context":"The military history of Australia during the Korean War was very eventful. Japan's defeat in World War II heralded the end to 35 years of Japanese occupation of the Korean Peninsula. The surrender of Japan to the Allied forces on 2 September 1945 led to the peninsula being subsequently divided into North and South Koreas, with the North being occupied by troops from the Soviet Union, and the South, below the 38th parallel, being occupied by troops from the United States.\\r\\nThe Soviet forces entered the Korean peninsula on 10 August 1945, followed a few weeks later by the American forces who entered through Incheon.

Hodge formally accepted the surrender of Japanese forces south of the 38th Parallel on 9 September 1945 at the Government House in Seoul.[1]\\r\\nAlthough both rival factions tried initially to diplomatically reunite the divided nation, it was the Northern faction that eventually decided to try and do so with military force. Troops from the Soviet backed North Korean Army crossed the 38th parallel on 25 June 1950 beginning a civil war.\\r\\nThe invasion of South Korea came as a surprise to the United Nations. The same day the war had officially begun (25 June), the United Nations immediately drafted UNSC Resolution 82, which called for:[2]\\r\\nThe Liberal government of Australia, led by Prime Minister Robert Menzies, immediately responded to the UN resolution by offering military assistance. 17,000 Australians served in the Korean War between 1950 and 1953, and they suffered 339 dead, and 1200 wounded.[3]\\r\\nWith the commitment of Australian forces to the Korean War, the Australian government called for 1000 men who had prior military experience in World War II [4] to enlist in the army for three years, with one year of overseas service in Korea. They were called Korean Force or K-Force.[5] A portion of the force were recruited in Great Britain.[6] At the end of their enlistment, personnel recruited from the United Kingdom could elect to be discharged in Australia, or returned to the UK.[7] Their previous military experience would facilitate rapid deployment to Korea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the North Korean Army crossed into South Korea on 25 June 1950, they advanced for the capital Seoul, which fell in less than a week.\\r\\nNorth Korea's forces continued toward the port of Pusan, a strategic goal. In two days, the United States offered assistance and the United Nations Security Council asked its members to help repel the North Korean attack. Australia immediately contributed No. 77 Squadron RAAF and the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), both of which were stationed in Japan under the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF).\\r\\nNo. 77 Squadron converted to P-51D Mustang fighters before arriving in Japan in February 1946 to participate in the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. Occupation duties proved uneventful, and No. 77 Squadron was preparing to leave Japan for Australia when the Korean War broke out in June 1950. 77 Sqn was immediately dispatched to Korea, where they became the first UN air unit to enter the war, primarily in ground support, combat air patrol, and escort missions.\\r\\n3 RAR was rapidly committed as Australia's main land force contribution to the United Nations forces in the Korean War. After a period of intensive training and reinforcement in Japan, the battalion arrived in South Korea in late September 1950.\\r\\nThe battalion formed part of the 27th Commonwealth Brigade and took part in the United Nations offensive into North Korea and the subsequent retreat into South Korea following the Chinese offensive in the winter of 1950√ø51. It was one of three units to receive the Presidential Unit Citation (US) after the Battle of Kapyong.\\r\\nIn addition to combat personnel, the Australian military provided the majority of supply and support personnel to BCOF, which was superseded in 1952 by British Commonwealth Forces Korea (BCFK). Australian, British, Canadian, Indian and New Zealand units were part of BCFK.\\r\\nBy the time 3 RAR arrived in Pusan on 28 September, the North Korean army was in retreat. As a part of the invasion force under the UN Supreme Commander, General Douglas MacArthur, 3 RAR moved north and was involved in its first major action near Pyongyang.\\r\\nBy 21 October, the United States 24th Infantry Division, with the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade leading, crossed the Taedong River at Pyongyang and headed north. The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders were in the van, and by nightfall the Brigade halted on the outskirts of Yongyu, 21 miles (34?km) north of Pyongyang. A patrol from the Argylls entered the town and made contact with elements of the U.S. 3rd Battalion, 187th Regimental Combat Team.\\r\\n239 North Koreans' midnight attack on Yongyu came from the general direction of the road running southwest of the town. The Argylls met the fringe of the attack and beat it off. The attack on 3/187 RCT was stronger, and the North Koreans succeeded in entering the town before breaking off and moving away at 03:00.\\r\\nNext day the Australians of 3 RAR were to take the lead in the advance, and C Company was to be the leading company. The orders given in the early evening stressed the urgency to link up with the U.S. Airborne. The company was not to be distracted at Yongyu, they were to press as quickly as possible as the Argylls continued to clear the town. The noises of the Airborne battles to the north were very close and could be heard clearly throughout the night.\\r\\nC Company 3RAR was the only company to remain largely intact as the battalion hastily absorbed reinforcements from the rest of the regiment and K Force and came to strength. This, the newest 3 RAR company had been formed in late 1949 and early 1950 from the young men who joined the Regular Army after World War II. By the standards of the other companies C Company was very young and untested. Much of the banter within the battalion was directed at them. Good humoured as it was, when it continued once the battalion commenced operations the young regulars became all the more determined to show their mettle. C Company was a well trained sub unit and, unlike the other sub units still shaking down, was a cohesive team.\\r\\nThe Non-Commissioned Officers and senior soldiers were experienced, competent leaders who had raised and trained the Company. As an unexpected luxury, a handful of K Force reinforcements joined the C Company during the advance and took it over strength; a state never to be attained again by any unit in the campaign. The platoon commanders were young and inexperienced, all from the 1948 graduating class from Royal Military College, Duntroon, the Company Commander, who arrived only weeks before the battalion sailed, was an experienced battle leader.\\r\\nAt 07:00 on 22 October 1950, C Company 3RAR advanced with 7 Platoon leading mounted on tanks of D Company, U.S. 89th Tank Battalion followed by the rest of the company in U.S. troop carrying vehicles. At 09:00 and a mile north of Yongyu, C Company came under fire from the apple orchard on the slopes of Hill 163 in YD 2354 (map grid location). It became apparent that C Company had driven into the North Koreans who were in the process of forming up to attack the Americans. At 09:30, 7 and 8 Platoons attacked the high ground east of the road, with 9 Platoon in reserve holding the road and northern flank.\\r\\nThe attacking platoons went in hard, uphill through the apple trees. Although outnumbered, the Australians pressed their attack fiercely. The platoons pushed on and in a stride were through to the vital ground. Even a bunker which threatened 8 Platoon provided only a momentary delay as the young men grenaded it and pressed forward. C Company's sudden arrival, even though it must have been expected to some extent, and the speed with which the North Korean outposts were brushed aside, had completely surprised the enemy. They were caught with all their attention directed north to a final frenzied effort to break out past the American forces. Thereafter the North Koreans were incapable of presenting organised resistance to the vigorous thrust from the south.\\r\\nThe Australians reported approximately 150 enemy had been killed, 239 wounded and 200 captured as a result of its action at a cost of seven wounded. The operations in Sunchon had achieved much more. The American 187 RCT claimed, 3818 North Korean prisoners, 805 enemy killed and 681 wounded for the loss of 46 jump casualties and 65 battle casualties. Despite heavy casualties several hundred North Koreans remained in and around the battlefield. However, with the link up complete, re-deployment for the continuation of the advance commenced. Within the British Commonwealth Brigade, 1st Battalion of the British Middlesex Regiment passed through and assumed the lead in the drive towards the Yalu River. The Americans reassembled and drove north to rejoin their regiment which returned to Pyongyang by the other route.\\r\\nWith the United Nations success at Inchon, they began to advance against the North Korean Army. Lacking the logistical support, and the naval and air superiority of the UN forces the North Koreans were pushed back beyond the 38th parallel, and despite having achieved their goal of saving the South Korean government, the UN forces continued the pursuit into North Korean territory. The American government had decided to adopt a policy of not just containment of the perceived communist threat, but the overall goal of the destruction of the communist regime.\\r\\nThe UN forces crossed into North Korea in early October 1950. The U.S. X Corps made amphibious landings at Wonsan and Riwon, which had already been captured by South Korean forces advancing by land. The rest of the U.S. Army, along with the South Koreans, and supported by the Commonwealth forces including 3RAR, drove up the western side of Korea and captured Pyongyang on 19 October 1950. By the end of October, the North Korean Army was rapidly disintegrating, and the UN had taken 135,000 prisoners.\\r\\nThe UN offensive greatly concerned the Chinese, who worried that the UN forces would not stop at the Yalu River, the border between North Korea and China, and extend their rollback policy into China. Many in the West, including General MacArthur, thought that spreading the war to China would be necessary and that since North Korean troops were being supplied by bases in China, those supply depots should be bombed. However, Truman and the other leaders disagreed, and MacArthur was ordered to be very cautious when approaching the Chinese border. Except on some rare occasions, UN bombers remained out of Manchuria during the war.\\r\\nChina warned American leaders through neutral diplomats that it would intervene to protect its national security, however the American hierarchy felt these to be empty threats.\\r\\nDespite this, on 8 October 1950, the day after American troops crossed the 38th parallel, Chairman Mao Zedong ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to be reorganised into the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.[8] Mao ordered the army to move to the Yalu River, ready to cross. Mao sought Soviet aid and saw intervention as essentially defensive: If we allow the U.S. to occupy all of Korea... we must be prepared for the U.S. to declare... war with China, he told Joseph Stalin. Premier Zhou Enlai was sent to Moscow to add force to Maos cabled arguments. Mao delayed while waiting for substantial Soviet help, postponing the planned attack from 13 October to 19 October. However, Soviet assistance was limited to providing air support no nearer than 60 miles (97?km) from the battlefront. The Chinese were angered by the Soviets not offering more support, but Soviet MiG-15s provided many problems for UN forces. The Soviet role was known to the U.S., but it was kept quiet so as to avoid the possibility of escalating the conflict into nuclear war.\\r\\nThe Chinese made contact with American troops on 25 October 1950, with 270,000 PVA troops under the command of General Peng Dehuai, much to the surprise of the UN, which had disregarded evidence of such a massive force.\\r\\nAfter the Chinese government moved 18 divisions into North Korea, the UN forces were defeated at Chosin Reservoir and withdrew their forces, but by 1 November, they had been forced to retreat back to the 38th parallel. The Chinese pressed their offensive, but stalwart defending and the harsh winter stalled their thrust. The Chinese offensive was halted in January 1951.\\r\\nThe Chinese began a new Spring Offensive in April 1951 as the weather improved, also referred to as the Fifth Phase Offensive, with the intention of recapturing Seoul. The Chinese launched a major assault between 22 and 25 April that resulted in a victory in the Battle of the Imjin River. At the same time, the UN repelled Chinese forces at Kapyong.\\r\\nChinese forces of the 118th Division attacked the Kapyong Valley in force, and pushed South Korean and New Zealand troops into retreat. Under heavy pressure, the Korean 6th Division broke, and the line collapsed. American and South Korean men poured through a gap under protective covering fire from Australians who were holding their section of the line despite heavy pressure.\\r\\nAustralian troops from 3 RAR, and Canadian troops from Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry were ordered to halt this Chinese advance. The mission of the men of the 27th Commonwealth Brigade was to block the two approaches to Kapyong. In only a few hours, they managed to prepare defensive positions.\\r\\nThe Chinese 118th Division engaged their two forward battalions on 23 April. In the early part of the battle the 1st Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment and the 16th Field Regiment of the Royal New Zealand Artillery were all but cut off. The resistance of forward positions, held by the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), and 3RAR, permitted the 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment to withdraw. It moved into place to provide a reserve.\\r\\nThe initial Chinese attack at Kapyong engaged 3 RAR on Hill 504. The Chinese then struck at the Canadian front. Wave after wave of massed Chinese troops kept up the attack throughout the night of 23 April. After a night of fierce fighting Major Bernard O'Dowd, Officer Commanding, A Company, 3 RAR, managed to get through on a radio phone to a general of the 1st U.S. Marine Division. The general was incredulous, thinking it was an enemy agent speaking. He told O'Dowd that the unit no longer existed, that it had been wiped out the night before.[9]\\r\\nThe Chinese had managed to infiltrate the brigade position by the morning of 23 April. The Australians and Canadians were facing the whole of the Chinese 118th Division. Throughout 24 April the battle was unrelenting. It devolved, on both fronts, into hand-to-hand combat with bayonet charges. The Australians, facing encirclement, were ordered to make an orderly fall back to new defensive positions late in the day of 24 April.\\r\\n2 PPCLI was completely surrounded. Captain Mills, in command of D Company, 2 PPCLI, was forced to call down artillery fire on his own positions on Hill 677 several times during the early morning hours of 25 April to avoid being overrun. It had to be resupplied by air drops during this desperate time.[10] By dawn the Chinese attack on the Canadian position had abated, and in the afternoon of 25 April the road through to the Canadians had been cleared of Chinese, at which time the 2nd Battalion was relieved.\\r\\nThe 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery, also managed to withdraw and link up with the U.S. Army's 72nd Heavy Tank Battalion. These units provided close heavy gun support.\\r\\nAlso, during the withdrawal of the Australians, 4 men from B Company, 3RAR, formed a rearguard to hold off any flanking attacks. The four Australians held off three waves of Chinese soldiers, killing at least 25 and wounding many more. After two days and two nights of fighting, the Australians had recaptured their positions, at the cost of 32 men killed and 53 wounded. For this contribution of stalling the Chinese advance, 3 RAR received a United States Distinguished Unit Citation.\\r\\nDespite their enormous advantage in numbers the Chinese troops had been badly outgunned. Their courage and tenacity could not overcome the well-trained, well-disciplined and well-armed Australians and Canadians.[9] The battlefield was littered with the corpses of Chinese soldiers, a testament to the discipline and firepower of the defenders.\\r\\nFor their brilliant conduct of this engagement, Lieutenant-Colonel Bruce Ferguson of Australia, and Lieutenant-Colonel James R. Stone of Canada were each awarded the Distinguished Service Order.[11][12] For Stone, it was the second bar to the DSO he had first won during Operation Olive in Italy in 1944.[13][14]\\r\\nThe second major battle the Australians fought in 1951 was Operation Commando. Operation Commando was the last major UN offensive thrust of the Korean War. It was an attack on a Chinese salient in a bend of the Imjin River, designed to prevent the Communist forces from interdicting the UN supply lines near Seoul.\\r\\nBy July 1951, 3RAR had come under the control of the 1st Commonwealth Division. Objectives of the 1st Commonwealth Division during Operation Commando, including the Australians, were Hill 355 and Hill 317.\\r\\nThe attack began on 3 October 1951 with the U.S. I Corps (including four U.S. Divisions, the 1st Commonwealth Division and the 1st South Korean Division) seized the Jamestown Line destroying elements of the 42nd Army, 47th Army, 64th Army and 65th Army, and after five days of intense combat, eventually forcing the Chinese into retreat. The operation was a success, and ended on 15 October, with a few hills south of the line still in Communist hands, requiring a follow-up operation (Operation Polecharge).\\r\\nThe official historian for the Korean War, Robert ONeill, wrote of this battle: \\"In this action 3RAR had won one of the most impressive victories achieved by any Australian battalion. In five days of heavy fighting 3RAR dislodged a numerically superior enemy from a position of great strength. The Australians were successful in achieving surprise on 3 and 5 October, the company and platoon showed high courage, tenacity and morale despite some very difficult situations, such as that of D company when the mist rose on 5 October and those of B and C Companies when the weight of enemy fire threatened their isolation of Hill 317 on 7 October ... The victory of Maryang San is probably the greatest single feat of the Australian Army during the Korean War\\".\\r\\nAustralian casualties during Operation Commando were 20 dead and 89 wounded.\\r\\nAfter 1951, both sides were in a type of combat comparable to the Western Front in World War I in which men lived in tunnels, redoubts, and sandbagged forts behind barbed wire defences. From 1951 to the end of the war, 3 RAR held trenches on the eastern side of the Commonwealth Division's positions in the hills northeast of the Imjin River. Across from them were heavily fortified Chinese positions.\\r\\nAs the war continued, several other nations grew less willing to contribute more ground troops. Australia, however, increased its troop strength in Korea,[15] by sending 1 RAR. This battalion arrived in Korea on 6 April 1952 and experienced its first major combat during Operation Blaze on 2 July.[16] In March 1953, they were replaced by 2 RAR.[17]\\r\\nRoyal Australian Navy vessels had been stationed in Japan following the Japanese surrender ending World War II. Following North Korea's invasion of the South, RAN vessels stationed in Japan were put on immediate alert.\\r\\nOn 29 June Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced that the frigate HMAS Shoalhaven, stationed in Japan, and the destroyer HMAS Bataan, in Hong Kong would be placed under UN command in Korea. On 1 July, one day after President Truman committed American ground forces to Korea, the first Australian operation in Korea took place; HMAS Shoalhaven moved from Japan to Pusan escorting an American ammunition ship. On 27 July 1950, the destroyer HMAS Warramunga was also deployed.\\r\\nDuring the Landing at Wonsan in October 1950, HMAS Warramunga provided gunfire support during the landing of U.S. X Corps. During the mass evacuation of troops and refugees in the city of Hungnam in December 1950, HMA Ships Bataan and Warramunga assisted in the evacuation. In October 1951, Sydney arrived in Korean waters to replace HMS?Glory for a three-month tour. Sydney carried two squadrons of Sea Furies √ø 805 Squadron RAN and 808 Squadron RAN, and 817 Squadron RAN equipped with Fireflies. Sydney returned to Japan having lost only 9 aircraft, with 3 pilots killed, and having launched over 2,700 missions from her flight deck. Later in the war, 9 ships of the RAN participated in the naval blockade of North Korea.[18]\\r\\nThe Royal Australian Air Force was heavily involved in the Pacific War during World War II. Following the Japanese surrender, No. 77 Squadron was selected as part of Australia's contribution to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force and, after converting to P-51D Mustang fighters, arrived in Japan in February 1946. Occupation duties proved uneventful, and No. 77 Squadron was preparing to leave Japan for Australia when the Korean War broke out in June 1950.\\r\\nNo. 77 Squadron was committed to action over Korea as part of the United Nations forces, and flew its first ground attack sorties on 2 July 1950, making it the first UN unit to see action.\\r\\nNo. 30 Communications Flight, No. 491 (Maintenance) Squadron, and No. 391 (Base) Squadron were attached to the United Nations Command in Korea and grouped into No. 91 (Composite) Wing in October 1950. No. 91 Wing was based in Iwakuni, Japan.\\r\\nNo. 77 Squadron fully deployed to Korea in October to support the UN advance into North Korea but was withdrawn to Pusan in November in response to the Communist forces' counter-attack.\\r\\nThe Squadron was withdrawn to Japan in April 1951 to re-equip with Gloster Meteor jet fighters and returned to action with these new aircraft in July, where they met with greater success against the Soviet MiG pilots. However, the MiGs were still far superior to the Meteor.\\r\\nFollowing heavy losses from MiG-15 fighters, No. 77 Squadron operated in the ground attack role from December 1951 until the end of the war; it remained in South Korea on garrison duties until returning to Australia in November 1954.\\r\\nThe Battle of Sunchon was an air battle fought near the city of Sunchon on 1 December 1951, 12 Gloster Meteor jets of the RAAF's No. 77 Squadron were attacked by 40√ø50 Chinese MiG-15s. Despite their Meteors having inferior manoeuvrability to the Soviet-built MiGs, the Australian pilots managed to score their first victories of the Korean War, for the loss of three aircraft. Accounts vary, with the Australians claiming at least 10 MiGs shot down, but Chinese and North Korean sources stated it was only one.\\r\\nOn 29 November 1952, U.S. President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower fulfilled a campaign promise by going to Korea to find out what could be done to end the conflict. With the UN's acceptance of Indias proposal for a Korean armistice, a cease-fire was established on 27 July 1953, by which time the front line was back around the proximity of the 38th parallel, and so a demilitarised zone (DMZ) was established around it, presently defended by North Korean troops on one side and by South Korean, American and UN troops on the other. The DMZ runs north of the parallel towards the east, and to the south as it travels west. The site of the peace talks, Kaesong, the old capital of Korea, was part of the South before hostilities broke out but is currently a special city of the North. North Korea and the United States signed the Armistice Agreement, with Syngman Rhee refusing to sign.[19]\\r\\nAfter the war ended, Australians remained in Korea for four years as military observers. Australia gained political and security benefits, the most important being the signing of the ANZUS Treaty with the United States and New Zealand.[20]\\r\\nAfter two years and 17 days of fighting the UN and North Korea had finally negotiated an agreement to suspend hostilities on 27 July 1953. Out of 17,000 Australians who served in Korea, casualties numbered more than 1,500, of whom 339 were killed.","input":"How many troops did australia send to korea?"},{"output":"Bromochlorofluorocarbon","context":"A refrigerant is a substance or mixture, usually a fluid, used in a heat pump and refrigeration cycle. In most cycles it undergoes phase transitions from a liquid to a gas and back again. Many working fluids have been used for such purposes. Fluorocarbons, especially chlorofluorocarbons, became commonplace in the 20th century, but they are being phased out because of their ozone depletion effects. Other common refrigerants used in various applications are ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and non-halogenated hydrocarbons such as propane.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ideal refrigerant would have favorable thermodynamic properties, be noncorrosive to mechanical components, and be safe, including freedom from toxicity and flammability. It would not cause ozone depletion or climate change. Since different fluids have the desired traits in different degree, choice is a matter of trade-offs.\\r\\nThe desired thermodynamic properties are a boiling point somewhat below the target temperature, a high heat of vaporization, a moderate density in liquid form, a relatively high density in gaseous form, and a high critical temperature. Since boiling point and gas density are affected by pressure, refrigerants may be made more suitable for a particular application by appropriate choice of operating pressures.\\r\\nThe inert nature of many halons, chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), particularly CFC-11 and CFC-12, made them preferred choices among refrigerants for many years because of their nonflammability and nontoxicity. However, their stability in the atmosphere and their corresponding global warming potential and ozone depletion potential raised concerns about their usage. This led to their replacement with HFCs and PFCs, especially HFC-134a, which are not-ozone depleting, and have lesser global warming potentials. However, these refrigerants still have global warming potentials thousands of times greater than CO2. Therefore, they are now being replaced in markets where leaks are likely, by using a third generation of refrigerants, most prominently HFO-1234yf, which have global warming potentials much closer to that of CO2.\\r\\nSome other refrigerants such as propane and ammonia are not inert, and are flammable or toxic if released.\\r\\nIn order from the highest to the lowest potential of ozone depletion are: Bromochlorofluorocarbon, CFC then HCFC.\\r\\nNew refrigerants were developed in the early 21st century that are safer for the environment, but their application has been held up due to concerns over toxicity and flammability.[2]\\r\\nEarly mechanical refrigeration systems employed sulfur dioxide, methyl chloride and ammonia. Being toxic, sulfur dioxide and methyl chloride rapidly disappeared from the market with the introduction of CFCs. Occasionally, one may encounter older machines with methyl formate, chloromethane, or dichloromethane (called carrene in the trade).\\r\\nChlorofluorocarbons were little used for refrigeration until better synthesis methods, developed in the 1950s, reduced their cost. Their domination of the market was called into question in the 1980s by concerns about depletion of the ozone layer.\\r\\nFollowing legislative regulations on ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), substances used as substitute refrigerants such as perfluorocarbons (FCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have also come under criticism. They are currently subject to prohibition discussions on account of their harmful effect on the climate. In 1997, FCs and HFCs were included in the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate Change. In 2006, the EU adopted a Regulation on fluorinated greenhouse gases, which makes stipulations regarding the use of FCs and HFCs with the intention of reducing their emissions. The provisions do not affect climate-neutral refrigerants.\\r\\nRefrigerants such as ammonia (R717), carbon dioxide and non-halogenated hydrocarbons do not deplete the ozone layer and have no (ammonia) or only a low (carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons) global warming potential.[citation needed] They are used in air-conditioning systems for buildings, in sport and leisure facilities, in the chemical/pharmaceutical industry, in the automotive industry and above all in the food industry (production, storage, marine shipping, retailing). In these settings their toxicity is less a concern than in home equipment.\\r\\nEmissions from automobile air conditioning are a growing concern because of their impact on climate change.[citation needed] From 2011 on, the European Union will phase out refrigerants with a global warming potential (GWP) of more than 150 in automotive air conditioning (GWP = 100 year warming potential of one kilogram of a gas relative to one kilogram of CO2).[citation needed] This will ban potent greenhouse gases such as the refrigerant HFC-134a (also known as R-134a in North America) which has a GWP of 1410to promote safe and energy-efficient refrigerants.\\r\\nOne of the most promising alternatives is CO2 (R-744). Carbon dioxide is non-flammable, non-ozone depleting, has a global warming potential of 1. R-744 can be used as a working fluid in climate control systems for cars, residential air conditioning, hot water pumps, commercial refrigeration, and vending machines.[citation needed] R12 is compatible with mineral oil, while R134a is compatible with synthetic oil that contains esters.[citation needed] GM announced that it would start using \\"hydrofluoroolefin\\", HFO-1234yf, in all of its brands by 2013.[3] Dimethyl ether (DME) is also gaining popularity as a refrigerant,[4] but like propane, it is also dangerously flammable.\\r\\nSome refrigerants are seeing rising use as recreational drugs, leading to an extremely dangerous phenomenon known as inhalant abuse.[5]\\r\\nUnder Section 608 of the United States' Clean Air Act it is illegal to knowingly release refrigerants into the atmosphere.[EPA 1]\\r\\nWhen refrigerants are removed they should be recycled to clean out any contaminants and return them to a usable condition. Refrigerants should never be mixed together outside of facilities licensed to do so for the purpose of producing blends. Some refrigerants must be managed as hazardous waste even if recycled, and special precautions are required for their transport, depending on the legislation of the country's government.\\r\\nVarious refrigerant reclamation methods are in use to recover refrigerants for reuse.[6]\\r\\nRefrigerants may be divided into three classes according to their manner of absorption or extraction of heat from the substances to be refrigerated:[citation needed]\\r\\nThe R-# numbering system was developed by DuPont corporation (which owns the Freon trademark), and systematically identifies the molecular structure of refrigerants made with a single halogenated hydrocarbon. The meaning of the codes is as follows:[citation needed]\\r\\nFor example, R-134a has 2 carbon atoms, 2 hydrogen atoms, and 4 fluorine atoms, an empirical formula of tetrafluoroethane. The \\"a\\" suffix indicates that the isomer is unbalanced by one atom, giving 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane. R-134 (without the \\"a\\" suffix) would have a molecular structure of 1,1,2,2-Tetrafluoroethanea compound not especially effective as a refrigerant.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe same numbers are used with an R- prefix for generic refrigerants, with a \\"Propellant\\" prefix (e.g., \\"Propellant 12\\") for the same chemical used as a propellant for an aerosol spray, and with trade names for the compounds, such as \\"Freon 12\\". Recently, a practice of using abbreviations HFC- for hydrofluorocarbons, CFC- for chlorofluorocarbons, and HCFC- for hydrochlorofluorocarbons has arisen, because of the regulatory differences among these groups.[citation needed]\\r\\nBelow are some notable blended HFC mixtures. There exist many more (see list of refrigerants). All R-400 (R-4xx) and R-500 (R-5xx) hydroflurocarbons are blends, as noted above.\\r\\nAir is so frequently used as a coolant that air cooling is seldom mentioned in a refrigeration context. Due to the low boiling point of its constituents and low heat-carrying capacity, air is infrequently used as a refrigerant.\\r\\nAir has been used for residential,[18] automobile, and turbine-powered aircraft[19][20] air-conditioning and/or cooling. The reason why air is not more widely used as a general-purpose refrigerant is because there is no change of phase, and is therefore too inefficient to be practical in most applications.[18] It has been suggested that with suitable compression and expansion technology, air can be a practical (albeit not the most efficient) refrigerant, free of the possibility of environmental contamination or damage,[18] and almost completely[21] harmless to plants and animals.\\r\\nHowever, an explosion could result from vapors or atomized refrigerant-type compressor lubricating oils being compressed together with air, in a process similar to a diesel engine.\\r\\nWaternatural, non toxic, low cost, environmentally friendly, and widely availableis widely used in water cooling, and if evaporated in the process may be called a \\"refrigerant\\". Water also commonly serves as a heat transfer and storage material ,and in large systems it may actually fill all of these roles.\\r\\nThe simplest and lowest cost open-cycle cooling systems, known as swamp coolers in the south-west United States, do not even need power for a compressor, merely a blower fan, so humidified cooled air is simply vented into the living space. Portable free-standing units can be obtained at discount stores for less than $200. However, if these systems are improperly implemented the drawbacks are multiple and severe.\\r\\nThe total cooling power of the unit is limited by the fact that neither coolant nor air can be recirculated. If the cooling unit does not have a supply of fresh dry air and the waste air is not effectively vented, stagnant humid air will make the space more uncomfortable than if it were merely ventilated.\\r\\nAn additional limitation of such systems would be that if the air outside is already humid, cooling power is severely limited. This is why such units are not found in areas of frequent and high humidity, such as the south-east United States.\\r\\nIf the temperature outside is severely hot, above 110?F (43?C), the simple unit will not cool the air sufficiently for comfort even if the dew point outside is very low. In these instances more-complex systems such as two stage, indirect-direct or hybrid will be needed.\\r\\nWhile all the drawbacks can be addressed in various ways, the complexity and initial cost of these systems increases to the point that the installation cost comes into competition with common refrigerant based direct cooling systems. At this price point, direct cooling systems are often chosen even though the long term energy cost of evaporative systems may be lower.","input":"Which type of refrigerant is the most harmful?"},{"output":"Maharashtra","context":"The Lokayukta (also Lok Ayukta) (Sanskrit: ????????? lokyukta, \\"appointed by the people\\")  is an anti-corruption ombudsman organization in the Indian states.[1][2] Once appointed, Lokayukta can not be dismissed nor transferred by the government, and can only be removed by passing an impeachment motion by the state assembly.[3]\\r\\nNaresh Kadyan moved public interest litigation before High Court and then contempt of court order petition for not appointment of Lokayukta in Haryana.\\r\\nThe Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) headed by Morarji Desai submitted a special interim report on \\"Problems of Redressal of Citizen's Grievances\\" in 1966.

It has assumed alarming proportions resultantly public funds going into private hands leading to enrichment of bribe givers and bribe takers. Ultimate result is, as said by former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, only 15 paisa; out of rupee reach the lowest level of population. Corruption, inefficiency, delays and insensitivity to peoples grievances can be identified key problems besetting the nation. Citizens bitterly feel the distance that separates them from the decision makers. This distance, makes them feel abandoned or even rejected and they eventually lose interest in public matters and become marginalized. Corruption does not mean only taking bribe. It is used in a much larger sense, Conduct, which is morally unsound and debased. It includes conduct which is blame-worthy or improper (See Dr. S. Dutt Vs State of UP AIR 1966 SC 523), B. Gupta Vs The King ILR (1949) 2 CAL 440). Corruption and mal-administration are like twin sisters each acts in complement to the other. Corruption has ruined Empires. After completion of his book, The Decline of Rome Empire Edward Gibbon, the Great Historian, Writer and Philosopher was asked to reply in one word the reason for the decline Roman Empire, he remarked Corruption. Corruption in a civilized society, is described disease like cancer.&rdquo, which if not detected in time is sure to malignise the polity of a country leading to disastrous consequences. Pylee points out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Corruption at the bureaucratic level operated like a subterranean monster, aiding, abetting and colluding with the political bosses. Service to the public has long given way to careerism with a work culture of 19th century aristocracy dealing with the citizens as subjects. Burke cautioned, Among people, generally corrupt, liberty cannot last long\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nSupreme Court also said that corruption in a civilized society is a disease like cancer and if not detected in time, will malignise the polity of the country leading to disastrous consequence. It is like plague, it is contagious and if not controlled, spreads like a fire in a jungle. Its virus is compared with HIV leading to AIDS, being incurable (See State of MP & Others Vs Ram Singh (2000) 5 SCC 88, and State of Andhra Pradesh Vs V. Vasudeva Rao 2003 (9) Scale 569). Corruption in public life is a gross violation of human rights. It is anti-people, anti-development, and anti-national. Rampant corruption is major national malady. It is the single big factor retarding the progress of our country, responsible for millions to live below poverty line despite astronomical amount being spent on development. It is garbage which is required to be removed otherwise it would hamper development of the country and bring bad name to the nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupreme Court observed in Lucknow Development Authority Vs M.K. Gupta (AIR 1994 SC 787):\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"...Harassment of a common man by public authorities is socially abhorring and legally impermissible. It may harm him personally but the injury to society is far more grievous. Crime and corruption thrive and prosper in the society due to lack of public resistance. Nothing is more damaging than the feeling of helplessness. An ordinary citizen instead of complaining and fighting succumbs to the pressure of undesirable functioning in offices instead of standing against it....\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAn honest man is the noblest wok of God √ø Pope. When men are pure, laws are useless; when men are corrupt, laws are broken √ø Benjamin Disraeli. Citizens realize that corruption is dominant factor keeping India a poor country, therefore, delaying march towards prosperity. A citizen faces corruption practically at every level and every sector of life. Corruption is anti-national, anti-poor, anti-economic development and anti-life. Rampant corruption is a major national malady. The Central Government as well as the State Governments are anxious to eradicate it because there is realization that it is a great hurdle on the path of progress because out of the huge plan outlays, very little goes to the people whose upliftment is essential for ushering the egalitarian society. This apart, it stalls the pace of development in other sectors too. It is, therefore, considered necessary to eradicate corruption with an iron hand otherwise march towards progress and prosperity would be delayed considerably. Why cant it be eradicated when the number of persons indulging in corruption is hardly two percent of the total population of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its widest connotation corruption includes improper and selfish exercise of power and influence attached to a public office due to the special position one occupies in public life. Developing countries like India, face this problem, as a result, it assumes status of mega industry, where some people thrive at the cost of public exchequer resultantly imparting the developmental activities of the State. The United Nations Convention against corruption (2003) signed/ratified by the member countries to deal firmly with corruption. Secretary General stressed that corruption violates the socio-economic human rights of the people especially in the developing countries because funds meant for roads, wells, hospital, schools and other basic necessities are siphoned off and deposited in safe havens abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nInaugurating two day National Seminar on Access to Justice, organized by the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association, in association with the United Nations Development Programme, His Excellency The President of India, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam said that with the rising all-round awareness and a demand for clean and corruption-free public life, the burning issue of probity in public life was increasingly coming into focus.\\r\\nConduct and behavior in public life are, like never before, under very close scrutiny. It was essential that the three pillars of democracy-Legislature, Judiciary and Executive-are strong in structure, pure in form and un-corrupted and un-blemished in conduct.\\r\\nThe President made it clear that, \\"If we cannot make India corruption free, then the vision of making the nation developed by 2020 would remain a dream\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nConsequently, understanding the menace of corruption and urgent necessity to deal with it in the context of existing scenario, public outcry, warning by transparency International, other NGOs and media, Government is attempting to eradicate it by taking steps for sometime past. The first Administrative Reforms Commission, headed by Late Shri Morarji Desai studied the causes for the steep deterioration in all areas of administration, Central and States and recommended remedial measures. In its report (1966) suggested, among other things, appointment of Lokpal at the Centre and Lokayukta at the State. Second Administrative Reforms Commission, headed by Shri Veerappa Moily, deliberated extensively for elimination of corruption in the administration and the strengthening of the Lokpal and the Lokayukta in two day National Colloquium on Ethics in Governance: Moving from Rhetoric to Results September ?, 2006 at the National Judicial Academy, Bhopal. Mahatma Gandhi, father of the Nation, had understood the gathering crisis of corruption and prophesied that the public would lead in the forefront in exposing corrupt practices and taking to task those who were involved in them. He wrote in Young India in 1928:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Corruption will be out one day, however, much one may try to conceal it; and the public can, as its right and duty, in every case of justifiable suspicion, call its servants to strict account, dismiss them, sue them, in a law court or appoint an arbitrator or inspector to scrutinize their conduct, as it likes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"He also said \\"On this earth, there is enough for everyones need but not for their greed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllah Curses The Giver Of Bribes And The Receiver Of Bribes And The Person Who Paves The Way For Both           \\r\\n\\r\\nYou Shall Not Take Bribe Blinds the Eyes Of The Wise And\\r\\n\\r\\nSubverts The Cause Of The Righteous\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInstitution of Lokpal has not as yet been created at the Centre, although efforts have been made since 1959. Meanwhile, Lokayuktas/Lokpal have been established by many states through state legislations. They provide for inquiry/investigation into complaints of corruption against public servants. He protects Citizens Right against mal-administration, corruption, delay, inefficiency, non-transparency, abuse of position, improper conduct etc. The procedure to be followed is informal and inexpensive; technicalities do not come in way. Complaint is supported by affidavit, making out case for inquiry. He is representative of Legislature, powerful friend of citizens to act against officials action, inaction or corruption. But not anti-administration, rather  helps in humanizing relations between the public and the administration, a step forward in establishing an Open Government securing respect for the rule of law, an educator aiming at propagating the prevention of corruption, inefficiency and mal-administration in governance. He is, therefore, a check on corruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn amendment to the Constitution has been proposed to implement the Lokayukta uniformly across Indian states. The proposed changes will make the institution of Lokayukta uniform across the country as a three-member body, headed by a retired Supreme Court judge or high court chief justice and comprising the state vigilance commissioner and a jurist or an eminent administrator as other members.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2012, after conclusion of the 11th All India Lokayukta Conference, as many as 16 Lokayuktas sent many recommendations to the Govt of India.

The battle was fought between the Allies and Nazi Germany. As part of the Battle of France on the Western Front, the Battle of Dunkirk was the defence and evacuation to Britain of British and other Allied forces in Europe from 26 May to 4 June 1940.\\r\\nAfter the Phoney War, the Battle of France began in earnest on 10 May 1940. To the east, the German Army Group B invaded the Netherlands and advanced westward. In response, the Supreme Allied CommanderFrench General Maurice Gamelininitiated \\"Plan D\\" and entered Belgium to engage the Germans in the Netherlands. The plan relied heavily on the Maginot Line fortifications along the German√øFrench border, but German forces had already crossed through most of the Netherlands before the French forces arrived. Gamelin instead committed the forces under his command, three mechanised armies, the French First and Seventh Armies and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), to the River Dyle. On 14 May, German Army Group A burst through the Ardennes and advanced rapidly to the west toward Sedan, then turned northward to the English Channel, using Generalfeldmarschall Erich von Manstein's plan Sichelschnitt under the German strategy Fall Gelb, effectively flanking the Allied forces.[9]\\r\\nA series of Allied counter-attacksincluding the Battle of Arrasfailed to sever the German spearhead, which reached the coast on 20 May, separating the BEF near Armentires, the French First Army, and the Belgian Army further to the north from the majority of French troops south of the German penetration. After reaching the Channel, the German forces swung north along the coast, threatening to capture the ports and trap the British and French before they could evacuate to Britain.\\r\\nIn one of the most debated decisions of the war, the Germans halted their advance on Dunkirk. Contrary to popular belief, what became known as the \\"Halt Order\\" did not originate with Adolf Hitler. Generalobersten (Colonel-Generals) Gerd von Rundstedt and Gnther von Kluge suggested that the German forces around the Dunkirk pocket should cease their advance on the port and consolidate to avoid an Allied breakout. Hitler sanctioned the order on 24 May with the support of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW). The army was to halt for three days, which gave the Allies sufficient time to organise the Dunkirk evacuation and build a defensive line. Despite the Allies' gloomy estimates of the situation, with some in Britain even discussing a conditional surrender to Germany, in the end more than 330,000 Allied troops were rescued.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 May 1940, Winston Churchill became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. By 26 May, the BEF and the French 1st Army were bottled up in a corridor to the sea, about 60?mi (97?km) deep and 15√ø25?mi (24√ø40?km) wide. Most of the British forces were still around Lille, over 40?mi (64?km) from Dunkirk, with the French further south. Two massive German armies flanked them. General Fedor von Bock's Army Group B was to the east, and General Gerd von Rundstedt's Army Group A to the west. Both officers were later promoted to field marshal.[9]\\r\\nDuring the following days... it became known that Hitler's decision was mainly influenced by Goering. To the dictator the rapid movement of the Army, whose risks and prospects of success he did not understand because of his lack of military schooling, became almost sinister. He was constantly oppressed by a feeling of anxiety that a reversal loomed...\\r\\nThe day's entry concludes with the remark: \\"The task of Army Group A can be considered to have been completed in the main\\"a view which further explains Rundstedt's reluctance to employ his armoured divisions in the final clearing-up stage of this first phase of the campaign.[12]\\r\\n\\"Brauchitsch is angry ... The pocket would have been closed at the coast if only our armour had not been held back. The bad weather has grounded the Luftwaffe and we must now stand and watch countless thousands of the enemy get away to England right under our noses.\\"[13]\\r\\nOn 24 May, Hitler visited General von Rundstedt's headquarters at Charleville. The terrain around Dunkirk was thought unsuitable for armour. Von Rundstedt advised him the infantry should attack the British forces at Arras, where the British had proved capable of significant action, while Kleist's armour held the line west and south of Dunkirk to pounce on the Allied forces retreating before Army Group B. Hitler, who was familiar with Flanders' marshes from the First World War, agreed. This order allowed the Germans to consolidate their gains and prepare for a southward advance against the remaining French forces.\\r\\nLuftwaffe commander Hermann G?ring asked for the chance to destroy the forces in Dunkirk. The Allied forces' destruction was thus initially assigned to the air force while the German infantry organised in Army Group B. Von Rundstedt later called this \\"one of the great turning points of the war.\\"[14][15][16]\\r\\nThe true reason for the decision to halt the German armour on 24 May is still debated. One theory is that Von Rundstedt and Hitler agreed to conserve the armour for Fall Rot, an operation to the south. It is possible that the Luftwaffe's closer ties than the army's to the Nazi Party contributed to Hitler's approval of G?ring's request. Another theorywhich few historians have given credenceis that Hitler was still trying to establish diplomatic peace with Britain before Operation Barbarossa (the invasion of the Soviet Union). Although von Rundstedt after the war stated his suspicions that Hitler wanted \\"to help the British\\", based on alleged praise of the British Empire during a visit to his headquarters, little evidence that Hitler wanted to let the Allies escape exists apart from a self-exculpatory statement by Hitler himself in 1945.[14][16][17] The historian Brian Bond wrote:\\r\\nFew historians now accept the view that Hitler's behaviour was influenced by the desire to let the British off lightly in [the] hope that they would then accept a compromise peace. True, in his political testament dated 26 February 1945 Hitler lamented that Churchill was \\"quite unable to appreciate the sporting spirit\\" in which he had refrained from annihilating [the] British Expeditionary Force, at Dunkirk, but this hardly squares with the contemporary record. Directive No. 13, issued by the Supreme Headquarters on 24 May called specifically for the annihilation of the French, English and Belgian forces in the pocket, while the Luftwaffe was ordered to prevent the escape of the English forces across the channel.[18]\\r\\nWhatever the reasons for Hitler's decision, the Germans confidently believed the Allied troops were doomed. American journalist William Shirer reported on 25 May, \\"German military circles here tonight put it flatly. They said the fate of the great Allied army bottled up in Flanders is sealed.\\" BEF commander Lord Gort agreed, writing to Anthony Eden, \\"I must not conceal from you that a great part of the BEF and its equipment will inevitably be lost in the best of circumstances\\".[16]\\r\\nHitler did not rescind the Halt Order until the evening of 26 May. The three days thus gained gave a vital breathing space to the Royal Navy to arrange the evacuation of the British and Allied troops. About 338,000 men were rescued in about 11 days. Of these some 215,000 were British and 123,000 were French, of whom 102,250 escaped in British ships.[19]\\r\\nOn 26 May, Anthony Eden told General Lord Gort, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the BEF, that he might need to \\"fight back to the west\\", and ordered him to prepare plans for the evacuation, but without telling the French or the Belgians. Gort had foreseen the order and preliminary plans were already in hand. The first such plan, for a defence along the Lys Canal, could not be carried out because of German advances on 26 May, with the 2nd and 50th Divisions pinned down, and the 1st, 5th and 48th Divisions under heavy attack. The 2nd Division took heavy casualties trying to keep a corridor open, being reduced to brigade strength, but they succeeded; the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 42nd Divisions escaped along the corridor that day, as did about one-third of the French First Army. As the Allies fell back, they disabled their artillery and vehicles and destroyed their stores.[20][21][22]\\r\\nOn 27 May, the British fought back to the Dunkirk perimeter line. The Le Paradis massacre took place that day, when the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf machine-gunned 97 British and French prisoners near the La Basse Canal. The British prisoners were from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment, part of the 4th Brigade of the 2nd Division. The SS men lined them up against the wall of a barn and shot them all; only two survived. Meanwhile, the Luftwaffe dropped bombs and leaflets on the Allied armies. The leaflets showed a map of the situation. They read, in English and French: \\"British soldiers! Look at the map: it gives your true situation! Your troops are entirely surrounded √ø stop fighting! Put down your arms!\\" To the land and air-minded Germans, the sea seemed an impassable barrier, so they believed the Allies were surrounded; but the British saw the sea as a route to safety.[23][24]\\r\\nBesides the Luftwaffe's bombs, German heavy artillery (which had just come within range) also fired high-explosive shells into Dunkirk. By this time, over 1,000 civilians in the town had been killed. This bombardment continued until the evacuation was over.[21]\\r\\nGort had sent Lieutenant General Ronald Adam, commanding III Corps, ahead to build the defensive perimeter around Dunkirk. Lieutenant General Alan Brooke, commanding II Corps, was to conduct a holding action with the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 50th Divisions along the Ypres-Comines canal as far as Yser, while the rest of the BEF fell back. The battle of Wytschaete, over the border in Belgium, was the toughest action Brooke faced in this role.[25]\\r\\nOn 26 May, the Germans made a reconnaissance in force against the British position. At mid-day on 27 May, they launched a full-scale attack with three divisions south of Ypres. A confused battle followed, where visibility was low because of forested or urban terrain, and communications were poor because the British at that time used no radios below battalion level and the telephone wires had been cut. The Germans used infiltration tactics to get among the British, who were beaten back.[26]\\r\\nThe heaviest fighting was in the 5th Division's sector. Still on 27 May, Brooke ordered the 3rd Division commander, Major-General Bernard Montgomery, to extend his division's line to the left, thereby freeing the 10th and 11th Brigades, both of the 4th Division, to join the 5th Division at Messines Ridge. The 10th Brigade arrived first, to find the enemy had advanced so far they were closing on the British field artillery. Between them, the 10th and 11th Brigades cleared the ridge of Germans, and by 28 May they were securely dug in east of Wytschaete.[27]\\r\\nThat day, Brooke ordered a counterattack. This was to be spearheaded by two battalions, the 3rd Grenadier Guards and 2nd North Staffordshire Regiment, both of Major-General Harold Alexander's 1st Division. The North Staffords advanced as far as the Kortekeer River, while the Grenadiers reached the canal itself, but could not hold it. The counterattack disrupted the Germans, holding them back a little longer while the BEF retreated.[28]\\r\\nThe route back from Brooke's position to Dunkirk passed through the town of Poperinge (known to most British sources as \\"Poperinghe\\"), where there was a bottleneck at a bridge over the Yser canal. Most of the main roads in the area converged on that bridge. On 27 May, the Luftwaffe bombed the resulting traffic jam thoroughly for two hours, destroying or immobilising about 80 percent of the vehicles. Another Luftwaffe raid, on the night of 28√ø29 May, was illuminated by flares as well as the light from burning vehicles. The British 44th Division in particular had to abandon many guns and lorries, losing almost all of them between Poperinge and the Mont.[29]\\r\\nThe German 6. Panzerdivision could probably have destroyed the 44th Division at Poperinge on 29 May, thereby cutting off the 3rd and 50th Divisions as well. The historian and author Julian Thompson calls it \\"astonishing\\" that they did not, but they were distracted, investing the nearby town of Cassel.[30]\\r\\nGort had ordered Lieutenant General Adam, commanding III Corps, and French General Fagalde to prepare a perimeter defence of Dunkirk. The perimeter was semicircular, with French troops manning the western sector and British troops the eastern. It ran along the Belgian coastline from Nieuport in the east via Furnes, Bulskamp and Bergues to Gravelines in the west. The line was made as strong as possible under the circumstances, but on 28 May the Belgian army, who were largely outnumbered by the attacking Germans, and still under the direct command of King Leopold, who had refused to abandon his troops and the Belgian refugees inside the little enclave of what remained of unoccupied Belgium, surrendered. This left a 20?mi (32?km) gap in Gort's eastern flank between the British and the sea. The British were surprised by the Belgian capitulation, despite King Leopold warning them in advance.[31][32] As a constitutional monarch, Leopold's decision to surrender without consulting the Belgian government led to his condemnation by the Belgian and French Prime Ministers, Hubert Pierlot and Paul Reynaud.\\r\\nKing George VI sent Gort a telegram that read:\\r\\n\\"All your countrymen have been following with pride and admiration the courageous resistance of the British Expeditionary Force during the continuing fighting of the last fortnight. Faced by circumstances outside their control in a position of extreme difficulty, they are displaying a gallantry which has never been surpassed in the annals of the British Army. The hearts of everyone of us at home are with you and your magnificent troops in this hour of peril.\\"[31]\\r\\nGort sent the battle-worn 3rd, 4th and 50th Divisions into the line to fill the space the Belgians had held.[33]\\r\\nWhile they were still moving into position, they ran headlong into the German 256th Division, who were trying to outflank Gort. Armoured cars of the 12th Lancers stopped the Germans at Nieuport itself. A confused battle raged all along the perimeter throughout 28 May. Command and control on the British side disintegrated, and the perimeter was driven slowly inwards toward Dunkirk.[33]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Erwin Rommel had surrounded five divisions of the French First Army near Lille. Although completely cut off and heavily outnumbered, the French fought on for four days under General Molini in the Siege of Lille (1940), thereby keeping seven German divisions from the assault on Dunkirk and saving an estimated 100,000 Allied troops.[33] In recognition of the garrison's stubborn defence, German general Kurt Waeger granted them the honours of war, saluting the French troops as they marched past in parade formation with rifles shouldered.[34]\\r\\nThe defence of the Dunkirk perimeter held throughout 29√ø30 May, with the Allies falling back by degrees. On 31 May, the Germans nearly broke through at Nieuport. The situation grew so desperate that two British battalion commanders manned a Bren gun, with one colonel firing and the other loading. A few hours later, the 2nd Battalion, Coldstream Guards of the 3rd Division, rushed to reinforce the line near Furnes, where the British troops had been routed. The Guards restored order by shooting some of the fleeing troops and turning others around at bayonet point. The British troops returned to the line and the German assault was beaten back.[35]\\r\\nIn the afternoon, the Germans breached the perimeter near the canal at Bulskamp but the boggy ground on the far side of the canal and sporadic fire from the Durham Light Infantry, halted them. As night fell, the Germans massed for another attack at Nieuport. Eighteen RAF bombers found the Germans while they were still assembling and scattered them with an accurate bombing run.[36]\\r\\nAlso on 31 May, General Von Kuechler assumed command of all the German forces at Dunkirk. His plan was simple: launch an all-out attack across the whole front at 11:00 on 1 June. Strangely, Von Kuechler ignored a radio intercept telling him the British were abandoning the eastern end of the line to fall back to Dunkirk itself.[37]\\r\\nThe morning of 1 June was clear√øgood flying weather, in contrast to the bad weather that had hindered air operations on 30 and 31 May (there were only two and a half good flying days in the whole operation.) Although Churchill had promised the French that the British would cover their escape, on the ground it was the French who held the line whilst the last remaining British soldiers were evacuated. Enduring concentrated German artillery fire and Luftwaffe strafing and bombs, the French stood their ground. On 2 June (the day the last of the British units embarked onto the ships),[Notes 1] the French began to fall back slowly, and by 3 June the Germans were about two miles (3?km) from Dunkirk. The night of 3 June was the last night of evacuations. At 10:20 on 4 June, the Germans hoisted the swastika over the docks from which so many British and French troops had escaped.[39][40][41]\\r\\nThe desperate resistance of Allied forces, especially the French 12th Motorised Infantry Division from the Fort des Dunes, had bought time for the evacuation of the bulk of the troops. The Wehrmacht captured some 35,000 soldiers, almost all of them French. These men had protected the evacuation until the last moment and were unable to embark. The same fate was reserved for the survivors of the French 12th Motorised Infantry Division (composed in particular of the French 150th Infantry Regiment); they were taken prisoner on the morning of 4 June on the beach of Malo-les-Bains. The flag of this regiment was burnt so as not to fall into enemy hands.[42]\\r\\nThe War Office made the decision to evacuate British forces on 25 May. In the nine days from 27 May√ø4 June, 338,226 men escaped, including 139,997 French, Polish, and Belgian troops, together with a small number of Dutch soldiers, aboard 861 vessels (of which 243 were sunk during the operation). B. H. Liddell Hart wrote that Fighter Command lost 106 aircraft over Dunkirk and the Luftwaffe lost about 135, some of which were shot down by the French Navy and the Royal Navy. MacDonald wrote in 1986 that the British losses were 177 aircraft and German losses 240.[39][41][43]\\r\\nThe docks at Dunkirk were too badly damaged to be used, but the East and West Moles (sea walls protecting the harbour entrance) were intact. Captain William Tennantin charge of the evacuationdecided to use the beaches and the East Mole to land the ships. This highly successful idea hugely increased the number of troops that could be embarked each day and on 31 May, over 68,000 men were embarked.[21][39]\\r\\nThe last of the British Army left on 3 June, and at 10:50, Tennant signalled Ramsay to say \\"Operation completed. Returning to Dover\\". Churchill insisted on coming back for the French and the Royal Navy returned on 4 June, to rescue as many as possible of the French rearguard. Over 26,000 French soldiers were evacuated on that last day, but between 30,000 and 40,000 more were left behind and forced to surrender to the Germans.[44]\\r\\nFollowing the events at Dunkirk, the German forces regrouped before commencing an operation called Fall Rot (\\"Case Red\\"), a renewed assault southward, starting on 5 June. Although two fresh British divisions had begun moving to France in an attempt to form a Second BEF, the decision was taken on 14 June to withdraw all the remaining British troops; an evacuation called Operation Ariel. By 25 June, almost 192,000 Allied personnel, 144,000 of them British, had been evacuated through various French ports.[45] Although the French Army fought on, German troops entered Paris on 14 June. The French government was forced to negotiate an armistice at Compigne on 22 June.\\r\\nThe loss of materiel on the beaches was huge. The British Army left enough equipment behind to fit out about eight to ten divisions. Discarded in France were, among other things, huge supplies of ammunition, 880 field guns, 310 guns of large calibre, some 500 anti-aircraft guns, about 850 anti-tank guns, 11,000 machine guns, nearly 700 tanks, 20,000 motorcycles and 45,000 motor cars and lorries. Army equipment available at home was only just sufficient to equip two divisions. The British Army needed months to re-supply properly and some planned introductions of new equipment were halted while industrial resources concentrated on making good the losses. Officers told troops falling back from Dunkirk to burn or otherwise disable their trucks (so as not to let them benefit the advancing German forces). The shortage of army vehicles after Dunkirk was so severe that the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) was reduced to retrieving and refurbishing obsolete buses and coaches from British scrapyards to press them into use as troop transports. Some of these antique workhorses were still in use as late as the North African campaign of 1942.[46]\\r\\nOn 2 June, the Dean of St Paul's, Walter Matthews, was the first to call the evacuation the \\"Miracle of Dunkirk\\".\\r\\nIt was remembered that the Archbishop of Canterbury had announced that the Day of National Prayer might well be a turning point, and it was obvious to many that God had answered the nation's collective prayer with the 'miracle of Dunkirk'. The evidence of God's intervention was clear for those who wished to see it; papers had written of calm seas and the high mist which interfered with the accuracy of German bombers.[47]\\r\\nA marble memorial to the battle stands at Dunkirk. The French inscription is translated as: \\"To the glorious memory of the pilots, mariners, and soldiers of the French and Allied armies who sacrificed themselves in the Battle of Dunkirk, May√øJune 1940.\\"\\r\\nThe missing dead of the BEF are commemorated on the Dunkirk Memorial.\\r\\nBritish press later exploited the successful evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, and particularly the role of the \\"Dunkirk little ships\\", very effectively. Many of them were private vessels such as fishing boats and pleasure cruisers, but commercial vessels such as ferries also contributed to the force, including a number from as far away as the Isle of Man and Glasgow. These smaller vesselsguided by naval craft across the Channel from the Thames Estuary and from Doverassisted in the official evacuation. Being able to move closer into the beachfront shallows than larger craft, the \\"little ships\\" acted as shuttles to and from the larger ships, lifting troops who were queuing in the water, many waiting shoulder-deep in water for hours. The term \\"Dunkirk Spirit\\" refers to the solidarity of the British people in times of adversity.[48]\\r\\nA commemorative medal was established in 1960 by the French National Association of Veterans of the Fortified Sector of Flanders and Dunkirk on behalf of the town of Dunkirk.[49] The medal was initially awarded only to the French defenders of Dunkirk but in 1970 the qualification was expanded to include British forces who served in the Dunkirk sector and their rescue forces, including the civilians who volunteered to man the \\"little ships\\".[50]\\r\\nThe design of the bronze medal included the arms of the town of Dunkirk on one side, and \\"Dunkerque 1940\\" on the reverse side.\\r\\nCoordinates: 510203N 22237E? / ?51.0343N 2.37682E? / 51.0343; 2.37682","input":"Was dunkirk world war 1 or world war ii?"},{"output":"Marley's ghost","context":"A Christmas Carol in Prose, Being a Ghost-Story of Christmas, commonly known as A Christmas Carol, is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in London by Chapman & Hall in 1843; the first edition was illustrated by John Leech. A Christmas Carol tells the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, an old miser who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. After their visits Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man.\\r\\nDickens wrote A Christmas Carol at a time when the British were examining and exploring Christmas traditions from the past, such as carols, as well as new customs such as Christmas trees. He was influenced by experiences from his own past, and from the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired to write the story following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged school, one of several establishments for London's half-starved, illiterate street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a self-interested man redeeming himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this was a fully secular story, or if it is a Christian allegory.\\r\\nPublished on 19 December, the first edition sold out by Christmas Eve; by the end of 1844 thirteen editions had been released. Most critics reviewed the novella positively. The story was illicitly copied in January 1844; Dickens took action against the publishers, who went bankrupt, further reducing Dickens's small profits from the publication. He went on to write four other Christmas stories in subsequent years. In 1849 he began public readings of the story which proved so successful he undertook 127 further performances until 1870, the year of his death. A Christmas Carol has never been out of print and has been translated into several languages; the story has been adapted many times for film, stage, opera and other media.\\r\\nWith A Christmas Carol, Dickens captured the zeitgeist of the mid-Victorian revival of the Christmas holiday. He has been acknowledged as an influence on the modern Western observance of Christmas and inspired several aspects of Christmas, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDickens divided the book into five chapters, which he labelled \\"staves\\".\\r\\nThe story begins on a cold and bleak Christmas Eve in London, seven years after the death of Ebenezer Scrooge's business partner, Jacob Marley. Scrooge, an old miser, hates Christmas and refuses an invitation to Christmas dinner from his nephew Fred. He turns away two men who seek a donation from him in order to provide food and heating for the poor, and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit, Christmas Day off with pay to conform to the social custom.\\r\\nAt home that night, Scrooge is visited by Marley's ghost, who wanders the Earth, entwined by heavy chains and money boxes, forged during a lifetime of greed and selfishness. Marley tells Scrooge that he has one chance to avoid the same fate: he will be visited by three spirits and he must listen to them or be cursed to carry chains of his own, much longer than Marley's chains.\\r\\nThe first of the spirits, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge's boyhood and youth, reminding him of a time when he was more innocent. The boyhood scenes portray Scrooge's lonely childhood, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, Mr. Fezziwig, who treated Scrooge like a son. They also portray Scrooge's neglected fiance Belle, who ends their relationship after she realises that Scrooge will never love her as much as he loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on a recent Christmas Eve.\\r\\nThe second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, takes Scrooge to a joy-filled market of people buying the makings of Christmas dinner and celebrations of Christmas in a miner's cottage and in a lighthouse. Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred's Christmas party. A major part of this stave is taken up with Bob Cratchit's family feast and introduces his youngest son, Tiny Tim, a happy boy who is seriously ill. The spirit informs Scrooge that Tiny Tim will die soon unless the course of events changes. Before disappearing, the spirit shows Scrooge two hideous, emaciated children named Ignorance and Want. He tells Scrooge to beware the former above all and mocks Scrooge's concern for their welfare.\\r\\nThe third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. The ghost shows him scenes involving the death of a disliked man. The man's funeral will only be attended by local businessmen if lunch is provided. His charwoman, his laundress, and the local undertaker steal some of his possessions and sell them to a fence. When Scrooge asks the ghost to show anyone who feels any emotion over the man's death, the ghost can only show him the pleasure of a poor couple in debt to the man, rejoicing that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order. After Scrooge asks to see some tenderness connected with any death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the passing of Tiny Tim. The ghost then shows Scrooge the man's neglected grave, whose tombstone bears Scrooge's name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to the ghost that he will change his ways to avoid this outcome.\\r\\nScrooge awakens on Christmas morning a changed man. He spends the day with Fred's family and anonymously sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner. The following day he gives Cratchit an increase in pay and becomes like another father to Tiny Tim, who did not die. From then on Scrooge begins to treat everyone with kindness, generosity and compassion, embodying the spirit of Christmas.\\r\\nThe writer Charles Dickens was born to a respectable family that got into financial difficulties as a result of the spendthrift nature of John, Dickens's father. In 1824 John was committed to Marshalsea, a debtors' prison in Southwark, London. Dickens, aged 12, was forced to pawn his collection of books, leave school and go to work at a shoe-blacking factory, a dirty and rat-infested place. The change in Dickens's circumstances gave him what his biographer, Michael Slater, described as a \\"deep personal and social outrage\\", which heavily influenced his works.[1]\\r\\nAt the end of December 1842 Dickens began publishing his novel Martin Chuzzlewit as a monthly serial;[n 1] although the novel was his favourite work, sales had been disappointing and he faced financial difficulties.[2] By this time he was a well-established author, having written six major works,[n 2] as well as several short stories, novellas and other works.[3]\\r\\nCelebrating the Christmas season had been growing in popularity through the Victorian era.[4] Although the Christmas tree had been introduced in Britain during the 18th century, its use was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and their practice was copied in many homes across the country.[5] In the early 19th century there had been a revival of interest in Christmas carols, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years. The publication of Davies Gilbert's 1823 work Some Ancient Christmas Carols, With the Tunes to Which They Were Formerly Sung in the West of England and William Sandys's 1833 collection Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern led to a growth in the form's popularity in Britain.[6]\\r\\nDickens had an interest in Christmas, and his first story on the subject was \\"Christmas Festivities\\", published in Bell's Weekly Messenger in 1835; the story was then published as \\"A Christmas Dinner\\" in Sketches by Boz (1836).[7] \\"The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton\\", another Christmas story, appeared in the 1836 novel The Pickwick Papers,[n 3] followed by a passage about Christmas in Dickens's editorial Master Humphrey's Clock.[9]\\r\\nDickens was not the first author to celebrate the Christmas season in literature.[10] Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819√ø20 work The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham.[11] The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that the staging of a nostalgic English Christmas might help restore the social harmony that had been lost in the modern world.[12]\\r\\nSeveral works may have had an influence on the writing of A Christmas Carol, including two Douglas Jerrold essays: one from an 1841 issue of Punch, \\"How Mr. Chokepear Keeps a Merry Christmas\\" and one from 1843, \\"The Beauties of the Police\\".[13] More broadly, Dickens was influenced by fairy tales and nursery stories, which he closely associated with Christmas, because he saw them as stories of conversion and transformation.[14]\\r\\nDickens was touched by the lot of poor children in the middle decades of the 19th century.[15] In early 1843 he toured the Cornish tin mines, where he was angered after seeing children working in appalling conditions.[16] The suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by a visit to the Field Lane Ragged school, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital's half-starved, illiterate street children.[17]\\r\\nIn February 1843 the Second Report of the Children's Employment Commission was published. It was a parliamentary report exposing the effects of the Industrial Revolution upon working class children. Horrified by what he read, Dickens planned to publish an inexpensive political pamphlet tentatively titled, An Appeal to the People of England, on behalf of the Poor Man's Child, but changed his mind, deferring the pamphlet's production until the end of the year.[18] In March he wrote to Dr. Southwood Smith, one of the four commissioners responsible for the Second Report, about his change in plans: \\"you will certainly feel that a Sledge hammer has come down with twenty times the forcetwenty thousand times the forceI could exert by following out my first idea\\".[19]\\r\\nIn a fundraising speech on 5 October 1843 at the Manchester Athenaeum, Dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance with educational reform,[20] and realised in the days following that the most effective way to reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice was to write a deeply felt Christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays.[21]\\r\\nBy mid-1843 Dickens began to suffer from financial problems. Sales of Martin Chuzzlewit were slowing, and his wife, Catherine, was pregnant with the couple's fifth child. Matters worsened when Chapman & Hall, Martin Chuzzlewit's publishers, began to talk about reducing his monthly income by S50 if sales dropped further.[22] He began to write A Christmas Carol in October 1843.[23] Michael Slater, Dickens's biographer, describes the book as being \\"written at white heat\\"; it was completed in six weeks, with the final pages written in early December.[24] He built much of the work in his head while taking night-time walks of 15 to 20 miles around London.[25] Slater says that A Christmas Carol was\\r\\nintended to open its readers' hearts towards those struggling to survive on the lower rungs of the economic ladder and to encourage practical benevolence, but also to warn of the terrible danger to society created by the toleration of widespread ignorance and actual want among the poor.[15]\\r\\nGeorge Cruikshank, the illustrator who had previously worked with Dickens on Sketches by Boz (1836) and Oliver Twist (1838), introduced him to the caricaturist John Leech. By 24 October Dickens invited Leech to work on A Christmas Carol, and four hand-coloured etchings and four black-and-white wood engravings by the artist accompanied the text.[26]\\r\\nThe central character of A Christmas Carol is Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly London-based moneylender,[27] described in the story as \\"a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!\\"[28] Kelly writes that Scrooge may have been influenced by Dickens's conflicting feelings for his father, whom he both loved and demonised. This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the taleone a cold, stingy and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man.[29] Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, the professor of English literature, considers that in the opening part of the book covering young Scrooge's lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty \\"is something of a self-parody of Dickens's fears about himself\\"; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself.[30]\\r\\nScrooge could also be based on two misers: the eccentric John Elwes, MP,[31] or Jemmy Wood, the owner of the Gloucester Old Bank who was also known as \\"The Gloucester Miser\\".[32] According to the sociologist Frank W. Elwell, Scrooge's views on the poor are a reflection of those of the demographer and political economist Thomas Malthus,[33] while the miser's questions \\"Are there no prisons??... And the Union workhouses??... The treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\\" are a reflection of a sarcastic question raised by the Chartist philosopher Thomas Carlyle, \\"Are there not treadmills, gibbets; even hospitals, poor-rates, New Poor-Law?\\"[34][n 4]\\r\\nThere are literary precursors for Scrooge in Dickens's own works. Peter Ackroyd, Dickens's biographer, sees similarities between Scrooge and the elder Martin Chuzzlewit character, although the miser is \\"a more fantastic image\\" than the Chuzzlewit patriarch; Ackroyd observes that Chuzzlewit's transformation to a charitable figure is a parallel to that of the miser.[36] Douglas-Fairhurst sees that the minor character Gabriel Grub from The Pickwick Papers was also an influence when creating Scrooge.[37][n 5] Scrooge's name came from a tombstone Dickens had seen on a visit to Edinburgh. The grave was for Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose job was given as a meal mana corn merchant; Dickens misread the inscription as \\"mean man\\".[39][n 6] This theory has been described as \\"a probable Dickens hoax\\" for which \\"[n]o one could find any corroborating evidence\\".[41]\\r\\nWhen Dickens was young he lived near a tradesman's premises with the sign \\"Goodge and Marney\\", which may have provided the name for Scrooge's former business partner.[42] For the chained Marley, Dickens had remembered a visit he had made to the Western Penitentiary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in March 1842, where he sawand was affected by seeingfettered prisoners.[34] For the character Tiny Tim, Dickens used his nephew Henry, a disabled boy who was five at the time A Christmas Carol was written.[43][n 7] The two figures of Want and Ignorance, sheltering in the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present were inspired by the children Dickens had seen on his visit to a ragged School in the East End of London.[17]\\r\\nThe transformation of Scrooge is central to the story.[45] Kelly writes that the transformation is reflected in the description of Scrooge, who begins as a two-dimensional character, but who then grows into one who \\"possess[es] an emotional depth [and] a regret for lost opportunities\\".[46] Some writers, including Grace Moore, the Dickens scholar, consider that there is a Christian theme running through A Christmas Carol, and that the novella should be seen as an allegory of the Christian concept of redemption.[47][n 8] Dickens's biographer, Claire Tomalin sees the conversion of Scrooge as carrying the Christian message that \\"even the worst of sinners may repent and become a good man\\".[49] Dickens's attitudes towards organised religion were complex,[n 9] although he based his beliefs and principles within the New Testament.[52] Dickens's statement that Marley \\"had no bowels\\" is a reference to the \\"bowels of compassion\\" mentioned in I John, the reason for his eternal damnation.[53][n 10]\\r\\nOther writers, including Kelly, believe that Dickens put forward a \\"secular vision of this sacred holiday\\".[10] The Dickens scholar John O. Jordan argues that A Christmas Carol shows what Dickens referred to in a letter to Foster as his \\"Carol philosophy, cheerful views, sharp anatomisation of humbug, jolly good temper?... and a vein of glowing, hearty, generous, mirthful, beaming reference in everything to Home and Fireside\\".[54] From a secular viewpoint, the cultural historian Penne Restad suggests that Scrooge's redemption underscores \\"the conservative, individualistic and patriarchal aspects\\" of Dickens's \\"Carol philosophy\\" of charity and altruism.[55]\\r\\nDickens wrote A Christmas Carol because of how British social policy treated children at the time, and wished to use the novella as a means to put forward his arguments against it.[56] The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in povertypersonified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance.[57] The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readersas was Tiny Tim.[58] Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.[59]\\r\\nAs the result of the disagreements with Chapman and Hall over the commercial failures of Martin Chuzzlewit,[60] Dickens arranged to pay for the publishing himself, in exchange for a percentage of the profits.[30] Production of A Christmas Carol was not without problems. The first printing contained drab olive endpapers that Dickens felt were unacceptable, and the publisher Chapman and Hall quickly replaced them with yellow endpapers, but, once replaced, those clashed with the title page, which was then redone.[61] The final product was bound in red cloth with gilt-edged pages, completed only two days before the publication date of 19 December 1843.[62] Following publication, Dickens arranged for the manuscript to be bound in red Morocco leather and presented as a gift to his solicitor, Thomas Mitton.[63][n 11]\\r\\nPriced at five shillings (equal to S23 in 2018 pounds[64]), the first run of 6,000 copies sold out by Christmas Eve. Chapman and Hall issued second and third editions before the new year, and the book continued to sell well into 1844.[66] By the end of 1844 eleven more editions had been released.[67] Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.[68] It was Dickens's most popular book in the United States, and sold over two million copies in the hundred years following its first publication there.[69]\\r\\nThe high production costs upon which Dickens insisted led to reduced profits, and the first edition brought him only S230 (equal to S21,000 in 2018 pounds[64]) rather than the S1,000 (equal to S90,000 in 2018 pounds[64]) he expected.[70] A year later, the profits were only S744, and Dickens was deeply disappointed.[60][n 12]\\r\\nDouglas-Fairhurst writes that the reviews of A Christmas Carol \\"were almost uniformly kind\\".[72] The reviewer from The Illustrated London News described how the story's \\"impressive eloquence?... its unfeigned lightness of heartits playful and sparkling humour?... its gentle spirit of humanity\\" all put the reader \\"in good humour with ourselves, with each other, with the season and with the author\\".[73] The critic from The Athenaeum, the literary magazine, considered it a \\"tale to make the reader laugh and cry?√ø to open his hands, and open his heart to charity even toward the uncharitable?... a dainty dish to set before a King.\\"[74] William Makepeace Thackeray, writing in Fraser's Magazine, described the book as \\"a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness. The last two people I heard speak of it were women; neither knew the other, or the author, and both said, by way of criticism, 'God bless him!'\\"[71]\\r\\nThe poet Thomas Hood, in his own journal, wrote that \\"If Christmas, with its ancient and hospitable customs, its social and charitable observances, were ever in danger of decay, this is the book that would give them a new lease.\\"[75] The reviewer for Tait's Edinburgh MagazineTheodore Martin, who was usually critical of Dickens's work[72]spoke well of A Christmas Carol, noting it was \\"a noble book, finely felt and calculated to work much social good\\".[76] After Dickens' death, Margaret Oliphant deplored the turkey and plum pudding aspects of the book but admitted that in the days of its first publication it was regarded as \\"a new gospel\\" and noted that the book was unique in that it actually made people behave better.[72] The religious press generally ignored the tale but, in January 1884, Christian Remembrancer thought the tale's old and hackneyed subject was treated in an original way and praised the author's sense of humour and pathos.[77]\\r\\nThere were critics of the book. The New Monthly Magazine's reviewer, while praising the story, thought the book's physical excessesthe gilt edges and expensive bindingkept the price high, which made it unavailable to the poor. The reviewer recommended the tale be printed on cheap paper and priced accordingly.[78] The unnamed reviewer from The Westminster Review mocked Dickens's grasp of economics, asking \\"Who went without turkey and punch in order that Bob Cratchit might get themfor, unless there were turkeys and punch in surplus, someone must go without\\".[79]\\r\\nFollowing criticism of the US in American Notes and Martin Chuzzlewit, American readers were less enthusiastic at first, but by the end of the American Civil War, copies of the book were in wide circulation.[80] In 1863 The New York Times published an enthusiastic review, noting that the author brought the \\"old Christmas?... of bygone centuries and remote manor houses, into the living rooms of the poor of today\\".[81]\\r\\nIn January 1844 Parley's Illuminated Library published an unauthorised version of the story in a condensed form which they sold for twopence.[n 13] Dickens wrote to his solicitor\\r\\nI have not the least doubt that if these Vagabonds can be stopped they must.?... Let us be the sledge-hammer in this, or I shall be beset by hundreds of the same crew when I come out with a long story.[83]\\r\\nTwo days after the release of the Parley version, Dickens sued on the cases of copyright infringement and won. The publishers declared themselves bankrupt and Dickens was left to pay S700 in costs.[84] The small profits Dickens earned from A Christmas Carol further strained his relationship with his publishers, and he broke with them in favour of Bradbury and Evans, who had been printing his works to that point.[15]\\r\\nDickens returned to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised on the success of the book by publishing other Christmas stories The Chimes (1844), The Cricket on the Hearth (1845), The Battle of Life (1846) and The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain (1848); these were secular conversion tales which reflected the societal changes of the previous year, and which social problems still needed to be dealt with. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.[85]\\r\\nBy 1849 Dickens was engaged with David Copperfield and had neither the time nor the inclination to produce another Christmas book.[86] He decided the best way to reach his audience with his \\"Carol philosophy\\" was by public readings.[87] During Christmas 1852 Dickens gave a reading in Birmingham Town Hall to the Industrial and Literary Institute; the performance was a great success.[88] Thereafter, he read the tale in an abbreviated version 127 times, until 1870 (the year of his death), when it provided the material for his farewell performance.[89]\\r\\nIn the years following the book's publication, responses to the tale were published by W. M. Swepstone (Christmas Shadows, 1850), Horatio Alger (Job Warner's Christmas, 1863), Louisa May Alcott (A Christmas Dream, and How It Came True, 1882), and others who followed Scrooge's life as a reformed man?√ø or some who thought Dickens had got it wrong and needed to be corrected.[90]\\r\\nThe novella was adapted for the stage almost immediately. Three productions opened on 5 February 1844, with one by Edward Stirling sanctioned by Dickens and running for more than 40 nights.[91] By the close of February 1844 eight rival A Christmas Carol theatrical productions were playing in London.[72] The story has been adapted for film and television more than any of Dickens's other works.[92] In 1901 it was produced as Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost, a silent black-and-white British film; it was one of the first known adaptations of a Dickens work on film, although is now largely lost.[93] The story was adapted in 1923 for BBC radio.[94] The story has been adapted to other media, including opera, ballet, a Broadway musical, animation, and a BBC mime production starring Marcel Marceau.[95]\\r\\nAlthough the phrase \\"Merry Christmas\\" had been around for many years √ø the earliest known written use was in a letter in 1534 √ø Dickens's use of the term in A Christmas Carol popularised the term among the Victorian public.[96] The exclamation \\"Bah! Humbug!\\" entered popular use in the English language as a retort to anything sentimental or over festive;[97] the name \\"Scrooge\\" became used as a designation for a miser, and was added to the Oxford English Dictionary as such in 1982.[98]\\r\\nThe modern observance of Christmas is largely the result of a mid-Victorian revival of the holiday. The Oxford Movement of the 1830s and 1840s had produced a resurgence of the traditional rituals and religious observances associated with Christmastide and, with A Christmas Carol, Dickens captured the zeitgeist of the age, while he reflected and reinforced his vision of Christmas.[99] He advocated a humanitarian focus of the holiday,[100] which influenced several aspects of Christmas that are still celebrated in Western culture, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit.[101][n 14] The historian Ronald Hutton writes that Dickens \\"linked worship and feasting, within a context of social reconciliation\\".[102]\\r\\nRuth Glancy, a professor of English literature, states that the largest impact of A Christmas Carol was the influence felt by individual readers.[103] In the spring of 1844 The Gentleman's Magazine attributed a rise of charitable giving in Britain to Dickens's novella;[104] in 1874, Robert Louis Stevenson, after reading Dickens's Christmas books, vowed to give generously to those in need;[105] and Thomas Carlyle expressed a generous hospitality by hosting two Christmas dinners after reading the book.[106] In 1867 one American businessman was so moved after attending a reading, that he closed his factory on Christmas Day and sent every employee a turkey,[72] while in the early years of the 20th century the Queen of Norway sent gifts to London's crippled children signed \\"With Tiny Tim's Love\\".[107] On the novella, the author G. K. Chesterton wrote \\"The beauty and blessing of the story?... lie in the great furnace of real happiness that glows through Scrooge and everything around him.?... Whether the Christmas visions would or would not convert Scrooge, they convert us.\\"[108]","input":"Who was the first ghost to visit scrooge?"},{"output":"February 27, 1996","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nPokmon (Japanese: Ã∏∆π, Hepburn: Pokemon, Japanese:?[pokemo?]; English: /?po?k??m?n, -ki-, -ke?-/)[1][2][3] is a media franchise managed by The Pokmon Company, a Japanese consortium between Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.[4] The franchise copyright is shared by all three companies, but Nintendo is the sole owner of the trademark.[5] The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995,[6] and is centered on fictional creatures called \\"Pokmon\\", which humans, known as Pokmon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport.

The Pokmon Company International (formerly Pokmon USA Inc.), a subsidiary of Japan's Pokmon Co., oversees all Pokmon licensing outside Asia.[18] The franchise celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2006.[19] 2016 marks the 20th anniversary of the release of the original games, with the company celebrating by airing an ad during Super Bowl 50, issuing re-releases of Pokmon Red, Blue, and Yellow, and redesigning the way the games are played.[20][21] The mobile augmented reality game Pokmon Go was released in July 2016.[22] The first seventh-generation games Pokmon Sun and Moon were released worldwide on November 18, 2016.[23] A live-action film adaptation based on Detective Pikachu began production in January 2018,[24] and is set to release in 2019.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Pokmon is the romanized contraction of the Japanese brand Pocket Monsters (Ã∏∆π, Poketto Monsut).[25] The term \\"Pokmon\\", in addition to referring to the Pokmon franchise itself, also collectively refers to the 807 fictional species that have made appearances in Pokmon media as of the release of the seventh generation titles Pokmon Sun and Moon. \\"Pokmon\\" is identical in the singular and plural, as is each individual species name; it is grammatically correct to say \\"one Pokmon\\" and \\"many Pokmon\\", as well as \\"one Pikachu\\" and \\"many Pikachu\\".[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nTajiri first thought of Pokmon, albeit with a different concept and name, around 1989, when the Game Boy was released. The concept of the Pokmon universe, in both the video games and the general fictional world of Pokmon, stems from the hobby of insect collecting, a popular pastime which Pokmon executive director Satoshi Tajiri enjoyed as a child.[27] Players are designated as Pokmon Trainers and have three general goals: to complete the regional Pokdex by collecting all of the available Pokmon species found in the fictional region where a game takes place, to complete the national Pokdex by transferring Pokmon from other regions, and to train a team of powerful Pokmon from those they have caught to compete against teams owned by other Trainers so they may eventually win the Pokmon League and become the regional Champion. These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present in almost every version of the Pokmon franchise, including the video games, the anime and manga series, and the Pokmon Trading Card Game.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most incarnations of the Pokmon universe, a Trainer who encounters a wild Pokmon is able to capture that Pokmon by throwing a specially designed, mass-producible spherical tool called a Pok Ball at it. If the Pokmon is unable to escape the confines of the Pok Ball, it is considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterwards, it will obey whatever commands it receives from its new Trainer, unless the Trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that the Pokmon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pokmon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pokmon; if the opposing Pokmon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pokmon with a Pok Ball, increasing their collection of creatures. Pokmon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special circumstances in certain side games. If a Pokmon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out (\\"faints\\"), the winning Pokmon gains experience points and may level up. When leveling up, the Pokmon's battling aptitude statistics (\\"stats, such as Attack and Speed\\") increase. At certain levels, the Pokmon may also learn new moves, which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of Pokmon can undergo a form of metamorphosis and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pokmon, a process called evolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the main series, each game's single-player mode requires the Trainer to raise a team of Pokmon to defeat many non-player character (NPC) Trainers and their Pokmon. Each game lays out a somewhat linear path through a specific region of the Pokmon world for the Trainer to journey through, completing events and battling opponents along the way (including foiling the plans of an 'evil' team of Pokmon Trainers who serve as antagonists to the player). Excluding Sun and Moon, the games feature eight powerful Trainers, referred to as Gym Leaders, that the Trainer must defeat in order to progress. As a reward, the Trainer receives a Gym Badge, and once all eight badges are collected, the Trainer is eligible to challenge the region's Pokmon League, where four talented trainers (referred to collectively as the \\"Elite Four\\") challenge the Trainer to four Pokmon battles in succession. If the trainer can overcome this gauntlet, they must challenge the Regional Champion, the master Trainer who had previously defeated the Elite Four. Any Trainer who wins this last battle becomes the new champion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is implied by Takeshi Shudo, the initial writer for the anime, that the creators of Pokmon had not anticipated the franchise would become so popular, and there were plans to end the series by the Gold and Silver era. In his blog, Shudo reveals he had an ending drafted for the anime, in which the last episode reveals an elderly Ash Ketchum hallucinated the entire events of the show.[28] This is supported in an interview with president of The Pokmon Company, Tsunekazu Ishihara, who predicted the anime would end by 1998. He also stated he initially did not intend on making \\"any more Pokmon titles\\" after Gold and Silver and would have moved on to other projects. However, the games' success following their release prompted Ishinhara to continue work on the series.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Pokmon games are role-playing video games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. These games, and their sequels, remakes, and English language translations, are considered the \\"main\\" Pokmon games, and the games which most fans of the series are referring to when they use the term \\"Pokmon games\\".[citation needed] All of the licensed Pokmon properties overseen by The Pokmon Company International are divided roughly by generation. These generations are roughly chronological divisions by release; every several years, when a sequel in the main series is released that features new Pokmon, characters, and gameplay concepts, that sequel is considered the start of a new generation of the franchise. The main games and their spin-offs, the anime, manga, and trading card game are all updated with the new Pokmon properties each time a new generation begins.[citation needed] The franchise began the seventh generation on November 18, 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pokmon franchise started off in its first generation with its initial release of Pocket Monsters Aka and Midori (\\"Red\\" and \\"Green\\", respectively) for the Game Boy in Japan on February 27, 1996. When these games proved popular, an enhanced Ao (\\"Blue\\") version was released sometime after, and the Ao version was reprogrammed as Pokmon Red and Blue for international release. The games released in the United States on September 30, 1998. The original Aka and Midori versions were not released outside Japan.[31] Afterwards, a further enhanced version titled Pokmon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition was released to partially take advantage of the color palette of the Game Boy Color, as well as to feature more elements from the Pokmon anime. This first generation of games introduced the original 151 species of Pokmon, in National Pokdex order, encompassing all Pokmon from Bulbasaur to Mew. It also introduced the basic game concepts of capturing, training, battling, and trading Pokmon with both computer and human players. These versions of the games take place within the fictional Kanto region, inspired by the real world Kant region of Japan, though the name \\"Kanto\\" was not used until the second generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second generation of Pokmon began in 1999 with the release of Pokmon Gold and Silver for Game Boy Color. Like the previous generation, an enhanced version titled Pokmon Crystal was later released. The second generation introduced 100 new species of Pokmon, starting with Chikorita and ending with Celebi. The Pokdex totaled 251 Pokmon to collect, train, and battle, set in Johto, inspired by Japan's Kansai region. The second generation of Pokmon also saw the release of the Pokmon Mini, a handheld game console released in November 2001 in North America, December 2001 in Japan, and 2002 in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nPokmon entered its third generation with the 2002 release of Pokmon Ruby and Sapphire for Game Boy Advance and continued with the Game Boy Advance remakes of Pokmon Red and Blue, Pokmon FireRed and LeafGreen, and an enhanced version of Pokmon Ruby and Sapphire titled Pokmon Emerald. The third generation introduced 135 new Pokmon, starting with Treecko and ending with Deoxys, for a total of 386 species. Pokmon Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald are set in Hoenn, inspired by Japan's Kyushu region. However, this generation also garnered some criticism for leaving out several gameplay features, including the day-and-night system introduced in the previous generation. It was also the first installment that encouraged the player to collect a selected assortment of the total number of Pokmon rather than every existing species. By contrast, 202 out of 386 species are catchable in the Ruby and Sapphire versions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, the fourth generation of the franchise began with the release of Pokmon Diamond and Pearl for Nintendo DS. The fourth generation introduced another 107 new species of Pokmon, starting with Turtwig and ending with Arceus, bringing the total of Pokmon species to 493.[32] The Nintendo DS \\"touch screen\\" allows new features to the game such as cooking poffins with the stylus and using the \\"Poktch\\". New gameplay concepts include a restructured move-classification system, online multiplayer trading and battling via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, the return and expansion of the second generation's day-and-night system, the expansion of the third generation's Pokmon Contests into \\"Super Contests\\", and the new region of Sinnoh. This region was inspired by Japan's Hokkaido region and part of Russia's Sakhalin, and has an underground component for multiplayer gameplay in addition to the main overworld. Pokmon Platinum, the enhanced version of Diamond and Pearlmuch like Pokmon Yellow, Crystal, and Emeraldwas released in September 2008 in Japan, March 2009 in North America, and May 2009 in Australia and Europe. Spin-off titles in the fourth generation include the Pokmon Stadium follow-up Pokmon Battle Revolution for Wii, which has Wi-Fi connectivity as well.[33] Nintendo announced in May 2009 that enhanced remakes of Pokmon Gold and Silver, entitled Pokmon HeartGold and SoulSilver, would be released for the Nintendo DS system. HeartGold and SoulSilver are set in the Johto region and were released in September 2009 in Japan[34] and March 2010 in North America.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fifth generation of Pokmon began on September 18, 2010, with the release of Pokmon Black and White in Japan for Nintendo DS.[36] The games were originally announced by the Pokmon Company on January 29, 2010, with a tentative release later that year.[37][38] The final release date of September 18 was announced on June 27, 2010.[39] This version is set in the Unova region (ÀÅA‘¥, Isshu-chih, Isshu region), inspired by New York City, and utilizes the Nintendo DS's 3D rendering capabilities to a greater extent than Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver. A total of 156 new Pokmon were introduced, starting with Victini and ending with Genesect, bringing the franchise's total to 649. This is the only time that the number of Pokmon introduced surpasses the number introduced in the first generation.[40] It also deployed new game mechanics such as the C Gear (C ß, C Gia) wireless interactivity features[41] and the ability to upload game data to the Internet and to the player's own computer.[42] Pokmon Black and White was released in Europe on March 4, 2011, in North America on March 6, 2011, and in Australia on March 10, 2011. On June 23, 2012, Nintendo released Pokmon Black 2 and Pokmon White 2 in Japan for Nintendo DS, with early October releases in North America and Europe. Black 2 and White 2 are sequels to Black and White, with several events in the second games referencing events in the first; they also allow players to link their previous Black or White with their Black 2 or White 2, introducing several events based on how they played their previous game.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnounced on January 8, 2013, and released simultaneously worldwide on October 12, 2013, Pokmon X and Pokmon Y for the Nintendo 3DS are part of the sixth generation of games.[43] Introducing the France-inspired Kalos region, these are the first Pokmon games rendered in 3D, and the first released worldwide together.[44]\\r\\nA total of 72 new Pokmon were introduced, starting with Chespin and ending with Volcanion, bringing the franchise's total to 721. The fewest new Pokmon in a single generation so far; however, the new Mega Evolution feature was added to the games to balance out the lack of new characters. Another addition was the Fairy typing, the first new type since Dark and Steel in the second generation. On May 7, 2014, Nintendo announced remakes of the third generation games Pokmon Ruby and Sapphire titled Pokmon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire which were released in Japan, North America, Australia, and South Korea on November 21, 2014, and in Europe on November 28, 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnounced on February 26, 2016, Pokmon Sun and Moon for the Nintendo 3DS are part of the seventh generation of games, and the celebrations for the 20th anniversary of the franchise, introducing the Hawaii-inspired Alola region. Both games were released worldwide on November 18, 2016, in nine languages; Japanese, English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Korean, and, for the first time, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified).[45] A total of 81 new Pokmon were introduced, bringing the total to 802. Though no new mega evolutions were added, a new type of form was added for specific Pokmon, called Alola Form, changing their types and move sets. A new type of move was added as well, called the Z-move. Usable by any Pokmon, Z-moves are extremely powerful and as such can only be used once per battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo more games, Pokmon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon were released on November 17, 2017. These games add five new Pokmon on top of the ones introduced into Sun and Moon, bringing the total to 807.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 29, 2018, it was announced that two new Pokmon games in the main Pokmon franchise, Pokmon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokmon: Let's Go, Eevee!, were going to be released on November 16, 2018. They are the first installments of the main Pokmon series for Nintendo Switch and are inspired by Pokmon Yellow with gameplay mechanics borrowed from Pokmon GO.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring E3 2017, Nintendo and The Pokmon Company announced that Game Freak was developing a new core Pokmon role-playing game set to release for the Nintendo Switch[46] in \\"2018 or later.\\"[47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the announcement of Pokmon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokmon: Let's Go, Eevee! it was confirmed that the previously-announced core Pokmon game was a separate game which will be released in late 2019. It was confirmed that game will be the eighth generation of Pokmon.[49] Game director Junichi Masuda stated that it will also \\"follow in the tradition of Pokmon X and Y and Pokmon Sun and Moon\\".[50][51] The CEO of The Pokmon Company, Tsunekazu Ishihara, also confirmed that the upcoming \\"core\\" Pokmon game will not have influences from Pokmon Go like Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! will have.[52][53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main staple of the Pokmon video game series revolves around the catching and battling of Pokmon. Starting with a starter Pokmon, the player can catch wild Pokmon by weakening them and catching them with Pok Balls. Conversely, they can choose to defeat them in battle in order to gain experience for their Pokmon, raising their levels and teaching them new moves. Most Pokmon have \\"evolution families\\", a term which refers to the Pokmon to evolve into or be evolved into more powerful forms by raising their levels or using certain items. Throughout the game, players will have to battle other trainers in order to progress, with the main goal to defeat various Gym Leaders/Trials and earn the right to become the regional champion. Subsequent games in the series have introduced various side games and side quests, including the Battle Frontiers that display unique battle types and the Pokmon Contests where visual appearance is put on display.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the consistent aspects of the Pokmon gamesspanning from Pokmon Red and Blue on the Game Boy to the Nintendo 3DS games Pokmon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moonis the choice of one of three different Pokmon at the start of the player's adventures; these three are often labeled \\"starter Pokmon\\". Players can choose a Grass-type, a Fire-type, or a Water-type.[54] For example, in Pokmon Red and Blue (and their respective remakes, Pokmon FireRed and Pokmon LeafGreen), the player has the choice of starting with Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle. The exception to this rule is Pokmon Yellow (a remake of the original games that loosely follows the story of the Pokmon anime), where players are given a Pikachu, an Electric-type mouse Pokmon, famous for being the mascot of the Pokmon media franchise; in this game, however, the three starter Pokmon from Red and Blue can be obtained by meeting certain requirements in game, such as Pikachu having full happiness.[55] Another consistent aspect is that the player's rival will always choose as his or her starter Pokmon the one that has a type advantage over the player's Pokmon. For instance, if the player picks a Grass-type Pokmon, the rival will always pick the Fire-type starter. An exception to this is again Pokmon Yellow, in which the rival picks an Eevee, but whether this Eevee evolves into Vaporeon, Jolteon, or Flareon is decided by when the player wins and loses to the rival through the journey. Pokmon Sun and Moon are also an exception where the rival will pick the starter weak toward the players, with the remaining starter used elsewhere. The GameCube games Pokmon Colosseum and Pokmon XD: Gale of Darkness also contain an exception; whereas in most games the player's initial Pokmon starts at Level 5, in these two games the player's initial Pokmon starts at Levels 10 and 25, respectively. In Colosseum the player's starter Pokmon are Espeon and Umbreon, while in Gale of Darkness the player's starter is Eevee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pokdex is an electronic device featured in the Pokmon video game, anime, and manga series. In the games, whenever a Pokmon is first captured, its data will be added to a player's Pokdex, but in the anime, the Pokdex is a comprehensive electronic reference encyclopedia, usually referred to in order to deliver exposition. \\"Pokdex\\" is also used to refer to a list of Pokmon, usually a list of Pokmon by number. In the video games, a Pokmon Trainer is issued a blank device at the start of the journey. A trainer must attempt to fill the Pokdex by encountering and at least briefly obtaining each of the different species of Pokmon. A player will receive the name and image of a Pokmon after encountering one that was not previously in the Pokdex, typically after battling said Pokmon either in the wild or in a trainer battle (with the exceptions of link battles and tournament battles, such as in the Battle Frontier). In Pokmon Red and Blue, some Pokmon's data is added to the Pokdex by viewing the Pokmon, such as in the zoo outside the Safari Zone. Also, certain NPC characters may add to the Pokdex by explaining what a Pokmon looks like during conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore detailed information is available after the player obtains a member of the species, either through capturing the Pokmon in the wild, evolving a previously captured Pokmon, hatching a Pokmon egg (from the second generation onwards), or through a trade with another trainer (either an NPC or another player). This information includes height, weight, species type, typing, and a short description of the Pokmon. Later versions of the Pokdex have more detailed information, like the size of a certain Pokmon compared to the player character, or Pokmon being sorted by their habitat (so far, the latter feature is only in the FireRed and LeafGreen versions). The most current forms of Pokdex are capable of containing information on all Pokmon known. The GameCube games, Pokmon Colosseum and Pokmon XD: Gale of Darkness, have a Pokmon Digital Assistant (PDA) which is similar to the Pokdex, but also tells what types are effective against a Pokmon and gives a description of its abilities.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pokmon anime series and films are a meta-series of adventures usually separate from the canon that most of the Pokmon video games follow (with the exception of Pokmon Yellow, a game based loosely on the anime storyline). The anime follows the quest of the main character, Ash Ketchum (known as Satoshi in Japan), a Pokmon Master in training, as he and a small group of friends travel around the world of Pokmon along with their Pokmon partners.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original series, titled Pocket Monsters, or Pokmon in Western countries, begins with Ash's first day as a Pokmon trainer. His first and signature Pokmon is a Pikachu, differing from the games, where only Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle could be chosen.[58] The series follows the storyline of the original games, Pokmon Red and Blue, in the region of Kanto. Accompanying Ash on his journeys are Brock, the Pewter City Gym Leader, and Misty, the youngest of the Gym Leader sisters from Cerulean City. Pokmon: Adventures in the Orange Islands follows Ash's adventures in the Orange Islands, a place unique to the anime, and replaces Brock with Tracey Sketchit, an artist and \\"Pokmon watcher\\". The next series, based on the second generation of games, include Pokmon: Johto Journeys, Pokmon: Johto League Champions, and Pokmon: Master Quest, following the original trio of Ash, Brock, and Misty in the western Johto region.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe saga continues in Pokmon: Advanced, based on the third generation games. Ash and company travel to Hoenn, a southern region in the Pokmon world. Ash takes on the role of a teacher and mentor for a novice Pokmon trainer named May. Her brother Max accompanies them, and though he is not a trainer, he knows large amounts of information. Brock soon catches up with Ash, but Misty has returned to Cerulean City to tend to her duties as a gym leader (Misty, along with other recurring characters, appears in the spin-off series Pokmon Chronicles). The Advanced series concludes with the Battle Frontier saga, based on the Emerald version and including aspects of FireRed and LeafGreen. It ended with Max leaving to pick his starter Pokmon and May going to the Grand Festival in Johto.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Diamond and Pearl series, based on the fourth generation games, Ash, Brock, and a new companion, an aspiring Pokmon coordinator named Dawn, travel through the region of Sinnoh. At the end of the series, Ash and Brock return to Kanto where Brock begins to follow his newfound dream of becoming a Pokmon doctor himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nPocket Monsters: Best Wishes!, based on the fifth generation games, features Ash and Pikachu traveling through the region of Unova (Isshu in Japan) alongside two new companions, Iris and Cilan (Dent in Japan) who part ways with them after returning to Kanto.\\r\\n\\r\\nPocket Monsters: XY (Ã∏∆πXY, Poketo Monsut Ekkusu Wai), is the current airing series based on the sixth generation games, following Ash and Pikachu's journey through the region of Kalos, accompanied by Ash's childhood friend Serena and the siblings Clemont and Bonnie.[59][60][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the TV series, twenty Pokmon films have been made as of July 2017, with the pair of films, Pokmon the Movie: BlackVictini and Reshiram and WhiteVictini and Zekrom considered together as one. Collectibles, such as promotional trading cards, have been available with some of the films. Various children's books, collectively known as Pokmon Junior, are also based on the anime.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven release years are the original Japanese release years. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2016, it was announced by The Hollywood Reporter that Warner Bros. Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Legendary Pictures were in negotiations with The Pokmon Company for a live-action Pokmon movie.[63] The partnership sees Toho distributing the film in Japan, with Warner Bros. distributing it internationally. [64][65] Nicole Perlman and Alex Hirsch were penning the script.[66] Originally, Chris McKay, Robert Rodriguez, Tim Miller, Mark A.Z. Dipp, Shane Acker and Chris Wedge were being considered as potential directors.[citation needed] On November 30, 2016, Deadline reported that The Pokmon Company and Legendary Entertainment had chosen Rob Letterman to direct the film.[67] It was announced that the film would be titled Detective Pikachu.[68] Detective Pikachu started production in January 2018,[24] and concluded in May 2018.[69] On August 24, 2018, the film was retitled Pokmon: Detective Pikachu, and the film's logo was revealed the same day.[70] It is set to release in May 10, 2019.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nPokmon CDs have been released in North America, most of them in conjunction with the theatrical releases of the first three Pokmon films. These releases were commonplace until late 2001. On March 27, 2007, a tenth anniversary CD was released containing 18 tracks from the English dub; this was the first English-language release in over five years. Soundtracks of the Pokmon feature films have been released in Japan each year in conjunction with the theatrical releases.\\r\\n\\r\\n^1  The exact date of release is unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\n The Pokmon Trading Card Game (TCG) is a collectible card game with a goal similar to a Pokmon battle in the video game series. Players use Pokmon cards, with individual strengths and weaknesses, in an attempt to defeat their opponent by \\"knocking out\\" their Pokmon cards.[73] The game was published in North America by Wizards of the Coast in 1999.[74] With the release of Pokmon Ruby and Sapphire Game Boy Advance video games, The Pokmon Company took back the card game from Wizards of the Coast and started publishing the cards themselves.[74] The Expedition expansion introduced the Pokmon-e Trading Card Game, where the cards (for the most part) were compatible with the Nintendo e-Reader. Nintendo discontinued its production of e-Reader compatible cards with the release of FireRed and LeafGreen. In 1998, Nintendo released a Game Boy Color version of the trading card game in Japan; Pokmon Trading Card Game was subsequently released to the US and Europe in 2000. The game included digital versions cards from the original set of cards and the first two expansions (Jungle and Fossil), as well as several cards exclusive to the game. A sequel was released in Japan in 2001.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are various Pokmon manga series, four of which were released in English by Viz Media, and seven of them released in English by Chuang Yi. The manga series vary from game-based series to being based on the anime and the Trading Card Game. Original stories have also been published. As there are several series created by different authors, most Pokmon manga series differ greatly from each other and other media, such as the anime.[citation needed] Pokmon Pocket Monsters and Pokmon Adventures are the two manga in production since the first generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Pokmon-styled Monopoly board game was released in August 2014.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nPokmon has been criticized by some Christians over perceived occult and violent themes and the concept of \\"Pokmon evolution\\", which they feel goes against the Biblical creation account in Genesis.[91] Sat2000, a satellite television station based in Vatican City, has countered that the Pokmon Trading Card Game and video games are \\"full of inventive imagination\\" and have no \\"harmful moral side effects\\".[92][93] In the United Kingdom, the \\"Christian Power Cards\\" game was introduced in 1999 by David Tate who stated, \\"Some people aren't happy with Pokmon and want an alternative, others just want Christian games.\\" The game was similar to the Pokmon Trading Card Game but used Biblical figures.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999, Nintendo stopped manufacturing the Japanese version of the \\"Koga's Ninja Trick\\" trading card because it depicted a manji, a traditionally Buddhist symbol with no negative connotations. The Jewish civil rights group Anti-Defamation League complained because the symbol is the reverse of a swastika, a Nazi symbol. The cards were intended for sale in Japan only, but the popularity of Pokmon led to import into the United States with approval from Nintendo. The Anti-Defamation League understood that the issue symbol was not intended to offend and acknowledged the sensitivity that Nintendo showed by removing the product.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999, two nine-year-old boys from Merrick, New York sued Nintendo because they claimed the Pokmon Trading Card Game caused their problematic gambling.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, Saudi Arabia banned Pokmon games and the trading cards, alleging that the franchise promoted Zionism by displaying the Star of David in the trading cards (a six-pointed star is featured in the card game) as well as other religious symbols such as crosses they associated with Christianity and triangles they associated with Freemasonry; the games also involved gambling, which is in violation of Muslim doctrine.[97][98]\\r\\n\\r\\nPokmon has also been accused of promoting materialism.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, PETA criticized the concept of Pokmon as supporting cruelty to animals. PETA compared the game's concept, of capturing animals and forcing them to fight, to cockfights, dog fighting rings and circuses, events frequently criticized for cruelty to animals. PETA released a game spoofing Pokmon where the Pokmon battle their trainers to win their freedom.[100] PETA reaffirmed their objections in 2016 with the release of Pokmon Go, promoting the hashtag #GottaFreeThemAll.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 16, 1997, more than 635 Japanese children were admitted to hospitals with epileptic seizures.[102] It was determined the seizures were caused by watching an episode of Pokmon \\"Denn Senshi Porygon\\", (most commonly translated \\"Electric Soldier Porygon\\", season 1, episode 38); as a result, this episode has not been aired since. In this particular episode, there were bright explosions with rapidly alternating blue and red color patterns.[103] It was determined in subsequent research that these strobing light effects cause some individuals to have epileptic seizures, even if the person had no previous history of epilepsy.[104] This incident is a common focus of Pokmon-related parodies in other media, and was lampooned by The Simpsons episode \\"Thirty Minutes over Tokyo\\"[105] and the South Park episode \\"Chinpokomon\\",[106] among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2000, Morrison Entertainment Group, a toy developer based at Manhattan Beach, California, sued Nintendo over claims that Pokmon infringed on its own Monster in My Pocket characters. A judge ruled there was no infringement and Morrison appealed the ruling. On February 4, 2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision by the District Court to dismiss the suit.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin its first two days of release, Pokmon Go raised safety concerns among players. Multiple people also suffered minor injuries from falling while playing the game due to being distracted.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nMultiple police departments in various countries have issued warnings, some tongue-in-cheek, regarding inattentive driving, trespassing, and being targeted by criminals due to being unaware of one's surroundings.[109][110] People have suffered various injuries from accidents related to the game,[111][112][113][114] and Bosnian players have been warned to stay out of minefields left over from the 1990s Bosnian War.[115] On July 20, 2016, it was reported that an 18-year-old boy in Chiquimula, Guatemala was shot and killed while playing the game in the late evening hours.[116] This was the first reported death in connection with the app. The boy's 17-year-old cousin, who was accompanying the victim, was shot in the foot. Police speculated that the shooters used the game's GPS capability to find the two.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nPokmon, being a globally popular franchise, has left a significant mark on today's popular culture. The Pokmon characters have become pop culture icons; examples include two different Pikachu balloons in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Pokmon-themed airplanes operated by All Nippon Airways, merchandise items, and a traveling theme park that was in Nagoya, Japan in 2005 and in Taipei in 2006. Pokmon also appeared on the cover of the U.S. magazine Time in 1999. The Comedy Central show Drawn Together has a character named Ling-Ling who is a parody of Pikachu.[118] Several other shows such as ReBoot, The Simpsons, South Park, The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy, Robot Chicken, All Grown Up!, and Johnny Test have made references and spoofs of Pokmon, among other series. Pokmon was featured on VH1's I Love the '90s: Part Deux. A live action show called Pokmon Live! toured the United States in late 2000. It was based on the Pokmon anime.[citation needed] Jim Butcher cites Pokmon as one of the inspirations for the Codex Alera series of novels.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2001, Nintendo opened a store called the Pokmon Center in New York, in Rockefeller Center,[119] modeled after the two other Pokmon Center stores in Tokyo and Osaka and named after a staple of the video game series. Pokmon Centers are fictional buildings where Trainers take their injured Pokmon to be healed after combat.[120] The store sold Pokmon merchandise on a total of two floors, with items ranging from collectible shirts to stuffed Pokmon plushies.[121] The store also featured a Pokmon Distributing Machine in which players would place their game to receive an egg of a Pokmon that was being given out at that time. The store also had tables that were open for players of the Pokmon Trading Card Game to duel each other or an employee. The store was closed and replaced by the Nintendo World Store on May 14, 2005.[122] Three Pokmon Center kiosks were put in malls in Washington, with one in Tacoma and one in Seattle remaining.[123][unreliable source?] The Pokmon Center online store was relaunched on August 6, 2014.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor of Education Joseph Tobin theorizes that the success of the franchise was due to the long list of names that could be learned by children and repeated in their peer groups. Its rich fictional universe provides opportunities for discussion and demonstration of knowledge in front of their peers. For the French versions of Pokmon media, Nintendo took care to translate the name of the creatures so that they reflected French culture and language. The names of the creatures were linked to its characteristics, which converged with the children's belief that names have symbolic power. Children can pick their favourite Pokmon and affirm their individuality while at the same time affirming their conformance to the values of the group, and they can distinguish themselves from others by asserting what they liked and what they did not like from every chapter. Pokmon gained popularity because it provides a sense of identity to a wide variety of children, and lost it quickly when many of those children found that the identity groups were too big and searched for identities that would distinguish them into smaller groups.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nPokmon's history has been marked at times by rivalry with the Digimon media franchise that debuted at a similar time. Described as \\"the other 'mon'\\" by IGN's Juan Castro, Digimon has not enjoyed Pokmon's level of international popularity or success, but has maintained a dedicated fanbase.[126] IGN's Lucas M. Thomas stated that Pokmon is Digimon's \\"constant competition and comparison\\", attributing the former's relative success to the simplicity of its evolution mechanic as opposed to Digivolution.[127] The two have been noted for conceptual and stylistic similarities by sources such as GameZone.[128] A debate among fans exists over which of the two franchises came first.[129] In actuality, the first Pokmon media, Pokmon Red and Green, were released initially on February 27, 1996;[130] whereas the Digimon virtual pet was released on June 26, 1997.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Pokmon's target demographic is children, early purchasers of Pokmon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire were in their 20s.[131] Many fans are adults who originally played the games as children and later returned to the series.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBulbapedia, a wiki-based encyclopedia[132] associated with longtime fan site Bulbagarden,[133][134] is the \\"Internet's most detailed Pokmon database project\\".[135] Bulbapedia received a mobile makeover with the release of BulbaGo, the app for Bulbapedia. The app's developer, Jonathan Zarra, was the same that created the location based chat app GoChat for Pokmon Go. The Bulbapedia App was so successful that within three days of its release, it was acquired by Bulbapedia and turned into its official app.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA significant community around the Pokmon video games' metagame has existed for a long time, analyzing the best ways to use each Pokmon to their full potential in competitive battles. The most prolific competitive community is Smogon University, which has created a widely accepted tier-based battle system.[136]\\r\\nSmogon is affiliated with an online Pokmon game called Pokmon Showdown, in which players create a team and battle against other players around the world using the competitive tiers created by Smogon.[137]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2014, an anonymous video streamer on Twitch launched Twitch Plays Pokmon, an experiment trying to crowdsource playing subsequent Pokmon games, starting with Pokmon Red.[138][139]\\r\\n\\r\\nA challenge called the Nuzlocke Challenge was created in order for older players of the series to enjoy Pokmon againbut with a twist. When a Pokmon faints it is considered \\"dead\\" and must be released or stored in the PC permanently.[140] If the player faints the game is considered over and the player must restart.[141] The original idea consisted of 2 to 3 rules that the community has built upon. There are many fan made Pokmon games made that contains a game mode similar to the Nuzlocke Challenge, such as Pokmon Uranium.[142]","input":"When did pokemon first come out in japan?"},{"output":"Wesley Snipes","context":"","input":"Who is the creator of the movie black panther?"},{"output":"Germany","context":"The Central Powers (German: Mittelm?chte; Hungarian: K?zponti hatalmak; Turkish: ?ttifak Devletleri / Ba?la?ma Devletleri; Bulgarian: √ø“∞ “∂, translit.?Tsentralni sili), consisting of Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria?√ø hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance[1] (German: Vierbund)?√ø was one of the two main factions during World War?I (1914√ø18). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente. The Powers' origin was the alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1879. The Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria did not join until after World War I had begun, although the Ottoman Empire retained close relations with both Germany and Austria-Hungary since the beginning of the 20th century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Central Powers consisted of the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the beginning of the war. The Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers later in 1914. In 1915, the Kingdom of Bulgaria joined the alliance. The name \\"Central Powers\\" is derived from the location of these countries; all four (including the other groups that supported them except for Finland and Lithuania) were located between the Russian Empire in the east and France and the United Kingdom in the west. Finland, Azerbaijan, and Lithuania joined them in 1918 before the war ended and after the Russian Empire collapsed.\\r\\nThe Central Powers were composed of the following nations:[2]\\r\\nIn early July 1914, in the aftermath of the assassination of Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the immediate likelihood of war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, Kaiser Wilhelm II and the German government informed the Austro-Hungarian government that Germany would uphold its alliance with Austria-Hungary and defend it from possible Russian intervention if a war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia took place.[5] When Russia enacted a general mobilization, Germany viewed the act as provocative.[6] The Russian government promised Germany that its general mobilization did not mean preparation for war with Germany but was a reaction to the events between Austria-Hungary and Serbia.[6] The German government regarded the Russian promise of no war with Germany to be nonsense in light of its general mobilization, and Germany, in turn, mobilized for war.[6] On 1 August, Germany sent an ultimatum to Russia stating that since both Germany and Russia were in a state of military mobilization, an effective state of war existed between the two countries.[7] Later that day, France, an ally of Russia, declared a state of general mobilization.[7]\\r\\nIn August 1914, Germany waged war on Russia, the German government justified military action against Russia as necessary because of Russian aggression as demonstrated by the mobilization of the Russian army that had resulted in Germany mobilizing in response.[8]\\r\\nAfter Germany declared war on Russia, France with its alliance with Russia prepared a general mobilization in expectation of war. On 3 August 1914, Germany responded to this action by declaring war on France.[9] Germany, facing a two-front war, enacted what was known as the Schlieffen Plan, that involved German armed forces needing to move through Belgium and swing south into France and towards the French capital of Paris. This plan was hoped to quickly gain victory against the French and allow German forces to concentrate on the Eastern Front. Belgium was a neutral country and would not accept German forces crossing its territory. Germany disregarded Belgian neutrality and invaded the country to launch an offensive towards Paris. This caused Great Britain to declare war against the German Empire, as the action violated the Treaty of London that both nations signed in 1839 guaranteeing Belgian neutrality and defense of the kingdom if a nation reneged.\\r\\nSubsequently, several states declared war on Germany in late August 1914, with Italy declaring war on Austria-Hungary in 1915 and Germany on 27 August 1916, the United States declaring war on Germany on 6 April 1917 and Greece declaring war on Germany in July 1917.\\r\\nUpon its founding in 1871, the German Empire controlled Alsace-Lorraine as an \\"imperial territory\\" incorporated from France after the Franco-Prussian War. It was held as part of Germany's sovereign territory.\\r\\nGermany held multiple African colonies at the time of World War I. All of Germany's African colonies were invaded and occupied by Allied forces during the war.\\r\\nCameroon, German East Africa, and German Southwest Africa were German colonies in Africa. Togoland was a German protectorate in Africa.\\r\\nThe Kiautschou Bay concession was a German dependency in East Asia leased from China in 1898. It was occupied by Japanese forces following the Siege of Tsingtao.\\r\\nGerman New Guinea was a German protectorate in the Pacific. It was occupied by Australian forces in 1914.\\r\\nGerman Samoa was a German protectorate following the Tripartite Convention. It was occupied by the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in 1914.\\r\\nAustria-Hungary regarded the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand as being orchestrated with the assistance of Serbia.[5] The country viewed the assassination as setting a dangerous precedent of encouraging the country's South Slav population to rebel and threaten to tear apart the multinational country.[6] Austria-Hungary formally sent an ultimatum to Serbia demanding a full-scale investigation of Serbian government complicity in the assassination, and complete compliance by Serbia in agreeing to the terms demanded by Austria-Hungary.[5] Serbia submitted to accept most of the demands, however Austria-Hungary viewed this as insufficient and used this lack of full compliance to justify military intervention.[10] These demands have been viewed as a diplomatic cover for what was going to be an inevitable Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia.[10]\\r\\nAustria-Hungary had been warned by Russia that the Russian government would not tolerate Austria-Hungary crushing Serbia.[10] However, with Germany supporting Austria-Hungary's actions, the Austro-Hungarian government hoped that Russia would not intervene and that the conflict with Serbia would be a regional conflict.[5]\\r\\nAustria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia resulted in Russia declaring war on the country and Germany in turn declared war on Russia, setting off the beginning of the clash of alliances that resulted in the World War.\\r\\nAustria-Hungary was internally divided into two states with their own governments, joined in communion through the Habsburg throne. Austrian Cisleithania contained various duchies and principalities but also the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of Dalmatia, the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. Hungarian Transleithania comprised the Kingdom of Hungary and the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. In Bosnia and Herzegovina sovereign authority was shared by both Austria and Hungary.\\r\\nThe Ottoman Empire joined the war on the side of the Central Powers in November 1914. The Ottoman Empire had gained strong economic connections with Germany through the Berlin-to-Baghdad railway project that was still incomplete at the time.[11] The Ottoman Empire made a formal alliance with Germany signed on 2 August 1914.[12] The alliance treaty expected that the Ottoman Empire would become involved in the conflict in a short amount of time.[12] However, for the first several months of the war the Ottoman Empire maintained neutrality though it allowed a German naval squadron to enter and stay near the strait of Bosphorus.[13] Ottoman officials informed the German government that the country needed time to prepare for conflict.[13] Germany provided financial aid and weapons shipments to the Ottoman Empire.[12]\\r\\nAfter pressure escalated from the German government demanding that the Ottoman Empire fulfill its treaty obligations, or else Germany would expel the country from the alliance and terminate economic and military assistance, the Ottoman government entered the war with the recently acquired cruisers from Germany, the Yavuz Sultan Selim (formerly SMS Goeben) and the Midilli (formerly SMS Breslau) launching a naval raid on the Russian port of Odessa, thus engaging in a military action in accordance with its alliance obligations with Germany. Russia and the Triple Entente declared war on the Ottoman Empire.[14]\\r\\nBulgaria was still resentful after its defeat in July 1913 at the hands of Serbia, Greece and Romania. It signed a treaty of defensive alliance with the Ottoman Empire on 19 August 1914. It was the last country to join the Central Powers, which Bulgaria did in October 1915 by declaring war on Serbia. It invaded Serbia in conjunction with German and Austro-Hungarian forces. Bulgaria held claims on the region of Vardar Macedonia then held by Serbia following the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 and (from the Bulgarian point of view), the costly Treaty of Bucharest (1913).[15] As a condition of entering WW1 on the side of the Central Powers, Bulgaria was granted the right to reclaim that territory.[16]\\r\\nThe Dervish State was a rebel Somali state seeking independence of Somali territories. Dervish forces fought against Italian and British forces in Italian Somaliland and British Somaliland during World War I in the Somaliland Campaign. The Dervish State received support from Germany and the Ottoman Empire. It also briefly received support by the Ethiopian Empire from 1915-1916.[17]\\r\\nIn opposition to the Union of South Africa, which had joined the war, Boer rebels founded the South African Republic in 1914 and engaged in the Maritz Rebellion. Germany assisted the rebels, and the rebels operated in and out of the German colony of German South-West Africa. The rebels were defeated by British imperial forces.\\r\\nThe Sultanate of Darfur forces fought against British forces in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan during World War I in the Anglo-Egyptian Darfur Expedition.\\r\\nDuring 1917 and 1918, the Finns under Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim and Lithuanian nationalists fought Russia for a common cause. With the Bolshevik attack of late 1917, the General Secretariat of Ukraine sought military protection first from the Central Powers and later from the armed forces of the Entente.\\r\\nThe Ottoman Empire also had its own allies in Azerbaijan and the Northern Caucasus. The three nations fought alongside each other under the Army of Islam in the Battle of Baku.\\r\\nThe Belarusian People's Republic was a client state of Germany created in 1918.\\r\\nThe Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was a client state of Germany created in 1918.\\r\\nThe Crimean Regional Government was a client state of Germany created in 1918.\\r\\nThe Don Republic was closely associated with the German Empire and fought against the Bolsheviks.\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Finland was a client state of Germany created in 1918.

Soon after Ottoman Empire invaded republic and quickly reached Borjomi. this forced Georgia to ask for help from Germany which they got. Germany forced Ottomans too withdraw from Georgian territories and recognize its sovereignty on its borders. Germany, Georgia and Ottomans signed a peace treaty, the Treaty of Batum which ended conflict with last two. in return Georgia become Germany's \\"ally\\". this time period of Georgian-German friendship was known as German Caucasus expedition.\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Poland was a client state of Germany created in 1916.[18] This government was recognized by the emperors of Germany and Austria-Hungary in November 1916, and it adopted a constitution in 1917.[19] The decision to create a state of Poland was taken by Germany in order to attempt to legitimize its military occupation amongst the Polish inhabitants, following upon German propaganda sent to Polish inhabitants in 1915 that German soldiers were arriving as liberators to free Poland from subjugation by Russia.[20] The state was utilized by the German government alongside punitive threats to induce Polish landowners living in the German-occupied Baltic territories to move to the state and sell their Baltic property to Germans in exchange for moving to Poland, and efforts were made to induce similar emigration of Poles from Prussia to the state.[21]\\r\\nThe Ukrainian State was a client state of Germany led by Pavlo Skoropadskyi, who overthrew the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic.[22]\\r\\nThe United Baltic Duchy was a proposed client state of Germany created in 1918.\\r\\nIn 1918, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, facing Bolshevik revolution and opposition from the Muslim Musavat Party, was then occupied by the Ottoman Empire, which expelled the Bolsheviks while supporting the Musavat Party.[23] The Ottoman Empire maintained a presence in Azerbaijan until the end of the war in November 1918.[23]\\r\\nJabal Shammar was an Arab state in the Middle East that was closely associated with the Ottoman Empire.[24]\\r\\nStates listed in this section were not officially members of the Central Powers, but at some point during the war engaged in cooperation with one or more Central Powers members on level that makes their neutrality disputable.\\r\\nDuring the Somaliland Campaign, from the period of 1915 to 1916, the Ethiopian Empire gave aid to the Dervish state.\\r\\nOther movements supported the efforts of the Central Powers for their own reasons, such as the radical Irish Nationalists who launched the Easter Rising in Dublin in April 1916; they referred to their \\"gallant allies in Europe\\". However, the majority of Irish Nationalists supported the British and allied war effort up until 1916 when the Irish political landscape was changing. In 1914, J‹ázef Pi?sudski was permitted by Germany and Austria-Hungary to form independent Polish legions. Pi?sudski wanted his legions to help the Central Powers defeat Russia and then side with France and the UK and win the war with them.\\r\\nBulgaria signed an armistice with the Allies on 29 September 1918, following a successful Allied advance in Macedonia. The Ottoman Empire followed suit on 30 October 1918 in the face of British and Arab gains in Palestine and Syria. Austria and Hungary concluded ceasefires separately during the first week of November following the disintegration of the Habsburg Empire and the Italian offensive at Vittorio Veneto; Germany signed the armistice ending the war on the morning of 11 November 1918 after the Hundred Days Offensive, and a succession of advances by New Zealand, Australian, Canadian, Belgian, British, French and US forces in north-eastern France and Belgium. There was no unified treaty ending the war; the Central Powers were dealt with in separate treaties.[25]\\r\\nCentral Powers' military deaths.\\r\\nA postcard depicting the flags of the Central Powers' countries.\\r\\nThe collapse of the Central Powers in 1918.\\r\\nThe Leaders of Central Powers in 1914.","input":"What nations were the central powers in ww1?"},{"output":"September 1939","context":"During World War II, many South Africans saw military service. The Union of South Africa participated with other British Commonwealth forces in battles in North Africa against Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps, and many South African pilots joined the Royal Air Force and fought against the Axis powers in the European theatre.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the eve of World War II, the Union of South Africa found itself in a unique political and military quandary. While it was closely allied with Great Britain, being a co-equal Dominion under the 1931 Statute of Westminster with its head of state being the British king, the South African Prime Minister on 1 September 1939 was J.B.M. Hertzog √ø the leader of the pro-Afrikaner and anti-British National Party. The National Party had joined in a unity government with the pro-British South African Party of Jan Smuts in 1934 as the United Party.\\r\\nHertzog's problem was that South Africa was constitutionally obligated to support Great Britain against Nazi Germany. The Polish-British Common Defence Pact obligated Britain, and in turn its dominions, to help Poland if attacked by the Nazis. When Adolf Hitler's forces attacked Poland on 1 September 1939, Britain declared war on Germany two days later. A short but furious debate unfolded in South Africa, especially in the halls of power in the Parliament of South Africa. It pitted those who sought to enter the war on Britain's side, led by Smuts, against those who wanted to keep South Africa neutral, led by Hertzog.\\r\\nOn 4 September 1939, the United Party caucus refused to accept Hertzog's stance of neutrality in World War II and deposed him in favour of Smuts. Upon becoming Prime Minister, Smuts declared South Africa officially at war with Germany and the Axis. He immediately set about fortifying South Africa against any possible German sea invasion because of South Africa's global strategic importance controlling the long sea route around the Cape of Good Hope.\\r\\nJohn Vorster and other members of the pro-Nazi Ossewabrandwag strongly objected to South Africa's participation in World War II and actively carried out sabotage against Smuts' government. Smuts took severe action against the Ossewabrandwag movement and jailed its leaders, including Vorster, for the duration of the war.\\r\\nField Marshal Jan Smuts was the only important non-British general whose advice was constantly sought by Britain's war-time Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Smuts was invited to the Imperial War Cabinet in 1939 as the most senior South African in favour of war. On 28 May 1941, Smuts was appointed a Field Marshal of the British Army, becoming the first South African to hold that rank. Ultimately, Smuts would pay a steep political price for his closeness to the British establishment, to the King, and to Churchill which had made Smuts very unpopular amongst the Afrikaners, leading to his eventual downfall.\\r\\nWith the declaration of war in September 1939, the South African Army numbered only 5,353 regulars,[1] with an additional 14,631 men of the Active Citizen Force (ACF) which gave peace time training to volunteers and in time of war would form the main body of the army. Pre-war plans did not anticipate that the army would fight outside southern Africa and it was trained and equipped only for bush warfare.\\r\\nOne of the problems to continuously face South Africa during the war was the shortage of available men. Due to its race policies it would only consider arming men of European descent which limited the available pool of men aged between 20 and 40 to around 320,000. In addition the declaration of war on Germany had the support of only a narrow majority in the South African parliament and was far from universally popular. Indeed, there was a significant minority actively opposed to the war and under these conditions conscription was never an option. The expansion of the army and its deployment overseas depended entirely on volunteers.\\r\\nGiven the country's attitudes to race, it is not surprising that the enlistment of fighting troops from the much larger black population was hardly considered. Instead, in an attempt to free up as many whites as possible for the fighting and technical arms, a number of corps were formed to provide drivers and pioneers, drawn from the more acceptable Cape Coloured and Indian populations. These were eventually amalgamated into the Cape Corps. A Native Military Corps, manned by blacks, was also formed for pioneer and labouring tasks. For some of their tasks, individuals were armed, mainly for self-protection and guard duties, but they were never allowed to participate in actual combat against Europeans.\\r\\nSouth Africa and its military forces contributed in many theaters of war. South Africa's contribution consisted mainly of supplying troops, airmen and material for the North African campaign (the Desert War) and the Italian Campaign as well as to Allied ships that docked at its crucial ports adjoining the Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean that converge at the tip of Southern Africa. Numerous volunteers also flew for the Royal Air Force.\\r\\nAbout 334,000 men volunteered for full-time service in the South African Army during the war (including some 211,000 white, 77,000 black and 46,000 coloured and Indian servicemen).

Coco de mer is endemic to the Seychelles islands of Praslin and Curieuse. Before the Seychelles were discovered and settled, nuts of this species were sometimes carried by the ocean currents to distant shores, such as those of the Maldives, where the tree was unknown. These floating nuts did not germinate. The exceptional size and suggestive form of the nut, the circumstances of its discovery, and some unusual qualities of the trees have given rise to several legends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nut of the coco de mer is very large (the largest seed in the plant kingdom) and is oddly shaped, being the shape and size of a woman's disembodied buttocks on one side, and a woman's belly and thighs on the other side. Not surprisingly, this nut was viewed by people in other parts of the world as a rare and fascinating object with mythological and even magical properties. The nature and origin of this extraordinary nut was mysterious, and the propagation of the tree was not understood. A number of legends arose both about the nuts, and about the trees that produce them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coco de mer palm has separate male and female trees, unlike the coconut palm. And, unlike the more familiar fruit of the coconut tree, the coco de mer fruit is not adapted to disperse naturally by floating on the ocean water. When a coco de mer fruit falls into the sea, it cannot float because of its great weight and density; instead it sinks to the bottom. However, after the fruit has been on the sea bed for a considerable period of time, the husk drops off, the internal parts of the nut decay, and  the gases that form inside the nut cause the bare nut to rise up to the surface. At that time the nut can float, but is no longer fertile, thus when the ocean currents cause the nut to wash up on a distant beach, for example in the Maldives, a tree cannot, and does not, grow from the nut. The name coco de mer is French, and means \\"coconut of the sea\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nMalay seamen had seen coco de mer nuts \\"falling upwards\\" from the sea bed, and so they had reasoned that these nuts must grow on underwater trees, in a forest at the bottom of the Indian Ocean. According  to Antonio Pigafetta  and Georg Eberhard Rumphius, Malay people believed  that the tree was also the home of the huge bird or bird-like creature Garuda (or Rukh of the Arabs).[1] African priests believed that the Garuda was capable of hunting elephants and tigers. The African priests also believe that sometimes the coco de mer trees rose up above the ocean surface, and when this happened, the waves that the trees created did not allow any ship nearby to sail away and the helpless sailors were eaten by the Garuda.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nuts that were found in the ocean and on the beaches no longer had a husk,  and resembled the dismembered lower part of a woman's body, including the buttocks. This association is reflected in one of the plant's archaic botanical names, Lodoicea callipyge Comm. ex J. St.-Hil., in which callipyge is from the Greek words meaning \\"beautiful rump\\". Historically these floating \\"beautiful rumps\\" were collected and sold for a fortune in Arabia and in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Maldives, any coco de mer nuts that were found in the ocean or on the beaches were supposed to be given to the king, and keeping a nut for yourself or selling it could have resulted in the death penalty.[2] However, Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor was able to purchase one of these nuts for 4,000 gold florins. The Dutch Admiral Wolfert Hermanssen also received a nut as a gift for his services, from the Sultan of Bantam in 1602, for fighting the Portuguese and protecting the capital of Bantam. However, the nut that the admiral was given was missing the top part; apparently the Sultan had ordered the top of the nut to be cut off, in order not to upset the noble admirals modesty.[3][4] Jo?o de Barros believed that coco de mer possessed amazing healing powers, superior even to those of \\"the precious stone Bezoar\\".[4] In one of his books, Dr.?Berthold Carl Seemann mentioned that many believed the nuts to be an antidote to all poisons.[2] The nuts were praised not only by scientists and botanists, but also by poets. Lus de Cam?es wrote: \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1769, Jean Duchemin sailed to Praslin, the second largest island in the Seychelles, on the ship LHeureuse Marie. He loaded up with a cargo of these unusual nuts, which he later sold in Indian markets. After his trip, coco de mer nuts never again held the same extraordinary value.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew legends about the coco de mer came into existence after 1743, when the real coco de mer trees were discovered. Fruits of coco de mer are developed only on female trees. Male trees have long phallic-looking catkins. Because of these unusual, erotic shapes, some people believed that the trees made passionate love on stormy nights.  According to the legend, male trees uproot themselves, and approach female trees. Apparently the love-making trees are rather shy, and the legend has it that whoever sees the trees mating will die or go blind. The fact that even  now the pollination of the coco de mer is not fully understood, is one of the factors behind the legend.[7][8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Victorian era, General Charles George Gordon, who visited the Seychelles in 1881, believed that the Valle de Mai on the island of Praslin was the original Garden of Eden as described in the Bible, and that the coco de mer was the forbidden fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.[10] General Gordon wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt occurred to at least some of Gordon's readers that if coco de mer was really the forbidden fruit, Eve would have had a very hard time handing this gigantic fruit (which weighs 15√ø30?kg) to Adam.[12]","input":"Where does the coco de mer tree grow?"},{"output":"Castle Drogo","context":"Castle Drogo is a country house and castle near Drewsteignton, Devon, England: grid reference SX 722901.

According to his son Basil, he did so on the advice of Edward Hudson, proprietor of Country Life magazine, who was both a patron and a champion of Lutyens. Drewe was now 54 years old, but he still had time, energy and money to create his new family seat. On 4 April 1911, Drewe's 55th birthday, the first foundation stone was laid.[4]\\r\\nThe castle took many years to complete, with the First World War and the economic downturn causing many delays. Castle Drogo was finally completed in 1930, roughly half the size of Lutyens's 1911 designs, and only a year before Julius died; he had, however, been able to live in the house since around 1925. It was built at the same time as Lutyens's work in New Delhi resulting in many similarities in design.\\r\\nThe stately home borrows styles of castle building from the medieval and Tudor periods, along with more minimalist contemporary approaches. A notable feature is the encasement of the service staircase, around which the main staircase climbs. Its defensive characteristics are purely decorative. Additionally, the castle had electricity and lifts from the outset, with power being supplied by two turbines on the river below.\\r\\nThe castle has a fine formal garden, designed by Lutyens with planting by George Dillistone, which contrasts effectively with its striking setting on the edge of Dartmoor. The garden is noted for its rhododendrons and magnolias, herbaceous borders, rose garden, shrub garden and circular grass tennis court now used for croquet.\\r\\nAfter Julius's death, his wife Frances and her son Basil continued to live at the castle. During 1939√ø45, Frances and her daughter Mary ran the house as a home for babies made homeless during the bombings of London.\\r\\nFrances Drewe died in 1954 and Basil was then joined at Drogo by his son Anthony and his wife. In 1974, Anthony and his son, Dr Christopher Drewe, gave Castle Drogo and 600 acres (2.4?km2) of the surrounding land to the National Trust. It was the first 20th-century property the charity acquired.[5] A new visitor centre with shop and caf opened in the summer of 2009, after English Heritage required that industrial kitchen equipment such as that used by the previous caf within the house, be removed from Grade I listed buildings. In February 2011, the National Trust launched a public appeal for money to fund necessary restoration work.[6]\\r\\nChapel & Garden from north\\r\\nChapel belfry\\r\\nChapel & south fa?ade of house\\r\\nChapel & south-west fa?ade of house\\r\\nLibrary\\r\\nGardens","input":"When was the last castle built in england?"},{"output":"Giovanni Caboto","context":"The exploration of North America by non-indigenous people was a continuing effort to map and explore the continent of North America. It spanned centuries, and consisted of efforts by numerous people and expeditions from various foreign countries to map the continent. The European colonization of the Americas followed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Sagas of Icelanders, Norse sailors (often called Vikings) from Iceland first settled Greenland in the 980s. Erik the Red explored and settled southwestern Greenland, which he named to entice potential Icelandic settlers, eventually establishing the Eastern and Western Settlements, which were abandoned around 1350.\\r\\nL'Anse aux Meadows, an archaeological site on the northernmost tip of Newfoundland, and a second site in southwestern Newfoundland, are the only known sites of a Norse village in North America outside of Greenland. These sites are notable for their possible connections with the attempted colony of Vinland established by Leif Erikson in 1003.\\r\\nThe Viking voyages did not become common knowledge in the Old World, and Europeans remained ignorant of the existence of the Americas as a whole, until the first decades following the year 1492. Many expeditions were launched from European nations in search of a Northwest Passage to East Asia (or \\"the Indies\\" as the region was called) in order to establish a shorter trade route to China than the Silk Road, a trade route which had become desperately needed and yet exacerbated by the Fall of Constantinople. Also, the Castilian crown needed an alternative to the Portuguese controlled eastern maritime trade route around Africa to India and East Asia.\\r\\nOn August 3, 1492, Christopher Columbus set sail from the Port of Palos de la Frontera in the Province of Huelva, from the newly los Reyes Cat‹álicos coordinated Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, in present-day Spain, financed by Queen Isabella I of Castille. Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage of his discovery of the Bahamas, Cuba, and Hispaniola spread the news across Europe quickly. Columbus rediscovered and explored much of the Lesser Antilles in his second voyage then discovered both Trinidad and Tobago on his third voyage whilst skirting the northern South American coast. His fourth voyage was spent scanning the Central American coast. The Voyages of Christopher Columbus opened the New World.\\r\\nItalian navigator and explorer Giovanni Caboto (known in English as John Cabot) is credited with the discovery of continental North America on June 24, 1497, under the commission of Henry VII of England. Though the exact location of his discovery remains disputed, the Canadian and United Kingdom governments' official position is that he landed on the island of Newfoundland. The English presence through Giovanni Caboto was signaled in Juan de la Cosa's map of 1500.\\r\\nIn 1499 Jo?o Fernandes Lavrador was licensed by the King of Manuel I of Portugal and together with Pro de Barcelos they reached Greenland and sighted Labrador for the first time since Leif Erikson, which was granted and named after Lavrador. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.[1] Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 the brothers Gaspar and Miguel Corte Real explored and named the coasts of Greenland, Labrador and also Newfoundland, naming \\"Terra Verde\\" the explored North American coasts.[2] Both explorations were signaled in 1502 Cantino planisphere.\\r\\nIt was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia, but rather found what was to Europeans a New World, which in 1507 was named \\"America\\", probably after Amerigo Vespucci, on the Waldseemller map.\\r\\nIn 1500, Pedro lvares Cabral was sent by Portugal to explore South America. He is considered to be the discoverer of Brazil.\\r\\nAragon King Ferdinand II sent Juan Ponce de Le‹án from the fledgling colony on Hispaniola to verify rumors of undiscovered land to the northwest. On April 2, 1513, Ponce de Le‹án disembarked on the northeast coast of what he named Florida for the crown. The exact location is disputed, but historians have offered the possibilities of St. Augustine, Ponce de Le‹án Inlet, and Melbourne Beach. He encountered the powerful Gulf Stream and found a passage through the Florida Keys to land on the southwestern Gulf Coast of Florida on the Gulf of Mexico. Again, the exact location is disputed.[3] While it is true that Columbus visited Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in 1493, Ponce de Leon was the first known European to reach the present-day United States (mainland).[4]\\r\\nOn September 25, 1513, Spanish conquistador Vasco N~?ez de Balboa was the first European to see the Pacific Ocean once he crossed the Isthmus of Panama. He claimed all the territory touching it for the Crown, later to affect colonization of Las Californias.\\r\\nAround 1519-1521, Portuguese explorer Jo?o lvares Fagundes explored the coasts of Newfoundland, Labrador and Nova Scotia, with a mission to create colonies.\\r\\nIn 1524, Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed for King Francis I of France and is known as the first European since the Norse to explore the Atlantic coast of North America. Arriving near the Cape Fear River delta, he explored the coastlines of present-day states of South Carolina and North Carolina, entering the Pamlico Sound, and bypassing entrances to the Chesapeake Bay. Believing the New York Harbor to be a lake, he sailed past Long Island, exploring Narragansett Bay and Newfoundland.\\r\\nIn 1524-1525, Portuguese explorer Estev?o Gomes, on behalf of Charles I of Spain, explored present-day Nova Scotia sailing South along the Maine coast. Gomes entered New York Harbor and saw the Hudson River(which he named the \\"San Antonio River\\"). Because of his expedition, the 1529 Diogo Ribeiro world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly.\\r\\nIn 1534, Jacques Cartier planted a cross in the Gasp Peninsula, on the Gulf Gulf of Saint Lawrence and claimed the land in the name of Francis I. In 1535 Cartier explored the St. Lawrence river and also claimed the region for France.\\r\\nAfter two failed attempts to reach East Asia by circumnavigating Siberia, Henry Hudson sailed west in 1609 under the Dutch East India Company. He, too, passed Cape Cod, Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware Bay, instead sailing up the Hudson River on September 11, 1609 in search of a fabled connection to the Pacific via what was actually the Great Lakes. In Hudson's fourth and final voyage, he discovered, mapped, and explored the Hudson Strait, Hudson Bay and James Bay.\\r\\nOther major sea-based explorers were Captain James Cook, George Vancouver, and Charles Wilkes.\\r\\nThere were numerous Spanish explorers and conquistadors who explored the Southwest of North America (including present-day west and central United States) and cross the continent (east to west) in its southern regions, mainly from the second quarter to the middle of the 16th century, such as lvar N~?ez Cabeza de Vaca and Francisco Vsquez de Coronado, but also the North American Southeast and south-central regions, s Soto]].\\r\\nIn 1608 Samuel de Champlain founded what is now Quebec City, which would become the first permanent settlement and the capital of New France. He took personal administration over the city and its affairs, and sent out expeditions to explore the interior. Champlain himself discovered Lake Champlain in 1609. By 1615, he had travelled by canoe up the Ottawa River through Lake Nipissing and Georgian Bay to the centre of Huron country near Lake Simcoe. During these voyages, Champlain aided the Wendat (aka 'Hurons') in their battles against the Iroquois Confederacy. As a result, the Iroquois would become enemies of the French and be involved in multiple conflicts.\\r\\nFrom 1679 to 1682 Ren-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle explored the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada, and the entire course of Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico.\\r\\nFrom 1697 to 1702 Eusebio Kino explored the Sonoran Desert and on his journey to the Colorado River Delta discovered an overland route to Baja California that was then commonly believed to be an island. In 1683 Kino lead the first European overland crossing of Baja California.\\r\\nEuropean exploration of western Canada was largely motivated by the fur trade and the search for the elusive Northwest Passage. Hudson's Bay Company explorer Henry Kelsey has the distinction of being the first European to see the northern Great Plains in 1690.\\r\\nAnthony Henday was the first to have seen the Rocky Mountains, in 1754, but curiously did not mention it in his journals. From his westernmost geographic position (roughly near the town of Olds, Alberta, halfway between Calgary and Red Deer, Alberta) the Rockies should have been quite conspicuous, but he was likely trying to disguise the disappointing fact that an unknown range of seemingly impassible mountains now stood between the HBC and the Pacific. Samuel Hearne found the Coppermine River in 1769-71 in his failed search for copper ore deposits. Burned by these shortfalls, the HBC largely quit exploration.\\r\\nThe North West Company, on the other hand, used a business model that required constant expansion into untapped areas. Under the auspices of the NWC, Alexander Mackenzie discovered the Mackenzie River in 1789 and was the first European to reach the North-American Pacific overland, via the Bella Coola River, in 1793. Simon Fraser reached the Pacific in 1808 via the Fraser River.\\r\\nDavid Thompson, widely regarded as the greatest land geographer that ever lived, traveled over 90,000?km during his lifetime. In 1797, Thompson was sent south by his employers to survey part of the Canada-U.S. boundary along the water routes from Lake Superior to Lake of the Woods to satisfy unresolved questions of territory arising from the Jay Treaty between Great Britain and the United States. By 1798 Thompson had completed a survey of 6,750?km (4,190?mi) from Grand Portage, through Lake Winnipeg, to the headwaters of the Assiniboine and Mississippi Rivers, as well as two sides of Lake Superior.[5] In 1798, the company sent him to Red Deer Lake (in present-day Alberta) to establish a trading post. The English translation of Lac La Biche-Red Deer Lake-first appeared on the Mackenzie map of 1793.[6] Thompson spent the next few seasons trading based in Fort George (now in Alberta), and during this time led several expeditions into the Rocky Mountains. In 1811/1812 he followed the Columbia River to the Pacific, and in 1814 used his notes and measurements to draft the first European-style map of western Canada, covering 3.9 million square kilometres.\\r\\nLewis and Clark were the first Americans to venture into the newly acquired territory of the Louisiana Purchase, at the order of President Thomas Jefferson. They discovered many new geographical features, Indian tribes, and animal and plant species. John Colter was a member of the expedition who subsequently became a guide for others in the 'Old West,' and did some explorations of his own.\\r\\nJohn C. Frmont led many important explorations in the Great Plains, Great Basin, Oregon territory, and Mexican Alta California.\\r\\nJoseph Reddeford Walker was one of the most prominent of the explorers, and charted many new paths through the West, which often were then utilized by emigrants crossing to settle in Western towns and communities. In 1833, his exploring party discovered a route along the Humboldt River across present-day Nevada, ascending the Sierra Nevada following the Carson River and descending via Stanislaus River drainages to Monterey. His return route across the southern Sierra was via Walker Pass, named after Walker by John Charles Fremont. The approach of the Sierra via the Carson River route later became known as the California Trail, the primary route for the emigrants to the gold fields during the California gold rush.\\r\\nAs the American population of the West increased, the US government launched ongoing official explorations mainly through the US Army Corps of Topographical Engineers. One of the main officers and explorers in this unit was George Wheeler. In 1872, the US Congress authorized an ambitious plan to map the portion of the United States west of the 100th meridian at a scale of 8?miles to the inch. This plan necessitated what became known as the Wheeler Survey, along with the Clarence King and John Wesley Powell Surveys, and expeditions by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden. In 1879, all such efforts were reorganized as the United States Geological Survey.\\r\\nUniversalis Cosmographia, the Waldseemller map dated 1507, depicts the Americas, Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific Ocean separating Asia from the Americas.\\r\\nThe Vinland map surfaced in 1965 and is claimed, though widely discredited, to be a 15th-century map depicting the Norse colony of Vinland.","input":"Who was the first european to reach what is now the us mainland?"},{"output":"urinary meatus","context":"The urinary meatus, also known as the external urethral orifice, is the opening or meatus of the urethra. It is the point where urine exits the urethra in males and in females, and also where semen exits the urethra in males. The meatus has varying degrees of sensitivity to touch. The meatus is located on the glans penis in males and in the vulval vestibule in females.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male external urethral orifice is the external opening or urinary meatus, normally located at the tip of the glans penis, at its junction with the frenular delta. It presents as a vertical slit, possibly bounded on either side by two small labia-like projections and continues longitudinally along the front aspect of the glans, which facilitates the flow of urine micturition. In some cases the opening may be more rounded and this can occur naturally or may also occur as a side effect of excessive skin removal during circumcision. The meatus is a sensitive part of the male reproductive system.\\r\\nMeatal stenosis is a late complication of circumcision, which occurs in about 10-20 percent of newborn circumcised boys after the loss of the protection of the foreskin.[1]\\r\\nDue to the flexibility of the penis and meatus, the stream of urine in the male can be manipulated and targeted. In different cultures different positions of urination are employed. Sitting and squatting are also options to standing to urinate. Also in the elderly male with prostate problems sitting down is preferable.[2][3] For practising Muslim men, the genital modesty of squatting is also associated with proper cleanliness requirements or awrah.[4]\\r\\nThe female external urethral orifice is the external opening of the urethra, from which urine is ejected during urination. It is located about 2.5?cm behind the clitoris and immediately in front of the vagina in the vulval vestibule. It usually assumes the form of a short, sagittal cleft with slightly raised margins. To its left and right are the openings of the Skene's glands.\\r\\nSome evidence exists to suggest that the clitoral-urinary meatus distance (CUMD) in human females relates to the ease with which she may achieve orgasm through penetrative sex. Orgasm from penetration alone is observed to be more likely as CUMD decreases.[5]\\r\\nUnlike most other mammals, female spotted hyenas have a urinary meatus that is located on the clitoral glans.[6][7]\\r\\nCongenital disorders of the meatus, in the male, include epispadias √ø the misplacement to the upper aspect and hypospadias √ø the misplacement to the underside of the penis. A congenital mis-shaping can result in its narrowing (meatal stenosis) causing a partial or total urinary blockage, or the bifurcation of the urinary stream. A urethral blockage can also be caused by foreign material, kidney or bladder stones (lithiasis).","input":"What is the medical term for pee hole?"},{"output":"AD 43","context":"The Roman conquest of Britain was a gradual process, beginning effectively in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius, whose general Aulus Plautius served as first governor of Roman Britain (Latin: Britannia). Great Britain had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. In common with other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had enjoyed diplomatic and trading links with the Romans in the century since Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54 BC, and Roman economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, especially in the south.\\r\\nBetween 55 BC and the 40s AD, the status quo of tribute, hostages, and client states without direct military occupation, begun by Caesar's invasions of Britain, largely remained intact. Augustus prepared invasions in 34 BC, 27 BC and 25 BC. The first and third were called off due to revolts elsewhere in the empire, the second because the Britons seemed ready to come to terms.[1] According to Augustus's Res Gestae, two British kings, Dubnovellaunus and Tincomarus, fled to Rome as suppliants during his reign,[2] and Strabo's Geography, written during this period, says that Britain paid more in customs and duties than could be raised by taxation if the island were conquered.[3]\\r\\nBy the 40s AD, the political situation within Britain was apparently in ferment. The Catuvellauni had displaced the Trinovantes as the most powerful kingdom in south-eastern Britain, taking over the former Trinovantian capital of Camulodunum (Colchester), and were pressing their neighbours the Atrebates, ruled by the descendants of Julius Caesar's former ally Commius.[4]\\r\\nCaligula planned a campaign against the Britons in 40, but its execution was bizarre: according to Suetonius' The Twelve Caesars, he drew up his troops in battle formation facing the English Channel and, once his forces had become quite confused, ordered them to gather seashells, referring to them as \\"plunder from the ocean due to the Capitol and the Palace\\".[5]\\r\\nModern historians are unsure if that was meant to be an ironic punishment for the soldiers' mutiny or due to Caligula's derangement. Certainly this invasion attempt readied the troops and facilities that would make Claudius' invasion possible three years later. For example, Caligula built a lighthouse at Bononia (modern Boulogne-sur-Mer) that provided a model for the one built soon after at Dubris (Dover).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThree years later, in 43, possibly by re-collecting Caligula's troops, Claudius mounted an invasion force to re-instate Verica, an exiled king of the Atrebates.[6] Aulus Plautius, a distinguished senator, was given overall charge of four legions, totalling about 20,000 men, plus about the same number of auxiliaries. The legions were:\\r\\nThe II Augusta is known to have been commanded by the future emperor Vespasian. Three other men of appropriate rank to command legions are known from the sources to have been involved in the invasion. Cassius Dio mentions Gnaeus Hosidius Geta, who probably led the IX Hispana, and Vespasian's brother Titus Flavius Sabinus the Younger. He wrote that Sabinus was Vespasian's lieutenant, but as Sabinus was the older brother and preceded Vespasian into public life, he could hardly have been a military tribune. Eutropius mentions Gnaeus Sentius Saturninus, although as a former consul he may have been too senior, and perhaps accompanied Claudius later.[7]\\r\\nThe main invasion force under Aulus Plautius crossed in three divisions. The port of departure is usually taken to have been Boulogne, and the main landing at Rutupiae (Richborough, on the east coast of Kent). Neither of these locations is certain. Dio does not mention the port of departure, and although Suetonius says that the secondary force under Claudius sailed from Boulogne,[8] it does not necessarily follow that the entire invasion force did. Richborough has a large natural harbour which would have been suitable, and archaeology shows Roman military occupation at about the right time. However, Dio says the Romans sailed east to west, and a journey from Boulogne to Richborough is south to north. Some historians[9] suggest a sailing from Boulogne to the Solent, landing in the vicinity of Noviomagus (Chichester) or Southampton, in territory formerly ruled by Verica. An alternative explanation might be a sailing from the mouth of the Rhine to Richborough, which would be east to west.[10]\\r\\nBritish resistance was led by Togodumnus and Caratacus, sons of the late king of the Catuvellauni, Cunobeline. A substantial British force met the Romans at a river crossing thought to be near Rochester on the River Medway. The battle raged for two days. Hosidius Geta was almost captured, but recovered and turned the battle so decisively that he was awarded the \\"Roman triumph.\\"\\r\\nThe British were pushed back to the Thames. They were pursued by the Romans across the river causing some Roman losses in the marshes of Essex. Whether the Romans made use of an existing bridge for this purpose or built a temporary one is uncertain. At least one division of auxiliary Batavian troops swam across the river as a separate force.\\r\\nTogodumnus died shortly after the battle on the Thames. Plautius halted and sent word for Claudius to join him for the final push. Cassius Dio presents this as Plautius needing the emperor's assistance to defeat the resurgent British, who were determined to avenge Togodumnus. However, Claudius was no military man. Claudius's arch says he received the surrender of eleven kings without any loss,[11] and Suetonius' The Twelve Caesars says that Claudius received the surrender of the Britons without battle or bloodshed.[12] It is likely that the Catuvellauni were already as good as beaten, allowing the emperor to appear as conqueror on the final march on Camulodunum. Cassius Dio relates that he brought war elephants and heavy armaments which would have overawed any remaining native resistance. Eleven tribes of South East Britain surrendered to Claudius and the Romans prepared to move further west and north. The Romans established their new capital at Camulodunum and Claudius returned to Rome to celebrate his victory. Caratacus escaped and would continue the resistance further west.\\r\\nVespasian took a force westwards subduing tribes and capturing oppida as he went, going at least as far as Exeter, which would appear to have become an early base for Leg. II Augusta. In 2010, two separate temporary legionary fortresses, dated at about the time of Vespasian, were partly excavated by Exeter City Archaeological Unit at St Loyes on the Roman Road between Isca and Topsham and probably reaching Bodmin.[13] Legio IX Hispana was sent north towards Lincoln (Latin: Lindum Colonia) and within four years of the invasion it is likely that an area south of a line from the Humber to the River Severn Estuary was under Roman control. That this line is followed by the Roman road of the Fosse Way has led many historians to debate the route's role as a convenient frontier during the early occupation. It is more likely that the border between Roman and Iron Age Britain was less direct and more mutable during this period.\\r\\nLate in 47 the new governor of Britain, Publius Ostorius Scapula, began a campaign against the tribes of modern-day Wales, and the Cheshire Gap. The Silures of southeast Wales caused considerable problems to Ostorius and fiercely defended the Welsh border country. Caratacus himself was defeated in the Battle of Caer Caradoc and fled to the Roman client tribe of the Brigantes who occupied the Pennines. Their queen, Cartimandua was unable or unwilling to protect him however given her own truce with the Romans and handed him over to the invaders. Ostorius died and was replaced by Aulus Didius Gallus who brought the Welsh borders under control but did not move further north or west, probably because Claudius was keen to avoid what he considered a difficult and drawn-out war for little material gain in the mountainous terrain of upland Britain. When Nero became emperor in AD 54, he seems to have decided to continue the invasion and appointed Quintus Veranius as governor, a man experienced in dealing with the troublesome hill tribes of Anatolia. Veranius and his successor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus mounted a successful campaign across Wales, famously destroying the druidical centre at Mona or Anglesey in AD 60 at what historians later called the Menai Massacre. Final occupation of Wales was postponed however when the rebellion of Boudica forced the Romans to return to the south east. The Silures were not finally conquered until circa AD 76 when Sextus Julius Frontinus' long campaign against them began to have success.\\r\\nFollowing the successful suppression of Boudica's uprising, a number of new Roman governors continued the conquest by edging north. Cartimandua was forced to ask for Roman aid following a rebellion by her husband Venutius. Quintus Petillius Cerialis took his legions from Lincoln as far as York and defeated Venutius near Stanwick around 70. This resulted in the already Romanised Brigantes and Parisii tribes being further assimilated into the empire proper. Frontinus was sent into Roman Britain in 74 AD to succeed Quintus Petillius Cerialis as governor of that island. He subdued the Silures and other hostile tribes of Wales, establishing a new base at Caerleon for Legio II Augusta (Isca Augusta) and a network of smaller forts fifteen to twenty kilometres apart for his auxiliary units. During his tenure, he probably established the fort at Pumsaint in west Wales, largely to exploit the gold deposits at Dolaucothi. He retired in 78 AD, and later he was appointed water commissioner in Rome. The new governor was Gnaeus Julius Agricola, made famous through the highly laudatory biography of him written by his son-in-law, Tacitus.\\r\\nArriving in mid-summer of 78, Agricola found several previously defeated peoples had re-established their independence. The first to be dealt with were the Ordovices of north Wales, who had destroyed a cavalry ala of Roman auxiliaries stationed in their territory. Knowing the terrain from his prior military service in Britain, he was able to move quickly to defeat and virtually exterminate them. He then invaded Anglesey, forcing the inhabitants to sue for peace.[14] The following year he moved against the Brigantes of northern England and the Selgovae along the southern coast of Scotland, using overwhelming military power to re-establish Roman control.[15]\\r\\nDetails of the early years of the Roman occupation in North Britain are unclear but began no earlier than 71, as Tacitus says that in that year Petillius Cerialis (governor 71√ø74) waged a successful war against the Brigantes,[16] whose territory straddled Britain along the Solway-Tyne line. Tacitus praises both Cerialis and his successor Julius Frontinus (governor 75√ø78), but provides no additional information on events prior to 79 regarding the lands or peoples living north of the Brigantes. The Romans certainly would have followed up their initial victory over the Brigantes in some manner. In particular, archaeology has shown that the Romans had campaigned and built military camps in the north along Gask Ridge, controlling the glens that provided access to and from the Scottish Highlands, and also throughout the Scottish Lowlands in northeastern Scotland. In describing Agricola's campaigns, Tacitus does not explicitly state that this is actually a return to lands previously occupied by Rome, where Roman occupation either had been thrown off by the Brittonic inhabitants, or had been abandoned by the Romans.\\r\\nTacitus says that after a combination of force and diplomacy quieted discontent among the Britons who had been conquered previously, Agricola built forts in their territories in 79. In 80 he marched to the Firth of Tay (some historians hold that he stopped along the Firth of Forth in that year), not returning south until 81, at which time he consolidated his gains in the new lands that he had conquered, and in the rebellious lands that he had re-conquered.[17] In 82 he sailed to either Kintyre or the shores of Argyll, or to both. In 83 and 84 he moved north along Scotland's eastern and northern coasts using both land and naval forces, campaigning successfully against the inhabitants, and winning a significant victory over the northern British peoples led by Calgacus at the Battle of Mons Graupius.[18]\\r\\nPrior to his recall in 84, Agricola built a network of military roads and forts to secure the Roman occupation. Existing forts were strengthened and new ones planted in northeastern Scotland along the Highland Line, consolidating control of the glens that provided access to and from the Scottish Highlands. The line of military communication and supply along southeastern Scotland and northeastern England (i.e., Dere Street) was well-fortified. In southern-most Caledonia, the lands of the Selgovae (approximating to modern Dumfriesshire and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright) were heavily planted with forts, not only establishing effective control there, but also completing a military enclosure of south-central Scotland (most of the Southern Uplands, Teviotdale, and western Tweeddale).[19] In contrast to Roman actions against the Selgovae, the territories of the Novantae, Damnonii, and Votadini were not planted with forts, and there is nothing to indicate that the Romans were at war with them.\\r\\nAgricola was recalled to Rome by Domitian. His successors are not named in any surviving source, but it seems they were unable or unwilling to further subdue the far north. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge in Perthshire, erected to consolidate the Roman presence in Scotland in the aftermath of Mons Graupius, were abandoned within the space of a few years. It is equally likely that the costs of a drawn-out war outweighed any economic or political benefit and it was more profitable to leave the Caledonians alone and only under de jure submission.\\r\\nRoman occupation was withdrawn to a line subsequently established as one of the limites (singular limes) of the empire (i.e. a defensible frontier) by the construction of Hadrian's Wall. An attempt was made to push this line north to the River Clyde-River Forth area in 142 when the Antonine Wall was constructed. This was once again abandoned after two decades and only subsequently re-occupied on an occasional basis.\\r\\nThe Romans retreated to the earlier and stronger Hadrian's Wall in the River Tyne-Solway Firth frontier area, this having been constructed around 122. Roman troops, however, penetrated far into the north of modern Scotland several more times. Indeed, there is a greater density of Roman marching camps in Scotland than anywhere else in Europe as a result of at least four major attempts to subdue the area.\\r\\nThe most notable was in 209 when the emperor Septimius Severus, claiming to be provoked by the belligerence of the Maeatae tribe, campaigned against the Caledonian Confederacy, a coalition of Brittonic Pictish[20] tribes of the north of Britain. He used the three legions of the British garrison (augmented by the recently formed 2nd Parthica legion), 9000 imperial guards with cavalry support, and numerous auxiliaries supplied from the sea by the British fleet, the Rhine fleet and two fleets transferred from the Danube for the purpose. According to Dio Cassius, he inflicted genocidal depredations on the natives and incurred the loss of 50,000 of his own men to the attrition of guerrilla tactics before having to withdraw to Hadrian's Wall. He repaired and reinforced the wall with a degree of thoroughness that led most subsequent Roman authors to attribute the construction of the wall to him. It was during the negotiations to purchase the truce necessary to secure the Roman retreat to the wall that the first recorded utterance, attributable with any reasonable degree of confidence, to a native of Scotland was made (as recorded by Dio Cassius). When Septimius Severus's wife, Julia Domna, criticised the sexual morals of the Caledonian women, the wife of a Caledonian chief, Argentocoxos, replied: \\"We consort openly with the best of men while you allow yourselves to be debauched in private by the worst\\".[21] The emperor Septimius Severus died at York while planning to renew hostilities, and these plans were abandoned by his son Caracalla.\\r\\nLater excursions into Scotland by the Romans were generally limited to the scouting expeditions of exploratores in the buffer zone that developed between the walls, trading contacts, bribes to purchase truces from the natives, and eventually the spread of Christianity. The degree to which the Romans interacted with the Gaelic speaking island of Hibernia (modern Ireland) is still unresolved amongst archaeologists in Ireland. The successes and failures of the Romans in subduing the peoples of Britain are still represented in the political geography of the British Isles today.[clarification needed]","input":"When was the first roman invasion of britain?"},{"output":"Tamla Motown, the brand used outside the US","context":"Motown is an American record company. The record company was founded by Berry Gordy Jr. as Tamla Records on January 12, 1959,[1][2] and was incorporated as Motown Record Corporation on April 14, 1960, in Detroit, Michigan.[3] The name, a portmanteau of motor and town, has also become a nickname for Detroit. Motown played an important role in the racial integration of popular music as an African American-owned record label that achieved significant crossover success. In the 1960s, Motown and its subsidiary labels (including Tamla Motown, the brand used outside the US) were the most successful proponents of what came to be known as the Motown Sound, a style of soul music with a distinct pop influence. During the 1960s, Motown achieved spectacular success for a small record company: 79 records in the Top Ten of the Billboard Hot 100 record chart between 1960 and 1969.[4]\\r\\nFollowing the events of the Detroit Riots of 1967, and the loss of key songwriting/production team Holland-Dozier-Holland the same year over pay disputes, Gordy began relocating Motown to Los Angeles. The move was completed in 1972 and Motown expanded into television and film production, remaining an independent company until June 28, 1994.\\r\\nThe company was then sold to MCA Inc. Motown was later sold to PolyGram in 1994, before being sold again to MCA Records' successor, Universal Music Group, when it acquired PolyGram in 1999.[1]\\r\\nMotown spent much of the 2000s as a part of the Universal Music subsidiaries Universal Motown, Universal Motown Republic Group, and headquartered in New York City. From 2011 to 2014, Motown was a part of The Island Def Jam Music Group division of Universal Music.[5][6][7] On April 1, 2014, Universal Music Group announced the dissolution of Island Def Jam; subsequently Motown relocated back to Los Angeles to operate under the Capitol Music Group. It now operates out of the landmark Capitol Tower.[8]\\r\\nFor many decades, Motown was the highest-earning African American business in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBerry Gordy got his start as a songwriter for local Detroit acts such as Jackie Wilson and the Matadors. Wilson's single \\"Lonely Teardrops\\", written by Gordy, became a huge success, but Gordy did not feel he made as much money as he deserved from this and other singles he wrote for Wilson. He realized that the more lucrative end of the business was in producing records and owning the publishing.\\r\\nIn 1959, Billy Davis and Berry Gordy's sisters Gwen and Anna started Anna Records. Davis and Gwen Gordy wanted Berry to be the company president, but Berry wanted to strike out on his own. On January 12, 1959, he started Tamla Records, with an $800 loan from his family and royalties earned writing for Jackie Wilson. Gordy originally wanted to name the label Tammy Records, after the hit song popularized by Debbie Reynolds from the 1957 film Tammy and the Bachelor, in which Reynolds also starred. When he found the name was already in use, Berry decided on Tamla instead. Tamla's first release, in the Detroit area, was Marv Johnson's \\"Come to Me\\" in 1959 (released nationally on United Artists). Its first hit was Barrett Strong's \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\" (1959), which made it to number 2 on the Billboard R&B charts (released nationally on Anna Records).\\r\\nGordy's first signed act was the Matadors, who immediately changed their name to the Miracles. (They were not the Matadors who recorded for Sue.) Their first release, \\"Got a Job\\", was an answer record to the Silhouettes' \\"Get a Job\\" (issued on George Goldner's End Records). The Miracles' first, minor hit was their fourth single, 1959's \\"Bad Girl\\", released in Detroit as the debut record on the Motown imprint, and nationally on the Chess label. (Most early Motown singles were released through other labels, such as End, Fury, Gone and Chess.)\\r\\nMiracles lead singer William \\"Smokey\\" Robinson became the vice president of the company (and later named his daughter \\"Tamla\\" and his son \\"Berry\\"). Several of Gordy's family members, including his father Berry Sr., brothers Robert and George, and sister Esther, were given key roles in the company. By the middle of the decade, Gwen and Anna Gordy had joined the label in administrative positions as well.\\r\\nAlso in 1959, Gordy purchased the property that would become Motown's Hitsville U.S.A. studio. The photography studio located in the back of the property was modified into a small recording studio, and the Gordys moved into the second-floor living quarters. Within seven years, Motown would occupy seven additional neighboring houses:\\r\\nMotown had hired over 450 employees and had a gross income of $20 million by the end of 1966.\\r\\nEarly Tamla/Motown artists included Mable John, Eddie Holland and Mary Wells. \\"Shop Around\\", the Miracles' first number 1 R&B hit, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960. It was Tamla's first million-selling record. On April 14, 1960, Motown and Tamla Records merged into a new company called Motown Record Corporation. A year later, the Marvelettes scored Tamla's first US number-one pop hit, \\"Please Mr. Postman\\". By the mid-1960s, the company, with the help of songwriters and producers such as Robinson, A&R chief William \\"Mickey\\" Stevenson, Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Norman Whitfield, had become a major force in the music industry.\\r\\nFrom 1961 to 1971, Motown had 110 top 10 hits. Top artists on the Motown label during that period included the Supremes (initially including Diana Ross), the Four Tops, and the Jackson 5, while Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, the Marvelettes, and the Miracles had hits on the Tamla label. The company operated several labels in addition to the Tamla and Motown imprints. A third label, which Gordy named after himself (though it was originally called \\"Miracle\\") featured the Temptations, the Contours, and Martha and the Vandellas. A fourth, V.I.P., released recordings by the Velvelettes, the Spinners, the Monitors, and Chris Clark.\\r\\nA fifth label, Soul, featured Jr. Walker & the All Stars, Jimmy Ruffin, Shorty Long, the Originals, and Gladys Knight & the Pips (who had found success before joining Motown, as \\"The Pips\\" on Vee-Jay). Many more Motown-owned labels released recordings in other genres, including Workshop Jazz (jazz)Earl Washington Reflections and Earl Washington's All Stars, Mel-o-dy (country, although it was originally an R&B label), and Rare Earth (rock), which featured the band Rare Earth themselves. Under the slogan \\"The Sound of Young America\\", Motown's acts were enjoying widespread popularity among black and white audiences alike.\\r\\nSmokey Robinson said of Motown's cultural impact:\\r\\nInto the '60s, I was still not of a frame of mind that we were not only making music, we were making history. But I did recognize the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South in the early days of Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.[10]\\r\\nIn 1967 Berry Gordy purchased what is now known as Motown Mansion in Detroit's Boston-Edison Historic District as his home, leaving his previous home to his sister Anna and then husband Marvin Gaye (where photos for the cover of his album What's Going On were taken).[11] In 1968, Gordy purchased the Donovan building on the corner of Woodward Avenue and Interstate 75, and moved Motown's Detroit offices there (the Donovan building was demolished in January 2006 to provide parking spaces for Super Bowl XL). In the same year Gordy purchased Golden World Records, and its recording studio became \\"Studio B\\" to Hitsville's \\"Studio A\\".\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, Motown's records were released on various labels: at first London (only the Miracles' \\"Shop Around\\"/\\"Who's Lovin' You\\" and \\"Ain't It Baby\\"), then Fontana (\\"Please Mr. Postman\\" by the Marvelettes was one of four) and then Oriole American (\\"Fingertips\\" by Little Stevie Wonder was one of many). In 1963, Motown signed with EMI's Stateside label (\\"Where Did Our Love Go\\" by the Supremes and \\"My Guy\\" by Mary Wells were Motown's first British top-20 hits). Eventually EMI created the Tamla Motown label (\\"Stop! In the Name of Love\\" by the Supremes was the first Tamla Motown release in March 1965).\\r\\nAfter the songwriting trio Holland√øDozier√øHolland left the label in 1967 over royalty-payment disputes, Norman Whitfield became the company's top producer, turning out hits for The Temptations, Marvin Gaye, Gladys Knight & the Pips and Rare Earth. In the meantime Berry Gordy established Motown Productions, a television subsidiary which produced TV specials for the Motown artists, including TCB, with Diana Ross & the Supremes and the Temptations, Diana! with Diana Ross, and Goin' Back to Indiana with the Jackson 5. The company loosened its production rules, allowing some of its longtime artists the opportunity to write and produce more of their own material. This resulted in the recordings of successful and critically acclaimed albums such as Marvin Gaye's What's Going On (1971) and Let's Get it On (1973), and Stevie Wonder's Music of My Mind (1972), Talking Book (1972), and Innervisions (1973).\\r\\nMotown had established branch offices in both New York City and Los Angeles during the mid-1960s, and by 1969 had begun gradually moving more of its operations to Los Angeles. The company moved all of its operations to Los Angeles in June 1972, with a number of artists, among them Martha Reeves, the Four Tops, Gladys Knight & the Pips, and Motown's Funk Brothers studio band, either staying behind in Detroit or leaving the company for other reasons. By re-locating, Motown aimed chiefly to branch out into the motion-picture industry, and Motown Productions got its start in film by turning out two hit-vehicles for Diana Ross: the Billie Holiday biographical film Lady Sings the Blues (1972), and Mahogany (1975). Other Motown films would include Scott Joplin (1977), Thank God It's Friday (1978), The Wiz (1978) and The Last Dragon (1985). Ewart Abner, who had been associated with Motown since the 1960s, became its president in 1973.\\r\\nDespite losing Holland√øDozier√øHolland, Norman Whitfield, and some of its other hitmakers by 1975, Motown still had a number of successful artists during the 1970s and 1980s, including Lionel Richie and the Commodores, Rick James, Teena Marie, the Dazz Band and DeBarge. By the mid-1980s Motown had started losing money, and Berry Gordy sold his ownership in Motown to MCA Records (which began a US distribution deal with the label in 1983) and Boston Ventures in June 1988 for $61 million. In 1989, Gordy sold the Motown Productions TV/film operations to Motown executive Suzanne de Passe, who renamed the company de Passe Entertainment and continues to run it as of 2012[update].\\r\\nDuring the 1990s Motown was home to successful recording artists such as Boyz II Men and Johnny Gill, although the company itself remained in a state of turmoil. MCA appointed a revolving door of executives to run the company, beginning with Berry Gordy's immediate successor, Jheryl Busby. Busby quarreled with MCA, alleging that the company did not give Motown's product adequate attention or promotion. In 1991, Motown sued MCA to have its distribution deal with the company terminated, and began releasing its product through PolyGram. PolyGram purchased Motown from Boston Ventures three years later.\\r\\nIn 1994, Busby was replaced by Andre Harrell, the entrepreneur behind Uptown Records. Harrell served as Motown's CEO for just under two years, leaving the company after receiving bad publicity for being inefficient. Danny Goldberg, who ran PolyGram's Mercury Records group, assumed control of Motown, and George Jackson served as president.\\r\\nBy 1998, Motown had added stars such as 702, Brian McKnight, and Erykah Badu to its roster. In December 1998, PolyGram was acquired by Seagram, and Motown was absorbed into the Universal Music Group. Seagram had purchased Motown's former parent MCA in 1995, and Motown was in effect reunited with many of its MCA corporate siblings (Seagram had hoped to build a media empire around Universal, and started by purchasing PolyGram). Universal briefly considered shuttering the label, but instead decided to restructure it. Kedar Massenburg, a producer for Erykah Badu, became the head of the label, and oversaw successful recordings from Badu, McKnight, Michael McDonald, and new Motown artist India.Arie.\\r\\nDiana Ross, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, and the Temptations had remained with the label since its early days, although all except Wonder recorded for other labels for several years. Ross left Motown for RCA Records from 1981 to 1988, but returned in 1989 and stayed until 2002. Robinson left the label in the early 1990s, and the Temptations left a second time in 2004. Wonder is, today, the only artist from Motown's early period still on the label.\\r\\nIn 2005, Massenburg was replaced by Sylvia Rhone, former CEO of Elektra Records. Motown was merged with Universal Records to create the Universal Motown Records and placed under the newly created umbrella division of Universal Motown Republic Group. Motown began celebrating its fiftieth anniversary (January 12, 2009) in late 2008, including the release of a The Complete No. 1's box set containing Motown number-one hits from Billboards pop, R&B, and disco charts, reissues of classic-era Motown albums on CD, and other planned events, which were released in collaboration with Universal Music Group's catalog division Universal Music Enterprises.\\r\\nAs of summer of 2011, Universal Motown has been separated from Universal Motown Republic Group, has reverted to the original Motown brand, has hired Ethiopia Habtemariam as its Senior Vice President, and is now operated under The Island Def Jam Music Group.[5][7] Artists from Universal Motown have been transferred to the newly revitalized Motown label.[6] On January 25, 2012, it was announced that Ne-Yo would join the Motown label both as an artist as well as the new Senior Vice President of A&R.[12][13] On April 1, 2014, it was announced that Island Def Jam will no longer be running following the resignation of CEO Barry Weiss. In a press release sent out by Universal Music Group, the label will now be reorganizing Def Jam Recordings, Island Records and Motown Records all as separate entities.[14] Motown would then begin serving as a subsidiary of Capitol Records.[15]\\r\\nMotown specialized in a type of soul music it referred to with the trademark \\"The Motown Sound\\". Crafted with an ear towards pop appeal, the Motown Sound typically used tambourines to accent the back beat, prominent and often melodic electric bass-guitar lines, distinctive melodic and chord structures, and a call-and-response singing style that originated in gospel music. In 1971, Jon Landau wrote in Rolling Stone that the sound consisted of songs with simple structures but sophisticated melodies, along with a four-beat drum pattern, regular use of horns and strings and \\"a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing (boosting the high range frequencies) to give the overall product a distinctive sound, particularly effective for broadcast over AM radio\\".[16] Pop production techniques such as the use of orchestral string sections, charted horn sections, and carefully arranged background vocals were also used. Complex arrangements and elaborate, melismatic vocal riffs were avoided.[17] Motown producers believed steadfastly in the \\"KISS principle\\" (keep it simple, stupid).[18] Despite the growth of popular music being written and performed by black artists, the songs would not become popular or recognized unless the music was being performed by white performers. However, the Motown Sound became distinctly unique, making it impossible for white performers to replicate its sound. The \\"real\\" Motown Sound became more favorable than the altered renditions.[19]\\r\\nThe Motown production process has been described as factory-like. The Hitsville studios remained open and active 22 hours a day, and artists would often go on tour for weeks, come back to Detroit to record as many songs as possible, and then promptly go on tour again. Berry Gordy held quality control meetings every Friday morning, and used veto power to ensure that only the very best material and performances would be released. The test was that every new release needed to fit into a sequence of the top five selling pop singles of the week. Several tracks that later became critical and commercial favorites were initially rejected by Gordy; the two most notable being the Marvin Gaye songs \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" and \\"What's Going On\\". In several cases, producers would re-work tracks in hopes of eventually getting them approved at a later Friday morning meeting, as producer Norman Whitfield did with \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" and The Temptations' \\"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\\".\\r\\nMany of Motown's best-known songs, including all the early hits for the Supremes, were written by the songwriting trio of Holland√øDozier√øHolland (Lamont Dozier and brothers Brian and Eddie Holland). Other important Motown producers and songwriters included Norman Whitfield, William \\"Mickey\\" Stevenson, Smokey Robinson, Barrett Strong, Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson, Frank Wilson, Pamela Sawyer & Gloria Jones, James Dean & William Weatherspoon, Johnny Bristol, Harvey Fuqua, Gil Askey,[20] Stevie Wonder, and Gordy himself.\\r\\nThe style created by the Motown musicians was a major influence on several non-Motown artists of the mid-1960s, such as Dusty Springfield and the Foundations. In the United Kingdom, the Motown Sound became the basis of the northern soul movement. Smokey Robinson said the Motown Sound had little to do with Detroit:\\r\\nPeople would listen to it, and they'd say, 'Aha, they use more bass. Or they use more drums.' Bullshit. When we were first successful with it, people were coming from Germany, France, Italy, Mobile, Alabama. From New York, Chicago, California. From everywhere. Just to record in Detroit. They figured it was in the air, that if they came to Detroit and recorded on the freeway, they'd get the Motown sound. Listen, the Motown sound to me is not an audible sound. It's spiritual, and it comes from the people that make it happen. What other people didn't realize is that we just had one studio there, but we recorded in Chicago, Nashville, New York, L.A.almost every big city. And we still got the sound.[21]\\r\\nIn addition to the songwriting process of the writers and producers, one of the major factors in the widespread appeal of Motown's music was Gordy's practice of using a highly-select and tight-knit group of studio musicians, collectively known as the Funk Brothers, to record the instrumental or \\"band\\" tracks of a majority of Motown recordings. Among the studio musicians responsible for the \\"Motown Sound\\" were keyboardists Earl Van Dyke, Johnny Griffith, and Joe Hunter; guitarists Joe Messina, Robert White, and Eddie Willis; percussionists Eddie \\"Bongo\\" Brown and Jack Ashford; drummers Benny Benjamin, Uriel Jones, and Richard \\"Pistol\\" Allen; and bassists James Jamerson and Bob Babbitt. The band's career and work is chronicled in the 2002 documentary film Standing in the Shadows of Motown, which publicised the fact that these musicians \\"played on more number-one records than The Beatles, Elvis, The Rolling Stones, and The Beach Boys combined.\\"[22]\\r\\nMuch of the Motown Sound came from the use of overdubbed and duplicated instrumentation. Motown songs regularly featured two drummers instead of one (either overdubbed or in unison), as well as three or four guitar lines.[22] Bassist James Jamerson often played his instrument with only the index finger of his right hand, and created many of the basslines apparent on Motown songs such as \\"Up the Ladder to the Roof\\" by The Supremes.[22]\\r\\nArtist development was a major part of Motown's operations instituted by Berry Gordy. The acts on the Motown label were fastidiously groomed, dressed and choreographed for live performances. Motown artists were advised that their breakthrough into the white popular music market made them ambassadors for other African-American artists seeking broad market acceptance, and that they should think, act, walk and talk like royalty, so as to alter the less-than-dignified image commonly held of black musicians by white Americans in that era.[23] Given that many of the talented young artists had been raised in housing projects and lacked the necessary social and dress experience, this Motown department was not only necessary, it created an elegant style of presentation long associated with the label.[24] The artist development department specialized primarily in working with younger, less-experienced acts; experienced performers such as Jr. Walker and Marvin Gaye were exempt from artist-development classes.\\r\\nMany of the young artists participated in an annual package tour called the \\"Motortown Revue\\", which was popular, first, on the \\"chitlin' circuit\\", and, later, around the world. The tours gave the younger artists a chance to hone their performance and social skills and learn from the more experienced artists.\\r\\nIn order to avoid accusations of payola should DJs play too many records from the original Tamla label, Gordy formed Motown Records as a second label in 1960. The two labels featured the same writers, producers and artists.\\r\\nMany more subsidiary labels were established later under the umbrella of the Motown parent company, including Gordy Records, Soul Records and VIP Records; in reality the Motown Record Corporation controlled all of these labels. Most of the distinctions between Motown labels were largely arbitrary, with the same writers, producers and musicians working on all the major subsidiaries, and artists were often shuffled between labels for internal marketing reasons. All of these records are usually considered to be \\"Motown\\" records, regardless of whether they actually appeared on the Motown Records label itself.","input":"What is the difference between motown and tamla motown?"},{"output":"a two-year term","context":"Majority (237)\\r\\nMinority (193)\\r\\nVacant (5)\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States House of Representatives is the lower chamber of the United States Congress, the Senate being the upper chamber. Together they compose the legislature of the United States.\\r\\nThe composition of the House is established by Article One of the United States Constitution. The House is composed of Representatives who sit in congressional districts that are allocated to each of the 50 states on a basis of population as measured by the U.S. Census, with each district entitled to one representative. Since its inception in 1789, all Representatives have been directly elected. The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435.[1] As of the 2010 Census, the largest delegation is that of California, with fifty-three representatives. Seven states have the smallest delegation possible, a single representative: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming.[2]\\r\\nThe House is charged with the passage of federal legislation, known as bills, which, after concurrence by the Senate, are sent to the President for consideration. In addition to this basic power, the House has certain exclusive powers which include the power to initiate all bills related to revenue, the impeachment of federal officers, who are sent to trial before the Senate, and in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for President, the duty falls upon the House to elect one of the top three recipients of electors for that office, with one vote given to each state for that purpose.[3][4]\\r\\nThe presiding officer is the Speaker of the House, who is elected by the members thereof and is therefore traditionally the leader of the controlling party. The Speaker and other floor leaders are chosen by the Democratic Caucus or the Republican Conference, depending on whichever party has more voting members. The House meets in the south wing of the United States Capitol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, the Congress of the Confederation was a unicameral body in which each state was equally represented, and in which each state had a veto over most action. After eight years of a more limited confederal government under the Articles, numerous political leaders such as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton initiated the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which received the Confederation Congress's sanction to \\"amend the Articles of Confederation\\". All states except Rhode Island agreed to send delegates.\\r\\nThe issue of how to structure Congress was one of the most divisive among the founders during the Convention. Edmund Randolph's Virginia Plan called for a bicameral Congress: the lower house would be \\"of the people\\", elected directly by the people of the United States and representing public opinion, and a more deliberative upper house that would represent the individual states, and would be less susceptible to variations of mass sentiment, would be elected by the lower house.[6]\\r\\nThe House is referred to as the lower house, with the Senate being the upper house, although the United States Constitution does not use that terminology. Both houses' approval is necessary for the passage of legislation. The Virginia Plan drew the support of delegates from large states such as Virginia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, as it called for representation based on population. The smaller states, however, favored the New Jersey Plan, which called for a unicameral Congress with equal representation for the states.[6]\\r\\nEventually, the Convention reached the Connecticut Compromise or Great Compromise, under which one house of Congress (the House of Representatives) would provide representation proportional to each state's population, whereas the other (the Senate) would provide equal representation amongst the states.[6] The Constitution was ratified by the requisite number of states (nine out of the 13) in 1788, but its implementation was set for March 4, 1789. The House began work on April 1, 1789, when it achieved a quorum for the first time.\\r\\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, the House was frequently in conflict with the Senate over regionally divisive issues, including slavery. The North was much more populous than the South, and therefore dominated the House of Representatives. However, the North held no such advantage in the Senate, where the equal representation of states prevailed.\\r\\nRegional conflict was most pronounced over the issue of slavery. One example of a provision repeatedly supported by the House but blocked by the Senate was the Wilmot Proviso, which sought to ban slavery in the land gained during the Mexican√øAmerican War. Conflict over slavery and other issues persisted until the Civil War (1861√ø1865), which began soon after several southern states attempted to secede from the Union. The war culminated in the South's defeat and in the abolition of slavery. All southern senators except Andrew Johnson resigned their seats at the beginning of the war, and therefore the Senate did not hold the balance of power between North and South during the war.\\r\\nThe years of Reconstruction that followed witnessed large majorities for the Republican Party, which many Americans associated with the Union's victory in the Civil War and the ending of slavery. The Reconstruction period ended in about 1877; the ensuing era, known as the Gilded Age, was marked by sharp political divisions in the electorate. The Democratic Party and Republican Party each held majorities in the House at various times.\\r\\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries also saw a dramatic increase in the power of the Speaker of the House. The rise of the Speaker's influence began in the 1890s, during the tenure of Republican Thomas Brackett Reed. \\"Czar Reed\\", as he was nicknamed, attempted to put into effect his view that \\"The best system is to have one party govern and the other party watch.\\" The leadership structure of the House also developed during approximately the same period, with the positions of Majority Leader and Minority Leader being created in 1899. While the Minority Leader was the head of the minority party, the Majority Leader remained subordinate to the Speaker. The Speakership reached its zenith during the term of Republican Joseph Gurney Cannon, from 1903 to 1911. The powers of the Speaker included chairmanship of the influential Rules Committee and the ability to appoint members of other House committees. These powers, however, were curtailed in the \\"Revolution of 1910\\" because of the efforts of Democrats and dissatisfied Republicans who opposed Cannon's arguably heavy-handed tactics.\\r\\nThe Democratic Party dominated the House of Representatives during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933√ø1945), often winning over two-thirds of the seats. Both Democrats and Republicans were in power at various times during the next decade. The Democratic Party maintained control of the House from 1955 until 1995. In the mid-1970s, there were major reforms of the House, strengthening the power of sub-committees at the expense of committee chairs and allowing party leaders to nominate committee chairs. These actions were taken to undermine the seniority system, and to reduce the ability of a small number of senior members to obstruct legislation they did not favor. There was also a shift from the 1990s to greater control of the legislative program by the majority party; the power of party leaders (especially the Speaker) grew considerably.\\r\\nThe Republicans took control of the House in 1995, under the leadership of Speaker Newt Gingrich. Gingrich attempted to pass a major legislative program, the Contract with America, on which the House Republicans had been elected, and made major reforms of the House, notably reducing the tenure of committee chairs to three two-year terms. Many elements of the Contract did not pass Congress, were vetoed by President Bill Clinton, or were substantially altered in negotiations with Clinton. The Republicans held on to the House until 2006, when the Democrats won control and Nancy Pelosi was subsequently elected by the House as the first female Speaker. The Republicans retook the House in 2011, with the largest shift of power since the 1930s.[7]\\r\\nUnder Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, seats in the House of Representatives are apportioned among the states by population, as determined by the census conducted every ten years. Each state is entitled to at least one Representative, however, small its population.\\r\\nThe only constitutional rule relating to the size of the House states: \\"The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative.\\"[8] Congress regularly increased the size of the House to account for population growth until it fixed the number of voting House members at 435 in 1911.[1] In 1959, upon the admission of Alaska and Hawaii, the number was temporarily increased to 437 (seating one Representative from each of those states without changing existing apportionment), and returned to 435 four years later, after the reapportionment consequent to the 1960 census.\\r\\nThe Constitution does not provide for the representation of the District of Columbia or of territories. The District of Columbia and the territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are each represented by one non-voting delegate. Puerto Rico elects a Resident Commissioner, but other than having a four-year term, the Resident Commissioner's role is identical to the delegates from the other territories. The five Delegates and Resident Commissioner may participate in debates; prior to 2011,[9] they were also allowed to vote in committees and the Committee of the Whole when their votes would not be decisive.[10]\\r\\nStates that are entitled to more than one Representative are divided into single-member districts. This has been a federal statutory requirement since 1967.[11] Prior to that law, general ticket representation was used by some states.\\r\\nStates typically redraw district boundaries after each census, though they may do so at other times, such as the 2003 Texas redistricting. Each state determines its own district boundaries, either through legislation or through non-partisan panels. \\"Malapportionment\\" is unconstitutional and districts must be approximately equal in population (see Wesberry v. Sanders). Additionally, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits redistricting plans that are intended to, or have the effect of, discriminating against racial or language minority voters.[12] Aside from malapportionment and discrimination against racial or language minorities, federal courts have allowed state legislatures to engage in gerrymandering for the benefit of political parties or incumbents.[13][14] In a 1984 case, Davis v. Bandemer, the Supreme Court held that gerrymandered districts could be struck down on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause, but the Court did not articulate a standard for when districts are impermissibly gerrymandered. However, the Court overruled Davis in 2004 in Vieth v. Jubelirer, and Court precedent currently holds gerrymandering to be a political question. According to calculations made by Burt Neuborne using criteria set forth by the American Political Science Association, about 40 seats, less than 10% of the House membership, are chosen through a genuinely contested electoral process, given partisan gerrymandering.[15][16]\\r\\nArticle I, Section 2 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for representatives. Each representative must: (1) be at least twenty-five years old; (2) have been a citizen of the United States for the past seven years; and (3) be (at the time of the election) an inhabitant of the state he or she represents. Members are not required to live in the districts they represent, but they traditionally do.[17] The age and citizenship qualifications for representatives are less than those for senators. The constitutional requirements of Article I, Section 2 for election to Congress are the maximum requirements that can be imposed on a candidate.[18] Therefore, Article I, Section 5, which permits each House to be the judge of the qualifications of its own members does not permit either House to establish additional qualifications. Likewise a State could not establish additional qualifications.\\r\\nDisqualification: under the Fourteenth Amendment, a federal or state officer who takes the requisite oath to support the Constitution, but later engages in rebellion or aids the enemies of the United States, is disqualified from becoming a representative. This post√øCivil War provision was intended to prevent those who sided with the Confederacy from serving. However, disqualified individuals may serve if they gain the consent of two-thirds of both houses of Congress.\\r\\nElections for representatives are held in every even-numbered year, on Election Day the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. By law, Representatives must be elected from single-member districts. After a census is taken (in a year ending in 0), the year ending in 2 is the first year in which elections for U.S. House districts are based on that census (with the Congress based on those districts starting its term on the following Jan. 3).\\r\\nIn most states, major party candidates for each district are nominated in partisan primary elections, typically held in spring to late summer. In some states, the Republican and Democratic parties choose their respective candidates for each district in their political conventions in spring or early summer, which often use unanimous voice votes to reflect either confidence in the incumbent or the result of bargaining in earlier private discussions. Exceptions can result in so-called floor fightconvention votes by delegates, with outcomes that can be hard to predict. Especially if a convention is closely divided, a losing candidate may contend further by meeting the conditions for a primary election.\\r\\nThe courts generally do not consider ballot access rules for independent and third party candidates to be additional qualifications for holding office and there are no federal regulations regarding ballot access. As a result, the process to gain ballot access varies greatly from state to state, and in the case of a third party may be affected by results of previous years' elections.\\r\\nIn 1967, the United States Congress passed the Uniform Congressional District Act, which requires almost all representatives be elected from single-member-districts,[19][20] Following the Wesberry v. Sanders decision, Congress was motivated by fears that courts would impose at-large plurality districts on states that did not redistrict to comply with the new mandates for districts roughly equal in population, and Congress also sought to prevent attempts by southern states to use such voting systems to dilute the vote of racial minorities.[21] Several states have used multi-member districts in the past, although only two states (Hawaii and Maine) used multi-member districts in 1967.[20] Hawaii and Maine were made exempt from the Uniform Congressional District Act, and are free to use multi-member districts, although neither state chooses to do so.[20]\\r\\nLouisiana is unique in that it holds an all-party \\"primary election\\" on the general Election Day with a subsequent runoff election between the top two finishers (regardless of party) if no candidate received a majority in the primary. The states of Washington and California now use a similar (though not identical) system to that used by Louisiana. Seats vacated during a term are filled through special elections, unless the vacancy occurs closer to the next general election date than a pre-established deadline. The term of a member chosen in a special election usually begins the next day, or as soon as the results are certified.\\r\\nAdditionally, Washington D.C. and the five inhabited U.S. territories each elect a non-voting delegate. With the exception of the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, each representative and delegate serves for a two-year term. They have a voice and can introduce bills on the floor, but cannot vote there.\\r\\nRepresentatives and Delegates serve for two-year terms, while the Resident Commissioner serves for four years. The Constitution permits the House to expel a member with a two-thirds vote. In the history of the United States, only five members have been expelled from the House; in 1861, three were removed for supporting the Confederate states' secession: John Bullock Clark (D-MO), John William Reid (D-MO) and Henry Cornelius Burnett (D-KY). Michael Myers (D-PA) was expelled after his criminal conviction for accepting bribes in 1980, and James Traficant (D-OH) was expelled in 2002 following his conviction for corruption.[22] The House also has the power to formally censure or reprimand its members; censure or reprimand of a member requires only a simple majority, and does not remove that member from office.\\r\\nAs a check on the regional, popular, and rapidly changing politics of the House, the Senate has several distinct powers. For example, the \\"advice and consent\\" powers (such as the power to approve treaties) are a sole Senate privilege.[23] The House, however, has the exclusive power to initiate bills for raising revenue, to impeach officials, and to choose the President in the event that a presidential candidate fails to get a majority of the Electoral College votes.[24] The Senate and House are further differentiated by term lengths and the number of districts represented: the Senate has longer terms of six years, fewer members (currently one hundred, two for each state), and (in all but seven delegations) larger constituencies per member. The Senate is informally referred to as the \\"upper\\" house, and the House of Representatives as the \\"lower\\" house.\\r\\nAs of December?2014[update], the annual salary of each Representative is $174,000.[25][26] The Speaker of the House and the Majority and Minority Leaders earn more: $223,500 for the Speaker and $193,400 for their party leaders (the same as Senate leaders).[26] A cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) increase takes effect annually unless Congress votes to not accept it. Congress sets members' salaries; however, the Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits a change in salary (but not COLA[27]) from taking effect until after the next election of the whole House. Representatives are eligible for retirement benefits after serving for five years.[28] Outside pay is limited to 15% of congressional pay, and certain types of income involving a fiduciary responsibility or personal endorsement are prohibited.[26]\\r\\nRepresentatives use the prefix \\"The Honorable\\" before their names. A member of the House is referred to as a representative, congressman, or congresswoman. While senators are members of Congress, the terms congressman and congresswoman are not generally used by them.\\r\\nAll members of Congress are automatically (without the option of withdrawal) enrolled in the Federal Employees Retirement System, a pension system also used for federal civil servants. They become eligible to receive benefits after five years of service (two and one-half terms in the House). The FERS is composed of three elements:\\r\\nMembers of Congress may retire with full benefits at age 62 after five years of service, at age 50 after twenty years of service, and at any age after twenty-five years of service. They may retire with reduced benefits at ages 55 to 59 after five years of service. Depending on birth year, they may receive a reduced pension after ten years of service if they are between 55 years and 57 years of age.[29]\\r\\nMembers of Congress are permitted to deduct up to $3,000 of living expenses per year incurred while living away from their district or home state.[30]\\r\\nPrior to 2014, members of Congress and their staff had access to essentially the same health benefits as federal civil servants; they could voluntarily enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), an employer-sponsored health insurance program, and were eligible to participate in other programs, such as the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS).[31]\\r\\nHowever, Section 1312(d)(3)(D) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) provided that the only health plans that the federal government can make available to members of Congress and certain congressional staff are those created under the ACA or offered through a health care exchange. The Office of Personnel Management promulgated a final rule to comply with Section 1312(d)(3)(D).[31] Under the rule, effective January 1, 2014, members and designated staff are no longer able to purchase FEHBP plans as active employees.[31] However, if members enroll in a health plan offered through a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) exchange, they remain eligible for an employer contribution toward coverage, and members and designated staff who are eligible for retirement may enroll in a FEHBP plan upon retirement.[31]\\r\\nThe ACA and the final rule do not affect members' or staffers' eligibility for Medicare benefits.[31] The ACA and the final rule also do not affect members' and staffers' eligibility for other health benefits related to federal employment, so current members and staff are eligible to participate in FSAFEDS (which has three options within the program), the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program, and the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program.[31]\\r\\nThere is an Office of the Attending Physician at the U.S. Capitol, which current members may seek health care from for an annual fee.[31] The attending physician provides routine exams, consultations, and certain diagnostics, and may write prescriptions (although it does not dispense them).[31] The office does not provide vision or dental care.[31]\\r\\nCurrent members (but not their dependents, and not former members) may also receive medical and emergency dental care at military treatment facilities.[31] There is no charge for outpatient care if it is provided in the National Capital Region, but members are billed at full reimbursement rates (set by the Department of Defense) for inpatient care.[31] (Outside the National Capital Region, charges are at full reimbursement rates for both inpatient and outpatient care).[31]\\r\\nHouse members are eligible for a Member's Representational Allowance (MRA) to support them in their official and representational duties to their district.[32] The MRA is calculated based on three components: one for personnel, one for official office expenses and one for official or franked mail. The personnel allowance is the same for all members; the office and mail allowances vary based on the members' district's distance from Washington, D.C., the cost of office space in the member's district, and the number of non-business addresses in their district. These three components are used to calculate a single MRA that can fund any expenseeven though each component is calculated individually, the franking allowance can be used to pay for personnel expenses if the member so chooses. In 2011 this allowance averaged $1.4 million per member, and ranged from $1.35 to $1.67 million.[33]\\r\\nThe Personnel allowance was $944,671 per member in 2010. Each member may employ no more than 18 permanent employees. Members' employees' salary is capped at $168,411 as of 2009.[33]\\r\\nEach member-elect and one staffer can be paid for one round trip between their home in their congressional district and Washington, D.C. for organization caucuses.[33]\\r\\nThe party with a majority of seats in the House is known as the majority party. The next-largest party is the minority party. The Speaker, committee chairs, and some other officials are generally from the majority party; they have counterparts (for instance, the \\"ranking members\\" of committees) in the minority party.\\r\\nThe Constitution provides that the House may choose its own Speaker.[34] Although not explicitly required by the Constitution, every Speaker has been a member of the House. The Constitution does not specify the duties and powers of the Speaker, which are instead regulated by the rules and customs of the House. Speakers have a role both as a leader of the House and the leader of their party (which need not be the majority party; theoretically, a member of the minority party could be elected as Speaker with the support of a fraction of members of the majority party). Under the Presidential Succession Act (1947), the Speaker is second in the line of presidential succession behind the Vice President.\\r\\nThe Speaker is the presiding officer of the House but does not preside over every debate. Instead, s/he delegates the responsibility of presiding to other members in most cases. The presiding officer sits in a chair in the front of the House chamber. The powers of the presiding officer are extensive; one important power is that of controlling the order in which members of the House speak. No member may make a speech or a motion unless s/he has first been recognized by the presiding officer. Moreover, the presiding officer may rule on a \\"point of order\\" (a member's objection that a rule has been breached); the decision is subject to appeal to the whole House.\\r\\nSpeakers serve as chairs of their party's steering committee, which is responsible for assigning party members to other House committees. The Speaker chooses the chairmen of standing committees, appoints most of the members of the Rules Committee, appoints all members of conference committees, and determines which committees consider bills.\\r\\nEach party elects a floor leader, who is known as the Majority Leader or Minority Leader. The Minority Leader heads their party in the House, and the Majority Leader is their party's second-highest-ranking official, behind the Speaker. Party leaders decide what legislation members of their party should either support or oppose.\\r\\nEach party also elects a Whip, who works to ensure that the party's members vote as the party leadership desires. The current majority whip in the House of Representatives is Steve Scalise, who is a member of the Republican Party. The current minority whip is Steny Hoyer, who is a member of the Democratic Party. The whip is supported by chief deputy whips.\\r\\nIn the 112th Congress, the Democratic Party has an additional Assistant Minority Leader, Jim Clyburn, who ranks between the whips and the caucus/conference chair.\\r\\nAfter the whips, the next ranking official in the House party's leadership is the Party Conference Chair (styled as the Republican Conference Chair and Democratic Caucus Chair).\\r\\nAfter the Conference Chair, there are differences between each party's subsequent leadership ranks. After the Democratic Caucus Chair is the Campaign Committee Chair (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee), then the co-chairs of the Steering Committee. For the Republicans it is the Chair of the House Republican Policy Committee, followed by the Campaign Committee Chairman (styled as the National Republican Congressional Committee).\\r\\nThe chairs of House committees, particularly influential standing committees such as Appropriations, Ways and Means, and Rules, are powerful but not officially part of House leadership hierarchy. Until the post of Majority Leader was created, the Chair of Ways and Means was the de facto majority leader.\\r\\nWhen the Presidency and Senate are controlled by a different party from the one controlling the House, the Speaker can become the de facto \\"leader of the opposition\\". Some notable examples include Tip O'Neill in the 1980s, Newt Gingrich in the 1990s, and John Boehner in the 2010s. Since the Speaker is a partisan officer with substantial power to control the business of the House, the position is often used for partisan advantage.\\r\\nIn the instance when the Presidency and both Houses of Congress are controlled by one party, the Speaker normally takes a low profile and defers to the President. For that situation the House Minority Leader can play the role of a de facto \\"leader of the opposition\\", often more so than the Senate Minority Leader, due to the more partisan nature of the House and the greater role of leadership.\\r\\nThe House is also served by several officials who are not members. The House's chief such officer is the Clerk, who maintains public records, prepares documents, and oversees junior officials, including pages, until the junior position's discontinuation in 2011. The Clerk also presides over the House at the beginning of each new Congress pending the election of a Speaker. Another officer is the Chief Administrative Officer, responsible for the day-to-day administrative support to the House of Representatives. This includes everything from payroll to foodservice.\\r\\nThe position of Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) was created by the 104th Congress following the 1994 mid-term elections, replacing the positions of Doorkeeper and Director of Non-Legislative and Financial Services (created by the previous congress to administer the non-partisan functions of the House). The CAO also assumed some of the responsibilities of the House Information Services, which previously had been controlled directly by the Committee on House Administration, then headed by Representative Charlie Rose of North Carolina, along with the House \\"Folding Room\\".\\r\\nThe Chaplain leads the House in prayer at the opening of the day. There is also a Sergeant at Arms, who as the House's chief law enforcement officer maintains order and security on House premises. Finally, routine police work is handled by the United States Capitol Police, which is supervised by the Capitol Police Board, a body to which the Sergeant at Arms belongs, and chairs in even-numbered years.\\r\\nLike the Senate, the House of Representatives meets in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. At one end of the chamber of the House is a rostrum from which the Speaker, Speaker Pro Tempore, or (when in the Committee of the Whole) the Chair presides.[35] The lower tier of the rostrum is used by clerks and other officials. Members' seats are arranged in the chamber in a semicircular pattern facing the rostrum and are divided by a wide central aisle.[36] By tradition, Democrats sit on the left of the center aisle, while Republicans sit on the right, facing the presiding officer's chair.[37] Sittings are normally held on weekdays; meetings on Saturdays and Sundays are rare. Sittings of the House are generally open to the public; visitors must obtain a House Gallery pass from a congressional office.[38] Sittings are broadcast live on television and have been streamed live on C-SPAN since March 19, 1979,[39] and on HouseLive, the official streaming service operated by the Clerk, since the early 2010s.\\r\\nThe procedure of the House depends not only on the rules, but also on a variety of customs, precedents, and traditions. In many cases, the House waives some of its stricter rules (including time limits on debates) by unanimous consent.[40] A member may block a unanimous consent agreement; in practice, objections are rare. The presiding officer, the Speaker of the House enforces the rules of the House, and may warn members who deviate from them. The Speaker uses a gavel to maintain order.[41] The box in which legislation is placed to be considered by the House is called the hopper.[42]\\r\\nIn one of its first resolutions, the U.S. House of Representatives established the Office of the Sergeant at Arms. In an American tradition adopted from English custom in 1789 by the first Speaker of the House, Frederick Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania, the Mace of the United States House of Representatives is used to open all sessions of the House. It is also used during the inaugural ceremonies for all Presidents of the United States. For daily sessions of the House, the sergeant at Arms carries the mace in front of the Speaker in procession to the rostrum. It is placed on a green marble pedestal to the Speaker's right. When the House is in committee, the mace is moved to a pedestal next to the desk of the Sergeant at Arms.[43]\\r\\nThe Constitution provides that a majority of the House constitutes a quorum to do business.[44] Under the rules and customs of the House, a quorum is always assumed present unless a quorum call explicitly demonstrates otherwise. House rules prevent a member from making a point of order that a quorum is not present unless a question is being voted on. The presiding officer does not accept a point of order of no quorum during general debate, or when a question is not before the House.[45]\\r\\nDuring debates, a member may speak only if called upon by the presiding officer. The presiding officer decides which members to recognize, and can therefore control the course of debate.[46] All speeches must be addressed to the presiding officer, using the words \\"Mr. Speaker\\" or \\"Madam Speaker\\". Only the presiding officer may be directly addressed in speeches; other members must be referred to in the third person. In most cases, members do not refer to each other only by name, but also by state, using forms such as \\"the gentleman from Virginia\\", \\"the distinguished gentlewoman from California\\", or \\"my distinguished friend from Alabama\\".\\r\\nThere are 448 permanent seats on the House Floor and four tables, two on each side. These tables are occupied by members of the committee that have brought a bill to the floor for consideration and by the respective party leadership. Members address the House from microphones at any table or \\"the well,\\" the area immediately in front of the rostrum.[47]\\r\\nPer the constitution, the House determines the rules according to which it passes legislation. The rules are in principle open to change with each new Congress, but in practice each new session amends a standing set of rules built up over the history of the body in an early resolution published for public inspection.[48] Before legislation reaches the floor of the House, the Rules Committee normally passes a rule to govern debate on that measure (which then must be passed by the full House before it becomes effective). For instance, the committee determines if amendments to the bill are permitted. An \\"open rule\\" permits all germane amendments, but a \\"closed rule\\" restricts or even prohibits amendment. Debate on a bill is generally restricted to one hour, equally divided between the majority and minority parties. Each side is led during the debate by a \\"floor manager\\", who allocates debate time to members who wish to speak. On contentious matters, many members may wish to speak; thus, a member may receive as little as one minute, or even thirty seconds, to make his/her point.[49]\\r\\nWhen debate concludes, the motion in question is put to a vote. In many cases, the House votes by voice vote; the presiding officer puts the question, and members respond either \\"yea\\" or \\"aye\\" (in favor of the motion) or \\"nay\\" or \\"no\\" (against the motion). The presiding officer then announces the result of the voice vote. A member may however challenge the presiding officer's assessment and \\"request the yeas and nays\\" or \\"request a recorded vote\\". The request may be granted only if it is seconded by one-fifth of the members present. In practice, however, members of congress second requests for recorded votes as a matter of courtesy. Some votes are always recorded, such as those on the annual budget.[50]\\r\\nA recorded vote may be taken in one of three different ways. One is electronically. Members use a personal identification card to record their votes at 46 voting stations in the chamber. Votes are usually held in this way. A second mode of recorded vote is by teller. Members hand in colored cards to indicate their votes: green for \\"yea\\", red for \\"nay\\", and orange for \\"present\\" (i.e., to abstain). Teller votes are normally held only when electronic voting breaks down. Finally, the House may conduct a roll call vote. The Clerk reads the list of members of the House, each of whom announces their vote when their name is called. This procedure is only used rarely (such as for the election of a Speaker) because of the time consumed by calling over four hundred names.[50]\\r\\nVoting traditionally lasts for, at most, fifteen minutes, but it may be extended if the leadership needs to \\"whip\\" more members into alignment.[50] The 2003 vote on the prescription drug benefit was open for three hours, from 3:00 to 6:00?a.m., to receive four additional votes, three of which were necessary to pass the legislation.[51] The 2005 vote on the Central American Free Trade Agreement was open for one hour, from 11:00?p.m. to midnight.[52] An October 2005 vote on facilitating refinery construction was kept open for forty minutes.[53]\\r\\nPresiding officers may vote like other members. They may not, however, vote twice in the event of a tie; rather, a tie vote defeats the motion.[54]\\r\\nThe House uses committees and their subcommittees for a variety of purposes, including the review of bills and the oversight of the executive branch. The appointment of committee members is formally made by the whole House, but the choice of members is actually made by the political parties. Generally, each party honors the preferences of individual members, giving priority on the basis of seniority. Historically, membership on committees has been in rough proportion to the party's strength in the House as a whole, with two exceptions: on the Rules Committee, the majority party fills nine of the thirteen seats;[55] and on the Ethics Committee, each party has an equal number of seats.[56] However, when party control in the House is closely divided, extra seats on committees are sometimes allocated to the majority party. In the 109th Congress, for example, the Republicans controlled about 53% of the House as a whole, but had 54% of the Appropriations Committee members, 55% of the members on the Energy and Commerce Committee, 58% of the members on the Judiciary Committee, and 69% of the members on the Rules Committee.\\r\\nThe largest committee of the House is the Committee of the Whole, which, as its name suggests, consists of all members of the House. The Committee meets in the House chamber; it may consider and amend bills, but may not grant them final passage. Generally, the debate procedures of the Committee of the Whole are more flexible than those of the House itself. One advantage of the Committee of the Whole is its ability to include otherwise non-voting members of Congress.\\r\\nMost committee work is performed by twenty standing committees, each of which has jurisdiction over a specific set of issues, such as Agriculture or Foreign Affairs. Each standing committee considers, amends, and reports bills that fall under its jurisdiction. Committees have extensive powers with regard to bills; they may block legislation from reaching the floor of the House. Standing committees also oversee the departments and agencies of the executive branch. In discharging their duties, standing committees have the power to hold hearings and to subpoena witnesses and evidence.\\r\\nThe House also has one permanent committee that is not a standing committee, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and from time to time may establish committees that are temporary and advisory in nature, such as the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. This latter committee, created in the 110th Congress and reauthorized for the 111th, has no jurisdiction over legislation and must be chartered anew at the start of every Congress. The House also appoints members to serve on joint committees, which include members of the Senate and House. Some joint committees oversee independent government bodies; for instance, the Joint Committee on the Library oversees the Library of Congress. Other joint committees serve to make advisory reports; for example, there exists a Joint Committee on Taxation. Bills and nominees are not referred to joint committees. Hence, the power of joint committees is considerably lower than those of standing committees.\\r\\nEach House committee and subcommittee is led by a chairman (always a member of the majority party). From 1910 to the 1970s, committee chairs were powerful. Woodrow Wilson in his classic study,[57] suggested:\\r\\nPower is nowhere concentrated; it is rather deliberately and of set policy scattered amongst many small chiefs. It is divided up, as it were, into forty-seven seigniories, in each of which a Standing Committee is the court-baron and its chairman lord-proprietor. These petty barons, some of them not a little powerful, but none of them within the reach of the full powers of rule, may at will exercise almost despotic sway within their own shires, and may sometimes threaten to convulse even the realm itself.\\r\\nFrom 1910 to 1975 committee and subcommittee chairmanship was determined purely by seniority; congressmembers sometimes had to wait 30 years to get one, but their chairship was independent of party leadership. The rules were changed in 1975 to permit party caucuses to elect chairmen, shifting power upward to the party leaders. In 1995, Republicans under Newt Gingrich set a limit of three two-year terms for committee chairs. The chairman's powers are extensive; he controls the committee/subcommittee agenda, and may prevent the committee from dealing with a bill. The senior member of the minority party is known as the Ranking Member. In some committees like Appropriations, partisan disputes are few.\\r\\nMost bills may be introduced in either House of Congress. However, the Constitution states, \\"All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives\\". As a result of the Origination Clause, the Senate cannot initiate bills imposing taxes. This provision barring the Senate from introducing revenue bills is based on the practice of the British Parliament, in which only the House of Commons may originate such measures. Furthermore, congressional tradition holds that the House of Representatives originates appropriation bills.\\r\\nAlthough it cannot originate revenue bills, the Senate retains the power to amend or reject them. Woodrow Wilson wrote the following about appropriations bills:[58]\\r\\n[T]he constitutional prerogative of the House has been held to apply to all the general appropriations bills, and the Senate's right to amend these has been allowed the widest possible scope. The upper house may add to them what it pleases; may go altogether outside of their original provisions and tack to them entirely new features of legislation, altering not only the amounts but even the objects of expenditure, and making out of the materials sent them by the popular chamber measures of an almost totally new character.\\r\\nThe approval of the Senate and the House of Representatives is required for a bill to become law. Both Houses must pass the same version of the bill; if there are differences, they may be resolved by a conference committee, which includes members of both bodies. For the stages through which bills pass in the Senate, see Act of Congress.\\r\\nThe President may veto a bill passed by the House and Senate. If he does, the bill does not become law unless each House, by a two-thirds vote, votes to override the veto.\\r\\nThe Constitution provides that the Senate's \\"advice and consent\\" is necessary for the President to make appointments and to ratify treaties. Thus, with its potential to frustrate Presidential appointments, the Senate is more powerful than the House.\\r\\nThe Constitution empowers the House of Representatives to impeach federal officials for \\"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors\\" and empowers the Senate to try such impeachments. The House may approve \\"articles of impeachment\\" by a simple majority vote; however, a two-thirds vote is required for conviction in the Senate. A convicted official is automatically removed from office and may be disqualified from holding future office under the United States. No further punishment is permitted during the impeachment proceedings; however, the party may face criminal penalties in a normal court of law.\\r\\nIn the history of the United States, the House of Representatives has impeached sixteen officials, of whom seven were convicted. (Another, Richard Nixon, resigned after the House Judiciary Committee passed articles of impeachment but before a formal impeachment vote by the full House.) Only two Presidents of the United States have ever been impeached: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Both trials ended in acquittal; in Johnson's case, the Senate fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority required for conviction.\\r\\nUnder the Twelfth Amendment, the House has the power to elect the President if no presidential candidate receives a majority of votes in the Electoral College. The Twelfth Amendment requires the House to choose from the three candidates with the highest numbers of electoral votes. The Constitution provides that \\"the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote.\\" It is rare for no presidential candidate to receive a majority of electoral votes. In the history of the United States, the House has only had to choose a President twice. In 1800, which was before the adoption of the Twelfth Amendment, it elected Thomas Jefferson over Aaron Burr. In 1824, it elected John Quincy Adams over Andrew Jackson and William H. Crawford. (If no vice-presidential candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes, the Senate elects the Vice President from the two candidates with the highest numbers of electoral votes.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 385320N 77032W? / ?38.88889N 77.00889W? / 38.88889; -77.00889","input":"How long do we elect a us representative?"},{"output":"the Tibetan Himalaya","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Himalayas, or Himalaya (/?h?m??le??, h??m?l?j?/), form a mountain range in Asia, separating the plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Himalayan range has many of the Earth's highest peaks, including the highest, Mount Everest.  The Himalayas include over fifty mountains exceeding 7,200 metres (23,600?ft) in elevation, including ten of the fourteen 8,000-metre peaks.  By contrast, the highest peak outside Asia (Aconcagua, in the Andes) is 6,961 metres (22,838?ft) tall.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nLifted by the subduction of the Indian tectonic plate under the Eurasian Plate, the Himalayan mountain range runs west-northwest to east-southeast in an arc 2,400 kilometres (1,500?mi) long.[2]  Its western anchor, Nanga Parbat, lies just south of the northernmost bend of Indus river.

The Himalayan range is bordered on the northwest by the Karakoram and the Hindu Kush ranges, to the north, the chain is separated from the Tibetan Plateau by a 50√ø60 kilometres (31√ø37?mi) wide tectonic valley called the Indus-Tsangpo Suture.[3] Towards the south the arc of the Himalaya is ringed by the very low Indo-Gangetic Plain.[4]  The range varies in width from 350 kilometres (220?mi) in the west (Pakistan) to 150 kilometres (93?mi) in the east (Arunachal Pradesh).[5]  The Himalayas are distinct from the other great ranges of central Asia, although sometimes the term Himalaya (or Greater Himalaya) is loosely used to include the Karakoram and some of the other ranges.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Himalayas are inhabited by 52.7 million people[5] and are spread across five countries: Nepal, India, Bhutan, China and Pakistan.  Some of the world's major rivers  the Indus, the Ganges and the Tsangpo-Brahmaputra  rise in the Himalayas, and their combined drainage basin is home to roughly 600 million people.  The Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the region, helping to keep the monsoon rains on the Indian plain and limiting rainfall on the Tibetan plateau.  The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of the Indian subcontinent; many Himalayan peaks are sacred in Hinduism and Buddhism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name of the range derives from the Sanskrit Him-laya (??????, \\"Abode of Snow\\"), from him (???, \\"snow\\") and -laya (???, \\"receptacle, dwelling\\").[6] They are now known as the \\"Himalaya Mountains\\", usually shortened to the \\"Himalayas\\". Formerly, they were described in the singular as the \\"Himalaya\\". This was also previously transcribed \\"Himmaleh\\", as in Emily Dickinson's poetry[7] and Henry David Thoreau's essays.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mountains are known as the Himlaya in Nepali and Hindi (both written ??????), the Himalaya (?????????) or 'The Land of Snow' (?????????????) in Tibetan, the Hamaleh Mountain Range (????? ??? ??????) in Urdu and the Ximalaya Mountain Range (t X\\\\, > Xm“äly“ä Shnmi) in Chinese.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the great curve of the Himalayan mountains lie the 8000m peaks of Dhaulagiri and Annapurna in Nepal, separated by the Kali Gandaki Gorge. The gorge splits the Himalayas into Western and Eastern sections both ecologically and orographically √ø the pass at the head of the Kali Gandaki, the Kora La is the lowest point on the ridgeline between Everest and K2. To the east of Annapurna are the 8000?m peaks of Manaslu and across the border in Tibet, Shishapangma. To the south of these lies Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal and the largest city in the Himalayas. East of the Kathmandu Valley lies valley of the Bhote/Sun Kosi river which rises in Tibet and provides the main overland route between Nepal and China √ø the Araniko Highway/China National Highway 318. Further east is the Mahalangur Himal with four of the world's six highest mountains, including the highest: Cho Oyu, Everest, Lhotse and Makalu. The Khumbu region, popular for trekking, is found here on the south-western approaches to Everest. The Arun river drains the northern slopes of these mountains, before turning south and flowing through the range to the east of Makalu.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the far east of Nepal, the Himalayas rise to the Kanchenjunga massif on the border with India, the third highest mountain in the world, the most easterly 8000?m summit and the highest point of India. The eastern side of Kanchenjunga is in the Indian state of Sikkim. Formerly an independent Kingdom, it lies on the main route from India to Lhasa, Tibet, which passes over the Nathu La pass into Tibet. East of Sikkim lies the ancient Buddhist Kingdom of Bhutan. The highest mountain in Bhutan is Gangkhar Puensum, which is also a strong candidate for the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The Himalayas here are becoming increasingly rugged with heavily forested steep valleys. The Himalayas continue, turning slightly northeast, through the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh as well as Tibet, before reaching their easterly conclusion in the peak of Namche Barwa, situated in Tibet inside the great bend of the Yarlang Tsangpo river. On the other side of the Tsangpo, to the east, are the Kangri Garpo mountains. The high mountains to the north of the Tsangpo including Gyala Peri, however, are also sometimes also included in the Himalayas.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing west from Dhaulagiri, Western Nepal is somewhat remote and lacks major high mountains, but is home to Rara Lake, the largest lake in Nepal. The Karnali River rises in Tibet but cuts through the center of the region. Further west, the border with India follows the Sarda River and provides a trade route into China, where on the Tibetan plateau lies the high peak of Gurla Mandhata. Just across Lake Manasarovar from this lies the sacred Mount Kailash, which stands close to the source of the four main rivers of Himalayas and is revered in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, Jainism, and Bonpo. In the newly created Indian state of Uttarkhand, the Himalayas rise again as the Garwhal Himalayas with the high peaks of Nanda Devi and Kamet. The state is also an important pilgrimage destination, with the source of the Ganges at Gangotri and the Yamuna at Yamunotri, and the temples at Badrinath and Kedarnath. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next Himalayan Indian state, Himachal Pradesh, lacks very high mountains, but is noted for its hill stations, particularly Shimla, the summer capital of the British Raj, and Dharmasala, the centre of the Tibetan community in exile in India. This area marks the start of the Punjab Himalaya and the Sutlej river, the most easterly of the five tributaries of the Indus, cuts through the range here. Further west, the Himalayas form most of the southern portion of the disputed Indian State of Jammu & Kashmir. The twin peaks of Nun Kun are the only mountains over 7000?m in this part of the Himalayas. Beyond lies the renown Kashmir Valley and the town and lakes of Srinagar. Finally, the Himalayas cross the Line of Control into Pakistan and reach their western end in the dramatic 8000?m peak of Nanga Parbat, which rises over 7000?m above the Indus valley and is the most westerly of the 8000?m summits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Himalayan range is one of the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consists mostly of uplifted sedimentary and metamorphic rock. According to the modern theory of plate tectonics, its formation is a result of a continental collision or orogeny along the convergent boundary between the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The Arakan Yoma highlands in Myanmar and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal were also formed as a result of this collision.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Upper Cretaceous, about 70 million years ago, the north-moving Indo-Australian Plate (which has subsequently broken into the Indian Plate and the Australian Plate[10]) was moving at about 15?cm per year. About 50 million years ago this fast moving Indo-Australian Plate had completely closed the Tethys Ocean, the existence of which has been determined by sedimentary rocks settled on the ocean floor and the volcanoes that fringed its edges. Since both plates were composed of low density continental crust, they were thrust faulted and folded into mountain ranges rather than subducting into the mantle along an oceanic trench.[9] An often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine limestone from this ancient ocean.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the Indian plate continues to be driven horizontally at the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to continue to move upwards.[12] The Indian plate is still moving at 67?mm per year, and over the next 10 million years it will travel about 1,500?km into Asia. About 20? mm per year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by thrusting along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5? mm per year, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also makes this region seismically active, leading to earthquakes from time to time.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the last ice age, there was a connected ice stream of glaciers between Kangchenjunga in the east and Nanga Parbat in the west.[13][14] In the west, the glaciers joined with the ice stream network in the Karakoram, and in the north, they joined with the former Tibetan inland ice. To the south, outflow glaciers came to an end below an elevation of 1,000√ø2,000 metres (3,300√ø6,600?ft).[13][15] While the current valley glaciers of the Himalaya reach at most 20 to 32 kilometres (12 to 20?mi) in length, several of the main valley glaciers were 60 to 112 kilometres (37 to 70?mi) long during the ice age.[13] The glacier snowline (the altitude where accumulation and ablation of a glacier are balanced) was about 1,400√ø1,660 metres (4,590√ø5,450?ft) lower than it is today. Thus, the climate was at least 7.0 to 8.3?C (12.6 to 14.9?F) colder than it is today.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite their scale, the Himalayas do not form a major watershed, and a number of rivers cut through the range, particularly in the eastern part of the range. As a result, the main ridge of the Himalayas is not clearly defined, and mountain passes are not as significant for traversing the range as with other mountain ranges. The rivers of the Himalayas drain into two large river systems:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe northern slopes of Gyala Peri and the peaks beyond the Tsangpo, sometimes included in the Himalayas, drain into the Irrawaddy River, which originates in eastern Tibet and flows south through Myanmar to drain into the Andaman Sea. The Salween, Mekong, Yangtze and Yellow River all originate from parts of the Tibetan Plateau that are geologically distinct from the Himalaya mountains and are therefore not considered true Himalayan rivers. Some geologists refer to all the rivers collectively as the circum-Himalayan rivers.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great ranges of central Asia, including the Himalayas, contain the third-largest deposit of ice and snow in the world, after Antarctica and the Arctic.[19] The Himalayan range encompasses about 15,000 glaciers, which store about 12,000?km3 (3,000 cubic miles) of fresh water.[20] Its glaciers include the Gangotri and Yamunotri (Uttarakhand) and Khumbu glaciers (Mount Everest region), Langtang glacier (Langtang region) and Zemu (Sikkim).\\r\\n\\r\\nOwing to the mountains' latitude near the Tropic of Cancer, the permanent snow line is among the highest in the world at typically around 5,500 metres (18,000?ft).[21] In contrast, equatorial mountains in New Guinea, the Rwenzoris and Colombia have a snow line some 900 metres (2,950?ft) lower.[22] The higher regions of the Himalayas are snowbound throughout the year, in spite of their proximity to the tropics, and they form the sources of several large perennial rivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, scientists have monitored a notable increase in the rate of glacier retreat across the region as a result of global climate change.[23] For example, glacial lakes have been forming rapidly on the surface of debris-covered glaciers in the Bhutan Himalaya during the last few decades. Although the effect of this will not be known for many years, it potentially could mean disaster for the hundreds of millions of people who rely on the glaciers to feed the rivers during the dry seasons.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Himalayan region is dotted with hundreds of lakes. Most of the larger lakes are on the northern side of the main range. The most famous is the sacred freshwater Lake Manasarovar, near to Mount Kailas with an area of 410?km2 and an altitude of 4590m. It drains into the nearby Lake Rakshastal  with an area of 250?km2 and slightly lower at 4575m.  Pangong Tso, which is spread across the border between India and China, at far western end of Tibet, and Yamdrok Tso, located in south central Tibet, are among the largest with surface areas of 700?km2, and 638?km2, respectively. Lake Puma Yumco is one of the highest of the larger lakes at an elevation of 5030m.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth of the main range, the lakes are smaller. Tilicho Lake in Nepal in the Annapurna massif is one of the highest lakes in the world. Other notable lakes include Rara Lake in western Nepal, She-Phoksundo Lake in the Shey Phoksundo National Park of Nepal, Gurudongmar Lake, in North Sikkim, Gokyo Lakes in Solukhumbu district of Nepal and Lake Tsongmo, near the Indo-China border in Sikkim.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the lakes present a danger of a glacial lake outburst flood. The Tsho Rolpa glacier lake in the Rowaling Valley, in the Dolakha District of Nepal, is rated as the most dangerous. The lake, which is located at an altitude of 4,580 metres (15,030?ft) has grown considerably over the last 50 years due to glacial melting.[25][26] The mountain lakes are known to geographers as tarns if they are caused by glacial activity. Tarns are found mostly in the upper reaches of the Himalaya, above 5,500 metres.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vast size, huge altitude range and complex topography of the Himalayas mean they experience a wide range of climates, from humid subtropical in the foothills to cold, dry desert conditions on the Tibetan side of the range.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor much of Himalayas √ø that on the south side of the high mountains, except in the furthest west, the most characteristic feature of the climate is the monsoon. Heavy rain arrives on the south-west monsoon in June and persists until September. The monsoon can seriously impact transport and cause major landslides. It restricts tourism √ø the trekking and mountaineering season is limited to either before the monsoon in April/May or after the monsoon in October/November (autumn). In Nepal and Sikkim, there are often considered to be five seasons: summer, monsoon, autumn (or post-monsoon), winter and spring.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing the K?ppen climate classification, the lower elevations of the Himalayas, reaching in mid elevations in central Nepal (including the Kathmandu valley), are classified as Cwa, Humid subtropical climate with dry winters. Higher up, most of the Himalayas have a subtropical highland climate (Cwb).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the furthest west of the Himalayas, in the west of the Kashmir valley and the Indus valley, the South Asian monsoon is no longer a dominant factor and most precipitation falls in the spring. Srinagar receives around 723 millimetres (28?in) around half the rainfall of locations such as Shimla and Kathmandu, with the wettest months being March and April.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe northern side of the Himalayas, also known as the Tibetan Himalaya, is dry, cold and generally wind swept particularly in the west where it has a cold desert climate. The vegetation is sparse and stunted and the winters are severely cold. Most of the precipitation in the region is in the form of snow during late winter and spring months.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal impacts on climate are significant throughout the Himalayas. Temperatures fall by 6.5?C (11.7?F) for every 1000m rise in altitude. This gives rise to a variety of climates from nearly tropical in the foothills to tundra and permanent snow and ice. Local climate is also affected by the topography: The leeward side of the mountains receive less rain while the well exposed slopes get heavy rainfall and the rain shadow of large mountains can be significant, for example leading to near desert conditions in the Upper Mustang which is sheltered from the monsoon rains by the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri massifs and has annual precipitation of around 300mm, while Pokhara on the southern side of the massifs has substantial rainfall (3,900mm/year). Thus although annual precipitation is generally higher in east than the west, local variations are often more important.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan Plateau. They prevent frigid, dry winds from blowing south into the subcontinent, which keeps South Asia much warmer than corresponding temperate regions in the other continents. It also forms a barrier for the monsoon winds, keeping them from traveling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the Terai region. The Himalayas are also believed to play an important part in the formation of Central Asian deserts, such as the Taklamakan and Gobi.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flora and fauna of the Himalayas vary with climate, rainfall, altitude, and soils. The climate ranges from tropical at the base of the mountains to permanent ice and snow at the highest elevations. The amount of yearly rainfall increases from west to east along the southern front of the range. This diversity of altitude, rainfall and soil conditions combined with the very high snow line supports a variety of distinct plant and animal communities. The extremes of high altitude (low atmospheric pressure) combined with extreme cold favor extremophile organisms.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\n At high altitudes, the elusive and previously endangered snow leopard is the main predator. Its prey includes members of the goat family grazing on the alpine pastures and living on the rocky terrain, notably the endemic bharal or Himalayan blue sheep. The Himalayan musk deer is also found at high altitude. Hunted for its musk, it is now rare and endangered. Other endemic or near endemic herbivores include the Himalayan tahr, the takin, the Himalayan serow, and the Himalayan goral. The critically endangered Himalayan subspecies of the brown bear is found sporadically across the range as is the Asian black bear. In the mountainous mixed deciduous and conifer forests of the eastern Himalayas, Red panda feed in the dense understories of bamboo. Lower down the forests of the foothills are inhabited by several different primates, including the endangered Gee's golden langur and the Kashmir gray langur, with highly restricted ranges in the east and west of the Himalayas respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unique floral and faunal wealth of the Himalayas is undergoing structural and compositional changes due to climate change. Hydrangea hirta is an example of floral species that can be found in this area. The increase in temperature is shifting various species to higher elevations. The oak forest is being invaded by pine forests in the Garhwal Himalayan region. There are reports of early flowering and fruiting in some tree species, especially rhododendron, apple and box myrtle. The highest known tree species in the Himalayas is Juniperus tibetica located at 4,900 metres (16,080?ft) in Southeastern Tibet.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Himalayan population belongs to four distinct cultural groups, who throughout history have systematically penetrated the isolated indigenous Himalayan population. Those migrating cultures √ø Hindu (Indian), Buddhist (Tibetan), Islamic (Afghanistan√øIran) and Animist (Burmese and south-eastern Asian) √ø without any doubt have created here their own individual and unique place.[5] Their current arrangement, though with a few exceptions, is linked to specific geographical regions, and the relative altitude at which they occur.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many cultural aspects of the Himalayas. In Jainism, Mount Ashtapad in Himalayas is a sacred place where the first Jain Tirthankara, Rishabhdeva attained moksha. It is believed that after Rishabhdeva attained nirvana, his son emperor Bharata Chakravartin had constructed three stupas and twenty four shrines of the 24 Tirthankaras with their idols studded with precious stones over there and named it Sinhnishdha.[31][32][33] For the Hindus, the Himalayas are personified as Himavath, the father of the goddess Parvati.[34] The Himalayas is also considered to be the father of the river Ganges. The Mountain Kailash is a sacred peak to the Hindus and is where the Lord Shiva is believed to live.[citation needed] Two of the most sacred places of pilgrimage for the Hindus is the temple complex in Pashupatinath and Muktinath, also known as Saligrama because of the presence of the sacred black rocks called saligrams.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Buddhists also lay a great deal of importance on the mountains of the Himalayas. Paro Taktsang is the holy place where Buddhism started in Bhutan.[36] The Muktinath is also a place of pilgrimage for the Tibetan Buddhists. They believe that the trees in the poplar grove came from the walking sticks of eighty-four ancient Indian Buddhist magicians or mahasiddhas. They consider the saligrams to be representatives of the Tibetan serpent deity known as Gawo Jagpa.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Himalayan peoples diversity shows in many different ways. It shows through their architecture, their languages and dialects, their beliefs and rituals, as well as their clothing.[37] The shapes and materials of the peoples homes reflect their practical needs and the beliefs. Another example of the diversity amongst the Himalayan peoples is that handwoven textiles display colors and patterns unique to their ethnic backgrounds. Finally, some people place a great importance on jewellery. The Rai and Limbu women wear big gold earrings and nose rings to show their wealth through their jewellery.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral places in the Himalayas are of religious significance in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. A notable example of a religious site is Paro Taktsang, where Padmasambhava is said to have founded Buddhism in Bhutan.[38] Padmasambhava is also worshipped as the patron saint of Sikkim. There are also Muslim and Hindhu Shaivite Kashmiri Pandit in the area of Kashmir.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Hinduism, the Himalayas have been personified as the king of all Mountain √ø \\"Giriraj Himavat\\", father of Ganga and Parvati (form of Adi Shakti Durga).[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of Vajrayana Buddhist sites are situated in the Himalayas, in Tibet, Bhutan and in the Indian regions of Ladakh, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Spiti and Darjeeling. There were over 6,000 monasteries in Tibet, including the residence of the Dalai Lama.[40] Bhutan, Sikkim and Ladakh are also dotted with numerous monasteries. The Tibetan Muslims have their own mosques in Lhasa and Shigatse.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Himalayas are home to a diversity of medicinal resources. Plants from the forests have been used for millennia to treat conditions ranging from simple coughs to snake bites.[35]\\r\\nDifferent parts of the plants √ø root, flower, stem, leaves, and bark √ø are used as remedies for different ailments. For example, a bark extract from an abies pindrow tree is used to treat coughs and bronchitis. Leaf and stem paste from an arachne cordifolia is used for wounds and as an antidote for snake bites. The bark of a callicarpa arborea is used for skin ailments.[35] Nearly a fifth of the gymnosperms, angiosperms and pteridophytes in the Himalayas are found to have medicinal properties, and more are likely to be discovered.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the population in some Asian and African countries depend on medicinal plants rather than prescriptions and such.[34] Since so many people use medicinal plants as their only source of healing in the Himalayas, the plants are an important source of income. This contributes to economic and modern industrial development both inside and outside the region.[34] The only problem is that locals are rapidly clearing the forests on the Himalayas for wood, often illegally.[42] This means that the number of medicinal plants is declining and that some of them might become rarer or, in some cases, go extinct.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough locals are clearing out portions of the forests in the Himalayas, there is still a large amount of greenery ranging from the tropical forests to the Alpine forests. These forests provide wood for fuel and other raw materials for use by industries. There are also many pastures for animals to graze upon.[citation needed] The many varieties of animals that live in these mountains do so based on the elevation. For example, elephants and rhinoceros live in the lower elevations of the Himalayas, also called the Terai region. Also, found in these mountains are the Kashmiri stag, black bears, musk deer, langur, and snow leopards. The Tibetan yak are also found on these mountains and are often used by the people for transportation. However, the populations of many of these animals and still others are declining and are on the verge of going extinct.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Himalayas are also a source of many minerals and precious stones. Amongst the tertiary rocks, are vast potentials of mineral oil. There is coal located in Kashmir, and precious stones located in the Himalayas. There is also gold, silver, copper, zinc, and many other such minerals and metals located in at least 100 different places in these mountains.[citation needed]","input":"What is the northern most range of the himalayas known as?"},{"output":"Lakota","context":"","input":"Who won the battle of the little bighorn?"},{"output":"can be throttled down to different power levels or sections of the chip can be turned off entirely when not in use","context":"A mobile processor is found in mobile computers and cellphones.\\r\\nA CPU chip is designed for portable computers, it is typically housed in a smaller chip package, but more importantly, in order to run cooler, it uses lower voltages than its desktop counterpart and has more sleep mode capability.

The term generally applies to large snails whose shell has a high spire and a noticeable siphonal canal (in other words, the shell comes to a noticeable point at both ends).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn North America, a conch is often identified as a queen conch, found off the coast of Florida. Queen conchs are valued for fish bait, and are also known as seafood.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group of conchs that are sometimes referred to as \\"true conchs\\" are marine gastropod molluscs in the family Strombidae, specifically in the genus Strombus and other closely related genera. For example, see Lobatus gigas, the queen conch, and Laevistrombus canarium, the dog conch.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany other species are also often called \\"conch\\", but are not at all closely related to the family Strombidae, including Melongena species (family Melongenidae), and the horse conch Triplofusus papillosus (family Fasciolariidae). Species commonly referred to as conchs also include the sacred chank or more correctly shankha shell (Turbinella pyrum) and other Turbinella species in the family Turbinellidae. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe English word conch is attested in Middle English,[4] coming from Latin concha (shellfish, mussel),[4][5] which in turn comes from Greek konch (same meaning)[4][5] ultimately from PIE root *konkho-,[4] cognate with Sanskrit ?a?kha.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meat of conchs is eaten raw in salads, or cooked, as in burgers, chowders, fritters, and gumbos. All parts of the conch meat are edible.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nConch is most indigenous to The Bahamas, and is typically served in fritter, salad, and soup forms. In addition to The Bahamas, conch is also eaten in the West Indies (Jamaica in particular); locals in Jamaica eat conch in soups, stews and curries. Restaurants all over the islands serve this particular meat. In the Dominican Republic, Grenada, and Haiti, conch is commonly eaten in curries or in a spicy soup. It is locally referred to as lambi. In The Turks and Caicos Islands, the Annual Conch Festival is held in November each year, located at the Three Queen's Bar/Restautant in Blue Hills. Local restaurateurs compete for the best and most original conch dishes, that are then judged by international chefs. Free sampling of the dishes follows the judging; along with those festivities, other competitions, events, and music performances occur well into the evening.[7] In Puerto Rico, conch is served as a ceviche, often called ensalada de carrucho (conch salad), consisting of raw conch marinated in lime juice, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, green peppers, and onions. It is also used to fill empanadas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Panama, conch is known as cambombia and is often served as a ceviche known as ceviche de cambombia consisting of raw conch marinated in lime juice, chopped onions, finely chopped habaneros, and often vinegar.\\r\\n\\r\\nConch is very popular in Italy and among Italian Americans. Called scungille (pl. scungilli) is eaten in a variety of ways, but most often in salads or cooked in a sauce for pasta. It is often included as one of the dishes prepared for the Feast of the Seven Fishes.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn East Asian cuisines, this seafood is often cut into thin slices and then steamed or stir-fried.\\r\\n\\r\\nConch shells can be used as wind instruments. They are prepared by cutting a hole in the spire of the shell near the apex, and then blowing into the shell as if it were a trumpet, as in blowing horn. Sometimes a mouthpiece is used, but some shell trumpets are blown without one. Pitch is adjusted by moving one's hand in and out of the aperture; the deeper the hand, the lower the note.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious species of large marine gastropod shells can be turned into \\"blowing shells\\", but some of the best-known species used are the sacred chank or shankha Turbinella pyrum, the Triton's trumpet Charonia tritonis, and the queen conch Strombus gigas.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany different kinds of mollusks can produce pearls. Pearls from the queen conch, L. gigas, are rare and have been collectors' items since Victorian times.[8] Conch pearls occur in a range of hues, including white, brown and orange, with many intermediate shades, but pink is the colour most associated with the conch pearl, such that these pearls are sometimes referred to simply as \\"pink pearls\\".[8] In some gemological texts, non-nacreous gastropod pearls used to be referred to as \\"calcareous concretions\\" because they were \\"porcellaneous\\" (shiny and ceramic-like in appearance), rather than \\"nacreous\\" (with a pearly lustre), sometimes known as \\"orient\\". The GIA and CIBJO now simply use the term \\"pearl\\"or, where appropriate, the more descriptive term \\"non-nacreous pearl\\"when referring to such items,[9][10] and under Federal Trade Commission rules, various mollusc pearls may be referred to as \\"pearls\\" without qualification.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough non-nacreous, the surface of fine conch pearls has a unique and attractive appearance of its own. The microstructure of conch pearls comprises partly aligned bundles of microcrystalline fibres that create a shimmering, slightly iridescent effect known as \\"flame structure\\". The effect is a form of chatoyancy, caused by the interaction of light rays with the microcrystals in the pearl's surface, and it somewhat resembles moir silk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped the sea and often depicted conch shells in their art.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nQuetzalcoatl, the Mexican god of wind and learning, wears around his neck the \\"wind breastplate\\" ehecailacocozcatl, \\"the spirally voluted wind jewel\\" made of a conch shell.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nBuddhism has also incorporated the conch shell, Turbinella pyrum, as one of the Eight Auspicious Symbols.\\r\\n\\r\\nA shankha shell (the shell of a Turbinella pyrum, a species in the gastropod family Turbinellidae) is often referred to in the West as a conch shell, or a chank shell. This shell is used as an important ritual object in Hinduism. The shell is used as a ceremonial trumpet, as part of religious practices, for example puja. The chank trumpet is sounded during worship at specific points, accompanied by ceremonial bells and singing. As it is an auspicious instrument, it is often played in a Lakshmi puja in temple or at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the story of Dhruva, the divine conch plays a special part. The warriors of ancient India blew conch shells to announce battle, as is described in the beginning of the war of Kurukshetra, in the Mahabharata, the famous Hindu epic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe god of preservation, Vishnu, is said to hold a special conch, Panchajanya, that represents life, as it has come out of life-giving waters.There is an interesting story behind the origin of a \\"the shankha\\" or conch shell.According to Hindu mythology, Devas (Gods) and Asuras (Demons) once decided to churn the ocean in order to get a special divine nectar. This divine nectar also known as \\"Amrit\\" was known to give immortality to whoever drank it. All the Gods were on one side of it and the Demons were on the other end. The Samudra Manthan produced a number of things from the Ocean. One of the first things to come out of it was lethal poison called Halahala.Everyone was terrified as the poison was potent enough to destroy entire creation. So they went to Lord Shiva for protection and he consumed the poison to safeguard the universe. Lord Shiva took the poison in his mouth but did not swallow it. Later some additional objects came out of the ocean like Lakshmi (goddess of prosperity and beauty), Goddess of wine, Moon, divine Nymphs like Rambha- and Menakha, Uchhaishravas the divine seven headed White horse, Kaustubha a jewel, Parijata the celestial tree, Surabhi the cow of plenty, Airavata a white elephant, Dhanus a mighty bow and many more such things were produced. \\"Shankha\\" or conch shell also was one of divine objects that was obtained from Samudra manthan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, the sound of the conch is believed to drive away the evil spirits.\\r\\nThe blowing of the conch or \\"the shankha\\" needs a tremendous power and respiratory capacity. Hence, blowing it daily helps keep the lungs healthy.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA newly wed Bengali bride wears bangles called Shakha Paula, made from coral and conch shell powder. They have been a part of Bengali custom and tradition. It is believed that in ancient era, the Bengali farming community resided near the river.

They gifted these beautiful bangles to their wives as they could not afford ivory bangles.They were also known as poor man's ivory as they were cheap substitute for ivory bangles.[13]","input":"What kind of animal lives in a conch shell?"},{"output":"approximately 80% of the world's top 50 telecoms companies","context":"Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. (/?hw??we?/; pinyin: ?Huwi) is a Chinese multinational networking and telecommunications equipment and services company headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong.[3] It is the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world, having overtaken Ericsson in 2012.[4]\\r\\nHuawei was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a former engineer in the People's Liberation Army. At the time of its establishment, Huawei focused on manufacturing phone switches, but has since expanded its business to include building telecommunications networks, providing operational and consulting services and equipment to enterprises inside and outside of China, and manufacturing communications devices for the consumer market.[5][6] Huawei has over 170,000 employees as of September 2015, around 76,000 of whom are engaged in research and development (R&D).[7][8] It has 21 R&D institutes in countries including China, the United States,[9] Canada,[10] the United Kingdom,[11] Pakistan, Finland, France, Belgium, Germany, Colombia, Sweden, Ireland, India,[12] Russia, Israel, and Turkey,[13][14] and in 2014, the company invested $6.4 billion USD in R&D, up from $5 billion USD in 2013.[15]\\r\\nIn 2014, Huawei recorded a profit of 34.2 billion CNY (5.5 billion USD).[16] Its products and services have been deployed in more than 170 countries and it currently serves 45 of the world's 50 largest telecoms operators.[17]\\r\\nIn June 2016, Huawei is reportedly working on and designing its own mobile OS for future usage.[18]\\r\\nIn July 2017, Huawei surpassed Apple and became the second largest smartphone manufacturer in the world (third if BBK Electronics, which operates Oppo, OnePlus and Vivo smartphone brands, is counted in), after Samsung.[19][20][21]\\r\\nIn September 2017, Huawei created an NB-IoT city-aware network using a \\"one network, one platform, N applications\\" construction model utilizing IoT, cloud computing, big data, and other next-generation information and communications technology (ICT), it also aims to be one of the world's five largest cloud players in the near future.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHuawei is the official translation of the firm's Chinese name (simplified Chinese: √≤R; traditional Chinese: ?A??; pinyin: Huwi). The etymology of the character √≤ is derived from \\"\\" which means \\"flower.\\" This is hinted at in Huawei's logo. The character can also mean \\"splendid\\" or \\"magnificent,\\" but nowadays mostly refers to \\"China\\" or \\"(ethnic) Chinese\\" (see also Names of China). It is common for Chinese companies to use this word, another example being the Taiwanese company Asus (simplified Chinese: √≤; traditional Chinese: ?A; pinyin: Hushu; literally: \\"Chinese-Eminent\\") that was founded back in 1989. The second character of Huawei's name, R, means \\"action\\" or \\"achievement,\\" thus Huawei literally means \\"Chinese achievement.\\"[citation needed] It is pronounced \\"Wah-Way\\" according to a Gizmodo video that claims to provide the \\"official\\" pronunciation,[24] as well as many other internet sources. However, \\"Wah-Way\\" is incorrect, and is an unfortunate perpetuation of a mistaken combination of the Cantonese and Mandarin pronunciations for the first and second characters, respectively. The Cantonese pronunciation is \\"Wah-Waii,\\"[25] while the Mandarin pronunciation is \\"Hwa-Way\\" (IPA:?[?w??we?]). Although the company is based in the Cantonese-speaking area of Guangdong, the use of Huawei as the spelling for its name reflects the Mandarin pronunciation of the two characters.\\r\\nDuring the 1980s, Chinese government tried to modernize the country's underdeveloped telecommunications infrastructure. A core component of the telecommunications network was telephone exchange switches, and in the late 1980s several Chinese research groups endeavored to acquire and develop the technology, usually through joint ventures with foreign companies.\\r\\nRen Zhengfei, a former deputy director of the People's Liberation Army engineering corp, founded Huawei in 1987 in Shenzhen. Rather than relying on joint ventures to secure technology transfers from foreign companies, which were often reluctant to transfer their most advanced technologies to Chinese firms, Ren focused on local research and development to produce the switches through reverse-engineering of foreign technologies. At a time when all of China's telecommunications technology was imported from abroad, Ren hoped to build a domestic Chinese telecommunication company that could compete with foreign competitors.[26]\\r\\nThe company reports that it had RMB 21,000 in registered capital at the time of its founding. The Far Eastern Economic Review also reported that it received an $8.5 million loan from a state-owned bank, though the company has denied the existence of the loan.[5][27]\\r\\nDuring its first several years the company's business model consisted mainly of reselling private branch exchange (PBX) switches imported from Hong Kong. Meanwhile, it was reverse-engineering imported switches and investing heavily in research and development to manufacture its own technologies.[5] By 1990 the company had approximately 600 R&D staff, and began its own independent commercialization of PBX switches targeting hotels and small enterprises.[28]\\r\\nThe company's first major breakthrough came in 1993, when it launched its C&C08 program controlled telephone switch. It was by far the most powerful switch available in China at the time. By initially deploying in small cities and rural areas and placing emphasis on service and customizability, the company gained market share and made its way into the mainstream market.[29] The company also developed collusive joint venture relationships with local authorities, whereby it would provide \\"dividends\\" to the local officials in exchange for their using Huawei products in the network. Ahrens writes that these methods were \\"unorthodox, bordering on corrupt,\\" but not illegal.[5]\\r\\nHuawei also gained a key contract to build the first national telecommunications network for the People's Liberation Army, a deal one employee described as \\"small in terms of our overall business, but large in terms of our relationships.\\"[27] In 1994, founder Ren Zhengfei had a meeting with Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, telling him that \\"switching equipment technology was related to international security, and that a nation that did not have its own switching equipment was like one that lacked its own military.\\" Jiang reportedly agreed with this assessment.[5]\\r\\nAnother major turning point for the company came in 1996, when the government in Beijing adopted an explicit policy of supporting domestic telecommunications manufacturers and restricting access to foreign competitors. Huawei was promoted by both the government and the military as a national champion, and established new research and development offices.[5]\\r\\nIn 1997, Huawei won its first overseas contract,[30] providing fixed-line network products to Hong Kong company Hutchison Whampoa.[29] Later that year, Huawei launched its wireless GSM-based products and eventually expanded to offer CDMA and UMTS. In 1999, the company opened a research and development (R&D) center in Bangalore, India to develop a wide range of telecom software.[28] From 1998 to 2003, Huawei contracted with IBM for management consulting, and underwent significant transformation of its management and product development structure. After 2000, Huawei increased its speed of expansion into overseas markets, having achieved international sales of more than US$100 million by 2000[30] and establishing an R&D center in Stockholm, Sweden. In 2001, Huawei established four R&D centers in the United States, divested non-core subsidiary Avansys to Emerson for US$750 million and joined the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). By 2002, Huaweis international market sales had reached US$552 million.[28]\\r\\nIn 2004 Huawei continued its overseas expansion with a contract to build a third-generation network for Telfort, the Dutch mobile operator.[28] This contract, valued at more than $US25 million, was the first such contract for the company in Europe.[31]\\r\\nIn 2005, Huaweis international contract orders exceeded its domestic sales for the first time. Huawei signed a Global Framework Agreement with Vodafone. This agreement marked the first time a telecommunications equipment supplier from China had received Approved Supplier status from Vodafone Global Supply Chain. The agreement established the terms and conditions for the supply of Huawei's solutions to any one of the Vodafone operating companies worldwide.[32] Huawei also signed a contract with British Telecom (BT) for the deployment of its multi-service access network (MSAN) and Transmission equipment for BT's 21st Century Network (21CN), providing BT and the UK telecommunications industry with some infrastructure necessary to support future growth as these companies are multi vendor infrastructure.[33]\\r\\nIn May 2008, Huawei and Optus developed a mobile innovation centre in Sydney, Australia, providing facilities for engineers to develop new wireless and mobile broadband concepts into \\"ready for market\\" products.[34] In 2008, the company embarked on its first large-scale commercial deployment of UMTS/ HSPA in North America providing TELUS's new next generation wireless network and Bell Canada with high-speed mobile access.[35]\\r\\nHuawei delivered one of the worlds first LTE/EPC commercial networks for TeliaSonera in Oslo, Norway in 2009. The company launched the world's first end-to-end 100G solution from routers to transmission system that same year, to help meet the rapid growth of network traffic and enhance router efficiency and reliability.[28]\\r\\nIn July 2010, Huawei was included in the Global Fortune 500 2010 list published by the U.S. magazine Fortune for the first time, on the strength of annual sales of US$21.8 billion and net profit of US$2.67 billion.[36] In late 2010 it was reported that Huawei is planning to invest around US$500 million (Rs 2,200 crore) to set up a telecom equipment manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu, India and $US100 million to expand its R&D center in Bangalore.[37][38]\\r\\nIn October 2012, it was announced that Huawei would move its UK headquarters to Green Park, Reading, Berkshire.[39] The company also, in an effort to increase its prominence in the United States, became the main sponsor of the Jonas Brothers' 2013 summer tour.[40]\\r\\nIn September 2013, Huawei opened a new Canadian office in Regina, SaskatchewanHuawei had collaborated with the local carrier SaskTel to build its HSPA+ and LTE networks. The company also announced that SaskTel would carry its new Ascend Y300 smartphone.[41]\\r\\nIn October 2013, Huawei was selected by TDC A/S as a sole vendor to modernize the nationwide GSM/UMTS/LTE network in Denmark and provide managed services over a six-year period. The value of the contract is over $700 million over the term of the agreement.[42] As per the latest rankings by The Economist, Huawei is the number one Telecom Vendor in the world.\\r\\nHuawei has focused on expanding its mobile technology and networking solutions through a number of partnerships. In March 2003, Huawei and 3Com Corporation formed a joint venture company, 3Com-Huawei (H3C), which focused on the R&D, production and sales of data networking products. The company later divested a 49% stake in H3C for US$880 million in 2006. In 2005, Huawei began a joint venture with Siemens, called TD Tech, for developing 3G/ TD-SCDMA mobile communication technology products. The US$100 million investment gave the company a 49% stake in the venture, while Siemens held a 51% stake.[28] In 2007, after Nokia and Siemens co-founded Nokia Siemens Networks, Siemens transferred all shares it held in TD Tech to Nokia Siemens Networks. At present, Nokia Siemens Networks and Huawei hold 51% and 49% shares of TD Tech respectively.[43]\\r\\nIn 2006, Huawei established a Shanghai-based joint R&D center with Motorola to develop UMTS technologies.[28] Later that year, Huawei also established a joint venture with Telecom Venezuela, called Industria Electronica Orinoquia, for research and development and sale of telecommunications terminals. Telecom Venezuela holds a 65% stake while Huawei holds the remaining 35% stake.[44]\\r\\nHuawei and American security firm Symantec announced in May 2007 the formation of a joint-venture company to develop security and storage solutions to market to telecommunications carriers. Huawei initially owned 51% of the new company, named Huawei Symantec Inc. while Symantec owned the rest. The joint-venture was based in Chengdu.[45] In March, 2012, Symantec announced the sale of its portion of the joint venture to Huawei.[46]\\r\\nGrameenphone Ltd. and Huawei won the Green Mobile Award at the GSMA Mobile Awards 2009.[47] In March 2009, the Wimax Forum announced four new members to its Board of Directors including Thomas Lee, the Vice Director of the Industry Standards Department at Huawei.[48]\\r\\nIn 2008, Huawei launched a joint venture with UK-based marine engineering company, Global Marine Systems, to deliver undersea network equipment and related services.[49]\\r\\nIn April 2011, Huawei announced an earnings increase of 30% in 2010, driven by significant growth in overseas markets, with net profit rising to RMB23.76 billion (US$3.64 billion; S2.23 billion) from RMB18.27 billion in 2009.[50] In 2010 sales outside China continued to be the main driver of Huaweis business. Overseas revenue rose 34% to RMB120.41 billion in 2010 from RMB90.02 billion in 2009, fueled by regions including North America and Russia. Revenues from China rose 9.7% to RMB64.77 billion, as the country's big telecom operators reduced their investment last year.[51]\\r\\nHuawei's revenues in 2010 accounted for 15.7% of the $78.56 billion global carrier-network-infrastructure market, putting the company second behind the 19.6% share of Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson, according to market-research firm Gartner.[51]\\r\\nHuawei is targeting a revenue of $150 million through its enterprise business solutions in India in the next 12 months. It denied using Chinese subsidies to gain global market share after being recently accused by US lawmakers and EU officials of unfair competition at best.[52][53]\\r\\nHuawei classifies itself as a \\"collective\\" and does not refer to itself as a private company. Richard McGregor, author of The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers, said that this is \\"a definitional distinction that has been essential to the company's receipt of state support at crucial points in its development.\\"[54] McGregor argued that \\"Huawei's status as a genuine collective is doubtful.\\"[54]\\r\\nRen Zhengfei is the president of Huawei and has held the title since 1987.[55] Huawei disclosed its list of board of directors for the first time in 2010. Ms. Sun Yafang is board chair. As of 2011, the members of the board[56] are Ms. Sun Yafang,[57][58] Guo Ping, Xu Zhijun, Hu Houkun,[59] Ren Zhengfei,[60] Xu Wenwei, Li Jie, Ding Yun, Meng Wanzhou, Chen Lifang,[61] Wan Biao, Zhang Pingan, and Yu Chengdong.[56] The members of the Supervisory Board are Liang Hua, Peng Zhiping, Ren Shulu, Tian Feng, and Deng Biao.[62] Richard Yu Chengdong is the Chairman of Huawei Device, its mobile phone division.[63] On 1 July 2013, Huawei Device announced former head of Nokia Colin Giles joined the company as Executive Vice President of Consumer Business.[63]\\r\\nOfficially, Huawei is an employee-owned company, a fact the company emphasizes to distance itself from allegations of government control.[5] What employee-owned means in practice at Huawei, however, is quite complexso much so that according to the Chinese media company Caixin, even longtime employees admit the [employee shareholding] system is nearly impossible to understand.[64]\\r\\nRen retains a direct 1.42 percent share of the company. The remainder of the shares is held by a trade union committee tied to the affiliate Shenzhen Huawei Investment Holding Co.[65] This body represents Huaweis employee shareholders. About 64 percent of Huawei staff participate in this scheme (approximately 61,000 Chinese employees; the 50,000-plus foreign employees are not eligible[66]), and hold what the company calls virtual restricted shares. These shares are nontradable and are allocated to reward performance.[67] When employees leave Huawei, their shares revert to the company, which compensates them for their holding.[68] Although employee shareholders receive dividends, it is reported that they have no information on their holding.[65]\\r\\nEmployees' shares do not entitle them to any voice in management decisions.[citation needed] Richard McGregor, author of The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers, claimed that the majority of shares are likely owned by Ren Zhengfei and Ren's managers, though the company states Ren directly owns less than 1.5%.[54]\\r\\nAs of the beginning of 2010[update], approximately 80% of the world's top 50 telecoms companies had worked with Huawei.[69] Prominent partners include:\\r\\nIn May 2011 Huawei won a contract with Everything Everywhere, the UKs biggest communication company, to enhance its 2G network. The four-year deal represents Huawei's first mobile network deal in the UK.[76]\\r\\nHuawei is organized around three core business segments:\\r\\nHuawei announced its Enterprise business in January, 2011 to provide network infrastructure, fixed and wireless communication, data center, and cloud computing solutions for global telecommunications customers.[79] Huawei has stated that it aims to increase enterprise sales to US$4 billion in 2011 and $15 billion within three to five years.[80][81]\\r\\nIn 2016, Huawei enterprise business group launched a new marketing slogan defining its position for the enterprise market, \\"Leading New ICT, Building a Better Connected World\\" at CeBIT 2016.[82]\\r\\nHuawei offers a variety of network technologies and solutions to help telecommunications operators expand the capacity of their mobile broadband networks. Huaweis core network solutions offer mobile and fixed softswitches, plus next-generation home location register and Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystems (IMS). Huawei assists content service providers looking to migrate from copper to fiber with solutions that support xDSL, passive optical network (PON) and next-generation PON (NG PON) on a single platform. The company also offers mobile infrastructure, broadband access and service provider routers and switches (SPRS). Huaweis software products include service delivery platforms (SDPs), BSSs, Rich Communication Suite and digital home and mobile office solutions.[83] Huawei announced that it jointly conducted successful 5G tests with Telenor with speed reached up to 70 Gbit/s in a controlled lab environment.[84]\\r\\nHuawei Global Services provides telecommunications operators with equipment to build and operate networks as well as consulting and engineering services to improve operational efficiencies.[76] These include network integration services such as those for mobile and fixed networks; assurance services such as network safety; and learning services, such as competency consulting.[83]\\r\\nIn 2010, Huawei won 47 managed services contracts to help improve network performance and efficiency for customers, as well as reducing the costs of network operations and maintenance.[85] In 2010 Huawei's global services revenues grew 28.6% to US$4.82 billion.[86]\\r\\nHuawei's Devices division provides white-label products to content-service providers, including USB modems, wireless modems and wireless routers for mobile wifi,[87][88] embedded modules, fixed wireless terminals, wireless gateways, set-top boxes, mobile handsets and video products.[89] Huawei also produces and sells a variety of devices under its own name, such as the IDEOS smartphones, tablet PCs and Huawei Smartwatch. Recent products include U8800, U8860, E220, Ascend, U7519, Huawei Mercury M886, Huawei Honor 6,[90] Honor 6 Plus,[91] Huawei Honor 5C[92] and U8150. On April 15, 2015, Huawei launched the Huawei P8 and Huawei P8 Max, two high-end Android smartphones.[93] In 2010, Huawei Devices shipped 120 million devices around the world.[6] 30 million cell phones, of which 3.3 million units were smartphones, were shipped to markets such as Japan, the United States and Europe.[94] Huawei also partnered with Google to build the Nexus 6P.\\r\\nEmotion User Interface (EMUI) is a ROM/OS that is developed by Huawei Technologies Co.

In response Cisco revealed parts of the independent expert's report produced for the case which proved that Huawei had stolen Cisco code and directly copied it into their products.[157]\\r\\nIn June 2004, a Huawei employee was caught after hours diagramming and photographing circuit boards from a competitor booth at the SuperComm tradeshow.[158] The employee denied the accusation, but was later dismissed.[159][160]\\r\\nIn July 2010, Motorola filed an amended complaint that named Huawei as a co-defendant in its case against Lemko for alleged theft of trade secrets.[161][162] The case against Huawei was subsequently dropped in April 2011.[163][164][165] In January 2011, Huawei filed a lawsuit against Motorola to prevent its intellectual property from being illegally transferred to Nokia Siemens Networks (\\"NSN\\") as part of NSNs US$1.2 billion acquisition of Motorola's wireless network business.[166][167][168][169] In April 2011, Motorola and Huawei entered into an agreement to settle all pending litigation,[164][170][171] with Motorola paying an undisclosed sum to Huawei for the intellectual property that would be part of the sale to NSN.[172][173][174]\\r\\nIn a further move to protect its intellectual property, Huawei filed lawsuits in Germany, France and Hungary in April 2011 against ZTE for patent and trademark infringement.[175][176][177] The following day, ZTE countersued Huawei for patent infringement in China.[178][179]\\r\\nIn the US, Huawei has been challenged by various entities of the American government and security officials that Huawei-made telecommunications equipment is designed to allow unauthorized access by the Chinese government and the Chinese People's Liberation Army,[180][181][182][183] given that Ren Zhengfei, the founder of the company, served as an engineer in the army in the early 1980s.[184] In the United Kingdom, the Conservative Party raised concerns about security over Huaweis bid for Marconi in 2005,[182] and the company's equipment was mentioned as an alleged potential threat in a 2009 government briefing by Alex Allan, chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee.[185] In December 2010, Huawei opened a Cyber Security Evaluation Centre to test its hardware and software to ensure they can withstand growing cyber security threats.[186][187] In the U.S., some members of Congress raised questions about the company's proposed merger with communications company 3Com in 2008,[188] and its bid for a Sprint contract in 2010.[184] In addition, Huawei withdrew its purchase of 3Leaf systems in 2010, following a review by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS).[181]\\r\\nIn a 2011 open letter, Huawei stated that the security concerns are \\"unfounded and unproven\\" and called on the U.S. government to investigate any aspect of its business.[189][190] The US-based non-profit organization Asia Society carried out a review of Chinese companies trying to invest in the U.S., including Huawei. The organization found that only a few investment deals were blocked following unfavorable findings by the CFIUS or had been given a recommendation not to apply, however all large transactions had been politicized by groups including the U.S. media, members of Congress and the security community.[191] However, another article unrelated to the report published by the Asia Society reported that, \\"fear that the P.R.C. government could strongarm private or unaffiliated Chinese groups into giving up cyber-secrets is reflected in the U.S. government's treatment of Chinese telecom company Huawei.\\"[192]\\r\\nIn October 2009, the Indian Department of Telecommunications reportedly requested national telecom operators to \\"self-regulate\\" the use of all equipment from European, U.S. and Chinese telecoms manufacturers following security concerns.[193] Earlier, in 2005, Huawei was blocked from supplying equipment to India's Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) cellular phone service provider.[194] In 2010, the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) insisted on cancelling the rest of the Huawei contract with BSNL and pressed charges against several top BSNL officers regarding their \\"doubtful integrity and dubious links with Chinese firms\\".[195][196] In June 2010, an interim solution was introduced that would allow the import of Chinese-made telecoms equipment to India if pre-certified by international security agencies such as Canadas Electronic Warfare Associates, US-based Infoguard, and Israels ALTAL Security Consulting.[197]\\r\\nIn October 2011, The Wall Street Journal reported that Huawei had become Iran's leading provider of telecommunications equipment, including monitoring technologies that could be used for surveillance.[198] Huawei responded with a statement claiming the story misrepresented the company's involvement: \\"We have never been involved and do not provide any services relating to monitoring or filtering technologies and equipment anywhere in the world\\".[199]\\r\\nIn December 2011, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. is invoking Cold War-era national security powers to force telecommunication companies including AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. to divulge confidential information about their networks in a hunt for Chinese cyber-spying, with Richard Falkenrath, a senior fellow in the Council on Foreign Relations Cyberconflict and Cybersecurity Initiative, saying, \\"This is beyond vague suspicions...Congress is now looking at this as well, and theyre doing so based on very specific material provided them in a classified setting by the National Security Agency.\\" The action represents a concern that China and other countries may be using their growing export sectors to develop built-in spying capabilities in U.S. networks. The U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence said it would investigate potential security threats posed by some foreign companies, and mentioned Huawei specifically. A spokesman for Huawei said that the company conducts its businesses according to normal business practices and actually welcomed the investigation.[200]\\r\\nIn 2001, it was alleged that Huawei Technologies India had developed telecommunications equipment for the Taliban in Afghanistan, and newspapers reported that the Indian government had launched a probe into the firm's operations.[201][202] Huawei responded, stating that the company did not have \\"any link with the Taliban\\", as its only customers are telecommunications carriers[203] and its facilities \\"always operate according to U.N. rules and the local laws of each country\\".[204] On 15 December 2001, the Indian authorities announced that they had not found any evidence that Huawei India had any connection to the Taliban,[205] although the U.S. remains suspicious.[206]\\r\\nIn March 2012, Australian media sources reported that the Australian government had excluded Huawei from tendering for contracts with NBN Co, a government-owned corporation that is managing the construction of the National Broadband Network,[207] following advice from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation regarding security concerns.[208] The Attorney-General's Department stated in response to these reports that the National Broadband Network is \\"a strategic and significant government investment, [and] we have a responsibility to do our utmost to protect its integrity and that of the information carried on it.\\"[209]\\r\\nIn July 2012, Felix Lindner and Gregor Kopf gave a conference at Defcon to announce that they uncovered several critical vulnerabilities in Huawei routers (models AR18 and AR29)[210] which could be used to get remote access to the device. The researchers said that Huawei \\"doesn't have a security contact for reporting vulnerabilities, doesn't put out security advisories and doesn't say what bugs have been fixed in its firmware updates\\", and as a result, the vulnerabilities have not been publicly disclosed. Huawei replied that they were investigating the claims.[211]\\r\\nOn 8 October 2012, a US House Intelligence Committee panel issued a report describing Huawei as a \\"national security threat\\" due to its alleged ties to various Chinese governmental agencies. The panel's report suggested that Huawei should \\"be barred from doing business with the US government\\", and additionally alleged that the telecom manufacturer had committed \\"potential violations\\" related to immigration, bribery, corruption, and copyright infringement.[212] However, a subsequent White House-ordered review found no concrete evidence to support the House report's espionage allegations.[213]\\r\\nOn 9 October 2012, a spokesman for Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper indicated that the Canadian government invoked a national security exception to exclude Huawei from its plans to build a secure government communications network.[214]\\r\\nOn 25 October 2012, a Reuters report[215] wrote that according to documents and interviews, an Iranian-based seller of Huawei (Soda Gostar Persian Vista) last year tried to sell embargoed American antenna equipment (made by American company Andrew LLC to an Iranian firm MTN Irancell). Specifically, the Andrew antennas were part of a large order for Huawei telecommunications gear that MTN Irancell had placed through Soda Gostar, but the MTN Irancell says it canceled the deal with Huawei when it learned the items were subject to sanctions and before any equipment was delivered.[213] Vic Guyang, a Huawei spokesman, acknowledged that MTN Irancell had canceled the order; Rick Aspan, a spokesman for CommScope, said the company was not aware of the aborted transaction.[213]\\r\\nOn 19 July 2013, Michael Hayden, former head of U.S. National Security Agency and director of Motorola Solutions, claimed that he has seen hard evidence of backdoors in Huawei's networking equipment and that the company engaged in espionage and shared intimate knowledge of the foreign telecommunications systems with the Chinese government.[216] Huawei and Motorola Solutions had previously been engaged in intellectual property disputes for a number of years. Huawei's global cybersecurity officer, John Suffolk, described the comments made by Hayden as \\"tired, unsubstantiated, defamatory remarks\\" and challenged him and other critics to present any evidence publicly.[217][218]\\r\\nIn 2014 The New York Times reported, based upon documents leaked by Edward Snowden, that the U.S. National Security Agency has since 2007 been operating a covert program against Huawei. This involved breaking into Huawei's internal networks, including headquarter networks and founder Ren Zhengfei's communications.[219]\\r\\nIn September 2014, Huawei faced a lawsuit from T-Mobile, which alleged that Huawei stole technology from its Bellevue, Washington, headquarters. T-Mobile claimed in its filed suit that Huawei's employees snuck into a T-Mobile lab during the period of 2012-2013 and stole parts of its smartphone testing robot Tappy. The Huawei employees then copied the operating software and design details, violating confidentiality agreements that both companies signed. Furthermore, Huawei is now using that intel to build its own testing robot. A Huawei spokesman stated to The New York Times that there is some truth to the complaint, but that the two employees involved have been fired. T-Mobile has since stopped using Huawei as a supplier, which T-Mobile says could cost it tens of millions of dollars as it moves away from its handsets.[220]\\r\\nIn May 2017, a jury agreed with T-Mobile that Huawei committed industrial espionage in United States, and Huawei was ordered to pay $4.8m in damages. Huawei responded to the lawsuit by arguing that Tappy was not a trade secret, and that it was made by Epson, not T-Mobile. According to Huawei, \\"T-Mobiles statement of the alleged trade secret is an insufficient, generic statement that captures virtually every component of its robot,\\" and it had failed to point out any trade secret stolen with sufficient specificity. T-mobile dismissed Huawei's arguments, and contended that Epson had provided only a component of the robot.[221][222]\\r\\nIn 2015, German cybersecurity company G Data reported that it had found that malware that can listen to calls, track users, and make online purchases was found pre-installed on smartphones from Chinese companies including Lenovo, Xiaomi, and Huawei. When G Data contacted the companies to let them know about the malware, Huawei replied that the security breaches must have taken place further down the supply chain, outside the manufacturing process.[223][224]\\r\\nIn 2016, Canada's immigration department said it planned to deny permanent resident visas to three Chinese citizens who worked for Huawei over concerns the applicants are involved in espionage, terrorism, and government subversion.[225]\\r\\nIn November 2016, a Pentagon report unearthed a backdoor in equipment jointly developed between Boyusec, which is one of the many cyber-security contractors the Chinese government uses to support its cyber-intelligence gathering operations, and Huawei. According to the report, \\"Boyusec is closely connected to the (Chinese) Ministry of State Security and Huawei and they are developing a start-up program that will use malware allowing for capturing and controlling devices.\\"[226]\\r\\nA U.S. Army Strategic Studies Institute report on Argentina published in September 2007 describes Huawei as \\"known to bribe and trap clients.\\" The report details unfair business practices, such as customers framed by \\"full-paid trips\\" to China and monetary \\"presents\\" offered and later used by Huawei as \\"a form of extortion.\\"[227]\\r\\nAccording to a WikiLeaks cable, in 2006, Michael Joseph, then-CEO of Safaricom Ltd, allegedly struggled to cancel a contract with Huawei due to poor after-sales experience, after which the Kenyan government pressured him to reinstate the contract.[228] When questioned regarding this incident, Joseph replied, \\"It [the cable] is not a reflection of the truth as evidenced by Safaricom being a major purchaser of Huawei products including all 3G, switching and the recent OCS billing system upgraded over the weekend.\\"[229]\\r\\nIn May 2010, it was reported in The Times of India, that security agencies in India became suspicious of Chinese Huawei employees after learning that Indian employees allegedly did not have access to part of Huawei's Bangalore research and development (R&D) office building.[230] Huawei responded that the company employs over 2,000 Indian engineers and just 30 Chinese engineers in the R&D center in Bangalore, and \\"both Indian and Chinese staff have equal access rights to all our information assets and facilities\\".[231] According to The Times of India, the intelligence agencies also noted that Chinese employees of Huawei had extended their stay in Bangalore for many months.[230] Huawei stated that many of these employees were on one-and-a-half-year international assignments to serve as a technical bridge between in-market teams and China, and that \\"all the Chinese employees had valid visas and did not overstay\\".[232]\\r\\nIn October 2007, 7,000 Huawei employees resigned and were then rehired on short-term contracts, thereby apparently avoiding the unlimited contract provisions of the Labour Contract Law of the People's Republic of China. The company denied it was exploiting loopholes in the law, while the move was condemned by local government and trade unions.[233][234]\\r\\nHuawei's treatment of its workforce in Guangdong Province, Southern China also triggered a media outcry after a 25-year-old software engineer, Hu Xinyu, died in May 2006 from bacterial encephalitis, as a result of what is believed[by whom?] to have been work-related fatigue.[235][236]\\r\\nIn its 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility report, Huawei highlighted the importance of employee health and safety. In 2010, Huawei provided annual health checks to all full-time employees and performed 3,200 checks to employees exposed to occupational health risks.[237]\\r\\nAlso, in 2011 Huawei initiated a Scholarship program, \\"Huawei Maitree Scholarship\\", for Indian students studying in China.[238]","input":"How many of the worlds top telecommunications companies have huawei have partnered with?"},{"output":"the ninth, and highest, enlisted rank","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nCMSgt insignia\\r\\n\\r\\n(1994√øpresent)\\r\\n\\r\\nChief Master Sergeant (CMSgt) is the ninth, and highest, enlisted rank in the U.S. Air Force, just above Senior Master Sergeant, and is a senior non-commissioned officer rank.

In a Joint Command, when an Air Force Chief fills a DoD-nominated Command senior enlisted advisor position (see note), that individual is also designated as a Command Chief. Command Chiefs advise the unit commanders on all enlisted matters, including all issues affecting the command's mission and operations, and the readiness, training, utilization, morale, technical and professional development, and quality of life of all enlisted members in the organization. Command Chiefs hold a reporting identifier of 9E000.

Group superintendents provide leadership, management, and guidance in organizing, equipping, training, and mobilizing groups to meet home station and expeditionary mission requirements. Group superintendents work closely with their group commanders and command chief master sergeants to prepare the enlisted force to best execute mission requirements. They manage and direct resource activities as well as interpret and enforce policies and applicable directives. They also establish control procedures to meet mission goals and standards. Additionally, they recommend or initiate actions to improve organizational effectiveness and efficiency as well as ensure that the management of personnel and resources are consistent with current practices and procedures in support of the wings mission. They resolve issues between subordinate sq-rons, other groups, wing staff, and outside agencies as well as perform other duties as directed by their group commanders.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe duty position of squadron superintendent is the senior enlisted advisor to a unit commander.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nObsolete\\r\\n\\r\\nCMSgt insignia\\r\\n\\r\\n(1958√ø1994)\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Air Force had been an independent service since 1947, the rank of chief master Sergeant did not come into being until the authorization of the Military Pay Act of 1958.

It wasn't until late 1958 that the title chief master sergeant (and the accompanying rank insignia) was decided upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Chief Master Sergeant rank insignia (1958√ø1994) consisted of 2 chevrons on top, 3 stripes in the middle, and 3 rockers on bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil his retirement in 2003, Chief Master Sergeant Norman Marous was the Air Force's senior-most chief master sergeant, having served in the Air Force since 1962. Marous left active duty in 1967 to spend 22 years in the USAF Reserve and National Guard before returning to active duty as a Chief Master Sergeant in 1989. He retired in 2003 with 41? years of service. He is the only person authorized to wear two longevity ribbons, due to the space required for the number of multiple award devices authorized.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nChief master sergeant is since 2004 and as part of the ongoing modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the highest possible rank attained by enlisted personnel of the Philippine Army, the Philippine Air Force and the Philippine Marine Corps (under the Philippine Navy).

The outer atmosphere is inflated and tenuous, making the radius large and the surface temperature around 5,000?K (8,540?F) or lower. The appearance of the red giant is from yellow-orange to red, including the spectral types K and M, but also class S stars and most carbon stars.\\r\\nThe most common red giants are stars on the red-giant branch (RGB) that are still fusing hydrogen into helium in a shell surrounding an inert helium core. Other red giants are the red-clump stars in the cool half of the horizontal branch, fusing helium into carbon in their cores via the triple-alpha process; and the asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) stars with a helium burning shell outside a degenerate carbon√øoxygen core, and a hydrogen burning shell just beyond that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRed giants are stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in their cores and have begun thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in a shell surrounding the core. They have radii tens to hundreds of times larger than that of the Sun. However, their outer envelope is lower in temperature, giving them a reddish-orange hue. Despite the lower energy density of their envelope, red giants are many times more luminous than the Sun because of their great size. Red-giant-branch stars have luminosities up to nearly three thousand times that of the Sun (L?), spectral types of K or M, have surface temperatures of 3,000√ø4,000 K, and radii up to about 200 times the Sun (R?). Stars on the horizontal branch are hotter, with only a small range of luminosities around 75?L?. Asymptotic-giant-branch stars range from similar luminosities as the brighter stars of the red giant branch, up to several times more luminous at the end of the thermal pulsing phase.\\r\\nAmong the asymptotic-giant-branch stars belong the carbon stars of type C-N and late C-R, produced when carbon and other elements are convected to the surface in what is called a dredge-up.[1] The first dredge-up occurs during hydrogen shell burning on the red-giant branch, but does not produce a large carbon abundance at the surface. The second, and sometimes third, dredge up occurs during helium shell burning on the asymptotic-giant branch and convects carbon to the surface in sufficiently massive stars.\\r\\nThe stellar limb of a red giant is not sharply-defined, contrary to their depiction in many illustrations. Rather, due to the very low mass density of the envelope, such stars lack a well-defined photosphere, and the body of the star gradually transitions into a 'corona'.[2] The coolest red giants have complex spectra, with molecular lines, emission features, and sometimes masers, particularly from thermally pulsing AGB stars.[3]\\r\\nAnother noteworthy feature of red giants is that, unlike Sun-like stars whose photospheres have a large number of small convection cells (solar granules), red-giant photospheres, as well as those of red supergiants, have just a few large cells, the features of which cause the variations of brightness so common on both types of stars.[4]\\r\\nRed giants are evolved from main-sequence stars with masses in the range from about 0.3?M? to around 8?M?.[5] When a star initially forms from a collapsing molecular cloud in the interstellar medium, it contains primarily hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of \\"metals\\" (in stellar structure, this simply refers to any element that is not hydrogen or helium i.e. atomic number greater than 2). These elements are all uniformly mixed throughout the star. The star reaches the main sequence when the core reaches a temperature high enough to begin fusing hydrogen (a few million kelvin) and establishes hydrostatic equilibrium. Over its main sequence life, the star slowly converts the hydrogen in the core into helium; its main-sequence life ends when nearly all the hydrogen in the core has been fused. For the Sun, the main-sequence lifetime is approximately 10?billion years. More-massive stars burn disproportionately faster and so have a shorter lifetime than less massive stars.[6]\\r\\nWhen the star exhausts the hydrogen fuel in its core, nuclear reactions can no longer continue and so the core begins to contract due to its own gravity. This brings additional hydrogen into a zone where the temperature and pressure are adequate to cause fusion to resume in a shell around the core. The outer layers of the star then expand greatly, thus beginning the red-giant phase of the star's life. As the star expands, the energy produced in the burning shell of the star is spread over a much larger surface area, resulting in a lower surface temperature and a shift in the star's visible light output towards the red √ø hence it becomes a red giant. At this time, the star is said to be ascending the red-giant branch of the Hertzsprung√øRussell (H√øR) diagram.[6]\\r\\nThe evolutionary path the star takes as it moves along the red-giant branch, that ends finally with the complete collapse of the core, depends on the mass of the star. For the Sun and stars of less than about 2?M?[7] the core will become dense enough that electron degeneracy pressure will prevent it from collapsing further. Once the core is degenerate, it will continue to heat until it reaches a temperature of roughly 108?K, hot enough to begin fusing helium to carbon via the triple-alpha process. Once the degenerate core reaches this temperature, the entire core will begin helium fusion nearly simultaneously in a so-called helium flash. In more-massive stars, the collapsing core will reach 108?K before it is dense enough to be degenerate, so helium fusion will begin much more smoothly, and produce no helium flash.[6] The core helium fusing phase of a star's life is called the horizontal branch in metal-poor stars, so named because these stars lie on a nearly horizontal line in the H√øR diagram of many star clusters. Metal-rich helium-fusing stars instead lie on the so-called red clump in the H√øR diagram.[8]\\r\\nAn analogous process occurs when the central helium is exhausted and the star collapses once again, causing helium in a shell to begin fusing. At the same time hydrogen may begin fusion in a shell just outside the burning helium shell. This puts the star onto the asymptotic giant branch, a second red-giant phase.[9] The helium fusion results in the build up of a carbon√øoxygen core. A star below about 8?M? will never start fusion in its degenerate carbon√øoxygen core.[7] Instead, at the end of the asymptotic-giant-branch phase the star will eject its outer layers, forming a planetary nebula with the core of the star exposed, ultimately becoming a white dwarf. The ejection of the outer mass and the creation of a planetary nebula finally ends the red-giant phase of the star's evolution.[6] The red-giant phase typically lasts only around a billion years in total for a solar mass star, almost all of which is spent on the red-giant branch. The horizontal-branch and asymptotic-giant-branch phases proceed tens of times faster.\\r\\nIf the star has about 0.2 to 0.5?M?,[7] it is massive enough to become a red giant but does not have enough mass to initiate the fusion of helium.[5] These \\"intermediate\\" stars cool somewhat and increase their luminosity but never achieve the tip of the red-giant branch and helium core flash. When the ascent of the red-giant branch ends they puff off their outer layers much like a post-asymptotic-giant-branch star and then become a white dwarf.\\r\\nVery low mass stars are fully convective[10][11] and may continue to fuse hydrogen into helium for up to a trillion years[12] until only a small fraction of the entire star is hydrogen. Luminosity and temperature steadily increase during this time, just as for more-massive main-sequence stars, but the length of time involved means that the temperature eventually increases by about 50% and the luminosity by around 10 times. Eventually the level of helium increases to the point where the star ceases to be fully convective and the remaining hydrogen locked in the core is consumed in only a few billion more years. Depending on mass, the temperature and luminosity continue to increase for a time during hydrogen shell burning, the star can become hotter than the Sun and tens of times more luminous than when it formed although still not as luminous as the Sun. After some billions more years, they start to become less luminous and cooler even though hydrogen shell burning continues. These become cool helium white dwarfs.[5]\\r\\nVery-high-mass stars develop into supergiants that follow an evolutionary track that takes them back and forth horizontally over the HR diagram, at the right end constituting red supergiants. These usually end their life as a type II supernova. The most massive stars can become Wolf√øRayet stars without becoming giants or supergiants at all.[13][14]\\r\\nRed giants with known planets: the M-type HD 208527, HD 220074 and, as of February 2014, a few tens[15] of known K-giants including Pollux, Gamma Cephei and Iota Draconis.\\r\\nAlthough traditionally it has been suggested the evolution of a star into a red giant will render its planetary system, if present, uninhabitable, some research suggests that, during the evolution of a 1?M? star along the red-giant branch, it could harbor a habitable zone for several times 109 years at 2 AU out to around 108 years at 9 AU out, giving perhaps enough time for life to develop on a suitable world. After the red-giant stage, there would for such a star be a habitable zone between 7 and 22 AU for an additional 109 years.[16] Later studies have refined this scenario, showing how for a 1?M? star the habitable zone lasts from 108 years for a planet with an orbit similar to that of Mars one to 7015662709600000000?2.1G108?yr for one that orbits at Saturn's distance to the Sun, the maximum time (7016116763120000000?3.7G108?yr) corresponding for planets orbiting at the distance of Jupiter. However, for planets orbiting a 0.5?M? star in equivalent orbits to those of Jupiter and Saturn they would be in the habitable zone for 7017183034080000000?5.8G109?yr and 7016662709600000000?2.1G109?yr respectively; for stars more massive than the Sun, the times are considerably shorter.[17]\\r\\nAs of June 2014, 50 giant planets have been discovered around giant stars. However, these giant planets are more massive than the giant planets found around solar-type stars. This could be because giant stars are more massive than the Sun (less massive stars will still be on the main sequence and will not have become giants yet) and more massive stars are expected to have more massive planets. However, the masses of the planets that have been found around giant stars do not correlate with the masses of the stars; therefore, the planets could be growing in mass during the stars' red giant phase. The growth in planet mass could be partly due to accretion from stellar wind, although a much larger effect would be Roche lobe overflow causing mass-transfer from the star to the planet when the giant expands out to the orbital distance of the planet.[18]\\r\\nMany of the well known bright stars are red giants, because they are luminous and moderately common. The asymptotic giant branch variable star Gamma Crucis is the nearest M class giant star at 88 light years.[19] The K0 red giant branch star Arcturus is 36 light years away.[20]\\r\\nIn about 5 to 6 billion years, the Sun will have depleted the hydrogen fuel in its core and will begin to expand. At its largest, its surface (photosphere) will approximately reach the current orbit of Earth. It will then lose its atmosphere completely; its outer layers forming a planetary nebula and the core a white dwarf. The evolution of the Sun into and through the red-giant phase has been extensively modelled, but it remains unclear whether Earth will be engulfed by the Sun or will continue in orbit. The uncertainty arises in part because as the Sun burns hydrogen, it loses mass causing Earth (and all planets) to orbit farther away. There are also significant uncertainties in calculating the orbits of the planets over the next 5√ø6.5 billion years, so the fate of Earth is not well understood. At its brightest, the red-giant Sun will be several thousand times more luminous than today but its surface will be at about half the temperature.\\r\\n Media related to Red giants at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What is the closest red giant star to earth?"},{"output":"pI can be calculated from the mean of the pKas","context":"The isoelectric point (pI, pH(I), IEP), is the pH at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge in the statistical mean. The standard nomenclature to represent the isoelectric point is pH(I),[1] although pI is also commonly seen,[2] and is used in this article for brevity. The net charge on the molecule is affected by pH of its surrounding environment and can become more positively or negatively charged due to the gain or loss, respectively, of protons (H+).\\r\\nSurfaces naturally charge to form a double layer. In the common case when the surface charge-determining ions are H+/OH?, the net surface charge is affected by the pH of the liquid in which the solid is submerged.\\r\\nThe pI value can affect the solubility of a molecule at a given pH. Such molecules have minimum solubility in water or salt solutions at the pH that corresponds to their pI and often precipitate out of solution. Biological amphoteric molecules such as proteins contain both acidic and basic functional groups. Amino acids that make up proteins may be positive, negative, neutral, or polar in nature, and together give a protein its overall charge. At a pH below their pI, proteins carry a net positive charge; above their pI they carry a net negative charge. Proteins can, thus, be separated by net charge in a polyacrylamide gel using either preparative gel electrophoresis, which uses a constant pH to separate proteins or isoelectric focusing, which uses a pH gradient to separate proteins. Isoelectric focusing is also the first step in 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\\r\\nIn biomolecules, proteins can be separated by ion exchange chromatography. Biological proteins are made up of zwitterionic amino acid compounds; the net charge of these proteins can be positive or negative depending on the pH of the environment. The specific pI of the target protein can be used to model the process around and the compound can then be purified from the rest of the mixture. Buffers of various pH can be used for this purification process to change the pH of the environment. When a mixture containing a target protein is loaded into an ion exchanger, the stationary matrix can be either positively-charged (for mobile anions) or negatively-charged (for mobile cations). At low pH values, the net charge of most proteins in the mixture is positive - in cation exchangers, these positively-charged proteins bind to the negatively-charged matrix. At high pH values, the net charge of most proteins is negative, where they bind to the positively-charged matrix in anion exchangers. When the environment is at a pH value equal to the protein's pI, the net charge is zero, and the protein is not bound to any exchanger, and therefore, can be eluted out.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor an amino acid with only one amine and one carboxyl group, the pI can be calculated from the mean of the pKas of this molecule.[4]\\r\\nThe pH of an electrophoretic gel is determined by the buffer used for that gel. If the pH of the buffer is above the pI of the protein being run, the protein will migrate to the positive pole (negative charge is attracted to a positive pole). If the pH of the buffer is below the pI of the protein being run, the protein will migrate to the negative pole of the gel (positive charge is attracted to the negative pole). If the protein is run with a buffer pH that is equal to the pI, it will not migrate at all. This is also true for individual amino acids.\\r\\nIn the two examples (on the right) the isoelectric point is shown by the green vertical line. In glycine the pK values are separated by nearly 7 units so the concentration of the neutral species, glycine (GlyH), is effectively 100% of the analytical glycine concentration. Glycine may exist as a zwitterion at the isoelectric point, but the equilibrium constant for the isomerization reaction in solution\\r\\nis not known.\\r\\nThe other example, adenosine monophosphate is shown to illustrate the fact that a third species may, in principle, be involved. In fact the concentration of (AMP)H32+ is negligible at the isoelectric point in this case. If the pI is greater than the pH, the molecule will have a positive charge.\\r\\nA number of algorithms for estimating isoelectric points of peptides and proteins have been developed. Most of them use Henderson√øHasselbalch equation with different pK values. For instance, within the model proposed by Bjellqvist and co-workers the pK's were determined between closely related immobilines, by focusing the same sample in overlapping pH gradients.[5] Some improvements in the methodology (especially in the determination of the pK values for modified amino acids) have been also proposed.[6][7] More advanced methods take into account the effect of adjacent amino acids I3 residues away from a charged aspartic or glutamic acid, the effects on free C terminus, as well as they apply a correction term to the corresponding pK values using genetic algorithm.[8] Other recent approaches are based on a support vector machine algorithm[9] and pKa optimization against experimentally known protein/peptide isoelectric points.[10]\\r\\nMoreover, experimentally measured isoelectric point of proteins were aggregated into the databases.[11][12] Recently, a database of isoelectric points for all proteins predicted using most of the available methods had been also developed.[13]\\r\\nThe isoelectric points (IEP) of metal oxide ceramics are used extensively in material science in various aqueous processing steps (synthesis, modification, etc.). In the absence of chemisorbed or physisorbed species particle surfaces in aqueous suspension are generally assumed to be covered with surface hydroxyl species, M-OH (where M is a metal such as Al, Si, etc.).[14] At pH values above the IEP, the predominate surface species is M-O?, while at pH values below the IEP, M-OH2+ species predominate. Some approximate values of common ceramics are listed below:[15][16]\\r\\nNote: The following list gives the isoelectric point at 25?C for selected materials in water. The exact value can vary widely, depending on material factors such as purity and phase as well as physical parameters such as temperature. Moreover, the precise measurement of isoelectric points can be difficult, thus many sources often cite differing values for isoelectric points of these materials.\\r\\nMixed oxides may exhibit isoelectric point values that are intermediate to those of the corresponding pure oxides. For example, a synthetically prepared amorphous aluminosilicate (Al2O3-SiO2) was initially measured as having IEP of 4.5 (the electrokinetic behavior of the surface was dominated by surface Si-OH species, thus explaining the relatively low IEP value).[23] Significantly higher IEP values (pH 6 to 8) have been reported for 3Al2O3-2SiO2 by others.[18] Similarly, also IEP of barium titanate, BaTiO3 was raported in the range 5-6[18] while others got a value of 3.[24]\\r\\nThe terms isoelectric point (IEP) and point of zero charge (PZC) are often used interchangeably, although under certain circumstances, it may be productive to make the distinction.\\r\\nIn systems in which H+/OH? are the interface potential-determining ions, the point of zero charge is given in terms of pH. The pH at which the surface exhibits a neutral net electrical charge is the point of zero charge at the surface. Electrokinetic phenomena generally measure zeta potential, and a zero zeta potential is interpreted as the point of zero net charge at the shear plane. This is termed the isoelectric point.[25] Thus, the isoelectric point is the value of pH at which the colloidal particle remains stationary in an electrical field. The isoelectric point is expected to be somewhat different than the point of zero charge at the particle surface, but this difference is often ignored in practice for so-called pristine surfaces, i.e., surfaces with no specifically adsorbed positive or negative charges.[14] In this context, specific adsorption is understood as adsorption occurring in a Stern layer or chemisorption. Thus, point of zero charge at the surface is taken as equal to isoelectric point in the absence of specific adsorption on that surface.\\r\\nAccording to Jolivet,[19] in the absence of positive or negative charges, the surface is best described by the point of zero charge. If positive and negative charges are both present in equal amounts, then this is the isoelectric point. Thus, the PZC refers to the absence of any type of surface charge, while the IEP refers to a state of neutral net surface charge. The difference between the two, therefore, is the quantity of charged sites at the point of net zero charge. Jolivet uses the intrinsic surface equilibrium constants, pK? and pK+ to define the two conditions in terms of the relative number of charged sites:\\r\\nFor large pK (>4 according to Jolivet), the predominant species is MOH while there are relatively few charged species - so the PZC is relevant. For small values of pK, there are many charged species in approximately equal numbers, so one speaks of the IEP.","input":"What is the difference between pka and pi?"},{"output":"to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait","context":"","input":"What was the reason for operation desert storm?"},{"output":"Byju Raveendran","context":"BYJUS - The Learning App is the popular brand name for Think and Learn Private Ltd., a Alipur-based Educational technology (edtech) and online tutoring firm.\\r\\nIt was founded in 2011 by Byju Raveendran at \\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, Byju himself comes from a small village in Kerala, Azhikode. \\r\\nBYJU'S was the first investment in Asia from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.[1] It is considered to be one among the only few Indian consumer startups that has gone global,[2] particularly with the 2017 acquisition of TutorVista.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir flagship product is a smartphone app named BYJU'S-The Learning App that has been available since August 2015.[3] \\r\\nThe App serves educational content mainly to school students from classes 4 to 12 (primary to higher secondary level education). \\r\\nThe company trains students for competitive examinations in India such as IIT-JEE, NEET, CAT, IAS as well as for international examinations such as GRE and GMAT.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main focus is on mathematics and science, where the concepts are visually explained and in context [4]\\r\\nusing modern digital animations\\r\\n[5]\\r\\nand moving illustrations, all embedded within short videos (15-20 minutes long).[6] The app has received criticism for a few issues such as lack of depth in some areas, overly simplistic treatment of some basic topics, and lack of within-lecture student-teacher interaction. \\r\\nIn spite of the adverse critical opinion and competition from other players (including Edtech startups and traditional education firms), the app has enjoyed tremendous popularity.

Cameras evolved from the camera obscura, and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology, including daguerreotypes, calotypes, dry plates, film, and to the modern day with digital cameras.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe forerunner to the photographic camera was the camera obscura. Camera obscura (Latin for \\"dark room\\") is the natural optical phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen and forms an inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. The oldest known record of this principle is a description by Han Chinese philosopher Mozi (ca. 470 to ca. 391 BC). Mozi correctly asserted that the camera obscura image is inverted because light travels in straight lines from its source. In the 11th century Arab physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen)'s wrote very influential books about optics, including experiments with light through a small opening in a darkened room.\\r\\nThe use of a lens in the opening of a wall or closed window shutter of a darkened room to project images used as a drawing aid has been traced back to circa 1550. Since the late 17th century portable camera obscura devices in tents and boxes were used as a drawing aid.\\r\\nBefore the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models. By Nipce's time portable box camerae obscurae suitable for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible.\\r\\nThe first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nicphore Nipce,[1][2] using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride, which darkened where it was exposed to light. No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Nipce, so the photograph was not permanent, eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it. In the mid-1820s, Nipce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with Bitumen of Judea.[3] The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image. The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away. One of those photographs has survived.\\r\\nAfter Nipce's death in 1833, his partner Louis Daguerre continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process, which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839.[4] Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor to give it a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide. After exposure in the camera, the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt (sodium chloride). Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process, the calotype, in 1840. As commercialized, both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes. The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus. After focusing, the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped. Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder, uncapped the lens, and counted off as many minutes as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder. Despite this mechanical simplicity, high-quality achromatic lenses were standard.[5]\\r\\nCollodion dry plates had been available since 1857, thanks to the work of Dsir van Monckhoven, but it was not until the invention of the gelatin dry plate in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox that the wet plate process could be rivaled in quality and speed. The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called \\"instantaneous\\" snapshot exposures practical. For the first time, a tripod or other support was no longer an absolute necessity. With daylight and a fast plate or film, a small camera could be hand-held while taking the picture. The ranks of amateur photographers swelled and informal \\"candid\\" portraits became popular. There was a proliferation of camera designs, from single- and twin-lens reflexes to large and bulky field cameras, simple box cameras, and even \\"detective cameras\\" disguised as pocket watches, hats, or other objects.\\r\\nThe short exposure times that made candid photography possible also necessitated another innovation, the mechanical shutter. The very first shutters were separate accessories, though built-in shutters were common by the end of the 19th century.[5]\\r\\nThe use of photographic film was pioneered by George Eastman, who started manufacturing paper film in 1885 before switching to celluloid in 1888-1889. His first camera, which he called the \\"Kodak,\\" was first offered for sale in 1888. It was a very simple box camera with a fixed-focus lens and single shutter speed, which along with its relatively low price appealed to the average consumer. The Kodak came pre-loaded with enough film for 100 exposures and needed to be sent back to the factory for processing and reloading when the roll was finished. By the end of the 19th century Eastman had expanded his lineup to several models including both box and folding cameras.\\r\\nIn 1900, Eastman took mass-market photography one step further with the Brownie, a simple and very inexpensive box camera that introduced the concept of the snapshot. The Brownie was extremely popular and various models remained on sale until the 1960s.\\r\\nFilm also allowed the movie camera to develop from an expensive toy to a practical commercial tool.\\r\\nDespite the advances in low-cost photography made possible by Eastman, plate cameras still offered higher-quality prints and remained popular well into the 20th century. To compete with rollfilm cameras, which offered a larger number of exposures per loading, many inexpensive plate cameras from this era were equipped with magazines to hold several plates at once. Special backs for plate cameras allowing them to use film packs or rollfilm were also available, as were backs that enabled rollfilm cameras to use plates.\\r\\nExcept for a few special types such as Schmidt cameras, most professional astrographs continued to use plates until the end of the 20th century when electronic photography replaced them.\\r\\nA number of manufacturers started to use 35mm film for still photography between 1905 and 1913. The first 35mm cameras available to the public, and reaching significant numbers in sales were the Tourist Multiple, in 1913, and the Simplex, in 1914.[citation needed]\\r\\nOskar Barnack, who was in charge of research and development at Leitz, decided to investigate using 35?mm cine film for still cameras while attempting to build a compact camera capable of making high-quality enlargements. He built his prototype 35?mm camera (Ur-Leica) around 1913, though further development was delayed for several years by World War I. It wasn't until after World War I that Leica commercialized their first 35mm Cameras. Leitz test-marketed the design between 1923 and 1924, receiving enough positive feedback that the camera was put into production as the Leica I (for Leitz camera) in 1925. The Leica's immediate popularity spawned a number of competitors, most notably the Contax (introduced in 1932), and cemented the position of 35 mm as the format of choice for high-end compact cameras.\\r\\nKodak got into the market with the Retina I in 1934, which introduced the 135 cartridge used in all modern 35?mm cameras. Although the Retina was comparatively inexpensive, 35?mm cameras were still out of reach for most people and rollfilm remained the format of choice for mass-market cameras. This changed in 1936 with the introduction of the inexpensive Argus A and to an even greater extent in 1939 with the arrival of the immensely popular Argus C3. Although the cheapest cameras still used rollfilm, 35?mm film had come to dominate the market by the time the C3 was discontinued in 1966.\\r\\nThe fledgling Japanese camera industry began to take off in 1936 with the Canon 35?mm rangefinder, an improved version of the 1933 Kwanon prototype. Japanese cameras would begin to become popular in the West after Korean War veterans and soldiers stationed in Japan brought them back to the United States and elsewhere.\\r\\nThe first practical reflex camera was the Franke & Heidecke Rolleiflex medium format TLR of 1928. Though both single- and twin-lens reflex cameras had been available for decades, they were too bulky to achieve much popularity. The Rolleiflex, however, was sufficiently compact to achieve widespread popularity and the medium-format TLR design became popular for both high- and low-end cameras.\\r\\nA similar revolution in SLR design began in 1933 with the introduction of the Ihagee Exakta, a compact SLR which used 127 rollfilm. This was followed three years later by the first Western SLR to use 135 film, the Kine Exakta (World's first true 35mm SLR was Soviet \\"Sport\\" camera, marketed several months before Kine Exakta, though \\"Sport\\" used its own film cartridge). The 35mm SLR design gained immediate popularity and there was an explosion of new models and innovative features after World War II. There were also a few 35mm TLRs, the best-known of which was the Contaflex of 1935, but for the most part these met with little success.\\r\\nThe first major post-war SLR innovation was the eye-level viewfinder, which first appeared on the Hungarian Duflex in 1947 and was refined in 1948 with the Contax S, the first camera to use a pentaprism. Prior to this, all SLRs were equipped with waist-level focusing screens. The Duflex was also the first SLR with an instant-return mirror, which prevented the viewfinder from being blacked out after each exposure. This same time period also saw the introduction of the Hasselblad 1600F, which set the standard for medium format SLRs for decades.\\r\\nIn 1952 the Asahi Optical Company (which later became well known for its Pentax cameras) introduced the first Japanese SLR using 135 film, the Asahiflex. Several other Japanese camera makers also entered the SLR market in the 1950s, including Canon, Yashica, and Nikon. Nikon's entry, the Nikon F, had a full line of interchangeable components and accessories and is generally regarded as the first Japanese system camera. It was the F, along with the earlier S series of rangefinder cameras, that helped establish Nikon's reputation as a maker of professional-quality equipment.\\r\\nWhile conventional cameras were becoming more refined and sophisticated, an entirely new type of camera appeared on the market in 1948. This was the Polaroid Model 95, the world's first viable instant-picture camera. Known as a Land Camera after its inventor, Edwin Land, the Model 95 used a patented chemical process to produce finished positive prints from the exposed negatives in under a minute. The Land Camera caught on despite its relatively high price and the Polaroid lineup had expanded to dozens of models by the 1960s. The first Polaroid camera aimed at the popular market, the Model 20 Swinger of 1965, was a huge success and remains one of the top-selling cameras of all time.\\r\\nThe first camera to feature automatic exposure was the selenium light meter-equipped, fully automatic Super Kodak Six-20 pack of 1938, but its extremely high price (for the time) of $225 ($3828 in present terms[6]) kept it from achieving any degree of success. By the 1960s, however, low-cost electronic components were commonplace and cameras equipped with light meters and automatic exposure systems became increasingly widespread.\\r\\nThe next technological advance came in 1960, when the German Mec 16 SB subminiature became the first camera to place the light meter behind the lens for more accurate metering. However, through-the-lens metering ultimately became a feature more commonly found on SLRs than other types of camera; the first SLR equipped with a TTL system was the Topcon RE Super of 1962.\\r\\nDigital cameras differ from their analog predecessors primarily in that they do not use film, but capture and save photographs on digital memory cards or internal storage instead. Their low operating costs have relegated chemical cameras to niche markets. Digital cameras now include wireless communication capabilities (for example Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) to transfer, print or share photos, and are commonly found on mobile phones.\\r\\nThe concept of digitizing images on scanners, and the concept of digitizing video signals, predate the concept of making still pictures by digitizing signals from an array of discrete sensor elements. Early spy satellites used the extremely complex and expensive method of de-orbit and airborne retrieval of film canisters. Technology was pushed to skip these steps through the use of in-satellite developing and electronic scanning of the film for direct transmission to the ground. The amount of film was still a major limitation, and this was overcome and greatly simplified by the push to develop an electronic image capturing array that could be used instead of film. The first electronic imaging satellite was the KH-11 launched by the NRO in late 1976. It had a charge-coupled device (CCD) array with a resolution of 800 x 800 pixels (0.64 megapixels).[7] At Philips Labs in New York, Edward Stupp, Pieter Cath and Zsolt Szilagyi filed for a patent on \\"All Solid State Radiation Imagers\\" on 6 September 1968 and constructed a flat-screen target for receiving and storing an optical image on a matrix composed of an array of photodiodes connected to a capacitor to form an array of two terminal devices connected in rows and columns. Their US patent was granted on 10 November 1970.[8] Texas Instruments engineer Willis Adcock designed a filmless camera that was not digital and applied for a patent in 1972, but it is not known whether it was ever built.[9] The Cromemco CYCLOPS introduced as a hobbyist construction project in 1975[10] was the first digital camera to be interfaced to a microcomputer.\\r\\nThe first recorded attempt at building a self-contained digital camera was in 1975 by Steven Sasson, an engineer at Eastman Kodak.[11][12] It used the then-new solid-state CCD image sensor chips developed by Fairchild Semiconductor in 1973.[13] The camera weighed 8 pounds (3.6?kg), recorded black and white images to a compact cassette tape, had a resolution of 0.01?megapixels (10,000 pixels), and took 23 seconds to capture its first image in December 1975. The prototype camera was a technical exercise, not intended for production.\\r\\nHandheld electronic cameras, in the sense of a device meant to be carried and used like a handheld film camera, appeared in 1981 with the demonstration of the Sony Mavica (Magnetic Video Camera). This is not to be confused with the later cameras by Sony that also bore the Mavica name. This was an analog camera, in that it recorded pixel signals continuously, as videotape machines did, without converting them to discrete levels; it recorded television-like signals to a 2?G?2?inch \\"video floppy\\".[14] In essence it was a video movie camera that recorded single frames, 50 per disk in field mode and 25 per disk in frame mode. The image quality was considered equal to that of then-current televisions.\\r\\nAnalog electronic cameras do not appear to have reached the market until 1986 with the Canon RC-701. Canon demonstrated a prototype of this model at the 1984 Summer Olympics, printing the images in the Yomiuri Shinbun, a Japanese newspaper. In the United States, the first publication to use these cameras for real reportage was USA Today, in its coverage of World Series baseball. Several factors held back the widespread adoption of analog cameras; the cost (upwards of $20,000), poor image quality compared to film, and the lack of quality affordable printers. Capturing and printing an image originally required access to equipment such as a frame grabber, which was beyond the reach of the average consumer. The \\"video floppy\\" disks later had several reader devices available for viewing on a screen, but were never standardized as a computer drive.\\r\\nThe early adopters tended to be in the news media, where the cost was negated by the utility and the ability to transmit images by telephone lines. The poor image quality was offset by the low resolution of newspaper graphics. This capability to transmit images without a satellite link was useful during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the first Gulf War in 1991.\\r\\nUS government agencies also took a strong interest in the still video concept, notably the US Navy for use as a real time air-to-sea surveillance system.\\r\\nThe first analog electronic camera marketed to consumers may have been the Casio VS-101 in 1987. A notable analog camera produced the same year was the Nikon QV-1000C, designed as a press camera and not offered for sale to general users, which sold only a few hundred units. It recorded images in greyscale, and the quality in newspaper print was equal to film cameras. In appearance it closely resembled a modern digital single-lens reflex camera. Images were stored on video floppy disks.\\r\\nSilicon Film, a proposed digital sensor cartridge for film cameras that would allow 35?mm cameras to take digital photographs without modification was announced in late 1998. Silicon Film was to work like a roll of 35?mm film, with a 1.3 megapixel sensor behind the lens and a battery and storage unit fitting in the film holder in the camera. The product, which was never released, became increasingly obsolete due to improvements in digital camera technology and affordability. Silicon Films' parent company filed for bankruptcy in 2001.[15]\\r\\nBy the late 1980s, the technology required to produce truly commercial digital cameras existed. The first true portable digital camera that recorded images as a computerized file was likely the Fuji DS-1P of 1988, which recorded to a 2?MB SRAM memory card that used a battery to keep the data in memory. This camera was never marketed to the public.\\r\\nThe first digital camera of any kind ever sold commercially was possibly the MegaVision Tessera in 1987 [16] though there is not extensive documentation of its sale known. The first portable digital camera that was actually marketed commercially was sold in December 1989 in Japan, the DS-X by Fuji[17] The first commercially available portable digital camera in the United States was the Dycam Model?1, first shipped in November 1990.[18] It was originally a commercial failure because it was black and white, low in resolution, and cost nearly $1,000 (about $2000 in 2014).[19] It later saw modest success when it was re-sold as the Logitech Fotoman in 1992. It used a CCD image sensor, stored pictures digitally, and connected directly to a computer for download.[20][21][22]\\r\\nIn 1991, Kodak brought to market the Kodak DCS (Kodak Digital Camera System), the beginning of a long line of professional Kodak DCS SLR cameras that were based in part on film bodies, often Nikons. It used a 1.3?megapixel sensor, had a bulky external digital storage system and was priced at $13,000. At the arrival of the Kodak DCS-200, the Kodak DCS was dubbed Kodak DCS-100.\\r\\nThe move to digital formats was helped by the formation of the first JPEG and MPEG standards in 1988, which allowed image and video files to be compressed for storage. The first consumer camera with a liquid crystal display on the back was the Casio QV-10 developed by a team led by Hiroyuki Suetaka in 1995. The first camera to use CompactFlash was the Kodak DC-25 in 1996.[citation needed]. The first camera that offered the ability to record video clips may have been the Ricoh RDC-1 in 1995.\\r\\nIn 1995 Minolta introduced the RD-175, which was based on the Minolta 500si SLR with a splitter and three independent CCDs. This combination delivered 1.75M pixels. The benefit of using an SLR base was the ability to use any existing Minolta AF mount lens. 1999 saw the introduction of the Nikon D1, a 2.74?megapixel camera that was the first digital SLR developed entirely from the ground up by a major manufacturer, and at a cost of under $6,000 at introduction was affordable by professional photographers and high-end consumers. This camera also used Nikon F-mount lenses, which meant film photographers could use many of the same lenses they already owned.\\r\\nDigital camera sales continued to flourish, driven by technology advances. The digital market segmented into different categories, Compact Digital Still Cameras, Bridge Cameras, Mirrorless Compacts and Digital SLRs. One of the major technology advances was the development of CMOS sensors, which helped drive sensor costs low enough to enable the widespread adoption of camera phones.\\r\\nSince 2003, digital cameras have outsold film cameras[23] and Kodak announced in January 2004 that they would no longer sell Kodak-branded film cameras in the developed world[24] - and 2012 filed for bankruptcy after struggling to adapt to the changing industry.[25] Smartphones now routinely include high resolution digital cameras.\\r\\nNotes","input":"When was the world's first camera invented?"},{"output":"a pink toy rabbit wearing sunglasses and blue and black striped sandals that beats a bass drum bearing the Energizer logo","context":"The Energizer Bunny is the marketing icon and mascot of Energizer batteries in North America. It is a pink toy rabbit wearing sunglasses and blue and black striped sandals that beats a bass drum bearing the Energizer logo.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally a parody of the preexisting Duracell Bunny, still seen in the UK, Europe and Australia, the Bunny has appeared in television commercials in North America since 1988. The Energizer Bunny is promoted as being able to continue operating indefinitely, or at least much longer than similar toys (or other products) using rival brands' batteries, with the marketing tagline \\"It just keeps going and going...\\". The American Energizer commercials, produced by D.D.B. Chicago Advertising, originally began as a parody of TV advertisements for rival Duracell. In the original Duracell ads, a set of battery-powered drum-playing toy rabbits gradually slow to a halt until only the toy powered by a copper-top battery remains active. In Energizer's parody, the Energizer Bunny then enters the screen beating a huge bass drum and swinging a mallet over his head. The criticism was that Duracell compared their batteries with carbon-zinc batteries, and not similar alkaline batteries like Energizer.[1]\\r\\nThe creative team at D.D.B. Chicago who conceived and designed the bunny chose All Effects special effects company to build the original Energizer Bunny, a remote-controlled prop. All Effects operated the Energizer Bunny in most of its first commercials.[citation needed] Later commercials were made by Industrial Light & Magic, Cafe FX and Method Studios.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commercials started out with the Bunny leaving the studio it was in, then wandering into the sets of a couple of realistic-looking commercials for fictional products, interrupting them. As the campaign progressed, many of these ads were standalone (for fake products such as \\"Sitagin Hemorrhoid Remedy\\", \\"Nasotine Sinus Relief\\", \\"TresCafe Coffee\\", \\"Alarm\\" deodorant soap, etc.) and even a few featured celebrities (such as Lyle Alzado promoting a snack called \\"Pigskins\\", and Ted Nugent doing an ad for a Mexican food chain called \\"Cucaracha\\") only to have the Bunny march through, beating his drum, because he was \\"still going\\" (one infamous commercial was for a fake long-distance telephone company with a couple in the United Kingdom talking to their son, who was supposedly in New York and exclaimed that he \\"sounded like he's right next door\\", and when the Bunny came in, he knocked down the divider to show they really were next to each other). Eventually real-life products and icons would do a crossover with the Energizer Bunny (Michael J. Fox doing a Pepsi ad, and the opening of TV shows such as Alfred Hitchcock Presents and ABC's Wide World of Sports).  The Energizer Bunny has appeared in more than 115 television commercials.[2] In these commercials, a voice-over would announce one of various slogans used throughout the years; all of them would relate the stalwartness of the Energizer Bunny to the long-lasting power of their batteries. The original slogan boasted that \\"...[n]othing outlasts the Energizer...\\", but it was eventually changed after a lawsuit filed by Duracell disputing Energizer's claim.[3] Those commercials with the bunny interrupting all the action in a commercial were eventually spoofed in the 1993 film Hot Shots! Part Deux, featuring a blue animal drumming through instead of the pink bunny. The two people fighting then used their guns to shoot the blue animal, causing the blue animal to explode.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1993 through 1995, Energizer ran a series of commercials featuring a fake rival battery called \\"Supervolt\\" including a Supervolt weasel mascot, which was an obvious lookalike of Duracell. As Supervolt's battery sales have gone low, the company's CEO (portrayed by Rip Torn) seeks to neutralize the Energizer Bunny by targeting its battery. In order to do this. Supervolt's CEO goes in the process of finding individuals who can assist them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many of the associated commercials that followed, villains such as Darth Vader, the Wicked Witch of the West, Wile E. Coyote, and Boris and Natasha, as well as a robotic flea, would try to destroy or capture the Bunny only to see complications arise when their devices using Supervolt batteries ran out or other circumstances allowed for the mascot's escape. In addition, a flock of vultures and a foxhunt would get exhausted trying to catch the Energizer Bunny and the Grim Reaper gave up waiting for the Energizer Bunny to come with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second one showed the quality of the product being advertised when it created complications for the villain-so as not to boast that Energizer was better than any other brand, as well as to encourage people to buy Energizer batteries for their smoke detectors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2016, Energizer switched their advertising agency to Camp+King and introduced a new more expressive bunny who is slimmer and has more facial expression. The bunny will keep the signature drum, flip flops, and dark sunglasses, but the pink fur will be more realistic.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991, Energizer Holdings unsuccessfully sued the Adolph Coors Company for copyright infringement for creating a parody of its Energizer bunny ads.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe advertisement had comedian Leslie Nielsen banging a bass drum while wearing rabbit ears while the announcer said \\"It keeps growing and growing!\\" The court eventually sided with Coors noting the obvious facts that the content of the ad is substantially different considering Nielsen was not a toy and he did not run on batteries.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the immense popularity of the campaign, sales of Energizer batteries actually went down during the years that the ads ran. Duracell claimed that 40 percent of its customers thought the campaign was promoting Duracell, not Energizer, but provided no evidence. Speculation has it that TV watchers still associated pink bunnies with Duracell, so the Energizer ads were actually helping their competitor's sales rather than their own.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn North America the term \\"Energizer Bunny\\" has entered the vernacular as a term for anything that continues endlessly, or someone that has immense stamina. In Europe and Australia the term \\"Duracell Bunny\\" has a similar connotation. Several U.S. presidential candidates have compared themselves to the bunny, including President George H. W. Bush in 1992 and Howard Dean in 2004.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992, the company PC Dynamics created a Screen Saver for Windows 3.x featuring Energizer Bunny with audio clips from the commercials.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the ninth season of Roseanne (1996√ø97), the lyrics sung by Blues Traveler lead singer John Popper begin with: \\"If what doesn't kill us is making us stronger, we're gonna last longer/Than that greatest wall in China, or that rabbit with the drum.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnergizer was the corporate sponsor of Star Tours at Disneyland Park and Disney's Hollywood Studios for several years; the bunny appeared in several ride-themed advertisements around the show's exit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, an Energizer Bunny balloonicle debuted in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and appeared until 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several years, comedian and ventriloquist Jeff Dunham had a recurring joke about the Energizer Bunny. His \\"grumpy old man\\" puppet Walter would ask about commercials interrupting their broadcast, citing the Bunny as a particularly annoying example. The joke would often end with Walter saying, \\"I'd like to trap his furry little ass...hook him up to a Sears  DieHard.\\"","input":"What did the first energizer bunny look like?"},{"output":"1,324,171,354","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia is the second most populated country in the world with nearly a fifth of the world's population.

Only the continent of Africa exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sex ratio is 944 females for 1000 males (2016) (940 per 1000 in 2011[12]) This ratio has been showing an upwards trend for the last two decades after a continuous decline in the last century.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table lists estimates for the population of India (including what are now Pakistan and Bangladesh) from prehistory up until 1820. It includes estimates and growth rates according to five different economic historians, along with interpolated estimates and overall aggregate averages derived from their estimates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe population grew from the South Asian Stone Age in 10,000 BC to the Maurya Empire in 200 BC at a steadily increasing growth rate,[22] before population growth slowed down in the classical era up to 500 AD, and then became largely stagnant during the early medieval era era up to 1000 AD.[14][16] The population growth rate then increased in the late medieval era (during the Delhi Sultanate) from 1000 to 1500.[14][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia's population growth rate under the Mughal Empire (16th√ø18th centuries) was higher than during any previous period in Indian history.[22][23][16] Under the Mughal Empire, India experienced an unprecedented economic and demographic upsurge,[22] due to Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production,[24] proto-industrialization[25] that established India as the most important centre of manufacturing in international trade,[26] and a relatively high degree of urbanisation for its time;[27] 15% of the population lived in urban centres, higher than the percentage of the population in 19th-century British India[27] and contemporary Europe[27] up until the 19th century.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the reign of Akbar the Great (reigned 1556√ø1605) in 1600, the Mughal Empire's urban population was up to 17 million people, larger than the urban population in Europe.[29] By 1700, Mughal India had an urban population of 23 million people, larger than British India's urban population of 22.3 million in 1871.[30] Nizamuddin Ahmad (1551√ø1621) reported that, under Akbar's reign, Mughal India had 120 large cities and 3,200 townships.[27] A number of cities in India had a population between a quarter-million and half-million people,[27] with larger cities including Agra (in Agra Subah) with up to 800,000 people[31] and Dhaka (in Bengal Subah) with over 1 million people.[32] Mughal India also had a large number of villages, with 455,698 villages by the time of Aurangzeb (reigned 1658√ø1707).[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman.

Scientists who study human sex ratios and demographic trends suggest that birth sex ratio between 1.08 and 1.12 can be because of natural factors, such as the age of mother at baby's birth, age of father at baby's birth, number of babies per couple, economic stress, endocrinological factors, etc.[66] The 2011 census birth sex ratio in India, of 917 girls to 1000 boys, is similar to 870√ø930 girls to 1000 boys birth sex ratios observed in Japanese, Chinese, Cuban, Filipino and Hawaiian ethnic groups in the United States between 1940 and 2005.

Sweeney (December 27, 1919 √ø July 16, 2004) was an officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II and the pilot who flew Bockscar carrying the Fat Man atomic bomb to the Japanese city of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.  Separating from active duty at the end of World War II, he later became an officer in the Massachusetts Air National Guard as the Army Air Forces transitioned to an independent U.S. Air Force, eventually rising to the rank of major general.\\r\\n\\r\\nSweeney became an instructor in the atomic missions training project, Project Alberta, at Wendover Army Airfield, Utah. Selected to be part of the 509th Composite Group commanded by Col. Paul Tibbets, he was named commander of the 320th Troop Carrier Squadron on 6 January 1945. Initially his squadron used C-47 Skytrain and C-46 Commando transports on hand to conduct the top secret operations to supply the 509th, but in April 1945 it acquired five C-54 Skymasters, which had the range to deliver personnel and materiel to the western Pacific area.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 4, 1945, Sweeney became commander of the 393d Bombardment Squadron, Heavy, the combat element of the 509th, in charge of 15 Silverplate B-29s and their flight and ground crews, 535 men in all. In June and July Sweeney moved his unit to North Field on the island of Tinian in the Marianas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to supervising the intensive training of his flight crews during July 1945, Sweeney was slated to command the second atomic bomb mission. He trained with the crew of Captain (Charles D.) Don Albury aboard their B-29 The Great Artiste, and was aircraft commander on the training mission of July 11. He and the crew flew five of the nine rehearsal test drops of inert Little Boy and Fat Man bomb assemblies in preparation for the missions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 August 1945, Sweeney and Albury piloted The Great Artiste as the instrumentation and observation support aircraft for the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 9 August 1945, Major Sweeney commanded Bockscar, which carried the atomic bomb Fat Man from the island of Tinian to Nagasaki. In addition to Bockscar, the mission included two observation and instrumentation support B-29s, The Great Artiste and The Big Stink, who would rendezvous with Bockscar over Yakushima Island. At the mission pre-briefing, the three planes were ordered to make their rendezvous over Yakushima at 30,000 feet due to weather conditions over Iwo Jima (the Hiroshima mission rendezvous). That same morning, on the day of the mission, the ground crew notified Sweeney that a faulty fuel transfer pump made it impossible to utilize some 625 gallons of fuel in the tail, but Sweeney, as aircraft commander, elected to proceed with the mission.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore takeoff, Col. Tibbets warned Sweeney that he had lost at least 45 minutes of flying time because of the fuel pump problem, and to take no more than fifteen minutes at the rendezvous before proceeding directly to the primary target.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter takeoff from Tinian, Bockscar reached its rendezvous point and after circling for an extended period, found The Great Artiste, but not The Big Stink.[4]  Climbing to 30,000 feet, the assigned rendezvous altitude, both aircraft slowly circled Yakushima Island. Though Sweeney had been ordered not to wait at the rendezvous for the other aircraft longer than fifteen minutes before proceeding to the primary target, Sweeney continued to wait for The Big Stink, perhaps at the urging of Commander Frederick Ashworth, the plane's weaponeer.[5]  After exceeding the original rendezvous time limit by a half-hour, Bockscar, accompanied by The Great Artiste, proceeded to the primary target, Kokura.[6]  No fewer than three bomb runs were made, but the delay at the rendezvous had resulted in 7/10ths cloud cover over the primary target, and the bombardier was unable to drop.[7]  By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese antiaircraft fire was getting close, and Japanese fighter planes could be seen climbing to intercept Bockscar.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor bombing visibility and an increasingly critical fuel shortage eventually forced Bockscar to divert from Kokura and attack the secondary target, Nagasaki.[9] As they approached Nagasaki, the heart of the city's downtown was covered by dense cloud, and Sweeney and the plane's weaponeer, Commander Ashworth, initially decided to bomb Nagasaki using radar.[10] However, a small opening in the clouds allowed Bockscar's bombardier to verify the target as Nagasaki. As the crew had been ordered to drop the bomb visually if possible, Sweeney decided to proceed with a visual bomb run.[11] Bockscar then dropped Fat Man, with a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT. It exploded 43 seconds later at 1,539 feet (469 meters) above the ground, at least 1.6 miles (2.5 kilometers) northwest of the planned aim point.[12][13] The failure to drop Fat Man at the precise bomb aim point caused the atomic blast to be confined to the Urakami Valley. As a consequence, a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, and only 60% of Nagasaki was destroyed. The bombing also severed the Mitsubishi arms production extensively and killed an estimated 35,000-40,000 people outright, including 23,200-28,200 Japanese industrial workers, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese soldiers.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nLow on fuel, Bockscar barely made it to the runway on Okinawa. With only enough fuel for one landing attempt, Sweeney brought Bockscar in fast and hard, ordering every available distress flare on board to be fired as he did so.[15]  The number two engine died from fuel starvation as Bockscar began its final approach.[16]  Touching the runway hard, the heavy B-29 slewed left and towards a row of parked B-24 bombers before the pilots managed to regain control.[16]  With both pilots standing on the brakes, Sweeney made a swerving 90-degree turn at the end of the runway to avoid going over the cliff into the ocean.[17] 2nd Lt. Jacob Beser recalled that at this point, two engines had died from fuel exhaustion, while \\"the centrifugal force resulting from the turn was almost enough to put us through the side of the airplane.\\"[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Bockscar returned to Tinian, Col. Tibbets recorded that he was faced with the dilemma of considering if any action should be taken against the airplane commander, Charles Sweeney, for failure to command.[19][20][21]  After meeting on Guam with Col. Tibbets and Major Sweeney, General Curtis LeMay, chief of staff for the Strategic Air Forces, confronted Sweeney, stating \\"You fucked up, didn't you, Chuck?\\", to which Sweeney made no reply.[22]  LeMay then turned to Tibbets and told him that an investigation into Sweeney's conduct of the mission would serve no useful purpose.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1945, Sweeney returned with the 509th Composite Group to Roswell Army Air Base in New Mexico to train aircrews for the atomic testing mission, Operation Crossroads.\\r\\n\\r\\nSweeney left active duty with the rank of lieutenant colonel on June 28, 1946, but remained active with the Massachusetts Air National Guard. Later promoted to full colonel, on February 21, 1956, Sweeney was named commander of its 102nd Air Defense Wing and shortly after, on April 6, was promoted to Brigadier General. During this time, he was activated with the 102nd and served in Europe during the Berlin Crisis from October 1961 to August 1962. Sweeney was made Chief of Staff in October 1967.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe retired in 1976 as a major general in the Air National Guard.[23]  He also appeared in the 1970s television series The World at War and was seen explaining the USAAF buildup to the mission raids.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout his life Sweeney remained convinced of the appropriateness and necessity of the bombing. \\"I saw these beautiful young men who were being slaughtered by an evil, evil military force,\\" he said in 1995. \\"There's no question in my mind that President Truman made the right decision.\\" At the same time, he said, \\"As the man who commanded the last atomic mission, I pray that I retain that singular distinction.\\"[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the end of his life, Sweeney wrote a controversial and factually disputed memoir of the atomic bombing and the 509th Composite Group, War's End: An Eyewitness Account of America's Last Atomic Mission.[25][26] In War's End, Sweeney defended the decision to drop the atomic bomb in light of subsequent historical questioning. However, it was Sweeney's other assertions regarding the Nagasaki atomic mission, along with various anecdotes regarding the 509th and its crews that drew the most criticism. General Paul Tibbets, Major \\"Dutch\\" Van Kirk, Colonel Thomas Ferebee and others vigorously disputed Sweeney's account of events.[27]  Partly in response to War's End, General Tibbets issued a revised version of his own autobiography in 1998, adding a new section on the Nagasaki attack in which he harshly criticized Sweeneys actions during the mission.[19][20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his later years Charles Sweeney performed in various air shows doing many maneuvers to awe crowds. Sweeney died at age 84 on July 16, 2004 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short documentary featuring an audio recording of Sweeney describing the Nagasaki mission preparation and execution called \\"Nagasaki: The Commander's Voice\\"[28] was made in 2005.

York is the son of Denise DeBartolo York and John York and nephew of former San Francisco 49ers owner Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn and raised in Youngstown, Ohio,[1] York attended St. Charles Elementary School and Cardinal Mooney High School.[2] While in high school he was a baseball team captain and the senior class president.[2] He graduated from the University of Notre Dame with a BA in Finance and History.[1]\\r\\nYork began his working days as a financial analyst for Guggenheim Partners at their New York City offices but left after approximately one year.[1] After he quit his first job, York's parents brought him into their family owned team, the San Francisco 49ers, as the Director of Strategic Planning[1] and later promoted him to Vice President of Strategic Planning.[3]\\r\\nOn December 28, 2008, Jed was appointed by his father to become president of the 49ers. While Jed is the operating head of the franchise, his mother Denise is the principal owner, and both of his parents, as co-chairmen, are responsible for providing resources and maintaining their role of interacting with other owners and NFL executives.[4]\\r\\nOn October 11, 2010, with the 49ers off to an 0-5 start, Jed York wrote to ESPN's Adam Schefter that the 49ers would win their division and make the playoffs.[5] This proclamation led ESPN columnist David Fleming to refer to York as \\"kooky\\" and \\"goofy\\" and to note that York \\"backs up such bold declarations with a long list of qualifications starting with (1) his lifelong love of the 49ers, (2) his prestigious high school baseball career and (3) the fact that his godfather is Eddie DeBartolo.\\"[6] However, the 49ers did come within one game of backing up York's assertion. In 2011, the Niners finished the season 13-3 with the 2nd seed in the National Football Conference. In the divisional round, the Niners defeated the New Orleans Saints. The 49ers then hosted the NFC Championship game against the New York Giants, eventually losing, 20-17. The success of the 2011 San Francisco 49ers was with much of the same team from 2010, but largely accomplished with the key addition of first-year head coach Jim Harbaugh.\\r\\nIn 2012, Jed York was replaced by Gideon Yu as Team President, although he retained the title of CEO.[7]\\r\\nAfter a 19-3 loss to the Seattle Seahawks on November 27, 2014, York tweeted Thank you 49ers faithful for coming out strong tonight. This performance wasnt acceptable. I apologize for that.[8] This public statement sparked a media frenzy about York's intent behind the Tweet and whether he was specifically referring to Coach Jim Harbaugh's future.\\r\\nAfter the decision to fire head coach Jim Harbaugh, there was a large negative outcry from the media and the 49ers fan base. In a press conference addressing the issue, Jed York was quoted as saying, Its up to us to make sure we compete for and win Super Bowls. Thats our only goal. We dont raise division championship banners, we dont raise NFC Championship banners. We raise Super Bowl banners. And whenever we dont deliver that, I hope that you will hold me directly responsible and accountable for it. And we look forward to getting this thing back on track. [9] Commenting on York's ability to manage the critical relationship between the general manager and the head coach, Michael Rosenberg wrote in Sports Illustrated, \\"he failed completely.\\"[10] Rosenberg also described York's impact on the broader 49ers organization, noting that \\"York has created a culture that encourages selfishness, weakness and back-stabbing.\\" Throughout the season, there were numerous leaks to the media from within the 49ers organization criticizing Coach Harbaugh. San Jose Mercury News columnist Tim Kawakami noted \\"York and [General Manager, Trent] Baalke were the primary sources for the off-the-record disclosures that undercut Harbaughs tenure.\\"[11] It has been reported that York and Harbaugh had a clash in the personality department. The animosity between the two was exacerbated by an alleged clash between them midway through the 2014 season when York supposedly walked into a meeting Harbaugh was holding with the players. When Harbaugh noticed York walking into the meeting, he allegedly told York that the meeting was for \\"men only\\".[12]\\r\\nTrent Baalke replaced former head coach Jim Harbaugh with Jim Tomsula, but Jed supported the change comparing it to the Golden State Warriors firing Mark Jackson and replacing him with Steve Kerr.[13] San Jose Mercury News columnist Tim Kawakami criticized Jed's Kerr comparison in an article titled \\"49ers' Jed York clueless in comparing Tomsula to Warriors' Kerr.\\" [14] Tomsula lasted one season, leading the 49ers to a 5-11 record before being fired on Jan. 3, 2016.[15] However, according to Adam Gase, it was Trent Baalke and not Jed York who decided to make Tomsula head coach instead of Gase.[16]","input":"Who is the owner of the san francisco 49ers?"},{"output":"22 March 1963","context":"Please Please Me is the debut studio album by English rock band the Beatles. Parlophone rush-released the album on 22?March 1963[6] in the United Kingdom to capitalise on the success of their singles \\"Please Please Me\\" (No. 1 on most lists though only No. 2 on Record Retailer)[7] and \\"Love Me Do\\" (No. 17).\\r\\nOf the album's 14 songs, eight were written by Lennon√øMcCartney (originally credited \\"McCartney√øLennon\\"), early evidence of what Rolling Stone later called \\"[their invention of] the idea of the self-contained rock band, writing their own hits and playing their own instruments.\\"[8] In 2012, Please Please Me was voted 39th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNationwide interest in the Beatles had been piqued with the success of their second UK single and Parlophone Records, hoping to take advantage of this, promptly decided to follow it up with an album. Consequently, their record producer,?George Martin,?urgently needed ten more tracks if he were to include the four sides (\\"Love Me Do\\" / \\"P.S. I Love You\\" and \\"Please Please Me\\" / \\"Ask Me Why\\") of the group's first two singles: I asked them what they had which we could record quickly, and the answer was their stage act Martin said (the norm for British 12\\"?vinyl?pop albums in 1963 was to have seven songs on each side whereas American albums usually had five or six songs per side). Having established that the Cavern Club was unsuitable for live recording purposes they were booked into?EMI Studios?in Abbey Road and recorded live there instead. Martin said, \\"It was a straightforward performance of their stage repertoirea broadcast, more or less.\\"[10] Initially, a morning and afternoon session only were booked - the evening session was added later.[11]\\r\\nTherefore, at 10:00?am on Monday, 11 February 1963, the Beatles began working their way through their live set song by song, the number of takes varying on each, and finished at 10:45?pmless than 13 hours later capturing in essence an authentic representation of the band's Cavern Club-era sound. The day ended with a cover of \\"Twist and Shout\\", which had to be recorded last because John Lennon had a particularly bad cold and Martin feared the throat-shredding vocal would ruin Lennon's voice for the day. This performance, caught on the first take, prompted Martin to say: \\"I don't know how they do it. We've been recording all day but the longer we go on the better they get.\\"[11] Mark Lewisohn would later write: \\"There can scarcely have been 585 more productive minutes in the history of recorded music\\"[12] Paul McCartney double tracked his vocal on \\"A Taste of Honey\\" and Lennon added harmonica onto \\"There's a Place\\" during these sessions. Martin overdubbed piano on \\"Misery\\" and celesta on \\"Baby It's You\\" on 20 February, during which the Beatles were not present.[13]\\r\\nThe song \\"Hold Me Tight\\" was recorded during these sessions, but was \\"surplus to requirements\\" and not included on the album.[11] \\"Hold Me Tight\\" was recorded again on 12 September 1963 for With the Beatles.[14]\\r\\nThe whole day's session cost around S400[15] (equivalent to S7,600 in 2015).[16] Martin said: \\"There wasn't a lot of money at Parlophone. I was working to an annual budget of S55,000.\\"[17] This budget had to cover all of the artists on Martin's roster. Individually, under a contract with the Musicians' Union, each Beatle collected a S7 10s (S7.50 or S142 in 2015)[16] session fee for each three-hour session (10:00 am - 1:00 pm / 2:30 pm - 5:30 pm / 7:30 pm - 10:30 pm).[18]\\r\\nBefore deciding on the title Please Please Me, Martin considered calling the album Off the Beatle Track, a title he would later use for his own orchestral album of Beatles songs.[19] The album was recorded on a two-track BTR tape machine with most of the instruments on one track and the vocals on the other, allowing Martin to better balance the two in the final mono mix.[13] A stereo mix was also made with one track on the left channel and the other on the right, as well as an added layer of reverb to better blend the two tracks together. The two tracks generally divided the instrumental track from the vocals, with the exception of \\"Boys\\", in which the close proximity of Ringo's drums to his vocal microphone placed the drums (but not the other instruments) on the vocal channel.\\r\\nTwo tracks, \\"Love Me Do\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\", were only mixed for mono for the single's release and no stereo versions were ever made, so, for the stereo version of the album, during the mixing sessions on 25 February 1963, George Martin created \\"mock stereo\\" versions by emphasizing low frequencies on one side and high frequencies on the other.[20] These versions would continue to be made available via compilation albums (such as A Collection of Beatles Oldies and 1962√ø1966), and on Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs' half-speed mastered vinyl releases (catalog number MFSL-1-101)[21] sourced from EMI's original stereo master tapes, until the Beatles' catalogue was standardized and issued on compact disc in 1987, starting with the first four UK albums being issued in their mono versions. However, when Capitol Records issued the second volume of American Beatles albums on compact disc (The Capitol Albums, Volume 2) in 2006, the same mock stereo versions that appeared on The Early Beatles were included. When the entire catalogue was remastered for release in 2009, the mono mixes were chosen for inclusion on the stereo re-issues, and appear on all releases since, including newer compilations and variations.\\r\\nPlease Please Me was released as a mono LP album on the Parlophone label in the UK on 22 March 1963, and has remained on UK catalogue continuously since 1963. The stereo version was released on 26 April, over a month after the mono version.\\r\\nRelease formats:\\r\\nIn the United States, most of the songs on Please Please Me were first issued on Vee-Jay Records' Introducing... The Beatles in 1964, and subsequently on Capitol Records' The Early Beatles in 1965. Please Please Me was not released in the US until the Beatles' catalogue was standardised for CD.\\r\\nIn Canada, the majority of the album's songs were included upon the Canadian-exclusive release Twist and Shout, which featured \\"From Me to You\\" and \\"She Loves You\\" in place of \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" and \\"Misery\\".[29]\\r\\nIn New Zealand, the album first appeared only in mono on the black Parlophone label. The following year (1964) EMI (NZ) changed from black to a blue Parlophone label and the album was again available only in mono. Due to constant demand, it was finally made available in stereo, first through the World Record Club on their Young World label in both mono and stereo, and finally on the blue Parlophone label.\\r\\nThe album was released on CD on 26 February 1987, in mono, as were their three subsequent albums, With the Beatles, A Hard Day's Night and Beatles for Sale. It was not released on vinyl or tape in the US until five months later when it was issued for the first time in the US on LP and cassette on 21 July 1987.[citation needed]\\r\\nPlease Please Me was remastered and re-released on CD in stereo, along with all the other original UK studio albums, on 9 September 2009.[30] The 2009 remasters replaced the 1987 remasters. A remastered mono CD was also available as part of The Beatles in Mono box set.[31]\\r\\nGeorge Martin was an honorary fellow of the Zoological Society of London, which owns the London Zoo. Martin thought that it might be good publicity for the zoo to have the Beatles pose outside the insect house for the cover photography of the album. However, the society turned down Martin's offer, and instead, Angus McBean was asked to take the distinctive colour photograph of the group looking down over the stairwell inside EMI's London headquarters in Manchester Square.[19] Martin was to write later: \\"We rang up the legendary theatre photographer Angus McBean, and bingo, he came round and did it there and then. It was done in an almighty rush, like the music. Thereafter, though, the Beatles' own creativity came bursting to the fore.\\"[32] In 1969, the Beatles asked McBean to recreate this shot. Although the 1969 photograph was originally intended for the then-planned Get Back album, it was not used when that project saw eventual release in 1970 as Let It Be. Instead, the 1969 photograph, along with an unused photograph from the 1963 photo shoot, was used in 1973 for the Beatles' retrospective albums 1962√ø1966 and 1967√ø1970. Another unused photograph from the 1963 photo shoot was used for The Beatles (No. 1) (EP released 1 November 1963).\\r\\nAs consistent with all early 1960s albums made in the UK, the rear of the album sleeve has sleeve notes. The Beatles' press officer Tony Barrow wrote extensive sleeve notes, which included a brief mention of their early 1960s rivals The Shadows.\\r\\nPlease Please Me hit the top of the UK album charts in May 1963 and remained there for 30 weeks before being replaced by With the Beatles. This was surprising because the UK album charts at the time tended to be dominated by film soundtracks and easy listening vocalists.[42]\\r\\nIn a 1987 review upon its CD reissue, Rolling Stone magazine's Steve Pond recommended Please Please Me \\"for the Beatles' unfettered joy at making music\\".[43] In 2012, Please Please Me was voted 39th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\".[9] It was ranked first among the Beatles' early albums, and sixth of all of the Beatles' albums, with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Revolver, Rubber Soul, The Beatles (also known as \\"The White Album\\") and Abbey Road ranked higher.\\r\\nRolling Stone also placed two songs from the album on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: No. 140, \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", and No. 186, \\"Please Please Me\\". According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, \\"Decades after its release, the album still sounds fresh\\", the covers are \\"impressive\\" and the originals \\"astonishing\\".[44]\\r\\nIn 2013, the album's 50th anniversary was celebrated by modern artists re-recording the album in just one day, the same time it took the Beatles to record it 50 years earlier. Stereophonics recorded a cover of the album's opening track, \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\".

The story features the adventures of young Charlie Bucket inside the chocolate factory of eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka.\\r\\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory was first published in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. in 1964 and in the United Kingdom by George Allen & Unwin, 11 months later. The book has been adapted into two major motion pictures: Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory in 1971, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in 2005. The book's sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, was written by Roald Dahl in 1971 and published in 1972. Dahl had also planned to write a third book in the series but never finished it.[1]\\r\\nThe story was originally inspired by Roald Dahl's experience of chocolate companies during his schooldays. Cadbury would often send test packages to the schoolchildren in exchange for their opinions on the new products.[2] At that time (around the 1920s), Cadbury and Rowntree's were England's two largest chocolate makers and they each often tried to steal trade secrets by sending spies, posing as employees, into the other's factory. Because of this, both companies became highly protective of their chocolate-making processes. It was a combination of this secrecy and the elaborate, often gigantic, machines in the factory that inspired Dahl to write the story.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n11-year-old Charlie Bucket lives in poverty in a tiny house with his parents and four grandparents. His grandparents share the only bed in the house, located in the only bedroom. Charlie and his parents sleep on a mattress on the floor. One day, Grandpa Joe tells him about the legendary and eccentric chocolatier, Willy Wonka and all the wonderful sweets he made until the other sweetmakers sent in spies to steal his secret recipes, which led him to close the factory forever. The next day, the newspaper announces that Mr Wonka is reopening the factory and has invited five children to come on a tour, after they find a golden ticket in a Wonka Bar. Each ticket find is a media sensation and each finder becomes a celebrity. The first four golden tickets are found by the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the spoiled and petulant Veruca Salt, the gum-addicted Violet Beauregarde, and the TV-obsessed Mike Teavee.\\r\\nOne day, Charlie sees a fifty-pence coin (dollar bill in the US version) buried in the snow. He then buys himself a Wonka Bar and finds the fifth golden ticket. The ticket says he can bring any family members with him to the factory and Charlie's parents decide to allow Grandpa Joe to go with him.\\r\\nAfter meeting Mr Wonka, the kids and their parents go inside where they meet Oompa-Loompas, a race of small people who help Mr Wonka operate the factory since he rescued them from poverty and fear in their home country Loompaland. The other kids are ejected from the factory in comical, mysterious and painful ways - befitting their various greedy characters and personalities. Augustus gets sucked up the pipe after falling into the Chocolate River in the Chocolate Room, Violet blows up into a giant blueberry after sampling an experimental three-course chewing gum meal in the Inventing Room, Veruca is thrown down the rubbish chute in the Nut Room after the nut-testing squirrels consider her a \\"bad nut,\\" and Mike gets shrunk after he tries to be the first person to be sent by television in the Television Room's Television Chocolate Technology. With only Charlie remaining, Mr Wonka congratulates him for \\"winning\\" the factory and, after explaining his true age and the reason behind his golden tickets, names Charlie his successor. They ride the Great Glass Elevator to Charlie's house while the other four children go home (Augustus squeezed thin, Violet all blue in the face, Veruca covered in rubbish, and Mike stretched ten feet tall). Afterwards, Mr Wonka invites Charlie's family to come live with him in the factory, and they do.\\r\\nDahls widow said that Charlie was originally written as 'a little black boy.' Dahls biographer said the change to a white character was driven by Dahls agent, who thought a black Charlie would not appeal to readers.[4][5]\\r\\nIn the first published edition, the Oompa-Loompas were described as African pygmies, and were drawn this way in the original printed edition.[4] After the announcement of a film adaptation sparked a statement from the NAACP expressing concern that the transportation of Oompa-Loompas to Wonka's factory resembled slavery, Dahl found himself sympathizing with the NAACP's concerns and published a revised edition.[4] In this edition, as well as the subsequent sequel, the Oompa-Loompas were drawn as being white and appearing similar to hippies, and the references to Africa were deleted.[4] Dahl later expressed regret over the original version, saying that his original intention of depicting Charlie as a black child was evidence that he was not racist.[4]\\r\\nVarious unused and draft material from Dahl's early versions of the novel have been found. In the initial, unpublished drafts of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory nine golden tickets were distributed to tour Willy Wonka's secret chocolate factory[6] and the children faced more rooms and more temptations to test their self-control.[6][7] Some of the names of the children cut from the final work include:[8]\\r\\n\\"Spotty Powder\\" was first published as a short story in 1973.[12][14] In 2005, The Times reprinted \\"Spotty Powder\\" as a \\"lost\\" chapter, saying it had been found in Dahl's desk, written backwards in mirror writing (the way Leonardo da Vinci wrote his journal).[7][15] This chapter describes Spotty Powder, which looks and tastes like sugar, but causes bright red pox-like spots to appear on faces and necks five seconds after ingestion, so children who eat Spotty Powder do not have to go to school. The spots fade on their own a few hours later. After learning the purpose of Spotty Powder, the humourless, smug Miranda Piker and her equally humourless father (a schoolmaster) are enraged and disappear into the Spotty Powder room to sabotage the machine. Soon after entering, they are heard making what Mrs Piker interpreted as screams. Mr Wonka assures her (after making a brief joke where he claims that headmasters are one of the occasional ingredients) it was only laughter. Exactly what happened to them is not revealed in the extract.[6][7]\\r\\nIn an early draft, sometime after being renamed from Miranda Grope to Miranda Piker but before \\"Spotty Powder\\" was written, she falls down the chocolate waterfall and ends up in the Peanut-Brittle Mixer. This results in the \\"rude and disobedient little kid\\" becoming \\"quite delicious.\\"[12][16] This early draft poem was slightly rewritten as an Oompa-Loompa song in the lost chapter, which now puts her in the \\"Spotty-Powder mixer\\" and instead of being \\"crunchy and ... good [peanut brittle]\\" she is now \\"useful [for truancy] and ... good.\\"[7]\\r\\nIn 2014, The Guardian revealed that Dahl had cut another chapter (\\"The Vanilla Fudge Room\\") from an early draft of the book. The Guardian reported the now-eliminated passage was \\"deemed too wild, subversive and insufficiently moral for the tender minds of British children almost 50 years ago.\\"[6][17] In what was originally chapter five in that version of the book, Charlie goes to the factory with his mother (instead of his grandfather, as originally published). At this point, the chocolate factory tour is down to eight kids,[13][18] including Tommy Troutbeck and Wilbur Rice. After the entire group climbs to the top of the titular fudge mountain, eating vanilla fudge along the way, Troutbeck and Rice decide to take a ride on the wagons carrying away chunks of fudge. The wagons take them directly to The Pounding And Cutting Room, where the fudge is reformed and sliced into small squares for retail sale. Wonka states the machine is equipped with \\"a large wire strainer ... which is used specially for catching children before they fall into the machine\\" adding that \\"It always catches them. At least it always has up to now.\\"[13]\\r\\nThe chapter dates back to an early draft with ten golden tickets, including two for Miranda Grope and Augustus Pottle, who fell into the chocolate river prior to the events of \\"Fudge Mountain\\".[6][19] Augustus Pottle was routed to the Chocolate Fudge Room, not the Vanilla Fudge Room explored in this chapter,[13][18] and Miranda Grope ended up in the Peanut Brittle Room.[12]\\r\\nAlso in 2014, Vanity Fair published a plot summary of \\"The Warming Candy Room\\", wherein three boys eat too many \\"warming candies\\" and end up \\"bursting with heat.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe Warming Candy Room is dominated by a boiler, which heats a scarlet liquid. The liquid is dispensed one drop at a time, where it cools and forms a hard shell, storing the heat and \\"by a magic process ... the hot heat changes into an amazing thing called 'cold heat.'\\" After eating a single warming candy, one could stand naked in the snow comfortably. This is met with predictable disbelief from Clarence Crump, Bertie Upside, and Terence Roper, who proceed to eat at least one hundred warming candies each, resulting in profuse perspiration. The three boys and their families discontinue the tour after they are taken to cool off \\"in the large refrigerator for a few hours.\\"[10]\\r\\nRoald Dahl originally planned for a child called Marvin Prune to be included in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Dahl submitted the excised chapter regarding Marvin Prune to The Horn Book Review in the early 1970s.[21] Rather than publish the chapter, Horn Book responded with a critical essay by novelist Eleanor Cameron, who criticised Dahl's worth as a human being.[22]\\r\\nAlthough it was believed that Horn Book never returned the chapter, Marvin Prune's chapter is actually available, but it has not yet been published.[citation needed] \\"The Children's-Delight Room\\" was reworked into \\"Spotty Powder\\".[citation needed] It is present in two versions. One features the workers from \\"The Vanilla Fudge Room\\" but also include \\"tiny whispery voices\\" who sing the songs after each child's exit, and Charlie with his mother and father. The second version features Grandpa Joe, Charlie's grandfather, who is present in the final book, and the Oompa-Loompas. In the version with the voices, the voices actually sing two songs, a two verse type one found in \\"The Vanilla Fudge Room\\", plus a longer one like the type that is found in the final book.

K. Rowling (author of the Harry Potter books) named Charlie and the Chocolate Factory among her top ten books every child should read.[25]\\r\\nA 2004 study found that it was a common read-aloud book for fourth-graders in schools in San Diego County, California.[26] A 2012 survey by the University of Worcester determined that it was one of the most common books that UK adults had read as children, after Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and The Wind in The Willows.[27]\\r\\nGroups who have praised the book include:\\r\\nIn the 2012 survey published by SLJ, a monthly with primarily US audience, Charlie was the second of four books by Dahl among the so-called Top 100 Chapter Books, one more than any other writer.[32]\\r\\nAlthough the book has always been popular and considered a children's classic by many literary critics, a number of prominent individuals have spoken unfavorably of the novel over the years.[33] Children's novelist and literary historian John Rowe Townsend has described the book as \\"fantasy of an almost literally nauseating kind\\" and accused it of \\"astonishing insensitivity\\" regarding the original portrayal of the Oompa-Loompas as black pygmies, although Dahl did revise this in later editions.[34] Another novelist, Eleanor Cameron, compared the book to the sweets that form its subject matter, commenting that it is \\"delectable and soothing while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare.\\"[22] Ursula K. Le Guin wrote in support of this assessment in a letter to The Horn Book Review, saying that her own daughter would turn \\"quite nasty\\" upon finishing the book.[35] Roald Dahl responded to Cameron's criticisms by noting the classics she had cited would not be well received by contemporary children.[36]\\r\\nThe cover art for Penguin UK's Modern Classics 50th Anniversary Edition of the book, published in September 2014, received criticism as being creepy, irrelevant, and age inappropriate.[37]\\r\\nIn addition to spawning several sequels, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has frequently been adapted for other media, including games, radio, the screen,[38] and stage, most often as plays or musicals for children?√ø often titled Willy Wonka or Willy Wonka, Jr. and almost always featuring musical numbers by all the main characters (Wonka, Charlie, Grandpa Joe, Violet, Veruca, etc.); many of the songs are revised versions from the 1971 film.[citation needed]\\r\\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory has undergone numerous editions and been illustrated by numerous artists.[48]\\r\\nThe cover photo of the 50th anniversary edition, published by Penguin Modern Classics for sale in the UK and aimed at the adult market received widespread commentary and criticism.[49] The cover is a photo of a heavily made up young girl seated on her mother's knee and wearing a doll-like expression, taken by the photographers Sofia Sanchez and Mauro Mongiello as part of a photo shoot for a 2008 fashion article in a French magazine, for a fashion article titled \\"Mommie Dearest.\\"[37][50] In addition to writing that \\"the image seemingly has little to do with the beloved children's classic\\",[51] reviewers and commenters in social media (such as posters on the publisher's Facebook page) have said the art evokes Lolita, Valley of the Dolls, and JonBenet Ramsey; looks like a scene from Toddlers & Tiaras; and is \\"misleading,\\" \\"creepy,\\" \\"sexualized,\\" \\"grotesque,\\" \\"misjudged on every level,\\" \\"distasteful and disrespectful to a gifted author and his work,\\" \\"pretentious,\\" \\"trashy\\", \\"outright inappropriate,\\" \\"terrifying,\\" \\"really obnoxious,\\" and \\"weird & kind of paedophilic.\\"[37][52][53][54]\\r\\nThe publisher explained its objective in a blog post accompanying the announcement about the jacket art: \\"This new image .?.?. looks at the children at the center of the story, and highlights the way Roald Dahls writing manages to embrace both the light and the dark aspects of life.\\"[55] Additionally, Penguin Press's Helen Conford told the Bookseller: \\"We wanted something that spoke about the other qualities in the book,\\" Penguin Press's Helen Conford told the Bookseller. \\"It's a children's story that also steps outside children's and people aren't used to seeing Dahl in that way.\\" She continued: \\"[There is] a lot of ill feeling about it, I think because it's such a treasured book and a book which isn't really a 'crossover book'\\" As she acknowledged: \\"People want it to remain as a children's book.\\"\\r\\nThe New Yorker describes what it calls this \\"strangely but tellingly misbegotten\\" cover design thusly: \\"The image is a photograph, taken from a French fashion shoot, of a glassy-eyed, heavily made-up little girl.

Russia produced 1,303,989 vehicles in 2016, ranking 16th among car-producing nations in 2016, and accounting for 1.4% of the worldwide production.[1] The main local brands are light vehicle producers AvtoVAZ and GAZ, while KamAZ is the leading heavy vehicle producer. Eleven foreign carmakers have production operations or are constructing their plants in Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian Empire had a long history of progress in the development of machinery. As early as in the eighteenth century Ivan I. Polzunov constructed the first two-cylinder steam engine in the world,[2] while Ivan P. Kulibin created a human-powered vehicle that had a flywheel, a brake, a gearbox, and roller bearings.[3] One of the world's first tracked vehicles was invented by Fyodor A. Blinov in 1877.[4] In 1896, the Yakovlev engine factory and the Freze carriage-manufacturing workshop manufactured the first Russian petrol-engine automobile, the Yakovlev & Freze.[5]\\r\\nThe turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was marked by the invention of the earliest Russian electrocar, nicknamed the Cuckoo, which was created by the engineer Hippolyte V. Romanov in 1899. Romanov also constructed a battery-electric omnibus.[6] In the years preceding the 1917 October Revolution, Russia produced a growing number of Russo-Balt, Puzyryov, Lessner, and other vehicles, held its first motor show in 1907[7] and had car enthusiasts who successfully participated in international motor racing. A Russo-Balt car placed 9th in the Monte Carlo Rally of 1912, despite the extreme winter conditions that threatened the lives of the driver and riding mechanic on their way from Saint Petersburg,[8] 2nd in the San Sebastin Rally and covered more than 15,000?km in Western Europe and Northern Africa in 1913. The driver of the car, Andrei P. Nagel, was personally awarded by Emperor Nicholas II for increasing the prestige of the domestic car brand.[9]\\r\\nBy 1915, about 1,000 motor vehicles had been built in Russia.[10] Imported vehicles vastly exceeded domestic production, with the latter accounting for less than 10% of total stock by 1914.[10]\\r\\nIn February 1916 the Tsarist government allocated funds for the construction of six automotive plants: AMO in Moscow, Russo-Balt in the village of Fili, the State Plant of Military Self-Propelled Vehicles (KZVS) in Mytishchi, Russian Renault in Rybinsk, Aksai in Nakhichevan-on-Don, and Lebedev in Yaroslavl. None of the plants were completed before the October Revolution.[11]\\r\\nAfter the 1917 October Revolution, Russo-Balt was nationalised on August 15, 1918, and renamed to Prombron by the new leadership. It continued the production of Russo-Balt cars and launched a new model on October 8, 1922, while AMO built FIAT 15 Ter trucks under licence and released a more modern FIAT-derived truck developed by a team of AMO designers, the AMO-F-15. About 6,000√ø6,500 F-15s were built in the years 1924√ø1931.[12][13]\\r\\nIn 1927, engineers from the Scientific Automobile & Motor Institute (NAMI) created the first original Soviet car NAMI-I, which was produced in small numbers by the Spartak State Automobile Factory in Moscow, between 1927 and 1931.[14] In 1929, due to a rapidly growing demand for automobiles and in cooperation with its trade partner, the Ford Motor Company, the Supreme Soviet of the National Economy established GAZ.[15][16] A year later, a second automobile plant was founded in Moscow, which would become a major Soviet car maker after World War II and earn nationwide fame under the name Moskvitch.\\r\\nThe beginning of the 1960s saw the release of the Moskvitch 408, intended to be an economy car that would spread the use of cars among the population.[17] Other manufacturers such as MZMA, GAZ and ZAZ were offering a variety of cars intended for the mass market. The Soviet government opted to build an even larger car manufacturing plant that would produce a people's car and help to meet the demand for personal transport.[18] For reasons of cost-efficiency, it was decided to produce the car on the basis of an existing, modern foreign model. After considering several options, the Fiat 124 was chosen because of its simple and sturdy design, being easy to manufacture and repair.\\r\\nThe plant was built in just 4 years (1966√ø1970) in the small town of Stavropol Volzhsky, which later grew to a population of more than half a million and was renamed Togliatti to commemorate Palmiro Togliatti.[18][19] At the same time, the Izhmash car plant was established in the city of Izhevsk as part of the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant, with the initiative coming from the Minister of Defence[20] and in order to increase the overall production of cars in the Soviet Union. It produced Moskvitchs and Moskvitch-based kombi hatchbacks. KaMAZ, Europe's largest heavy truck plant, was built in Naberezhnye Chelny, while GAZ, ZIL, UralAZ, KrAZ, MAZ, BelAZ, and plants continued to produce other types of trucks.\\r\\nBy the early 1980s, Soviet automobile industry consisted of several main plants, which produced vehicles for various market segments. In late 1987, the industry produced 2 million cars, satisfying 45% of the domestic demand.[21]\\r\\nIn the early 1990s the Russian car market expanded dramatically, largely due to a drastic cut on import duties, so that by 1993 foreign-made imported cars made up 49% of all sales.[22] At the same time, Russian automakers were integrated into a market economy and immediately hit by a crisis due to the loss of financial support, economic turmoil, criminal activities[23][24][25] and stiffer competition in the domestic market during the 1990s.\\r\\nThe main domestic manufacturers in the early 1990s were AvtoVAZ, AZLK, IzhAvto, GAZ and UAZ.[26] Some of them, like AvtoVAZ, turned to cooperation with other companies (such as GM-AvtoVAZ) in order to obtain substantial capital investment and overcome the crisis.[27]\\r\\nBy 1993, total output was down 14% compared to 1990 levels. Lada's declining sales during the 1990s, and toughening European Union emissions requirements, saw exports to Western Europe discontinued by the end of the decade. Lada had enjoyed particularly strong sales in Britain, peaking at more than 30,000 sales a year in the late 1980s, but had failed to remain competitive with other budget brands over the subsequent few years.\\r\\n850,000 cars were sold in 1996.[28] As demand kept rising, local brands continued to be affected by a reputation for poor manufacturing quality. In was estimated in 1996 that a newly bought AvtoVAZ car needed $1-2,000 worth of repairs to bring it to a comfortable level of safety.[28]\\r\\nThe 1998 Russian financial crisis affected the industry, as car manufacturers stopped using imported components because of higher import prices. Nevertheless, the industry quickly recovered in subsequent years.[29]\\r\\nIn 1997, car production increased by 13.2% in comparison with 1996 and achieved 981,000. AvtoVAZ and UAZ extended their output by 8.8 and 52 percent respectively, whereas KamAZ doubled it. The overall truck production in Russia increased by 7 percent, reaching 148,000 in 1997[30] and 184,000 in 2000.[31] The overall production of cars rose from about 800,000 in 1993 to more than 1.16 million in 2000,[32] or 965,000[33] (969,235 according to OICA[34]) excluding commercial vehicles.\\r\\nThroughout the 1990s, the unavailability of dealer financing meant that cars had to be purchased in cash.[22]\\r\\nIn the early 2000s, the Russian economy recovered. Russian metal companies, having achieved significant profits on foreign markets, sought to invest in Russia's automotive sector.[35] Siberian Aluminum initially bought Pavlovo Bus Factory and accumulated increasing ownership stakes in GAZ. At the same time, Severstal gained control of UAZ.[35]\\r\\nIn 2001 Ford became the first western manufacturer to establish its own assembly plant in Russia, investing $150 million in their Vsevolozhsk factory, manufacturing the Ford Focus, which briefly became the best-selling foreign-branded car in Russia.[36]\\r\\nIn 2003 Russian manufacturers still accounted for over 90% of car production in Russia, either under their own brand or in partnership with a foreign company. The six main automotive groups were AvtoVAZ, SOK Group, Kamaz, RusPromAvto, SeverstalAvto and AZLK.[37] Just 11,000 cars were locally assembled by foreign manufacturers in 2002.[38]\\r\\nMacroeconomic trends were strong and growing incomes of the population led to a surging demand, and by 2005 the Russian car market was booming. In 2005, 1,446,525 new cars were sold, including 832,200 Russian models and 614,325 foreign ones.\\r\\nDuring the first quarter of 2005, foreign-branded cars outsold local ones for the first time in Russian history (including used imports).[36] Foreign companies started to massively invest in production in Russia: the number of foreign cars produced in the Russian Federation surged from 157,179 in 2005 to 456,500 in 2007.[39] To keep up with the competition, local brands launched more modern-looking models, such as Lada Kalina.[36]\\r\\nThe value of the Russian market grew at a brisk pace: 14% in 2005, 36% in 2006 and 67% in 2007making it the world's fastest growing automotive market by 2008.[40] Foreign companies started flocking to enter Russia in the 2000s, seeing it as a local production location and export powerhouse. Russia's labour, material and energy costs were only 1/6 compared to those in Western Europe.[41][42]\\r\\nTo boost the market share of locally produced vehicles, the Russian government implemented several protectionist measures and launched programs to attract foreign producers into the country. In late 2005, the Russian leadership enacted legislation to create special economic zones (SEZ) with the aim of encouraging investments by foreign automotive companies. The benefits of operating in the special economic zones include tax allowances, exemption from asset and land taxes and protection against changes in the tax regime. Some regions also provide extensive support for large investors (over $100?million.) These include Saint Petersburg/Leningrad Oblast (Toyota, GM, Nissan) and Kaluga Oblast (VW). Kaluga has been especially successful in attracting foreign companies, as has been Kaliningrad Oblast.[40]\\r\\nRussia's automotive industry was hit hard by the late 2000s recession. Production of passenger cars dropped from 1,470,000 units in 2008 to just 597,000 units in 2009. Lorry production fell from 256,000 to 91,000 in the same period.[43]\\r\\nIn late 2008, the Russian government introduced protectionist measures, worth $5?billion, to improve the situation in the industry. This included $2?billion of bailouts for troubled companies and $3?billion of credits for buyers of Russian cars.[44] Prime minister Vladimir Putin described the move as vital in order to save jobs.[45] The tariffs for imported foreign cars and trucks were increased to a minimum of 50% and go up to 100%. The tariffs are linked to the engine size of the vehicle. The increased duties led to protests in Russian cities, most notably in Vladivostok, where the importation of Japanese cars is an important sector of the city's economy.[46] To compensate for the losses of the Vladivostok businesses, Prime Minister Putin ordered the car manufacturing company Sollers to move one of its factories from Moscow to Vladivostok. The move was completed in 2009, and the factory now employs about 700 locals. It was planned to produce 13,200 cars in Vladivostok in 2010.[47]\\r\\nThe most efficient anti-crisis measure executed by the Russian government was the introduction of a car scrappage scheme in March 2010. Under the scheme, buyers of new cars could receive a subsidy of up to 600,000 rubles (20,000 USD).[48] Sales of Russia's largest carmaker Avtovaz doubled in the second quarter of 2010 as a result, and the company returned to profit.[49][50]\\r\\nBy the end of 2010, automotive production had returned to pre-crisis levels.[51][52] Nine out of the ten most sold models in Russia in 2010 were domestically produced, with Avtovaz's Lada models topping the list.[51] In the first 7 months of 2010, sales of Lada cars increased by 60%, the Korean KIA reported a jump of 101%, and Chevrolet's sales rose by 15%.[53]\\r\\nIn 2010, Russia was the world's 15th largest producer of cars. The Russian automotive industry currently (as of 2010) accounts for about 2% of worldwide car production.[54]\\r\\nThe market share of Russian-branded vehicles fell to 34% in 2010 and to 21% in 2012. At the same time, the market share of foreign-branded cars made in Russia kept rising, reaching 45% in 2012.[55] Imported vehicles account for a sizable portion of the Russian automotive market: in 2014 they made up 27% of cars and 46% of trucks.[56]\\r\\nThe 2014 economic crisis led to a new fall in car sales and production levels, and reduced forecasts for future growth.[57]\\r\\nThe number of cars on Russian roads reached 40,629,200 in 2016. Lada cars accounted for 34.6% of the total,[58] down from 41.6% five years earlier.[59] Almost half of those cars were over ten years old, and the single most popular car model was still the classic Lada Riva.[58]\\r\\nThe Russian automotive industry can be divided into four types of companies: local brand producers, foreign OEMs, joint ventures and Russian companies producing foreign brands.[60] In 2008, there were 5,445 companies manufacturing vehicles and related equipment in Russia. The volume of production and sales amounted to 1,513?billion rubles.[43]\\r\\nCars with diesel engines are not popular in Russia, accounting for just 7.6% of all sales as of 2015, compared to half of the market in much of Western Europe.[61] There are 145,000 natural gas vehicles in Russia as of 2016, or 0.3% of all vehicles in the country.[62] The sale of leaded gasoline was outlawed in 2003.[63]\\r\\nThe four most popular cars in Russia in 2009 were all AvtoVAZ models. The economy car Lada Priora topped the list with 84,779 sold units. Lada Samara was second with 77,679 units sold in Russia, and the classic Lada 2105/2107 was third with sales of 57,499. Lada 2105 was expected to considerably increase sales following the car scrappage scheme launched in March 2010. The higher-end Lada Kalina was the fourth most sold car in Russia in 2009, selling 52,499 units that year.[64]\\r\\nIn the light commercial vehicle sector, the GAZelle van, manufactured by GAZ has been very popular, occupying a market share of 49% in 2009 and selling 42,400 units. The Avtoperevozchik magazine declared GAZelle as the most successful vehicle of 2009 in the Russian automotive market.[65]\\r\\nThe largest company of Russia's automotive industry is Avtovaz, located in the city of Tolyatti. It currently employs more than 130,000 people, and its Lada models dominate the Russian car market. Avtovaz models account for about 50% of Russia's total car production.[48]\\r\\nRussian car manufacturing companies are represented by two associations, ASM-Holding (-Ò∂∂≥“∑) and the Association of Russian Automakers (◊•“∑“øÏºº ÷æ“æ≈§—æ“Ω÷æ“øÏ∂∂Ï≥≠ Àæ).[66]\\r\\nRussia's second largest car manufacturer is Avtotor, located in Kaliningrad Oblast. Avtotor performs SKD, CKD or full-cycle assembly of foreign models, such as BMW, Kia, and General Motors' Cadillac and Chevrolet vehicles. In 2009, Avtotor produced 60,000 cars and accounted for 10% of Russian car production.[48]\\r\\nAvtoframos, the third largest car manufacturer, produced 49,500 cars in 2009. Its plant is located in the south-east part of the city of Moscow. Avtoframos is a joint venture between France's Renault and the Moscow city administration, but is majority owned by Renault.[48] The company manufactures Renault Logan and Renault Sandero models. The ratio of Russian-made parts is 54%. The figure was expected to rise to 74% by 2012.[67]\\r\\nThe fourth and fifth largest carmakers in Russia are Volkswagen and Ford, respectively. In total, the five largest companies of the industry account for 80% of all cars made in Russia.[48] In 2016, Hyundai Solaris became the first foreign-branded car to be the best-selling vehicle in the country since sales statistics began in 1970.[68]\\r\\nIn the heavy vehicle sector, the largest company is the truckmaker KaMAZ. It is also one of the largest companies in the whole Russian automotive industry. In 2010, KaMAZ sold a total of 32,293 trucks; 28,254 in Russia and 4,039 in foreign countries.[69]\\r\\nAnother very important company is GAZ, which makes vans, trucks and busses, among other products. Its most popular product is the GAZelle van, which has a market share of 49% in the light commercial vehicle market. In 2009, the company launched an improved version, called GAZelle Business.\\r\\nIn the bus sector, the GAZ Group Bus Division occupied a market share of 77%. In 2009 it sold 6,169 buses in the small-class, 1,806 in the medium class and 1,156 in the large class.[65]\\r\\nRussia's largest tractor maker, and one of the largest machine building companies in the world, is Concern Tractor Plants, located in Cheboksary. The company employs around 45,000 people.\\r\\nThe Marussia brand, produced by Marussia Motors, became the first modern sports car and the first supercar produced in Russia. The Marussia B1 was launched on 16 December 2008 in the New Manezh Hall in Moscow. On 10 September 2010 the first Marussia Motors show room opened in Moscow.[70] Marussia Motors was led by Nikolay Fomenko, a notable Russian showman, singer, actor and racer. His company acquired a 'significant stake' in the Virgin Racing Formula One team, which was renamed Marussia Virgin Racing from 2011.[71] This team is to become the first ever Russian-owned team in Formula One. Marussia Motors declared bankruptcy and ceased both support for their F1 team[72] and overall trading in 2014.\\r\\nAnother short-lived project was the Yo-mobile, a city car that could burn both gasoline and natural gas and was connected to a pair of electric motors. The car was introduced on 13 December 2010 in Moscow, a product of a joint venture between Yarovit, a producer of trucks based in St. Petersburg, Russia and the Onexim investment group, headed by Mikhail Prokhorov, who was the leader and financier of the project.[73][74] In 2014 the entire project was sold to the Russian government for a nominal sum, thus signalling the abandonment of the idea.[75] No actual vehicles other than a few concept cars were ever produced.\\r\\nRussia's automotive industry is a significant economic sector. It directly employs 600,000 people and supports around 2√ø3?million people in related industries.[52] It is politically a very important part of the country's economy: firstly, due to the large number of employed people and secondly, because many citizens depend on the social services provided by automotive companies. For example, the well-being of the giant AvtoVAZ factory in Tolyatti is massively important to the city or to the region of Samara Oblast.[76] Tolyatti is a typical monotown, a city whose economy is dependent on a single company. The factory employed around 100,000 people of the city's population of 700,000 in 2009.[77]\\r\\nIn 2009, former President Dmitry Medvedev launched the Medvedev modernisation programme, which aims to diversify Russia's raw materials and energy-dominated economy, turning it into a modern high-tech economy based on innovation. Following this, Russia's automotive industry has been in the spotlight due to its great potential for modernisation.\\r\\nFormer Prime Minister and current President Vladimir Putin has taken a personal interest in the automotive industry. In a symbolic gesture of support, Putin made a highly publicized road trip on the new Amur Highway in August 2010, driving 2,165 kilometers in a Lada Kalina Sport.[78] Putin described the car as \\"excellent, even beyond my expectations\\", and praised it as \\"comfortable\\" and \\"almost noise-free.\\"[79] The event was intended to show support for AvtoVAZ, which was recovering from the serious economic crisis.[80]\\r\\nTop ten manufacturers and car models on the Russian market according to AEB sales figures for 2016:[81]","input":"What is the most popular car in russia?"},{"output":"AD 1040","context":"Movable type (US English; moveable type in British English) is the system and technology of printing and typography that uses movable components to reproduce the elements of a document (usually individual letters or punctuation) usually on the medium of paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world's first movable type printing press technology for printing paper books was made of porcelain materials and was invented around AD 1040 in China during the Northern Song Dynasty by the inventor Bi Sheng (990√ø1051).[1] Subsequently in 1377, the world's oldest extant movable metal print book, Jikji, was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty. Because of this, the diffusion of both movable-type systems was, to some degree, limited to primarily East Asia, although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries, traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe. Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others.[2] Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg introduced the metal movable-type printing press in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould. The small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor.[3] Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimonyand these materials remained standard for 550 years.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor alphabetic scripts, movable-type page setting was quicker than woodblock printing. The metal type pieces were more durable and the lettering was more uniform, leading to typography and fonts. The high quality and relatively low price of the Gutenberg Bible (1455) established the superiority of movable type in Europe and the use of printing presses spread rapidly. The printing press may be regarded as one of the key factors fostering the Renaissance[5] and due to its effectiveness, its use spread around the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 19th-century invention of hot metal typesetting and its successors caused movable type to decline in the 20th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe technique of imprinting multiple copies of symbols or glyphs with a master type punch made of hard metal first developed around 3000 BC in ancient Sumer. These metal punch types can be seen as precursors of the letter punches adapted in later millennia to printing with movable metal type. Cylinder seals were used in Mesopotamia to create an impression on a surface by rolling the seal on wet clay.[6] They were used to \\"sign\\" documents and mark objects as the owner's property. Cylinder seals were a related form of early typography capable of printing small page designs in relief (cameo) on wax or claya miniature forerunner of rotogravure printing used by wealthy individuals to seal and certify documents. By 650 BC the ancient Greeks were using larger diameter punches to imprint small page images onto coins and tokens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe designs of the artists who made the first coin punches were stylized with a degree of skill that could not be mistaken for common handiworksalient and very specific types designed to be reproduced ad infinitum. Unlike the first typefaces used to print books in the 13th century, coin types were neither combined nor printed with ink on paper, but \\"published\\" in metala more durable mediumand survived in substantial numbers. As the portable face of ruling authority, coins were a compact form of standardized knowledge issued in large editions, an early mass medium that stabilized trade and civilization throughout the Mediterranean world of antiquity.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeals and stamps may have been precursors to movable type. The uneven spacing of the impressions on brick stamps found in the Mesopotamian cities of Uruk and Larsa, dating from the 2nd millennium BC, has been conjectured by some archaeologists as evidence that the stamps were made using movable type.[7] The enigmatic Minoan Phaistos Disc of 1800√ø1600 BC has been considered by one scholar as an early example of a body of text being reproduced with reusable characters: it may have been produced by pressing pre-formed hieroglyphic \\"seals\\" into the soft clay. A few authors even view the disc as technically meeting all definitional criteria to represent an early incidence of movable-type printing.[8][9] Recently it has been alleged by Jerome Eisenberg that the disk is a forgery.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prfening dedicatory inscription is medieval example of movable type stamps being used.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the invention of paper in the 2nd century AD during the Chinese Han Dynasty, writing materials became more portable and economical than the bones, shells, bamboo slips, metal or stone tablets, silk, etc. previously used. Yet copying books by hand was still labour-consuming. Not until the Xiping Era (172√ø178 AD), towards the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty did sealing print and monotype appear. It was soon used for printing designs on fabrics, and later for printing texts.\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodblock printing, invented by about the 8th century during the Tang Dynasty, worked as follows. First, the neat hand-copied script was stuck on a relatively thick and smooth board, with the front of the paper, which was so thin that it was nearly transparent, sticking to the board, and characters showing in reverse, but distinctly, so that every stroke could be easily recognized. Then carvers cut away the parts of the board that were not part of the character, so that the characters were cut in relief, completely differently from those cut intaglio. When printing, the bulging characters would have some ink spread on them and be covered by paper. With workers' hands moving on the back of paper gently, characters would be printed on the paper. By the Song Dynasty, woodblock printing came to its heyday. Although woodblock printing played an influential role in spreading culture, there remained some apparent drawbacks. Firstly, carving the printing plate required considerable time, labour and materials; secondly, it was not convenient to store these plates; and finally, it was difficult to correct mistakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith woodblock printing, one printing plate could be used for tens of hundreds of books, playing a magnificent role in spreading culture. Yet carving the plate was time and labour consuming. Huge books cost years of effort. The plates needed a lot of storage space, and were often damaged by deformation, worms and corrosion. If books had a small print run, and were not reprinted, the printing plates would become nothing but waste; and worse, if a mistake was found, it was difficult to correct it without discarding the whole plate.\\r\\n\\r\\nBi Sheng (?N/??N) (990√ø1051) developed the first known movable-type system for printing in China around 1040 AD during the Northern Song dynasty, using ceramic materials.[11][12] As described by the Chinese scholar Shen Kuo (\`) (1031√ø1095):\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor each character there were several types, and for certain common characters there were twenty or more types each, in order to be prepared for the repetition of characters on the same page. When the characters were not in use he had them arranged with paper labels, one label for each rhyme-group, and kept them in wooden cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1193, Zhou Bida, an officer of Southern Song Dynasty, made a set of clay movable-type method according to the method described by Shen Kuo in his Dream Pool Essays, and printed his book Notes of The Jade Hall (ﬁî—ô?).[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe claim that Bi Sheng's clay types were \\"fragile\\" and \\"not practical for large-scale printing\\" and \\"short lived\\"[14] was refuted by facts and experiments. Bao Shicheng (1775√ø1885) wrote that baked clay moveable type was \\"as hard and tough as horn\\"; experiments show that clay type, after being baked in an oven, becomes hard and difficult to break, such that it remains intact after being dropped from a height of two metres onto a marble floor. The length of clay movable types in China was 1 to 2 centimetres, not 2mm, thus hard as horn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has been an ongoing debate regarding the success of ceramic printing technology as there have been no printed materials found with ceramic movable types. However, it is historically recorded to have been used as late as 1844 in China from the Song dynasty through the Qing dynasty.[13][15]:22\\r\\n\\r\\nBi Sheng (990√ø1051) also pioneered the use of wooden movable type around 1040 AD, as described by the Chinese scholar Shen Kuo (1031√ø1095). However, this technology was abandoned in favour of clay movable types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.[11][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1298, Wang Zhen (t_/t?), a Yuan dynasty governmental official of Jingde County, Anhui Province, China, re-invented a method of making movable wooden types. He made more than 30,000 wooden movable types and printed 100 copies of Records of Jingde County (C∆≥), a book of more than 60,000 Chinese characters. Soon afterwards, he summarized his invention in his book A method of making moveable wooden types for printing books. Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down, and the types could only be replaced by carving new pieces. This system was later enhanced by pressing wooden blocks into sand and casting metal types from the depression in copper, bronze, iron or tin. This new method overcame many of the shortcomings of woodblock printing. Rather than manually carving an individual block to print a single page, movable type printing allowed for the quick assembly of a page of text. Furthermore, these new, more compact type fonts could be reused and stored.[11][12] The set of wafer-like metal stamp types could be assembled to form pages, inked, and page impressions taken from rubbings on cloth or paper.[12] In 1322a Fenghua county officer Ma Chengde (C) in Zhejiang, made 100,000 wooded movable types and printed the 43-volume Daxue Yanyi (?Wƒë). Wooden movable types were used continually in China. Even as late as 1733, a 2300-volume Wuying Palace Collected Gems Edition (K◊ìÔú∞??w?) was printed with 253,500 wooden movable types on order of the Yongzheng Emperor, and completed in one year.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of books printed in Tangut script during the Western Xia (1038√ø1227) period are known, of which the Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union that was discovered in the ruins of Baisigou Square Pagoda in 1991 is believed to have been printed sometime during the reign of Emperor Renzong of Western Xia (1139√ø1193).[17] It is considered by many Chinese experts to be the earliest extant example of a book printed using wooden movable type.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe logistical problems of handling the several thousand logographs (required for full literacy in Chinese language) posed a particular difficulty. It was faster to carve one woodblock per page than to composit a page from so many different types. However, if one used movable type to produce multiple copies of the same document, the speed of printing would increase relatively.[11]:201\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least 13 material finds in China indicate the invention of bronze movable type printing in China no later than the 12th century,[19] with the country producing large-scale bronze-plate-printed paper money and formal official documents issued by the Jin (1115√ø1234) and Southern Song (1127√ø1279) dynasties with embedded bronze metal types for anti-counterfeit markers. Such paper-money printing might date back to the 11th-century jiaozi of Northern Song (960√ø1127).[15]:41√ø54\\r\\n\\r\\nThe typical example of this kind of bronze movable type embedded copper-block printing is a printed \\"check\\" of the Jin Dynasty with two square holes for embedding two bronze movable-type characters, each selected from 1,000 different characters, such that each printed paper note has a different combination of markers. A copper-block printed note dated between 1215√ø1216 in the collection of Luo Zhenyu's Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties, 1914, shows two special characters √ø one called Ziliao, the other called Zihao √ø for the purpose of preventing counterfeiting; over the Ziliao there is a small character (?) printed with movable copper type, while over the Zihao there is an empty square hole √ø apparently the associated copper metal type was lost. Another sample of Song dynasty money of the same period in the collection of the Shanghai Museum has two empty square holes above Ziliao as well as Zihou, due to the loss of the two copper movable types. Song dynasty bronze block embedded with bronze metal movable type printed paper money was issued on a large scale and remained in circulation for a long time.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1298 book Zao Huozi Yinshufa (Cd/C?\`?) by the Yuan dynasty (1271√ø1368) official Wang Zhen mentions tin movable type, used probably since the Southern Song dynasty (1127√ø1279), but this was largely experimental.[21] It was unsatisfactory due to its incompatibility with the inking process.[11]:217\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Mongol Empire (1206√ø1405), printing using movable type spread from China to Central Asia.[clarification needed] The Uyghurs of Central Asia used movable type, their script type adopted from the Mongol language, some with Chinese words printed between the pages √ø strong evidence that the books were printed in China.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Ming Dynasty (1368√ø1644), Hua Sui in 1490 used bronze type in printing books.[11]:212 In 1574 the massive 1000-volume encyclopedia Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era (QLM/QL…°) was printed with bronze movable type.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1725 the Qing Dynasty government made 250,000 bronze movable-type characters and printed 64 sets of the encyclopedic Gujin Tushu Jicheng (Ã§Zdƒ¶/Ã§?D?ÃÇÿö?, Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times). Each set consisted of 5,040 volumes, making a total of 322,560 volumes printed using movable type.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1234 the first books known to have been printed in metallic type set were published in Goryeo Dynasty Korea. They form a set of ritual books, Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun, compiled by Choe Yun-ui. \\r\\n[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile these books have not survived, the oldest book in the world printed in metallic movable types is Jikji, printed in Korea in 1377.[25]\\r\\nThe Asian Reading Room of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. displays examples of this metal type.[26] \\r\\nCommenting on the invention of metallic types by Koreans, French scholar Henri-Jean Martin described this as \\"[extremely similar] to Gutenberg's\\".[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe techniques for bronze casting, used at the time for making coins (as well as bells and statues) were adapted to making metal type. The Joseon dynasty scholar Seong Hyeon (??, ?], 1439√ø1504) records the following description of the Korean font-casting process:\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first, one cuts letters in beech wood. One fills a trough level with fine sandy [clay] of the reed-growing seashore. Wood-cut letters are pressed into the sand, then the impressions become negative and form letters [moulds]. At this step, placing one trough together with another, one pours the molten bronze down into an opening. The fluid flows in, filling these negative moulds, one by one becoming type. Lastly, one scrapes and files off the irregularities, and piles them up to be arranged.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nA potential solution to the linguistic and cultural bottleneck that held back movable type in Korea for 200 years appeared in the early 15th centurya generation before Gutenberg would begin working on his own movable-type invention in Europewhen Sejong the Great devised a simplified alphabet of 24 characters (hangul) for use by the common people, which could have made the typecasting and compositing process more feasible. But Korea's cultural elite, \\"appalled at the idea of losing hanja, the badge of their elitism\\", stifled the adoption of the new alphabet.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nA \\"Confucian prohibition on the commercialization of printing\\" also obstructed the proliferation of movable type, restricting the distribution of books produced using the new method to the government.[28] The technique was restricted to use by the royal foundry for official state publications only, where the focus was on reprinting Chinese classics lost in 1126 when Korea's libraries and palaces had perished in a conflict between dynasties.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nScholarly debate and speculation has occurred as to whether Eastern movable type spread to Europe between the late 14th century and early 15th centuries.[23][29]:58√ø69[30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohannes Gutenberg of Mainz, Germany is acknowledged as the first to invent a metal movable-type printing system in Europe, the printing press. Gutenberg was a goldsmith familiar with techniques of cutting punches for making coins from moulds. Between 1436 and 1450 he developed hardware and techniques for casting letters from matrices using a device called the hand mould.[29] Gutenberg's key invention and contribution to movable-type printing in Europe, the hand mould, was the first practical means of making cheap copies of letterpunches in the vast quantities needed to print complete books, making the movable-type printing process a viable enterprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Gutenberg, books were copied out by hand on scrolls and paper, or printed from hand-carved wooden blocks. It was extremely time-consuming; even a small book could take months to complete, and because the carved letters or blocks were flimsy and the wood susceptible to ink the blocks had a limited lifespan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGutenberg and his associates developed oil-based inks ideally suited to printing with a press on paper, and the first Latin typefaces. His method of casting type may have been different from the hand mould used in subsequent decades. Detailed analysis of the type used in his 42-line Bible has revealed irregularities in some of the characters that cannot be attributed to ink spread or type wear under the pressure of the press. Scholars conjecture that the type pieces may have been cast from a series of matrices made with a series of individual stroke punches, producing many different versions of the same glyph.\\r\\n[34] It has also been suggested that the method used by Gutenberg involved using a single punch to make a mould, but the mould was such that the process of taking the type out disturbed the casting, creating variants and anomalies, and that the punch-matrix system came into use possibly around the 1470s.[35]\\r\\nThis raises the possibility that the development of movable type in the West may have been progressive rather than a single innovation.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nGutenberg's movable-type printing system spread rapidly across Europe, from the single Mainz printing press in 1457 to 110 presses by 1480, of which 50 were in Italy. Venice quickly became the center of typographic and printing activity. Significant were the contributions of Nicolas Jenson, Francesco Griffo, Aldus Manutius, and other printers of late 15th-century Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nType-founding as practiced in Europe and the west consists of three stages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe type-height was quite different in different countries. The Monotype Corporation Limited in London UK produced moulds in various heights:\\r\\n\\r\\nA Dutch printers manual mentions a tiny difference between French and German Height:[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nTiny differences in type-height will cause quite bold images of characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the 19th century there were only two typefoundries left in the Netherlands: Johan Ensched & Zonen, at Haarlem, and Lettergieterij Amsterdam, voorheen Tetterode. They both had their own type-height: Ensched: 65 23/24 points Didot, and Amsterdam: 66 1/24 points Didot. Enough difference to prevent a combined use of fonts of both typefoundries: Enschede would be to light, or otherwise the Amsterdam-font would print rather bold. A perfect way of binding clients.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1905 the Dutch governmental \\"Algemeene Landsdrukkerij\\", later: \\"State-printery\\" (Staatsdrukkerij) decided during a reorganisation to use a standard type-height of 63 points Didot. \\"Staatdrukkerij-hoogte\\", actually Belgium-height, but this fact was not widely known.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern, factory-produced movable type was available in the late 19th century. It was held in the printing shop in a job case, a drawer about 2?inches high, a yard wide, and about two feet deep, with many small compartments for the various letters and ligatures. The most popular and accepted of the job case designs in America was the California Job Case, which took its name from the Pacific coast location of the foundries that made the case popular.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally, the capital letters were stored in a separate drawer or case that was located above the case that held the other letters; this is why capital letters are called \\"upper case\\" characters while the non-capitals are \\"lower case\\".[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nCompartments also held spacers, which are blocks of blank type used to separate words and fill out a line of type, such as em and en quads (quadrats, or spaces. A quadrat is a block of type whose face is lower than the printing letters so that it does not itself print.). An em space was the width of a capital letter \\"M\\" √ø as wide as it was high √ø while an en space referred to a space half the width of its height (usually the dimensions for a capital \\"N\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual letters are assembled into words and lines of text with the aid of a composing stick, and the whole assembly is tightly bound together to make up a page image called a forme, where all letter faces are exactly the same height to form a flat surface of type. The forme is mounted on a printing press, a thin coating of viscous ink is applied and impressions made on paper under great pressure in the press. \\"Sorts\\" is the term given to special characters not freely available in the typical type case, such as the \\"@\\" mark.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes it is erroneously stated that printing with metal type replaced the earlier methods. In the industrial era printing methods would be chosen to suit the purpose. For example, when printing large scale letters in posters etc. the metal type would have proved too heavy and economically unviable. Thus, large scale type was made as carved wood blocks as well as ceramics plates.[42] Also in many cases where large scale text was required, it was simpler to hand the job to a sign painter than a printer.\\r\\nImages could be printed together with movable type if they were made as woodcuts or wood engravings as long as the blocks were made to the same type height. If intaglio methods, such as copper plates, were used for the images, then images and the text would have required separate print runs on different machines.","input":"When was the movable type printing technique invented?"},{"output":"endothelial cells","context":"The blood√øbrain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective semipermeable membrane barrier that separates the circulating blood from the brain and extracellular fluid in the central nervous system (CNS). The blood√øbrain barrier is formed by brain endothelial cells and it allows the passage of water, some gases, and lipid-soluble molecules by passive diffusion, as well as the selective transport of molecules such as glucose and amino acids that are crucial to neural function. Furthermore, it prevents the entry of lipophilic potential neurotoxins by way of an active transport mechanism mediated by P-glycoprotein. Astrocytes have been claimed to be necessary to create the blood√øbrain barrier. A few regions in the brain, including the circumventricular organs, do not have a blood√øbrain barrier.\\r\\nThe blood√øbrain barrier occurs along all capillaries and consists of tight junctions around the capillaries that do not exist in normal circulation.[1] Endothelial cells restrict the diffusion of microscopic objects (e.g., bacteria) and large or hydrophilic molecules into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), while allowing the diffusion of hydrophobic molecules (O2, CO2, hormones).[2] Cells of the barrier actively transport metabolic products such as glucose across the barrier with specific proteins.[3] This barrier also includes a thick basement membrane and astrocytic endfeet.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis \\"barrier\\" results from the selectivity of the tight junctions between endothelial cells in CNS vessels, which restricts the passage of solutes.[5] At the interface between blood and the brain, endothelial cells are stitched together by these tight junctions, which are composed of smaller subunits, frequently biochemical dimers, that are transmembrane proteins such as occludin, claudins, junctional adhesion molecule (JAM), or ESAM, for example.[3] Each of these transmembrane proteins is anchored into the endothelial cells by another protein complex that includes ZO-1 and associated proteins.[3]\\r\\nThe blood√øbrain barrier is composed of high-density cells restricting passage of substances from the bloodstream much more than do the endothelial cells in capillaries elsewhere in the body.[citation needed] Astrocyte cell projections called astrocytic feet (also known as \\"glia limitans\\") surround the endothelial cells of the BBB, providing biochemical support to those cells.[6] The BBB is distinct from the quite similar blood√øcerebrospinal fluid barrier, which is a function of the choroidal cells of the choroid plexus, and from the blood√øretinal barrier, which can be considered a part of the whole realm of such barriers.[7]\\r\\nSeveral areas of the human brain are not on the brain side of the BBB. Some examples of this include the circumventricular organs, the roof of the third and fourth ventricles, capillaries in the pineal gland on the roof of the diencephalon and the pineal gland. The pineal gland secretes the hormone melatonin \\"directly into the systemic circulation\\",[8] thus melatonin is not affected by the blood√øbrain barrier.[9]\\r\\nOriginally, experiments in the 1920s seemed to show that the blood√øbrain barrier (BBB) was still immature in newborns. The reason for this mistake was an error in methodology (the osmotic pressure was too high and the delicate embryonal capillary vessels were partially damaged). It was later shown in experiments with a reduced volume of the injected liquids that the markers under investigation could not pass the BBB. It was reported that those natural substances such as albumin, œ´-1-fetoprotein or transferrin with elevated plasma concentration in the newborn could not be detected outside of cells in the brain. The transporter P-glycoprotein exists already in the embryonal endothelium.[10]\\r\\nThe measurement of brain uptake of acetamide, antipyrine, benzyl alcohol, butanol, caffeine, cytosine, phenytoin, ethanol, ethylene glycol, heroin, mannitol, methanol, phenobarbital, propylene glycol, thiourea, and urea in ether-anesthetized newborn vs. adult rabbits shows that newborn rabbit and adult rabbit brain endothelia are functionally similar with respect to lipid-mediated permeability.[11] These data confirmed that no differences in permeability could be detected between newborn and adult BBB capillaries. No difference in brain uptake of glucose, amino acids, organic acids, purines, nucleosides, or choline was observed between adult and newborn rabbits.[11] These experiments indicate that the newborn BBB has restrictive properties similar to that of the adult. In contrast to suggestions of an immature barrier in young animals, these studies indicate that a sophisticated, selective BBB is operative at birth.\\r\\nThe blood√øbrain barrier acts very effectively to protect the brain from most pathogens. Thus, blood-borne infections of the brain are very rare. Infections of the brain that do occur are often very serious and difficult to treat. Antibodies are too large to cross the blood√øbrain barrier, and only certain antibiotics are able to pass.[12] In some cases, a drug has to be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it can enter the brain by crossing the blood√øcerebrospinal fluid barrier.[13][14] However, not all drugs that are delivered directly to the CSF can effectively penetrate the CSF barrier and enter the brain.[medical citation needed] The blood√øbrain barrier becomes more permeable during inflammation. This allows some antibiotics and phagocytes to move across the BBB. However, this also allows bacteria and viruses to infiltrate the BBB.[12][15] Examples of pathogens that can traverse the BBB and the diseases they cause include toxoplasma gondii which causes toxoplasmosis, spirochetes like Borrelia which causes Lyme disease, Group B streptococci which causes meningitis in newborns,[16] and Treponema pallidum which causes syphilis. Some of these harmful bacteria gain access by releasing cytotoxins like pneumolysin[17] which have a direct toxic effect on brain microvascular endothelium[18] and tight junctions.\\r\\nThere are also some biochemical poisons that are made up of large molecules that are too big to pass through the blood√øbrain barrier. This was especially important in more primitive times when people often ate contaminated food. Neurotoxins such as botulinum in the food might affect peripheral nerves, but the blood√øbrain barrier can often prevent such toxins from reaching the central nervous system, where they could cause serious or fatal damage.[19]\\r\\nThe blood√øbrain barrier (BBB) is formed by the brain capillary endothelium and excludes from the brain F100% of large-molecule neurotherapeutics and more than 98% of all small-molecule drugs.[5] Overcoming the difficulty of delivering therapeutic agents to specific regions of the brain presents a major challenge to treatment of most brain disorders. In its neuroprotective role, the blood√øbrain barrier functions to hinder the delivery of many potentially important diagnostic and therapeutic agents to the brain. Therapeutic molecules and antibodies that might otherwise be effective in diagnosis and therapy do not cross the BBB in adequate amounts.\\r\\nMechanisms for drug targeting in the brain involve going either \\"through\\" or \\"behind\\" the BBB. Modalities for drug delivery/Dosage form through the BBB entail its disruption by osmotic means; biochemically by the use of vasoactive substances such as bradykinin;[20] or even by localized exposure to high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).[21] Other methods used to get through the BBB may entail the use of endogenous transport systems, including carrier-mediated transporters such as glucose and amino acid carriers; receptor-mediated transcytosis for insulin or transferrin; and the blocking of active efflux transporters such as p-glycoprotein. However, vectors targeting BBB transporters, such as the transferrin receptor, have been found to remain entrapped in brain endothelial cells of capillaries, instead of being ferried across the BBB into the cerebral parenchyma.[22][23] Methods for drug delivery behind the BBB include intracerebral implantation (such as with needles) and convection-enhanced distribution. Mannitol can be used in bypassing the BBB.\\r\\nNanotechnology may also help in the transfer of drugs across the BBB.[24][25] Recently, researchers have been trying to build liposomes loaded with nanoparticles to gain access through the BBB. More research is needed to determine which strategies will be most effective and how they can be improved for patients with brain tumors. The potential for using BBB opening to target specific agents to brain tumors has just begun to be explored.\\r\\nDelivering drugs across the blood√øbrain barrier is one of the most promising applications of nanotechnology in clinical neuroscience. Nanoparticles could potentially carry out multiple tasks in a predefined sequence, which is very important in the delivery of drugs across the blood√øbrain barrier.\\r\\nA significant amount of research in this area has been spent exploring methods of nanoparticle-mediated delivery of antineoplastic drugs to tumors in the central nervous system. For example, radiolabeled polyethylene glycol coated hexadecylcyanoacrylate nanospheres targeted and accumulated in a rat gliosarcoma.[26] However, this method is not yet ready for clinical trials, due to the accumulation of the nanospheres in surrounding healthy tissue. Another, more promising approach, is the coating of polyalkylcyanoacrylate or poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles with polysorbate 80 or poloxamer 188. Due to this coating the particles adsorb apolipoproteins E or A-1 from the blood and thus interact with the LRP1 or with the scavenger receptor followed by transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier into the brain.[27] These particles loaded with doxorubicin for the treatment of glioblastomas are presently in Clinical Phase I. Recently, a novel class of multifunctional nanoparticles known as magneto-electric nanoparticles (MENs) has been discovered for externally controlled targeted delivery and release of drug(s) across BBB as well as wireless stimulation of cells deep in the brain. This approach depends more on the field control and less on the cellular microenvironment. In vitro and in vivo (on mice) experiments to prove the feasibility of using MENs to release a drug across BBB on demand and wirelessly stimulate the brain have been conducted by the research group of Prof. Sakhrat Khizroev at Florida International University (FIU).[28]\\r\\nIt should be noted that vascular endothelial cells and associated pericytes are often abnormal in tumors and that the blood√øbrain barrier may not always be intact in brain tumors. Also, the basement membrane is sometimes incomplete. Other factors, such as astrocytes, may contribute to the resistance of brain tumors to therapy.[29][30]\\r\\nPeptides are able to cross the blood√øbrain barrier (BBB) through various mechanisms, opening new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues.[31] However, their BBB transport data are scattered in the literature over different disciplines, using different methodologies reporting different influx or efflux aspects. Therefore, a comprehensive BBB peptide database (Brainpeps) was constructed to collect the BBB data available in the literature. Brainpeps currently contains BBB transport information with positive as well as negative results. The database is a useful tool to prioritize peptide choices for evaluating different BBB responses or studying quantitative structure-property (BBB behaviour) relationships of peptides. Because a multitude of methods have been used to assess the BBB behaviour of compounds, we classified these methods and their responses. Moreover, the relationships between the different BBB transport methods have been clarified and visualized.[32]\\r\\nCasomorphin is a heptapeptide and could be able to pass the BBB.[33]\\r\\nMeningitis is an inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (these membranes are known as meninges). Meningitis is most commonly caused by infections with various pathogens, examples of which are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. When the meninges are inflamed, the blood√øbrain barrier may be disrupted.[12] This disruption may increase the penetration of various substances (including either toxins or antibiotics) into the brain. Antibiotics used to treat meningitis may aggravate the inflammatory response of the central nervous system by releasing neurotoxins from the cell walls of bacteria - like lipopolysaccharide (LPS).[34] Depending on the causative pathogen, whether it is bacterial, fungal, or protozoan, treatment with third-generation or fourth-generation cephalosporin or amphotericin B is usually prescribed.[35]\\r\\nA brain or cerebral abscess, like other abscesses, is caused by inflammation and collection of lymphatic cells and infected material originating from a local or remote infection. A brain abscess is a rare, life-threatening condition. Local sources may include infections of the ear, the oral cavity and teeth, the paranasal sinuses, or an epidural abscess. Remote sources may include infections in the lung, heart or kidney. A brain abscess may also be caused by head trauma or as a complication of surgery. In children cerebral abscesses are usually linked to congenital heart disease.[36] In most cases, 8√ø12 weeks of antibacterial therapy is required.[12]\\r\\nEpilepsy is a common neurological disease that is characterized by recurrent and sometimes untreatable seizures. Several clinical and experimental data have implicated the failure of blood√øbrain barrier function in triggering chronic or acute seizures.[37][38][39][40][41] Some studies implicate the interactions between a common blood protein (albumin) and astrocytes.[42] These findings suggest that acute seizures are a predictable consequence of disruption of the BBB by either artificial or inflammatory mechanisms. In addition, expression of drug resistance molecules and transporters at the BBB are a significant mechanism of resistance to commonly used anti-epileptic drugs.[43][44]\\r\\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is considered to be an auto-immune and neurodegenerative disorder in which the immune system attacks the myelin that protects and electrically insulates the neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Normally, a person's nervous system would be inaccessible to the white blood cells due to the blood√øbrain barrier. However, magnetic resonance imaging has shown that when a person is undergoing an MS \\"attack,\\" the blood√øbrain barrier has broken down in a section of the brain or spinal cord, allowing white blood cells called T lymphocytes to cross over and attack the myelin. It has sometimes been suggested that, rather than being a disease of the immune system, MS is a disease of the blood√øbrain barrier.[45] The weakening of the blood√øbrain barrier may be a result of a disturbance in the endothelial cells on the inside of the blood vessel, due to which the production of the protein P-glycoprotein is not working well.[46]\\r\\nThere are currently active investigations into treatments for a compromised blood√øbrain barrier. It is believed that oxidative stress plays an important role into the breakdown of the barrier. Anti-oxidants such as lipoic acid may be able to stabilize a weakening blood√øbrain barrier.[47]\\r\\nNeuromyelitis optica, also known as Devic's disease, is similar to and is often confused with multiple sclerosis. Among other differences from MS, a different target of the autoimmune response has been identified. Patients with neuromyelitis optica have high levels of antibodies against a protein called aquaporin 4 (a component of the astrocytic foot processes in the blood√øbrain barrier).[48]\\r\\nLate-stage neurological trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is a condition in which trypanosoma protozoa are found in brain tissue. It is not yet known how the parasites infect the brain from the blood, but it is suspected that they cross through the choroid plexus, a circumventricular organ.\\r\\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that is caused by reactivation of a latent papovavirus (the JC polyomavirus) infection, that can cross the BBB. It affects immune-compromised patients and it is usually seen with patients suffering from AIDS.\\r\\nDe Vivo disease (also known as GLUT1 deficiency syndrome) is a rare condition caused by inadequate transportation of the sugar glucose across the blood√øbrain barrier, resulting in developmental delays and other neurological problems. Genetic defects in glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) appears to be the primary cause of De Vivo disease.[49][50]\\r\\nSome evidence indicates that disruption of the blood√øbrain barrier in Alzheimer's disease patients allows blood plasma containing amyloid beta (A) to enter the brain where the A adheres preferentially to the surface of astrocytes.[51] These findings have led to the hypotheses that (1) breakdown of the blood√øbrain barrier allows access of neuron-binding autoantibodies and soluble exogenous A42 to brain neurons and (2) binding of these autoantibodies to neurons triggers and/or facilitates the internalization and accumulation of cell surface-bound A42 in vulnerable neurons through their natural tendency to clear surface-bound autoantibodies via endocytosis. Eventually the astrocyte is overwhelmed, dies, ruptures, and disintegrates, leaving behind the insoluble A42 plaque. Thus, in some patients, Alzheimer's disease may be caused (or more likely, aggravated) by a breakdown in the blood√øbrain barrier.[52]\\r\\nCerebral edema is the accumulation of excess water in the extracellular space of the brain, which can result when hypoxia causes the blood√øbrain barrier to open.\\r\\nMany neurodegenerative diseases including synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's, and tauopathies such as Alzheimer's are thought to result from seeded misfolding from pathological extracellular protein variants known as prions. This prion-like hypothesis is gaining support in numerous studies in vitro and involving in vivo intracerebral injection of brain lysates, extracted protein (tau, alpha-synuclein) and synthetically generated fibers in alpha-synucleinopathies. These proteins are also detectable in increasing amounts in the plasma of patients suffering from these conditions (particularly total alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease patients). The extent to which and the mechanisms by which these prion-like proteins can penetrate the blood√øbrain barrier is currently unknown.\\r\\nIt is believed[53] that latent HIV can cross the blood√øbrain barrier inside circulating monocytes in the bloodstream (\\"Trojan horse theory\\") within the first 14 days of infection. Once inside, these monocytes become activated and are transformed into macrophages. Activated macrophages release virions into the brain tissue proximate to brain microvessels. These viral particles likely attract the attention of sentinel brain microglia and perivascular macrophages initiating an inflammatory cascade that may cause a series of intracellular signaling in brain microvascular endothelial cells and damage the functional and structural integrity of the BBB.[54] This inflammation is HIV encephalitis (HIVE). Instances of HIVE probably occur throughout the course of AIDS and are a precursor for HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The premier model for studying HIV and HIVE is the simian model.\\r\\nDuring lethal rabies infection of mice, the blood√øbrain barrier (BBB) does not allow anti-viral immune cells to enter the brain, the primary site of rabies virus replication. This aspect contributes to the pathogenicity of the virus and artificially increasing BBB permeability promotes viral clearance. Opening the BBB during rabies infection has been suggested as a possible novel approach to treating the disease, even though no attempts have yet been made to determine whether or not this treatment could be successful.[original research?]\\r\\nInflammation in the body may lead to effects on the brain via the blood-brain barrier (BBB). During systemic inflammation, whether in the form of infection or sterile inflammation, the BBB may undergo changes which may be disruptive or non-disruptive.[55] Such changes may be part of a productive host response to systemic inflammation, or may lead to deleterious consequences within the central nervous system. These BBB changes likely play a role in the generation of sickness behaviour during systemic infection (why we feel 'unwell' when we have an infection). These changes may also induce or accelerate disease within the brain, for example in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, and may be part of the reason why patients with these conditions can deteriorate during an infection. Also, in patients with neurological disease the BBB may be abnormally sensitive to the effects of systemic inflammation.\\r\\nPaul Ehrlich was a bacteriologist studying staining, a procedure that is used in many microscopic studies to make fine biological structures visible using chemical dyes. As Ehrlich injected some of these dyes (notably the aniline dyes that were then widely used), the dye stained all of the organs of some kinds of animals except for their brains. At that time, Ehrlich attributed this lack of staining to the brain simply not picking up as much of the dye.[56]\\r\\nHowever, in a later experiment in 1913, Edwin Goldmann (one of Ehrlich's students) injected the dye into the cerebro-spinal fluids of animals' brains directly. He found that in this case the brains did become dyed, but the rest of the body did not. This clearly demonstrated the existence of some sort of compartmentalization between the two. At that time, it was thought that the blood vessels themselves were responsible for the barrier, since no obvious membrane could be found. The concept of the blood√øbrain barrier (then termed hematoencephalic barrier) was proposed by a Berlin physician, Lewandowsky, in 1900.[57] Russian scientist Lina Stern performed important studies of the barrier from 1920 to the decade of 40's, about treatments capable of infiltrating this barrier (in order to treat brain diseases and injuries), saving thousands of lives specially during World War II. It was not until the introduction of the scanning electron microscope to the medical research fields in the 1960s that the actual membrane could be observed and proved to exist.","input":"Which type of cell forms the blood brain barrier?"},{"output":"10 December 1948","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a historic document that was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at its third session on?10 December 1948 as Resolution 217 at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, France. Of the then 58 members of the United Nations, 48 voted in favor, none against, eight abstained, and two did not vote.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Declaration consists of 30 articles affirming an individual's rights which, although not legally binding in themselves, have been elaborated in subsequent international treaties, economic transfers, regional human rights instruments, national constitutions, and other laws. The Declaration was the first step in the process of formulating the International Bill of Human Rights, which was completed in 1966, and came into force in 1976, after a sufficient number of countries had ratified them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome legal scholars have argued that because countries have constantly invoked the Declaration for more than 50 years, it has become binding as a part of customary international law.[1][2] However, in the United States, the Supreme Court in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain (2004), concluded that the Declaration \\"does not of its own force impose obligations as a matter of international law.\\"[3] Courts of other countries have also concluded that the Declaration is not in and of itself part of domestic law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe underlying structure of the Universal Declaration was introduced in its second draft, which was prepared by Ren Cassin. Cassin worked from a first draft, which was prepared by John Peters Humphrey. The structure was influenced by the Code Napolon, including a preamble and introductory general principles.[4] Cassin compared the Declaration to the portico of a Greek temple, with a foundation, steps, four columns, and a pediment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Declaration consists of a preamble and thirty articles:\\r\\n\\r\\nThese articles are concerned with the duty of the individual to society and the prohibition of use of rights in contravention of the purposes of the United Nations Organisation.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, the Allies adopted the Four Freedomsfreedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from fear, and freedom from wantas their basic war aims.[7][8] The United Nations Charter \\"reaffirmed faith in fundamental human rights, and dignity and worth of the human person\\" and committed all member states to promote \\"universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\\".[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany became fully apparent after World War II, the consensus within the world community was that the United Nations Charter did not sufficiently define the rights to which it referred.[10][11] A universal declaration that specified the rights of individuals was necessary to give effect to the Charter's provisions on human rights.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 1946, the UN Economic and Social Council established the Commission on Human Rights, comprising 18 members from various nationalities and political backgrounds. The Commission, a standing body of the United Nations, was constituted to undertake the work of preparing what was initially conceived as an International Bill of Rights.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commission established a special Universal Declaration of Human Rights Drafting Committee, chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt, to write the articles of the Declaration. The Committee met in two sessions over the course of two years.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian John Peters Humphrey, Director of the Division of Human Rights within the United Nations Secretariat, was called upon by the United Nations Secretary-General to work on the project and became the Declaration's principal drafter.[14] At the time, Humphrey was newly appointed as Director of the Division of Human Rights within the United Nations Secretariat.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther well-known members of the drafting committee included Ren Cassin of France, Charles Malik of Lebanon, and P. C. Chang of the Republic of China (Taiwan).[16] Humphrey provided the initial draft which became the working text of the Commission.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Allan Carlson, the Declaration's pro-family phrases were the result of the Christian Democratic movement's influence on Cassin and Malik.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the Committee finished its work in May 1948, the draft was further discussed by the Commission on Human Rights, the Economic and Social Council, the Third Committee of the General Assembly before being put to vote in December 1948. During these discussions many amendments and propositions were made by UN Member States.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish representatives were extremely frustrated that the proposal had moral but no legal obligation.[19] (It was not until 1976 that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights came into force, giving a legal status to most of the Declaration.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Universal Declaration was adopted by the General Assembly as Resolution 217 on 10?December 1948. Of the then 58 members[20] of the United Nations, 48 voted in favor, none against, eight abstained[21][22] and Honduras and Yemen failed to vote or abstain.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meeting record[24] provides firsthand insight into the debate. South Africa's position can be seen as an attempt to protect its system of apartheid, which clearly violated several articles in the Declaration.[21] The Saudi Arabian delegation's abstention was prompted primarily by two of the Declaration's articles: Article 18, which states that everyone has the right \\"to change his religion or belief\\"; and Article 16, on equal marriage rights.[21] The six communist countries abstentions centred around the view that the Declaration did not go far enough in condemning fascism and Nazism.[25] Eleanor Roosevelt attributed the abstention of Soviet bloc countries to Article 13, which provided the right of citizens to leave their countries.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 48 countries which voted in favour of the Declaration are:[27]\\r\\n\\r\\n8 countries abstained:[27]\\r\\n\\r\\n2 countries didn't vote:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOther countries only gained sovereignty and joined the United Nations later,[29] which explains the relatively small number of states entitled to the historical vote, and in no way reflects opposition to the universal principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Declaration of Human Rights Day is commemorated every year on?December 10, the anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration, and is known as Human Rights Day or International Human Rights Day. The commemoration is observed by individuals, community and religious groups, human rights organizations, parliaments, governments, and the United Nations. Decadal commemorations are often accompanied by campaigns to promote awareness of the Declaration and human rights. 2008 marked the 60th anniversary of the Declaration, and was accompanied by year-long activities around the theme \\"Dignity and justice for all of us\\".[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1948, the UN Resolution A/RES/217(III)[A] adopted the Declaration on a bilingual document in English and French, and official translations in Chinese, Russian and Spanish.[31] In 2009, the Guinness Book of Records described the Declaration as the world's \\"Most Translated Document\\" (370 different languages and dialects).[32][33] The Unicode Consortium stores 431[34] of the 503[35] official translations available at the OHCHR (as of  June?2017[update]).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its preamble, governments commit themselves and their people to progressive measures which secure the universal and effective recognition and observance of the human rights set out in the Declaration. Eleanor Roosevelt supported the adoption of the Declaration as a declaration rather than as a treaty because she believed that it would have the same kind of influence on global society as the United States Declaration of Independence had within the United States.[36] In this, she proved to be correct. Even though it is not legally binding, the Declaration has been adopted in or has influenced most national constitutions since 1948. It has also served as the foundation for a growing number of national laws, international laws, and treaties, as well as for a growing number of regional, sub national, and national institutions protecting and promoting human rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time in international law, the term the rule of law was used in the preamble of the Declaration. The third paragraph of the preamble of the Declaration reads as follows: \\"Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.\\"[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile not a treaty itself, the Declaration was explicitly adopted for the purpose of defining the meaning of the words \\"fundamental freedoms\\" and \\"human rights\\" appearing in the United Nations Charter, which is binding on all member states. For this reason, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a fundamental constitutive document of the United Nations. In addition, many international lawyers[38][39][40][41] believe that the Declaration forms part of customary international law[42] and is a powerful tool in applying diplomatic and moral pressure to governments that violate any of its articles. The 1968 United Nations International Conference on Human Rights advised that the Declaration \\"constitutes an obligation for the members of the international community\\" to all persons. The Declaration has served as the foundation for two binding UN human rights covenants: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The principles of the Declaration are elaborated in international treaties such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the United Nations Convention Against Torture, and many more. The Declaration continues to be widely cited by governments, academics, advocates, and constitutional courts, and by individuals who appeal to its principles for the protection of their recognised human rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Universal Declaration has received praise from a number of notable people. The Lebanese philosopher and diplomat Charles Malik called it \\"an international document of the first order of importance\\",[43] while Eleanor Rooseveltfirst chairwoman of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) that drafted the Declarationstated that it \\"may well become the international Magna Carta of all men everywhere.\\"[44] In a speech on 5 October 1995, Pope John Paul II called the Declaration \\"one of the highest expressions of the human conscience of our time\\" but the Vatican never adopted the Declaration.[45] In a statement on 10 December 2003 on behalf of the European Union, Marcello Spatafora said that the Declaration \\"placed human rights at the centre of the framework of principles and obligations shaping relations within the international community.\\"[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nTurkey which was a secular state with an overwhelmingly Muslim populationsigned the Declaration in 1948.[47] However, the same year, Saudi Arabia abstained from the ratification vote on the Declaration, claiming that it violated Sharia law.[48] Pakistanwhich had signed the declarationdisagreed and critiqued the Saudi position.[49] Pakistani minister Muhammad Zafarullah Khan strongly argued in favor of including freedom of religion.[50] In 1982, the Iranian representative to the United Nations, Said Rajaie-Khorassani, said that the Declaration was \\"a secular understanding of the Judeo-Christian tradition\\" which could not be implemented by Muslims without conflict with Sharia.[51] On 30 June 2000, members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) officially resolved to support the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam,[52] an alternative document that says people have \\"freedom and right to a dignified life in accordance with the Islamic Shari'ah\\", without any discrimination on grounds of \\"race, colour, language, sex, religious belief, political affiliation, social status or other considerations\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Muslim diplomats would go on later to help draft other UN human rights treaties. For example, Iraqi diplomat Bedia Afnan's insistence on wording that recognized gender equality resulted in Article 3 within the ICCPR and ICESCR. Pakistani diplomat Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah also spoke in favor of recognizing women's rights.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of scholars in different fields have expressed concerns with the Declaration's alleged Western bias. These include Irene Oh, Abdulaziz Sachedina, Riffat Hassan, and Faisal Kutty. Hassan has argued:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat needs to be pointed out to those who uphold the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be the highest, or sole, model, of a charter of equality and liberty for all human beings, is that given the Western origin and orientation of this Declaration, the \\"universality\\" of the assumptions on which it is based is?√ø at the very least?√ø problematic and subject to questioning. Furthermore, the alleged incompatibility between the concept of human rights and religion in general, or particular religions such as Islam, needs to be examined in an unbiased way.[53]\\r\\nIrene Oh argues that one solution is to approach the issue from the perspective of comparative (descriptive) ethics.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nKutty writes: \\"A strong argument can be made that the current formulation of international human rights constitutes a cultural structure in which western society finds itself easily at home ... It is important to acknowledge and appreciate that other societies may have equally valid alternative conceptions of human rights.\\"[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIronically, a number of Islamic countries that as of  2014[update] are among the most resistant to UN intervention in domestic affairs, played an invaluable role in the creation of the Declaration, with countries such as Syria and Egypt having been strong proponents of the universality of human rights and the right of countries to self-determination.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nGroups such as Amnesty International[57] and War Resisters International[58] have advocated for \\"The Right to Refuse to Kill\\" to be added to the Universal Declaration. War Resisters International has stated that the right to conscientious objection to military service is primarily derived frombut not yet explicit inArticle 18 of the UDHR: the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nSteps have been taken within the United Nations to make this right more explicit, butto date (2017)[update]those steps have been limited to less significant United Nations documents. Sean MacBrideAssistant Secretary-General of the United Nations and Nobel Peace Prize laureatehas said: \\"To the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights one more might, with relevance, be added. It is 'The Right to Refuse to Kill'.\\"[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Anthropological Association criticized the UDHR while it was in its drafting process. The AAA warned that the document would be defining universal rights from a Western paradigm which would be unfair to countries outside of that scope. They further argued that the West's history of colonialism and evangelism made them a problematic moral representative for the rest of the world. They proposed three notes for consideration with underlying themes of cultural relativism: \\"1. The individual realizes his personality through his culture, hence respect for individual differences entails a respect for cultural differences\\", \\"2. Respect for differences between cultures is validated by the scientific fact that no technique of qualitatively evaluating cultures has been discovered\\", and \\"3. Standards and values are relative to the culture from which they derive so that any attempt to formulate postulates that grow out of the beliefs or moral codes of one culture must to that extent detract from the applicability of any Declaration of Human Rights to mankind as a whole.\\"[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the lead up to the World Conference on Human Rights held in 1993, ministers from Asian states adopted the Bangkok Declaration, reaffirming their governments' commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They stated their view of the interdependence and indivisibility of human rights and stressed the need for universality, objectivity, and non-selectivity of human rights. However, at the same time, they emphasized the principles of sovereignty and non-interference, calling for greater emphasis on economic, social, and cultural rightsin particular, the right to economic development over civil and political rights. The Bangkok Declaration is considered to be a landmark expression of the Asian values perspective, which offers an extended critique of human rights universalism.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) is nonpartisan, nonsectarian, and independent of any government, and its core mandate is to promote respect for all the rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.[62][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, director Stephen R. Johnson and 41 international animators, musicians, and producers created a 20-minute video for Amnesty International to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration. The video was to bring to life the Declaration's 30 articles.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmnesty International celebrated Human Rights Day and the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration all over the world by organizing the \\"Fire Up!\\" event.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Unitarian Universalist Service Committee (UUSC) is a non-profit, nonsectarian organization whose work around the world is guided by the values of Unitarian Universalism and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It works to provide disaster relief and promote human rights and social justice around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Quaker United Nations Office and the American Friends Service Committee work on many human rights issues, including improving education on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They have developed a  Curriculum  to help introduce High School students to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[66][67]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997, the council of the American Library Association (ALA) endorsed Article 19 from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[68] Along with Article 19, Article 18 and 20 are also fundamentally tied to the ALA Universal Right to Free Expression and the Library Bill of Rights.[69] Censorship, the invasion of privacy, and interference of opinions are human rights violations according to the ALA. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to violations of human rights, the ALA asserts the following principles:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Library Association condemns any governmental effort to involve libraries and librarians in restrictions on the right of any individual to hold opinions without interference, and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas. Such restrictions, whether enforced by statutes or regulations, contractual stipulations, or voluntary agreements, pervert the function of the library and violate the professional responsibilities of librarians.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Library Association rejects censorship in any form. Any action that denies the inalienable human rights of individuals only damages the will to resist oppression, strengthens the hand of the oppressor, and undermines the cause of justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Library Association will not abrogate these principles. We believe that censorship corrupts the cause of justice, and contributes to the demise of freedom.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nYouth for Human Rights International (YHRI) is a non-profit organization founded in 2001 by Mary Shuttleworth, an educator born and raised in apartheid South Africa, where she witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of discrimination and the lack of basic human rights. The purpose of YHRI is to teach youth about human rights, specifically the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and inspire them to become advocates for tolerance and peace.

Each is a proverb-like proclamation, without narrative. Four of the blessings also appear in the Sermon on the Plain in the Gospel of Luke, followed by four woes which mirror the blessings.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Vulgate, each of these blessings begins with the word beati, which translates to \\"happy\\", \\"rich\\", or \\"blessed\\" (plural adjective). The corresponding word in the original Greek is œ´? (makarioi), with the same meanings.[2][3] Thus \\"Blessed are the poor in spirit\\" appears in Latin as beati pauperes spiritu.[4] The Latin noun betitd was coined by Cicero to describe a state of blessedness, and was later incorporated within the chapter headings written for Matthew 5 in various printed versions of the Vulgate.[5] Subsequently, the word was anglicized to beatytudes in the Great Bible of 1540,[6] and has, over time, taken on a preferred spelling of beatitudes.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach Beatitude consists of two phrases: the condition and the result. In almost every case the condition is from familiar Old Testament context, but Jesus teaches a new interpretation.[7] Together, the Beatitudes present a new set of Christian ideals that focus on a spirit of love and humility different in orientation than the usual force and exaction taken. They echo the ideals of the teachings of Jesus on mercy, spirituality, and compassion.[1][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile opinions may vary as to exactly how many distinct statements into which the Beatitudes should be divided (ranging from eight to ten), most scholars consider them to be only eight.[8][9] These eight of Matthew follow a simple pattern: Jesus names a group of people normally thought to be unfortunate and pronounces them blessed.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eight Beatitudes in Matthew:[10][8][9]\\r\\n3 Blessed are the poor in spirit,\\r\\n????for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\\r\\n4 Blessed are those who mourn,\\r\\n????for they will be comforted.\\r\\n5 Blessed are the meek,\\r\\n????for they will inherit the earth.\\r\\n6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,\\r\\n????for they will be filled.\\r\\n7 Blessed are the merciful,\\r\\n????for they will be shown mercy.\\r\\n8 Blessed are the pure in heart,\\r\\n????for they will see God.\\r\\n9 Blessed are the peacemakers,\\r\\n????for they will be called children of God.\\r\\n10 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,\\r\\n????for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\\r\\n11 Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. 12 Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ninth beatitude (Matthew 5:11√ø12) refers to the bearing of reviling and is addressed to the disciples.[11][12] R.

In almost all cases the phrases used are familiar from an Old Testament context, but in the Sermon on the Mount Jesus elevates them to new levels and teachings. Together, the Beatitudes present a new set of ideals that focus on love and humility rather than force and exaction. They echo the highest ideals of Jesus' teachings on spirituality and compassion.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"the meek\\" would be familiar in the Old Testament, e.g., as in \\r\\nPsalm 37:11\\r\\n.[15] Although the Beatitude concerning the meek has been much praised even by some non-Christians such as Mahatma Gandhi, some view the admonition to meekness skeptically. Friedrich Nietzsche in On the Genealogy of Morals considered the verse to be embodying what he perceived as a slave morality.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Christian teachings, the Works of Mercy, which have corporal and spiritual components, have resonated with the theme of the Beatitude for mercy.[17] These teachings emphasize that these acts of mercy provide both temporal and spiritual benefits.[1][9] The theme of mercy has continued in devotions such as the Divine Mercy in the 20th century.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"peacemakers\\" has traditionally been interpreted to mean not only those who live in peace with others, but also those who do their best to promote friendship among mankind and between God and man. St. Gregory of Nyssa interpreted it as \\"Godly work\\", which was an imitation of God's love of man.[9][17] John Wesley said the peacemakers 'endeavour to calm the stormy spirits of men, to quiet their turbulent passions, to soften the minds of contending parties, and, if possible, reconcile them to each other. They use all innocent arts, and employ all their strength, all the talents which God has given them, as well to preserve peace where it is, as to restore it where it is not.'[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrase \\"poor in spirit\\" (? ? ?œ´) in Matthew 5:3 has been subject to a variety of interpretations. A.W. Tozer describes poverty of spirit as \\"an inward state paralleling the outward circumstances of the common beggar in the streets.\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Burnet Wright, seeking to avoid a common misunderstanding of the meaning of poverty of spirit, distinguishes those who are \\"poor in spirit\\" from those he calls \\"poor spirited,\\" who \\"consider crawling the Christian's proper gait.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Book of Mormon, a religious text of Mormonism, Jesus gives a sermon to a group of indigenous Americans including statements very similar to Matthew 6 and evidently derived therefrom:[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, blessed are the poor in spirit 'who come unto me,' for theirs is the kingdom of heaven (3 Nephi 12:3).[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd blessed are all they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled 'with the Holy Ghost' (3 Nephi 12:6).[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bah' Law?-i-Aqdas contains the statement:\\r\\n\\r\\nBlessed the soul that hath been raised to life through My quickening breath and hath gained admittance into My heavenly Kingdom.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Qur'an quotes the Bible only in Q:21:105 which resembles Psalm 25:13 referred to in Matthew 5:5; but the Qur'an uses \\"righteous\\" rather than \\"meek\\".[25] The Qur'an (e.g., \\"say the word of humility and enter the gate of paradise\\") and some Hadith (e.g., \\"My mercy exceeds my anger\\") contain some passages with somewhat similar tone, but distinct phraseology, from the Beatitudes.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bhagavad Gita and the traditional writings of Buddhism (e.g., some of the Mangala Sutta) have been interpreted as including teachings whose intentions resemble some of the messages of Beatitudes (e.g., humility and absence of ego), although their wording is not the same.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nSix \\"modern Beatitudes\\" were proposed by Pope Francis during his visit to Malm?, Sweden on All Saints Day 2016:[28]","input":"What is the main purpose of the beatitudes?"},{"output":"southern half of Missouri","context":"Mark Twain National Forest (MTNF) is a U.S. National Forest located in the southern half of Missouri. MTNF was established on September 11, 1939. It is named for author Mark Twain, a Missouri native. The MTNF covers 3,068,800 acres (12,419?km2) of which 1,506,100 acres (6,095?km2) is public owned, 78,000 acres (320?km2) of which are Wilderness, and National Scenic River area. MTNF spans 29 counties and represents 11% of all forested land in Missouri. MTNF is divided into six distinct ranger districts: Ava-Cassville-Willow Springs, Eleven Point, Houston-Rolla, Cedar Creek, Poplar Bluff, Potosi-Fredericktown, and the Salem. The six ranger districts actually comprise nine overall unique tracts of forests. Its headquarters are in Rolla, Missouri.\\r\\nSome unique features of the Mark Twain include Greer Spring, which is the largest spring on National Forest land and part of the Eleven Point National Scenic River, and pumps an average of 214 million gallons of water per day into the river.[3] The public can also visit the Glade Top Trail National Scenic Byway, which offers views of over 30 miles (48?km) to the Boston Mountains in Arkansas. The 350-mile Ozark Trail system winds through much of the National Forest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mark Twain National Forest, as we know it today, was created on February 17, 1976.

On Feb. 17, 1976, the forests were combined and renamed the Mark Twain National Forest.\\r\\nMissouris only national forest, The Mark Twain, encompasses roughly 1.5 million acres, mostly within the Ozark Highlands. Located across southern Missouri and northern Arkansas, the Ozark Highlands are an ancient landscape characterized by large permanent springs, over 5,000 caves, rocky barren glades, old volcanic mountains and nationally recognized streams. Portions of the Ozarks were never under oceans, nor were the areas glaciated.\\r\\nIn the 1870s, citizens of southern Missouri began an era of extensive logging of the state's native oak, hickory, and pine forests. Lumber mills were commonplace, but by the 1920s they had disappeared, along with much of the state's native forests. Thus, in 1939 President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the MTNF into existence. In March 1933, he also created the Emergency Conservation Work Act, better known as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). In the area that would later become Mark Twain National Forest, hundreds of young men at over fifty CCC sites worked at building roads and planting hundreds of acres of pine to preserve and enhance the natural resources of southern Missouri. Many of their contributions can still be visited and enjoyed today including the Rolla Ranger Station Historic District and Winona Ranger Station Historic District.[4][5]\\r\\nAlthough it is far from being the largest National Forest in acreage, Mark Twain National Forest is located in more counties than any other.

The first papermaking process was documented in China during the Eastern Han period (25-220 C.E.), traditionally attributed to the court official Cai Lun. During the 8th century, Chinese papermaking spread to the Islamic world, where pulp mills and paper mills were used for money making. By the 11th century, papermaking was brought to medieval Europe, where it was refined with the earliest known paper mills utilizing waterwheels. Later Western improvements to the papermaking process came in the 19th century with the invention of wood-based papers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \\"paper\\" is etymologically derived from papyrus, Ancient Greek for the Cyperus papyrus plant. Papyrus is a thick, paper-like material produced from the pith of the Cyperus papyrus plant which was used in ancient Egypt and other Mediterranean societies for writing long before paper was used in China.[2] Papyrus however are plants pressed and dried, while paper is made from fibers whose properties have been changed by maceration or disintegration.[3]\\r\\nIt is lucky chance that the date of CE 105 was recorded, because Cai Lun, the official involved, who seems to have introduced some improvements in paper manufacture, worked at the palace as a eunuch. Yet just because the new technology was not trumpeted at the time does not mean that it had no effect. On the contrary: up to this point China was lagging behind those Mediterranean societies where papyrus was used and where light, inexpensive scrolls could be created. But thereafter the advantage swung the other way, since papyrus, which is composed of organic material not as highly processed as paper, was prone to splitting and deterioration at a much greater rate; this may be why vellum eventually came to dominate, especially in the harsher climate of Northern Europe. Paper, by contrast, gave a good, uniform writing surface that could be smoothly rolled and unrolled without damage, while remaining relatively durable.[4]\\r\\nIn the pre-Columbian Americas, a type of early bark paper known as amate was used as a folded writing material for codices. The earliest sample of amate was found at Huitzilapa near the Magdalena Municipality, Jalisco, Mexico, belonging to the shaft tomb culture.[5]\\r\\nArchaeological evidence of papermaking predates the traditional attribution given to Cai Lun,[6] an imperial eunuch official of the Han dynasty (202 BC-AD 220), thus the exact date or inventor of paper can not be deduced. The earliest extant paper fragment was unearthed at Fangmatan in Gansu province, and was likely part of a map, dated to 179-41 BC.[7] Fragments of paper have also been found at Dunhuang dated to 65 BC and at Yumen pass, dated to 8 BC.[8]\\r\\n\\"Cai Lun's\\" invention, recorded hundreds of years after it took place, is dated to 105 AD. The innovation is a type of paper made of mulberry and other bast fibres along with fishing nets, old rags, and hemp waste which reduced the cost of paper production, which prior to this, and later, in the West, depended solely on rags.[8][9][4]\\r\\nDuring the Shang (1600√ø1050 BC) and Zhou (1050-256 BC) dynasties of ancient China, documents were ordinarily written on bone or bamboo (on tablets or on bamboo strips sewn and rolled together into scrolls), making them very heavy, awkward, and hard to transport. The light material of silk was sometimes used as a recording medium, but was normally too expensive to consider. The Han dynasty Chinese court official Cai Lun (ca. 50√ø121) is credited as the inventor of a method of papermaking (inspired by wasps and bees) using rags and other plant fibers in 105 CE.[4] However, the discovery of specimens bearing written Chinese characters in 2006 at Fangmatan in north-east China's Gansu Province suggests that paper was in use by the ancient Chinese military more than 100 years before Cai, in 8 BC, and possibly much earlier as the map fragment found at the Fangmatan tomb site dates from the early 2nd century BC.[7] It therefore would appear that \\"Cai Lun's contribution was to improve this skill systematically and scientifically, fix a recipe for papermaking\\".[10]\\r\\nThe record in the Twenty-Four Histories says[11]\\r\\nThe production process may have originated from the practice of pounding and stirring rags in water, after which the matted fibres were collected on a mat. The bark of Paper Mulberry was particularly valued and high quality paper was developed in the late Han period using the bark of tan (w; sandalwood). In the Eastern Jin period a fine bamboo screen-mould treated with insecticidal dye for permanence was used in papermaking. After printing was popularized during the Song dynasty the demand for paper grew substantially. In the year 1101, 1.5 million sheets of paper were sent to the capital.[11]\\r\\nOpen, it stretches; closed, it rolls up. it can be contracted or expanded; hidden away or displayed.[8]\\r\\nAmong the earliest known uses of paper was padding and wrapping delicate bronze mirrors according to archaeological evidence dating to the reign of Emperor Wu of Han from the 2nd century BC.[12] Padding doubled as both protection for the object as well as the user in cases where poisonous \\"medicine\\" were involved, as mentioned in the official history of the period.[12] Although paper was used for writing by the 3rd century AD,[1] paper continued to be used for wrapping (and other) purposes. Toilet paper was used in China from around the late 6th century.[13] In 589, the Chinese scholar-official Yan Zhitui (531-591) wrote: \\"Paper on which there are quotations or commentaries from Five Classics or the names of sages, I dare not use for toilet purposes\\".[13] An Arab traveler who visited China wrote of the curious Chinese tradition of toilet paper in 851, writing: \\"...?[the Chinese] do not wash themselves with water when they have done their necessities; but they only wipe themselves with paper\\".[13]\\r\\nDuring the Tang dynasty (618√ø907) paper was folded and sewn into square bags to preserve the flavor of tea. In the same period, it was written that tea was served from baskets with multi-colored paper cups and paper napkins of different size and shape.[12] During the Song dynasty (960√ø1279) the government produced the world's first known paper-printed money, or banknote (see Jiaozi and Huizi). Paper money was bestowed as gifts to government officials in special paper envelopes.[13] During the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368), the first well-documented Europeans in Medieval China, the Venetian merchant Marco Polo remarked how the Chinese burned paper effigies shaped as male and female servants, camels, horses, suits of clothing and armor while cremating the dead during funerary rites.[14]\\r\\nAccording to Timothy Hugh Barrett, paper played a pivotal role in early Chinese written culture, and a \\"strong reading culture seems to have developed quickly after its introduction, despite political fragmentation.\\"[15] Indeed the introduction of paper had immense consequences for the book world. It meant books would no longer have to be circulated in small sections or bundles, but in their entirety. Books could now be carried by hand rather than transported by cart. As a result individual collections of literary works increased in the following centuries.[16]\\r\\nTextual culture seems to have been more developed in the south by the early 5th century, with individuals owning collections of several thousand scrolls. In the north an entire palace collection might have been only a few thousand scrolls in total.[17] By the early 6th century, scholars in both the north and south were capable of citing upwards of 400 sources in commentaries on older works.[18] A small compilation text from the 7th century included citations to over 1,400 works.[19]\\r\\nThe personal nature of texts was remarked upon by a late 6th century imperial librarian. According to him, the possession of and familiarity with a few hundred scrolls was what it took to be socially accepted as an educated man.[20]\\r\\nAccording to Endymion Wilkinson, one consequence of the rise of paper in China was that \\"it rapidly began to surpass the Mediterranean empires in book production.\\"[8] During the Tang dynasty, China became the world leader in book production. In addition the gradual spread of woodblock printing from the late Tang and Song further boosted their lead ahead of the rest of the world.[21]\\r\\nFrom the fourth century CE to about 1500, the biggest library collections in China were three to four times larger than the largest collections in Europe. The imperial government book collections in the Tang numbered about 5,000 to 6,000 titles (89,000 juan) in 721. The Song imperial collections at their height in the early twelfth century may have risen to 4,000 to 5,000 titles. These are indeed impressive numbers, but the imperial libraries were exceptional in China and their use was highly restricted. Only very few libraries in the Tang and Song held more than one or two thousand titles (a size not even matched by the manuscript collections of the grandest of the great cathedral libraries in Europe).[22]\\r\\nHowever despite the initial advantage afforded to China by the paper medium, by the 9th century its spread and development in the middle east had closed the gap between the two regions. Between the 9th to early 12th centuries, libraries in Cairo, Baghdad, and Cordoba held collections larger than even the ones in China, and dwarfed those in Europe. From about 1500 the maturation of paper making and printing in Southern Europe also had an effect in closing the gap with the Chinese. The Venetian Domenico Grimani's collection numbered 15,000 volumes by the time of his death in 1523. After 1600, European collections completely overtook those in China. The Bibliotheca Augusta numbered 60,000 volumes in 1649 and surged to 120,000 in 1666. In the 1720s the Bibliotheque du Roi numbered 80,000 books and the Cambridge University 40,000 in 1715. After 1700, libraries in North America also began to overtake those of China, and toward the end of the century, Thomas Jefferson's private collection numbered 4,889 titles in 6,487 volumes. The European advantage only increased further into the 19th century as national collections in Europe and America exceeded a million volumes while a few private collections, such as that of Lord Action, reached 70,000.[22]\\r\\nEuropean book production began to catch up with China after the introduction of the mechanical printing press in the mid fifteenth century. Reliable figures of the number of imprints of each edition are as hard to find in Europe as they are in China, but one result of the spread of printing in Europe was that public and private libraries were able to build up their collections and for the first time in over a thousand years they began to match and then overtake the largest libraries in China.[21]\\r\\nPaper became central to the three arts of China - poetry, painting, and calligraphy. In later times paper constituted one of the 'Four Treasures of the Scholar's Studio,' alongside the brush, the ink, and the inkstone.[23]\\r\\nAfter its origin in central China, the production and use of paper spread steadily. It is clear that paper was used at Dunhuang by AD 150, in Loulan in the modern-day province of Xinjiang by 200, and in Turpan by 399. Paper was concurrently introduced in Japan sometime between the years 280 and 610.[24]\\r\\nPaper spread to Vietnam in the 3rd century.[16]\\r\\nPaper spread to Korea in the 4th century.[16]\\r\\nPaper spread to Japan in the 5th century.[16]\\r\\nPaper spread to India in the 7th century.[16][25] However, the use of paper was not widespread there until the 12th century.[26]\\r\\nAfter the defeat of the Chinese in the Battle of Talas in 751 (present day Kyrgyzstan), the invention spread to the Middle East.[27]\\r\\nThe legend goes,[28] the secret of papermaking was obtained from two Chinese prisoners from the Battle of Talas, which led to the first paper mill in the Islamic world being founded in Samarkand in Sogdia (modern-day Uzbekistan). There was a tradition that Muslims would release their prisoners if they could teach ten Muslims any valuable knowledge.[29] There are records of paper being made at Gilgit in Pakistan by the sixth century, in Samarkand by 751, in Baghdad by 793, in Egypt by 900, and in Fes, Morocco around 1100.[30]\\r\\nThe laborious process of paper making was refined and machinery was designed for bulk manufacturing of paper. Production began in Baghdad, where a method was invented to make a thicker sheet of paper, which helped transform papermaking from an art into a major industry.[31] The use of water-powered pulp mills for preparing the pulp material used in papermaking, dates back to Samarkand in the 8th century,[32] though this should not be confused with paper mills (see Paper mills section below). The Muslims also introduced the use of trip hammers (human- or animal-powered) in the production of paper, replacing the traditional Chinese mortar and pestle method. In turn, the trip hammer method was later employed by the Chinese.[33] Historically, trip hammers were often powered by a water wheel, and are known to have been used in China as long ago as 40 BC or maybe even as far back as the Zhou Dynasty (1050 BC√ø221 BC).[34]\\r\\nBy the 9th century, Muslims were using paper regularly, although for important works like copies of the revered Qur'an, vellum was still preferred.[35] Advances in book production and bookbinding were introduced.[36][unreliable source] In Muslim countries they made books lightersewn with silk and bound with leather-covered paste boards; they had a flap that wrapped the book up when not in use. As paper was less reactive to humidity, the heavy boards were not needed. By the 12th century in Marrakech in Morocco a street was named \\"Kutubiyyin\\" or book sellers which contained more than 100 bookshops.[37]\\r\\nThe earliest recorded use of paper for packaging dates back to 1035,[contradictory] when a Persian traveler visiting markets in Cairo noted that vegetables, spices and hardware were wrapped in paper for the customers after they were sold.[38] Since the First Crusade in 1096, paper manufacturing in Damascus had been interrupted by wars, but its production continued in two other centres. Egypt continued with the thicker paper, while Iran became the center of the thinner papers. Papermaking was diffused across the Islamic world, from where it was diffused further west into Europe.[39] Paper manufacture was introduced to India in the 13th century by Muslim merchants, where it almost wholly replaced traditional writing materials.[35]\\r\\nThe oldest known paper document in the West is the Mozarab Missal of Silos from the 11th century, probably using paper made in the Islamic part of the Iberian Peninsula. They used hemp and linen rags as a source of fiber. The first recorded paper mill in the Iberian Peninsula was in Xtiva in 1056.[40][41] Papermaking reached Europe as early as 1085 in Toledo and was firmly established in Xtiva, Spain by 1150. It is clear that France had a paper mill by 1190, and by 1276 mills were established in Fabriano, Italy and in Treviso and other northern Italian towns by 1340. Papermaking then spread further northwards, with evidence of paper being made in Troyes, France by 1348, in Holland sometime around 1340√ø1350, in Mainz, Germany in 1320, and in Nuremberg by 1390 in a mill set up by Ulman Stromer.[42] This was just about the time when the woodcut printmaking technique was transferred from fabric to paper in the old master print and popular prints. There was a paper mill in Switzerland by 1432 and the first mill in England was set up by John Tate in 1490 near Stevenage in Hertfordshire,[43] but the first commercially successful paper mill in Britain did not occur before 1588 when John Spilman set up a mill near Dartford in Kent.[44] During this time, paper making spread to Poland by 1491, to Austria by 1498, to Russia by 1576, to the Netherlands by 1586, to Denmark by 1596, and to Sweden by 1612.[30]\\r\\nArab prisoners who settled in a town called Borgo Saraceno in the Italian Province of Ferrara introduced Fabriano artisans in the Province of Ancona[clarification needed] the technique of making paper by hand. At the time they were renowned for their wool-weaving and manufacture of cloth. Fabriano papermakers considered the process of making paper by hand an art form and were able to refine the process to successfully compete with parchment which was the primary medium for writing at the time. They developed the application of stamping hammers to reduce rags to pulp for making paper, sizing paper by means of animal glue, and creating watermarks in the paper during its forming process. The Fabriano used glue, obtained by boiling scrolls or scraps of animal skin to size the paper; it is suggested that this technique was recommended by the local tanneries. The introduction of the first European watermarks in Fabriano was linked to applying metal wires on a cover laid against the mould which was used for forming the paper.[45]\\r\\nThey adapted the waterwheels from the fuller's mills to drive a series of 3 wooden hammers per trough. The hammers were raised by their heads by cams fixed to a waterwheel's axle made from a large tree trunk.[46][47]\\r\\nIn the Americas, archaeological evidence indicates that a similar bark-paper writing material was used by the Mayans no later than the 5th century AD.[48] Called amatl, it was in widespread use among Mesoamerican cultures until the Spanish conquest. The paper is created by boiling and pounding the inner bark of trees, until the material becomes suitable for art and writing.\\r\\nThese materials made from pounded reeds and bark are technically not true paper, which is made from pulp, rags, and fibers of plants and cellulose.\\r\\nEuropean papermaking spread to the Americas first in Mexico by 1575 and then in Philadelphia by 1690.[30]\\r\\nThe use of human and animal powered mills was known to Chinese and Muslim papermakers. However, evidence for water-powered paper mills is elusive among both prior to the 11th century.[49][50][51][52] The general absence of the use of water-powered paper mills in Muslim papermaking prior to the 11th century is suggested by the habit of Muslim authors at the time to call a production center not a \\"mill\\", but a \\"paper manufactory\\".[53]\\r\\nDonald Hill has identified a possible reference to a water-powered paper mill in Samarkand, in the 11th-century work of the Persian scholar Abu Rayhan Biruni, but concludes that the passage is \\"too brief to enable us to say with certainty\\" that it refers to a water-powered paper mill.[54] This is seen by Halevi as evidence of Samarkand first harnessing waterpower in the production of paper, but notes that it is not known if waterpower was applied to papermaking elsewhere across the Islamic world at the time.[55] Burns remains sceptical, given the isolated occurrence of the reference and the prevalence of manual labour in Islamic papermaking elsewhere prior to the 13th century.[56]\\r\\nClear evidence of a water-powered paper mill dates to 1282 in the Spanish Kingdom of Aragon.[57] A decree by the Christian king Peter III addresses the establishment of a royal \\"molendinum\\", a proper hydraulic mill, in the paper manufacturing centre of Xtiva.[57] The crown innovation originates from the Muslim Mudjar community in the Moorish quarter of Xtiva, where paper mills were a Muslim Mudejar operated enterprise.[58] However, it appears to be resented by sections of the local Muslim papermakering community; the document guarantees them the right to continue the way of traditional papermaking by beating the pulp manually and grants them the right to be exempted from work in the new mill.[57] Paper making centers began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of parchment and then falling further; paper making centers reached Germany a century later.[59]\\r\\nThe first paper mill north of the Alps was established in Nuremberg by Ulman Stromer in 1390; it is later depicted in the lavishly illustrated Nuremberg Chronicle.[60] From the mid-14th century onwards, European paper milling underwent a rapid improvement of many work processes.[61]\\r\\nBefore the industrialisation of the paper production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, called rags. The rags were from hemp, linen and cotton.[62] A process for removing printing inks from recycled paper was invented by German jurist Justus Claproth in 1774.[62] Today this method is called deinking. It was not until the introduction of wood pulp in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from ragpickers.[62]\\r\\nAlthough cheaper than vellum, paper remained expensive, at least in book-sized quantities, through the centuries, until the advent of steam-driven paper making machines in the 19th century, which could make paper with fibres from wood pulp. Although older machines predated it, the Fourdrinier papermaking machine became the basis for most modern papermaking. Nicholas Louis Robert of Essonnes, France, was granted a patent for a continuous paper making machine in 1799. At the time he was working for Leger Didot with whom he quarrelled over the ownership of the invention. Didot sent his brother-in-law, John Gamble, to meet Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier, stationers of London, who agreed to finance the project. Gamble was granted British patent 2487 on 20 October 1801. With the help particularly of Bryan Donkin, a skilled and ingenious mechanic, an improved version of the Robert original was installed at Frogmore, Hertfordshire, in 1803, followed by another in 1804. A third machine was installed at the Fourdriniers' own mill at Two Waters. The Fourdriniers also bought a mill at St Neots intending to install two machines there and the process and machines continued to develop.\\r\\nHowever, experiments with wood showed no real results in the late 18th century and at the start of the 19th century. By 1800, Matthias Koops (in London, England) further investigated the idea of using wood to make paper, and in 1801 he wrote and published a book titled Historical account of the substances which have been used to describe events, and to convey ideas, from the earliest date, to the invention of paper.[63] His book was printed on paper made from wood shavings (and adhered together). No pages were fabricated using the pulping method (from either rags or wood). He received financial support from the royal family to make his printing machines and acquire the materials and infrastructure needed to start his printing business. But his enterprise was short lived. Only a few years following his first and only printed book (the one he wrote and printed), he went bankrupt. The book was very well done (strong and had a fine appearance), but it was very costly.[64][65][66]\\r\\nThen in the 1830s and 1840s, two men on two different continents took up the challenge, but from a totally new perspective. Both Friedrich Gottlob Keller and Charles Fenerty began experiments with wood but using the same technique used in paper making; instead of pulping rags, they thought about pulping wood. And at about the same time, by mid-1844, they announced their findings. They invented a machine which extracted the fibres from wood (exactly as with rags) and made paper from it. Charles Fenerty also bleached the pulp so that the paper was white. This started a new era for paper making. By the end of the 19th-century almost all printers in the western world were using wood in lieu of rags to make paper.[67]\\r\\nTogether with the invention of the practical fountain pen and the mass-produced pencil of the same period, and in conjunction with the advent of the steam driven rotary printing press, wood based paper caused a major transformation of the 19th century economy and society in industrialized countries. With the introduction of cheaper paper, schoolbooks, fiction, non-fiction, and newspapers became gradually available by 1900. Cheap wood based paper also meant that keeping personal diaries or writing letters became possible and so, by 1850, the clerk, or writer, ceased to be a high-status job.\\r\\nThe original wood-based paper was acidic due to the use of alum and more prone to disintegrate over time, through processes known as slow fires. Documents written on more expensive rag paper were more stable. Mass-market paperback books still use these cheaper mechanical papers (see below), but book publishers can now use acid-free paper for hardback and trade paperback books.\\r\\nDetermining the provenance of paper is a complex process that can be done in a variety of ways. The easiest way is using a known sheet of paper as an exemplar. Using known sheets can produce an exact identification. Next, comparing watermarks with those contained in catalogs or trade listings can yield useful results. Inspecting the surface can also determine age and location by looking for distinct marks from the production process. Chemical and fiber analysis can be used to establish date of creation and perhaps location.[68][page?needed]\\r\\nIt has also become universal to talk of paper \\"mills\\" (even of 400 such mills at Fez!), relating these to the hydraulic wonders of Islamic society in east and west. All our evidence points to non-hydraulic hand production, however, at springs away from rivers which it could pollute.\\r\\nEuropean papermaking differed from its precursors in the mechanization of the process and in the application of water power. Jean Gimpel, in The Medieval Machine (the English translation of La Revolution Industrielle du Moyen Age), points out that the Chinese and Muslims used only human and animal force. Gimpel goes on to say?: \\"This is convincing evidence of how technologically minded the Europeans of that era were. Paper had traveled nearly halfway around the world, but no culture or civilization on its route had tried to mechanize its manufacture.\\"'\\r\\nIndeed, Muslim authors in general call any \\"paper manufactory\\" a wiraqah - not a \\"mill\\" (tahun)","input":"Where did the technique of making paper originate?"},{"output":"Columbia University","context":"Chandler Muriel Bing[1] is a fictional character from the NBC sitcom Friends, portrayed by Matthew Perry.[2] He was born on April 8, 1968, to Nora Tyler Bing (Morgan Fairchild), a romance novelist, and Charles Bing (Kathleen Turner), a gay female impersonator who later had a sex change operation and became the star of a Las Vegas drag show called Viva Las Gay-gas. He is of Scottish and Swedish ancestry. He is an only child and is apparently from an affluent family. Chandler's parents announced their divorce to him over Thanksgiving dinner when he was nine years old, an event which causes him to refuse to celebrate the holiday in his adulthood. It is revealed in season 1 he went to an all-boys high school.\\r\\nChandler's best friend is Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), who was his college roommate. He and Ross were in a band named Way/No Way during college. He met Ross's sister, Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), and her friend, Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), while celebrating Thanksgiving at Ross's House. Chandler was the first person to know about Ross's love for Rachel. He moved to New York City and lives across the hall from Monica and, through her, meets Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow). At some point during this time, Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) moves in with him and they become best friends. Chandler has a very good sense of humor, and is notoriously sarcastic. He is the highest earning member of his friends circle on account of responsible income management, having learned the value of money from a young age. He suffers from commitment issues, but later marries Monica.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChandler works as an IT procurements manager with the specialization \\"Statistical analysis and data reconfiguration,\\" but loathes it. In Season 9, he quits his job and Monica helps him start a new career in advertising.\\r\\nChandler is Ross Geller's roommate in college. Chandler met his friend Rachel Green while celebrating Thanksgiving with the Geller family during his first year at college. On a tip from Monica, Chandler later moved to Apartment #4 in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, across the hall from Monica and her roommate Phoebe Buffay. Actor Joey Tribbiani moves in with Chandler, who becomes his best friend.\\r\\nRoss and Chandler have been best friends since college, where they were roommates at Columbia University. They were in a band together, shared weird hair and fashion styles, and graduated from college in 1991.[3]\\r\\nUntil moving in with Monica, Chandler shared an apartment with his best friend Joey Tribbiani. Chandler and Joey's apartment is an important focal point for the series as one of the few meeting areas of the gang. The two form a close and enduring friendship, and get into many humorous situations.\\r\\nWhen Chandler is first considering Joey as a roommate, the two start off on the wrong foot when Joey says that he \\"is cool with the gay thing\\" (Joey assuming Chandler was gay). Joey comes to fill the slot, only Chandler had already chosen a roommate √ø a fashion photographer with a porn-star sister. But after their eccentric neighbor Mr. Heckles (Larry Hankin) tells the photographer that he is Chandler's new roommate and is able to open Chandler's unlocked door, the photographer leaves. This forces Chandler to give the keys to Joey and they find out they had a lot in common, including a fondness for sports and beer. Chandler often supports Joey throughout the show, paying the rent, paying for Joey's head-shots, buying most of the food and even give money to Joey for his numerous dates. Joey tries to repay Chandler by giving him the only ticket to the premire of his new movie. Unfortunately, Chandler falls asleep. Later that episode, Joey insists on paying back every penny that he owes Chandler until he realizes exactly how much he owes him.\\r\\nThe relationship between the two is balanced: Joey looks to Chandler as his intellectual superior, while Chandler acknowledges Joey as the more confident counterpart, especially when it comes to getting women. One of their recurring moments involves Chandler understanding something and waiting in silence until Joey catches on.\\r\\nChandler and Rachel originally did not like each other, but grew to become good friends. In \\"The One with All the Cheesecakes\\" Chandler and Rachel steal and share the cheesecake which originally belonged to their downstairs neighbor. Rachel, who works for Ralph Lauren, is also the one who helps Chandler pick out his wedding suit. Rachel also sets up Chandler with her boss Joanna (Alison LaPlaca). Rachel and Chandler never have any romantic relationships apart from a glance back to their time in college when they made out.\\r\\nChandler and Phoebe are good friends. They sometimes are goofy and have fun with one another. In \\"The One with the Metaphorical Tunnel\\", Phoebe and Chandler play hide and seek. They also play games, like coming up with Superhero names and reclining the Barcaloungers like cowboys. They share a duet of \\"Endless Love\\" at the end of one episode, when Chandler is sad after a breakup with his on-off girlfriend Janice (Maggie Wheeler). In \\"The One Where Everyone Finds Out\\", she tries to trick him into believing that she is attracted to him, but Monica tells him that Phoebe finds him charming in a \\"sexless\\" way, indicating that any hints of romance are jokes. Phoebe is the initial reason that Chandler quit smoking in \\"The One With the Thumb\\", after an argument between the group about his smoking. He is leaving the apartment when she offers him $7,000 to never smoke again.\\r\\nChandler is brash, zany, and estranged from both of his parents. He suffers from commitment issues, brought on by growing up in a broken home with no idea of what a stable marriage looks like, can be neurotic and extremely defensive, with humour as his shield. Chandler also associates everything that links to his parents' divorce in a negative light, specifically Thanksgiving where his parents reveal their separation over a turkey where his father plans to run away with the bus boy.\\r\\nBoth of Chandler's parents are extremely sexually promiscuous, and he has made several allusions to having caught them during sexual acts. Most of these involve his father with other men. Among other things, he alludes to having witnessed orgies by the time he was seven years old, and playing \\"the far left\\" background dancer during his father's rendition of It's Raining Men when he was growing up. His mother Nora is a world famous writer of erotic novels, which is demonstrated when Rachel's short-term boyfriend Paulo - who is Italian and barely speaks any English - is shown to know her.\\r\\nChandler began smoking when he was nine years old after his parents announced their divorce. Chandler is first seen smoking during the first season and is chastised by his friends for breaking his non-smoking streak of three years. He does a fairly good job at controlling his habit throughout the series' run, although a few times he cannot resist temptation and has a single cigarette or just a single drag off someone else's. His only major relapse occurs in season 9 when he stays in Oklahoma four days a week for work and smoked \\"three cartons in three days\\" because all his colleagues lit up during work meetings. He promises Monica never to smoke again, and is not seen smoking in the series after this point.\\r\\nHis middle name, \\"Muriel,\\" was revealed in the beginning of \\"The One With Rachel's Date,\\" where one of his co-workers thinks his name is Toby.\\r\\nChandler's main catch phrase is starting sentences with \\"Could that BE any more...\\"\\r\\nChandler is afraid of commitment and had the fewest relationships out of all the Friends. Despite all this, he is the first one to have a committed marriage that doesn't end in divorce.\\r\\nAt Ross's wedding in London, Monica and Chandler sleep together and decide to begin dating. They try to keep their relationship secret, as they are unsure about how the others would react. Eventually, however, they all find out. Their wedding is officiated by Joey, who is ordained over the Internet. In the final episode, Monica and Chandler adopt twins, due to their inability to conceive.\\r\\nMonica's bossiness, neatness and overly competitive nature forces Chandler into several situations, such as her being unable to throw a game of tennis against Chandler's boss and Chandler hiding the fact that he is incredibly good at ping-pong so Monica won't enter them in doubles tournaments.\\r\\nBefore his relationship with Monica, Chandler has an on-and-off relationship with Janice Hosenstein (Maggie Wheeler). She is a regular feature in his life, even though he regretted dating her and kept ending their relationship in season 1. He dates her again in season 2, but it ends up in a break-up. However, Janice makes further appearances later in the series.\\r\\nKathy (Paget Brewster) makes an appearance in the fourth season of Friends. Chandler sees her in Central Perk and asks the gang if he should ask her out, only to learn that she was already waiting for a date with Joey. She is an actress and Chandler eventually dates her until he gets extremely paranoid when she shares a sex scene with her co-star prompting a big fight between the two. Ironically it was Chandler's own paranoia that drove Kathy to having an affair with the same person.\\r\\nChandler works as an IT procurements manager with the specialization \\"Statistical analysis and data reconfiguration\\", which he takes up as temporary work. Despite disliking his job, Chandler is unable to quit his job as it is his nature to avoid ending anything forcefully. His friends do not understand what he does; during the contest for Monica and Rachel's apartment, Rachel guesses \\"Transponster\\" for his job title.\\r\\nIn the episode \\"The One Where Emma Cries\\", Chandler falls asleep during a meeting and on waking, realizes that he had agreed to head the new division in Tulsa. Chandler quits his job on Christmas, so that he can fly home to New York to be with Monica. Monica helps Chandler secure a job in advertising through an old colleague of hers. Much to Chandler's dismay, he begins as an intern. However, his more mature approach eventually pays off, and he secures a full-time job in the business as a junior copywriter.","input":"Where did ross and chandler go to college?"},{"output":"Around 1860","context":"This is a timeline of the history of drug prohibition in the United States.\\r\\nAround 1860: Efforts to regulate the sale of pharmaceuticals began, and laws were introduced on a state-to-state basis that created penalties for mislabeling drugs, adulterating them with undisclosed narcotics, and improper sale of those considered \\"poisons\\". Poison laws generally either required labels on the packaging indicating the harmful effects of the drugs or prohibited sale outside of licensed pharmacies and without a doctor's prescription. Prominent pharmaceutical societies at the time supported the listing of cannabis as a poison.[1]\\r\\n1880: The U.S. and Qing Dynasty China complete an agreement prohibiting the shipment of opium between the two countries; Qing China itself was still reeling from the effects of fighting the Opium War after a failed attempt to stem the British importing of opium into China proper (see Lin Zexu).\\r\\n1906: The Pure Food and Drug Act requires that certain specified drugs, including alcohol, cocaine, heroin, morphine, and cannabis, be accurately labeled with contents and dosage. Previously many drugs had been sold as patent medicines with secret ingredients or misleading labels. Cocaine, heroin, cannabis, and other such drugs continued to be legally available without prescription as long as they were labeled. It is estimated that sale of patent medicines containing opiates decreased by 33% after labeling was mandated.[2]\\r\\n1911: United States first Opium Commissioner, Hamilton Wright argues that of all the nations of the world, the United States consumes most habit-forming drugs per capita.[3]\\r\\n1913: The American Medical Association created a propaganda department to outlaw health fraud and quackery.[4] In the same year, California outlawed cannabis.\\r\\n1914: The first recorded instance of the United States enacting a ban on the domestic distribution of drugs is the Harrison Narcotic Act[5] of 1914. This act was presented and passed as a method of regulating the production and distribution of opiate-containing substances under the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution, but a [1] section of the act was later interpreted by law enforcement officials for the purpose of prosecuting doctors who prescribe opiates to addicts.\\r\\n1919: Alcohol prohibition in the U.S. first appeared under numerous provincial bans and was eventually codified under a federal constitutional amendment in 1919, having been approved by 36 of the 48 U.S. states.\\r\\n1925: United States supported regulation of cannabis as a drug in the International Opium Convention.[6] and by the mid-1930s all member states had some regulation of cannabis.\\r\\n1930: The Federal Bureau of Narcotics was created.

This law, however, was something of a \\"Catch-22\\", as obtaining a tax stamp required individuals to first present their goods, which was an action tantamount to confession. This act was passed by Congress on the basis of testimony and public perception that marijuana caused insanity, criminality, and death.\\r\\n1951: The 1951 Boggs Act increased penalties fourfold, including mandatory penalties.[8]\\r\\n1956: The Daniel Act increased penalties by a factor of eight over those specified in the Boggs Act.

It is not a true berry but a cone with unusually fleshy and merged scales, which give it a berry-like appearance. The cones from a handful of species, especially Juniperus communis, are used as a spice, particularly in European cuisine, and also give gin its distinctive flavour. Juniper berries have been called the only spice derived from conifers,[1] although tar and inner bark from pine trees is sometimes considered a spice as well.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll juniper species grow berries, but some are considered too bitter to eat. In addition to J. communis, other edible species include Juniperus drupacea,[2][3] Juniperus phoenicea,[4] Juniperus deppeana, and Juniperus californica.[5] But the berries of some species, such as Juniperus sabina, are toxic and consumption of them is inadvisable.[6]\\r\\nJuniperus communis berries vary from four to twelve?millimeters in diameter; other species are mostly similar in size, though some are larger, notably J. drupacea (20√ø28?mm). Unlike the separated and woody scales of a typical pine cone, those in a juniper berry remain fleshy and merge into a unified covering surrounding the seeds. The berries are green when young, and mature to a purple-black colour over about 18 months in most species, including J. communis (shorter, 8√ø10 months in a few species, and about 24 months in J. drupacea).[2] The mature, dark berries are usually but not exclusively used in cuisine, while gin is flavoured with fully grown but immature green berries.[1]\\r\\nThe flavor profile of young, green berries is dominated by pinene; as they mature this piney, resinous backdrop is joined by what Harold McGee describes as \\"green-fresh\\" and citrus notes.[7] The outer scales of the berries are relatively flavourless, so the berries are almost always at least lightly crushed before being used as a spice. They are used both fresh and dried, but their flavour and odour are at their strongest immediately after harvest and decline during drying and storage.\\r\\nJuniper berries are used in northern European and particularly Scandinavian cuisine to \\"impart a sharp, clear flavor\\"[1] to meat dishes, especially wild birds (including thrush, blackbird, and woodcock) and game meats (including boar and venison).[8] They also season pork, cabbage, and sauerkraut dishes. Traditional recipes for choucroute garnie, an Alsatian dish of sauerkraut and meats, universally include juniper berries.[9] Besides Norwegian and Swedish dishes, juniper berries are also sometimes used in German, Austrian, Czech, Polish and Hungarian cuisine, often with roasts (such as German sauerbraten). Northern Italian cuisine, especially that of the South Tyrol, also incorporates juniper berries.\\r\\nJuniper, typically Juniperus communis, is used to flavor gin, a liquor developed in the 17th century in the Netherlands. The name gin itself is derived from either the French genivre or the Dutch jenever, which both mean \\"juniper\\".[1] Other juniper-flavoured beverages include the Finnish rye-and-juniper beer known as sahti, which is flavored with both juniper berries and branches.[10] The brand Dry Soda produces a juniper-berry soda as part of its lineup. Recently, some American distilleries have begun using 'New World' varieties of juniper such as Juniperus occidentalis.[11]\\r\\nA few North American juniper species produce a seed cone with a sweeter, less resinous flavor than those typically used as a spice. For example, one field guide describes the flesh of the berries of Juniperus californica as \\"dry, mealy, and fibrous but sweet and without resin cells\\".[12] Such species have been used not just as a seasoning but as a nutritive food by some Native Americans.[13] In addition to medical and culinary purposes, Native Americans have also used the seeds inside juniper berries as beads for jewellery and decoration.[13]\\r\\nAn essential oil extracted from juniper berries is used in aromatherapy and perfumery.[4]\\r\\nWhile classified as generally recognized as safe in the US,[14] juniper berries may have various side effects that have not been tested extensively in clinical trials.[15] Mainly due to an increased risk of miscarriage, even in small doses, consuming juniper berries may affect pregnant or breastfeeding women[16] and people with diabetes, bleeding disorders or after surgery.[16] In traditional medicine, juniper berries were used for female birth control.[13] In an in vitro study, juniper essential oil was studied for its possible antimicrobial and antifungal properties.[17]\\r\\nJuniper berries, including Juniperus phoenicea and Juniperus oxycedrus have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs at multiple sites. J. oxycedrus is not known to grow in Egypt, and neither is Juniperus excelsa, which was found along with J. oxycedrus in the tomb of Tutankhamun.[18] The berries imported into Egypt may have come from Greece; the Greeks record using juniper berries as a medicine long before mentioning their use in food.[19] The Greeks used the berries in many of their Olympics events because of their belief that the berries increased physical stamina in athletes.[20] The Romans used juniper berries as a cheap domestically produced substitute for the expensive black pepper and long pepper imported from India.[4] It was also used as an adulterant, as reported in Pliny the Elder's Natural History: \\"Pepper is adulterated with juniper berries, which have the property, to a marvellous degree, of assuming the pungency of pepper.\\"[21] Pliny also incorrectly asserted that black pepper grew on trees that were \\"very similar in appearance to our junipers\\".","input":"What kind of juniper is used to make gin?"},{"output":"July 1940","context":"","input":"When did the battle of britain ww2 start?"},{"output":"Rebecca Lee Crumpler","context":"Rebecca Lee Crumpler, ne Davis, (February 8, 1831?√ø March 9, 1895) was an African American physician and author.

Crumpler later attended the elite West Newton English and Classical School in Massachusetts where she was a \\"special student in mathematics.\\"\\r\\nShe moved to Charlestown, Massachusetts, in 1852.[7] During the next eight years, Crumpler was employed as a nurse[2][1][nb 3] until she was accepted into the New England Female Medical College in 1860. This school was founded by Dr. Israel Tisdale and Samuel Gregory[8].[2][1] It was rare for women or black men to be admitted to medical schools during this time. However, because of how strikingly talented Crumpler was as a medical apprentice her \\"supervising doctor recommended her to this school\\"[9].[1] That year, there were 54,543 physicians in the United States, 300 of whom were women. None of them were African-American women.[7]. The faculty was hesitant to pass Crumpler because they thought she showed a slow progress in learning. They ended up passing her but they felt pressured to do so.? The doctors who Crumpler worked with while in medical school helped persuade the faculty to pass her[10].

Claims have been made that she was \\"homeopathically trained\\", and gained a lot of knowledge from other pioneers in her field at the medical college[11]. However, Crumpler and the many other pioneers are not recognized, nor does \\"history record them as homeopathic practitioners.\\"[12] She won a tuition award from the Wade Scholarship Fund, which was established by the Ohio abolitionist, Benjamin Wade.[13] After having completed three years of coursework and a thesis, she gave her final oral examinations in February 1864. On March 1, 1864, the board of trustees named her a Doctor of Medicine,[1] making her the first African-American woman in the United States to earn the degree, and the only African-American woman to graduate from New England Female Medical College.[2] The school closed in 1873 due to financial issues[14] , without graduating another black woman.[2][1] It merged with Boston University School of Medicine and \\"adopted an exclusively homeopathic allegiance\\"[15].

The second portion of the books mainly focuses on womanhood and \\"distressing complaints\\" from youth to mature women[26].Crumpler describes the progression of experiences that led her to study and practice medicine in her A Book of Medical Discourses (1883):\\r\\nIt may be well to state here that, having been reared by a kind aunt in Pennsylvania, whose usefulness with the sick was continually sought, I early conceived a liking for, and sought every opportunity to relieve the sufferings of others. Later in life I devoted my time, when best I could, to nursing as a business, serving under different doctors for a period of eight years (from 1852 to 1860); most of the time at my adopted home in Charlestown, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. From these doctors I received letters commending me to the faculty of the New England Female Medical College, whence, four years afterward, I received the degree of Doctress of Medicine.[27][28]\\r\\nWhile living in Charlestown, Rebecca married Wyatt Lee, a Virginia native and former slave. They were married on April 19, 1852.[7][29] Rebecca was still a medical student when her husband Wyatt died of Phthisis pulmonalis (tuberculosis) on April 18, 1863. He is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Boston.[30] Her M.D. Degree was awarded under her married name, Rebecca Lee.[31]\\r\\nIn Saint John, New Brunswick, on May 24, 1865, Rebecca married Arthur Crumpler,[32][33] a former fugitive slave from Southampton County, Virginia. Born in 1824, he was the son of Samuel Crumpler, a slave of Benjamin Crumpler. Arthur lived on the neighboring estate of a large landowner, Robert Adams. He served with the Union Army at Fort Monroe, Virginia as a blacksmith, based upon his training and experience. He went to Massachusetts in 1862 and was taken in by Nathaniel Allen, founder of the West Newton English and Classical School, called the Allen School.[34][35]\\r\\nRebecca and Arthur were active members of the Twelfth Baptist Church where Arthur was a trustee, and in mid-December, 1870, their daughter, Lizzie Sinclair Crumpler, was born at their 20 Garden Street home.[36]\\r\\nCrumpler spoke at a service for Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner upon his death in 1874. She read a poem that she had written for him, where \\"she touchingly alluded to his love for the gifted Emerson.\\"[37] By 1880, Rebecca and Arthur moved to Hyde Park, Boston.[34]\\r\\nAlthough \\"no photos or other images\\" of Crumpler survive,[2] a Boston Globe article described her as \\"a very pleasant and intellectual woman and an indefatigable church worker. Dr. Crumpler is 59 or 60 years of age, tall and straight, with light brown skin and gray hair.\\"[38] About marriage, she said the secret to a successful marriage \\"is to continue in the careful routine of the courting days, till it becomes well understood between the two.\\"[34]\\r\\nRebecca Crumpler died on March 9, 1895, in Fairview, Massachusetts, while still residing in Hyde Park.[34] She and her husband Arthur are both buried at the Fairview Cemetery near their residence in Hyde Park.[39] Arthur died in Boston in 1910.[40][41]\\r\\nThe Rebecca Lee Society, one of the first medical societies for African-American women, was named in her honor.[1] Her home on Joy Street is a stop on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.[42] Dr. Maass Robinson and Dr. Patricia Whitley made this life-long legacy become reality.\\r\\nAt Syracuse University there is a pre-health club named The Rebecca Lee Pre-Health Society.?

Recognised as a film and fashion icon, Hepburn was active during Hollywood's Golden Age. She was ranked by the American Film Institute as the third-greatest female screen legend in Golden Age Hollywood and was inducted into the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame. Born in Ixelles, a district of Brussels, Hepburn spent her childhood between Belgium, England and the Netherlands. In Amsterdam, she studied ballet with Sonia Gaskell before moving to London in 1948, continuing her ballet training with Marie Rambert, and then performing as a chorus girl in West End musical theatre productions.\\r\\nFollowing minor appearances in several films, Hepburn starred in the 1951 Broadway play Gigi after being spotted by French novelist Colette, on whose work the play was based. She shot to stardom for playing the lead role in Roman Holiday (1953), for which she was the first actress to win an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award for a single performance. The same year Hepburn won a Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Play for her performance in Ondine. She went on to star in a number of successful films, such as Sabrina (1954), The Nun's Story (1959), Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), Charade (1963), My Fair Lady (1964) and Wait Until Dark (1967), for which she received Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations. Hepburn won three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. In recognition of her film career, she was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from BAFTA, the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award and the Special Tony Award. She remains one of the 12 people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy and Tony Awards.\\r\\nHepburn appeared in fewer films as her life went on, devoting much of her later life to UNICEF. She had contributed to the organisation since 1954, then worked in some of the poorest communities of Africa, South America and Asia between 1988 and 1992. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of her work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in December 1992. A month later, Hepburn died of appendiceal cancer at her home in Switzerland at the age of 63.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHepburn was born Audrey Kathleen Ruston or Edda Kathleen Hepburn-Ruston[1] on 4 May 1929 at number 48 Rue Keyenveld in Ixelles, a municipality in Brussels, Belgium.[2]\\r\\nHer father, Joseph Victor Anthony Ruston (21 November 1889?√ø?16 October 1980), was a British subject born in Auschitz, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary.[3][a] He was the son of Victor John George Ruston, of British and Austrian descent[4] and Anna Wels, of Austrian descent.[5] In 1923-24, Joseph had briefly been an honorary British consul in Samarang in the Dutch East Indies[6] and prior to his marriage to Hepburn's mother he had been married to Cornelia Bisschop, a Dutch heiress.[3][7] Although born with the surname Ruston, he later double-barrelled his name to the more \\"aristocratic\\" Hepburn-Ruston, mistakenly believing himself descended from James Hepburn, third husband of Mary, Queen of Scots.[4][7]\\r\\nHepburn's mother, Baroness Ella van Heemstra (12 June 1900?√ø?26 August 1984), was a Dutch noblewoman. She was the daughter of Baron Aarnoud van Heemstra, who served as mayor of Arnhem from 1910 to 1920 and as Governor of Dutch Suriname from 1921 to 1928, and Baroness Elbrig Willemine Henriette van Asbeck (1873√ø1939).[8] At the age of nineteen, Ella had married Jonkheer Hendrik Gustaaf Adolf Quarles van Ufford, an oil executive based in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, where they subsequently lived.[9] They had two sons, Jonkheer Arnoud Robert Alexander Quarles van Ufford (1920√ø1979) and Jonkheer Ian Edgar Bruce Quarles van Ufford (1924√ø2010), before divorcing in 1925.[7][10]\\r\\nHepburn's parents were married in Batavia in September 1926.[9] At the time, Ruston worked for a trading company, but soon after the marriage, the couple relocated to Europe, where he began working for a loan company. After a year in London, they moved to Brussels, where he had been assigned to open a branch office.[9][11] After three years spent travelling between Brussels, Arnhem, The Hague and London, the family settled in the suburban Brussels municipality of Linkebeek in 1932.[9][12] Hepburn's early childhood was sheltered and privileged.[9] As a result of her multinational background and travelling with her family due to her father's job,[13][b] she learned to speak five languages: Dutch and English from her parents, and later varying degrees of French, Spanish, and Italian.\\r\\nIn the mid-1930s, Hepburn's parents recruited and collected donations for the British Union of Fascists.[14] Joseph left the family abruptly in 1935 and moved to London, where he became more deeply involved in Fascist activity and never visited his daughter abroad.[15] Hepburn later professed that her father's departure was \\"the most traumatic event of my life\\".[9][16] That same year, her mother moved with Hepburn to her family's estate in Arnhem. Sometime in 1937, Ella and Hepburn moved to Kent, England, where Hepburn was educated at a small independent school in Elham.[17][18]\\r\\nHepburn's parents officially divorced in 1938. In the 1960s, Hepburn renewed contact with her father after locating him in Dublin through the Red Cross; although he remained emotionally detached, Hepburn supported him financially until his death.[19]\\r\\nAfter Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, Hepburn's mother relocated her daughter back to Arnhem in the hope that, as during the First World War, the Netherlands would remain neutral and be spared a German attack. While there, Hepburn attended the Arnhem Conservatory from 1939 to 1945. She had begun taking ballet lessons during her last years at boarding school, and continued training in Arnhem under the tutelage of Winja Marova, becoming her \\"star pupil\\".[9] After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, Hepburn used the name Edda van Heemstra, because an \\"English-sounding\\" name was considered dangerous during the German occupation. Her family was profoundly affected by the occupation, with Hepburn later stating that \\"had we known that we were going to be occupied for five years, we might have all shot ourselves. We thought it might be over next week ... six months ... next year ... that's how we got through\\".[9] In 1942, her uncle, Otto van Limburg Stirum (husband of her mother's older sister, Miesje), was executed in retaliation for an act of sabotage by the resistance movement; while he had not been involved in the act, he was targeted due to his family's prominence in Dutch society.[9] Hepburn's half-brother Ian was deported to Berlin to work in a German labour camp, and her other half-brother Alex went into hiding to avoid the same fate.[9]\\r\\nAfter her uncle's death, Hepburn, Ella and Miesje left Arnhem to live with her grandfather, Baron Aarnoud van Heemstra, in nearby Velp.[9] Food was scarce during this time and during the Dutch famine of 1944 and 1945 Hepburn and her family had to use tulip bulbs to make flour for bread. Around the same time Hepburn also performed silent dance performances in order to raise money for the Dutch resistance effort.[20] It was long believed that during this time, Hepburn participated in the Dutch resistance.[9] In 2016, the Airborne Museum 'Hartenstein' reported that after extensive research it had not found any evidence of such activities.[21] In addition to other traumatic events, she witnessed the transportation of Dutch Jews to concentration camps, later stating that \\"more than once I was at the station seeing trainloads of Jews being transported, seeing all these faces over the top of the wagon. I remember, very sharply, one little boy standing with his parents on the platform, very pale, very blond, wearing a coat that was much too big for him, and he stepped on the train. I was a child observing a child.\\"[22]\\r\\nAfter the Allied landing on D-Day, living conditions grew worse and Arnhem was subsequently heavily damaged during Operation Market Garden. During the Dutch famine that followed in the winter of 1944, the Germans blocked the resupply routes of the Dutch people's already-limited food and fuel supplies as retaliation for railway strikes that were held to hinder German occupation. Like others, Hepburn's family resorted to making flour out of tulip bulbs to bake cakes and biscuits;[23][24] she developed acute an?mia, respiratory problems and edema as a result of malnutrition.[25] The van Heemstra family was also seriously financially affected by the occupation, during which many of their properties, including their principal estate in Arnhem, were badly damaged or destroyed.[26] The Allies liberated the Netherlands in May 1945, with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration beginning the distribution of food and other essentials.[9][27]\\r\\nAfter the war ended in 1945, Hepburn moved with her mother and siblings to Amsterdam, where she began ballet training under Sonia Gaskell, a leading figure in Dutch ballet, and Russian Olga Tarassova.[28]\\r\\nAs the family's fortunes had been lost during the war, Ella supported them by working as a cook and housekeeper for a wealthy family.[29] Hepburn made her film debut in 1948, playing an air stewardess in Dutch in Seven Lessons, an educational travel film made by Charles van der Linden and Henry Josephson.[30]\\r\\nLater that year, Hepburn moved to London to take up a ballet scholarship with Ballet Rambert, which was then based in Notting Hill. [31][c] She supported herself with part-time work as a model, and dropped \\"Ruston\\" from her surname. After she was told by Rambert that despite her talent, her height and weak constitution (the after-effect of wartime malnutrition) would make the status of prima ballerina unattainable, she decided to concentrate on acting.[32][33][34]\\r\\nWhile Ella worked in menial jobs to support them, Hepburn appeared as a chorus girl[35] in the West End musical theatre revues High Button Shoes (1948) at the London Hippodrome, and Cecil Landeau's Sauce Tartare (1949) and Sauce Piquante (1950) at the Cambridge Theatre. During her theatrical work, she took elocution lessons with actor Felix Aylmer to develop her voice.[36] After being spotted by a casting director while performing in Sauce Piquante, Hepburn was registered as a freelance actress with the Associated British Picture Corporation. She appeared in the BBC Teleplay The Silent Village,[37] as well as minor roles in the 1951 films One Wild Oat, Laughter in Paradise, Young Wives' Tale and The Lavender Hill Mob, before being cast in her first major supporting role in Thorold Dickinson's The Secret People (1952), in which she played a prodigious ballerina, performing all of her own dancing sequences.[38]\\r\\nHepburn was then offered a small role in a film being shot in both English and French, Monte Carlo Baby (French: Nous Irons  Monte Carlo, 1952), which was filmed in Monte Carlo. Coincidentally, French novelist Colette was at the H?tel de Paris in Monte Carlo during the filming, and decided to cast Hepburn in the title role in the Broadway play Gigi.[39] Hepburn went into rehearsals having never spoken on stage and required private coaching.[40] When Gigi opened at the Fulton Theatre on 24 November 1951, she received praise for her performance, despite criticism that the stage version was inferior to the French film adaptation.[41] Life called her a \\"hit\\",[41] while The New York Times stated that \\"her quality is so winning and so right that she is the success of the evening\\".[40] She also received a Theatre World Award for the role.[42] The play ran for 219 performances, closing on 31 May 1952,[42] before going on tour which began 13 October 1952 in Pittsburgh and visited Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Washington D.C. and Los Angeles before closing on 16 May 1953 in San Francisco.[9]\\r\\nHepburn had her first starring role in Roman Holiday (1953), playing Princess Ann, a European princess who, while escaping the reins of royalty, falls in love with an American newsman (Gregory Peck). Its producers initially wanted Elizabeth Taylor for the role, but director William Wyler was so impressed by Hepburn's screen test that he cast her instead. Wyler later commented, \\"She had everything I was looking for: charm, innocence, and talent. She also was very funny. She was absolutely enchanting and we said, 'That's the girl!'\\"[43] Originally, the film was to have had only Gregory Peck's name above its title, with \\"Introducing Audrey Hepburn\\" beneath in smaller font. However, Peck suggested to Wyler that he elevate her to equal billing so that her name appeared before the title and in type as large as his: \\"You've got to change that because she'll be a big star and I'll look like a big jerk.\\"[44]\\r\\nThe film was a box office success, and Hepburn gained critical acclaim for her portrayal, unexpectedly winning an Academy Award for Best Actress, a BAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress √ø Motion Picture Drama in 1953. In his review in The New York Times, A. H. Weiler wrote: \\"Although she is not precisely a newcomer to films Audrey Hepburn, the British actress who is being starred for the first time as Princess Anne, is a slender, elfin and wistful beauty, alternately regal and childlike in her profound appreciation of newly-found, simple pleasures and love. Although she bravely smiles her acknowledgement of the end of that affair, she remains a pitifully lonely figure facing a stuffy future.\\"[45]\\r\\nHepburn was signed to a seven-picture contract with Paramount with 12 months in between films to allow her time for stage work.[46] She was featured on 7 September 1953 cover of TIME magazine, and also became noted for her personal style.[47] Following her success in Roman Holiday, Hepburn starred in Billy Wilder's romantic Cinderella-story comedy Sabrina (1954), in which wealthy brothers (Humphrey Bogart and William Holden) compete for the affections of their chauffeur's innocent daughter (Hepburn). For her performance, she was nominated for the 1954 Academy Award for Best Actress while winning the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role the same year. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times stated that she was \\"a young lady of extraordinary range of sensitive and moving expressions within such a frail and slender frame. She is even more luminous as the daughter and pet of the servants' hall than she was as a princess last year, and no more than that can be said.\\"[48]\\r\\nHepburn also returned to the stage in 1954, playing a water spirit who falls in love with a human in the fantasy play Ondine on Broadway. A New York Times critic commented that \\"somehow Miss Hepburn is able to translate [its intangibles] into the language of the theatre without artfulness or precociousness. She gives a pulsing performance that is all grace and enchantment, disciplined by an instinct for the realities of the stage\\". Her performance won her the 1954 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play the same year she won the Academy Award for Roman Holiday, making her one of three actresses to receive the Academy and Tony Awards for Best Actress in the same year (the other two are Shirley Booth and Ellen Burstyn).[49] During the production, Hepburn and her co-star Mel Ferrer began a relationship, and were married on 25 September 1954 in Switzerland.[50]\\r\\nAlthough she appeared in no new film releases in 1955, Hepburn received the Golden Globe for World Film Favorite that year.[51] Having become one of Hollywood's most popular box-office attractions, she went on to star in a series of successful films during the remainder of the decade, including her BAFTA- and Golden Globe-nominated role as Natasha Rostova in War and Peace (1956), an adaptation of the Tolstoy novel set during the Napoleonic wars, starring Henry Fonda and her husband Mel Ferrer. In 1957, she exhibited her dancing abilities in her debut musical film, Funny Face (1957) wherein Fred Astaire, a fashion photographer, discovers a beatnik bookstore clerk (Hepburn) who, lured by a free trip to Paris, becomes a beautiful model. The same year Hepburn starred in another romantic comedy, Love in the Afternoon, alongside Gary Cooper and Maurice Chevalier.\\r\\nHepburn played Sister Luke in The Nun's Story (1959), which focuses on the character's struggle to succeed as a nun, alongside co-star Peter Finch. The role produced a third Academy Award nomination for Hepburn and earned her a second BAFTA Award. A review in Variety read, \\"Hepburn has her most demanding film role, and she gives her finest performance\\", while Films in Review stated that her performance \\"will forever silence those who have thought her less an actress than a symbol of the sophisticated child/woman. Her portrayal of Sister Luke is one of the great performances of the screen.\\"[52] Reportedly, she spent hours in convents and with members of the Church to bring truth to her portrayal, stating that she \\"gave more time, energy and thought to this than to any of my previous screen performances.\\"[53]\\r\\nFollowing The Nun's Story, Hepburn received a lukewarm reception for starring with Anthony Perkins in the romantic adventure Green Mansions (1959), in which she played Rima, a jungle girl who falls in love with a Venezuelan traveller,[54] and The Unforgiven (1960), her only western film, in which she appeared opposite Burt Lancaster and Lillian Gish in a story of racism against a group of Native Americans.[55]\\r\\nHepburn next starred as New York call girl Holly Golightly in Blake Edwards's Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), a film loosely based on the Truman Capote novella of the same name. Capote disapproved of many changes that were made to sanitise the story for the film adaptation, and would have preferred Marilyn Monroe to have been cast in the role, although he also stated that Hepburn \\"did a terrific job\\".[56] The character is considered one of the best-known in American cinema, and a defining role for Hepburn.[57] The dress she wears during the opening credits is considered an icon of the twentieth century and perhaps the most famous \\"little black dress\\" of all time.[58][59][60][61] Hepburn stated that the role was \\"the jazziest of my career\\"[62] yet admitted: \\"I'm an introvert. Playing the extroverted girl was the hardest thing I ever did.\\"[63] She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.\\r\\nThe same year, Hepburn also starred in William Wyler's controversial drama The Children's Hour (1961), in which she and Shirley MacLaine played teachers whose lives become troubled after a student accuses them of being lesbians.[57] Due to the social mores of the time, the film and Hepburn's performance went largely unmentioned, both critically and commercially. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times opined that the film \\"is not too well acted\\" with the exception of Hepburn who \\"gives the impression of being sensitive and pure\\" of its \\"muted theme\\",[64] while Variety magazine also complimented Hepburn's \\"soft sensitivity, mar-velous  [sic] projection and emotional understatement\\" adding that Hepburn and MacLaine \\"beautifully complement each other\\".[65]\\r\\nHepburn next appeared opposite Cary Grant in the comic thriller Charade (1963), playing a young widow pursued by several men who chase the fortune stolen by her murdered husband. The 59-year-old Grant, who had previously withdrawn from the starring male lead roles in Roman Holiday and Sabrina, was sensitive about his age difference with 34-year-old Hepburn, and was uncomfortable about the romantic interplay. To satisfy his concerns, the filmmakers agreed to change the screenplay so that Hepburn's character romantically pursued his.[66] The film turned out to be a positive experience for him, stating that \\"All I want for Christmas is another picture with Audrey Hepburn.\\"[67] The role earned Hepburn her third and final competitive BAFTA Award and another Golden Globe nomination. Critic Bosley Crowther was less kind to her performance, stating that \\"Hepburn is cheerfully committed to a mood of how-nuts-can-you-be in an obviously comforting assortment of expensive Givenchy costumes.\\"[68]\\r\\nHepburn reteamed with her Sabrina co-star William Holden in Paris When It Sizzles (1964), a screwball comedy in which she played the young assistant of a Hollywood screenwriter, who aids his writer's block by acting out his fantasies of possible plots. Its production was troubled by a number of problems. Holden unsuccessfully tried to rekindle a romance with the now-married Hepburn, and his alcoholism was beginning to affect his work. After principal photography began, she demanded the dismissal of cinematographer Claude Renoir after seeing what she felt were unflattering dailies.[69] Superstitious, she also insisted on dressing room 55 because that was her lucky number and required that Givenchy, her long-time designer, be given a credit in the film for her perfume.[69] Dubbed \\"marshmallow-weight hokum\\" by Variety upon its release in April,[70] the film was \\"uniformly panned\\"[69] but critics were kinder to Hepburn's performance, describing her as \\"a refreshingly individual creature in an era of the exaggerated curve\\".[70]\\r\\nHepburn's second film of 1964 was George Cukor's film adaptation of the stage musical My Fair Lady, released in November. Soundstage wrote that \\"not since Gone with the Wind has a motion picture created such universal excitement as My Fair Lady\\",[49] yet Hepburn's casting in the role of Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle sparked controversy. Julie Andrews, who had originated the role in the stage show, had not been offered the part because producer Jack L. Warner thought Hepburn or Elizabeth Taylor were more \\"bankable\\" propositions. Hepburn initially asked Warner to give the role to Andrews but was eventually cast. Further friction was created when, although non-singer Hepburn had sung in Funny Face and had lengthy vocal preparation for the role in My Fair Lady, her vocals were dubbed by Marni Nixon as the songs were not written for her vocal range.[71][72] Hepburn was initially upset and walked off the set when informed.[d]\\r\\nThe press further played up the fabricated rivalry between Hepburn and Andrews, when the latter won an Academy Award for Mary Poppins at the 37th Academy Awards (1964) but Hepburn was not even nominated, despite My Fair Lady's accumulation of eight out of a possible twelve awards. Regardless, critics greatly applauded Hepburn's \\"exquisite\\" performance.[72] Crowther wrote that \\"the happiest thing about [My Fair Lady] is that Audrey Hepburn superbly justifies the decision of Jack Warner to get her to play the title role.\\"[71] Gene Ringgold of Soundstage also commented that \\"Audrey Hepburn is magnificent. She is Eliza for the ages\\",[49] while adding, \\"Everyone agreed that if Julie Andrews was not to be in the film, Audrey Hepburn was the perfect choice.\\"[49]\\r\\nAs the decade carried on, Hepburn appeared in an assortment of genres including the heist comedy How to Steal a Million (1966) where she played the daughter of a famous art collector, whose collection consists entirely of forgeries. Fearing her father's exposure, she sets out to steal one of his priceless statues with the help of a man played by Peter O'Toole. It was followed by two films in 1967. The first was Two for the Road, a non-linear and innovative British dramedy that traces the course of a couple's troubled marriage. Director Stanley Donen said that Hepburn was more free and happy than he had ever seen her, and he credited that to co-star Albert Finney.[73] The second, Wait Until Dark, is a suspense thriller in which Hepburn demonstrated her acting range by playing the part of a terrorised blind woman. Filmed on the brink of her divorce, it was a difficult film for her, as husband Mel Ferrer was its producer. She lost fifteen pounds under the stress, but she found solace in co-star Richard Crenna and director Terence Young. Hepburn earned her fifth and final competitive Academy Award nomination for Best Actress; Bosley Crowther affirmed, \\"Hepburn plays the poignant role, the quickness with which she changes and the skill with which she manifests terror attract sympathy and anxiety to her and give her genuine solidity in the final scenes.\\"[74]\\r\\nAfter 1967, Hepburn chose to devote more time to her family and acted only occasionally in the following decades. She attempted a comeback in 1976, playing Maid Marian in the period piece Robin and Marian with Sean Connery co-starring as Robin Hood, which was moderately successful. In 1979, Hepburn reunited with director Terence Young in the production of Bloodline, sharing top-billing with Ben Gazzara, James Mason and Romy Schneider. The film, an international intrigue amid the jet-set, was a critical and box-office failure. Hepburn's last starring role in a feature film was opposite Gazzara in the comedy They All Laughed (1981), directed by Peter Bogdanovich. The film was overshadowed by the murder of one of its stars, Dorothy Stratten, and received only a limited release. Six years later, Hepburn co-starred with Robert Wagner in a made-for-television caper film, Love Among Thieves (1987).\\r\\nAfter finishing her last motion picture role in 1988a cameo appearance as an angel in Steven Spielberg's AlwaysHepburn completed only two more entertainment-related projects, both critically acclaimed. Gardens of the World with Audrey Hepburn was a PBS documentary series, which was filmed on location in seven countries in the spring and summer of 1990. A one-hour special preceded it in March 1991, and the series itself began airing the day after her death, 21 January 1993. For the debut episode, Hepburn was posthumously awarded the 1993 Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement √ø Informational Programming. The other project was a spoken word album, Audrey Hepburn's Enchanted Tales, which features readings of classic children's stories and was recorded in 1992. It earned her a posthumous Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children.[75]\\r\\nIn the 1950s, Hepburn narrated two radio programmes for UNICEF, re-telling children's stories of war.[76] In 1989, Hepburn was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador of UNICEF. On her appointment, she stated that she was grateful for receiving international aid after enduring the German occupation as a child, and wanted to show her gratitude to the organisation.[77]\\r\\nHepburn's first field mission for UNICEF was to Ethiopia in 1988. She visited an orphanage in Mek'ele that housed 500 starving children and had UNICEF send food. Of the trip, she said,\\r\\n\\"I have a broken heart. I feel desperate. I can't stand the idea that two million people are in imminent danger of starving to death, many of them children, [and] not because there isn't tons of food sitting in the northern port of Shoa. It can't be distributed. Last spring, Red Cross and UNICEF workers were ordered out of the northern provinces because of two simultaneous civil wars... I went into rebel country and saw mothers and their children who had walked for ten days, even three weeks, looking for food, settling onto the desert floor into makeshift camps where they may die. Horrible. That image is too much for me. The 'Third World' is a term I don't like very much, because we're all one world. I want people to know that the largest part of humanity is suffering.\\"[78]\\r\\nIn August 1988 Hepburn went to Turkey on an immunisation campaign. She called Turkey \\"the loveliest example\\" of UNICEF's capabilities. Of the trip, she said \\"the army gave us their trucks, the fishmongers gave their wagons for the vaccines, and once the date was set, it took ten days to vaccinate the whole country. Not bad.\\"[79] In October, Hepburn went to South America. Of her experiences in Venezuela and Ecuador, Hepburn told the United States Congress, \\"I saw tiny mountain communities, slums, and shantytowns receive water systems for the first time by some miracle √ø and the miracle is UNICEF. I watched boys build their own schoolhouse with bricks and cement provided by UNICEF.\\"\\r\\nHepburn toured Central America in February 1989, and met with leaders in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. In April, she visited Sudan with Wolders as part of a mission called \\"Operation Lifeline\\". Because of civil war, food from aid agencies had been cut off. The mission was to ferry food to southern Sudan. Hepburn said, \\"I saw but one glaring truth: These are not natural disasters but man-made tragedies for which there is only one man-made solution √ø peace.\\"[79] In October 1989, Hepburn and Wolders went to Bangladesh. John Isaac, a UN photographer, said, \\"Often the kids would have flies all over them, but she would just go hug them. I had never seen that. Other people had a certain amount of hesitation, but she would just grab them. Children would just come up to hold her hand, touch her √ø she was like the Pied Piper.\\"[9]\\r\\nIn October 1990 Hepburn went to Vietnam, in an effort to collaborate with the government for national UNICEF-supported immunisation and clean water programmes. In September 1992, four months before she died, Hepburn went to Somalia. Calling it \\"apocalyptic\\", she said, \\"I walked into a nightmare. I have seen famine in Ethiopia and Bangladesh, but I have seen nothing like this √ø so much worse than I could possibly have imagined. I wasn't prepared for this.\\"[79][80] Though scarred by what she had seen, Hepburn still had hope. \\"Taking care of children has nothing to do with politics. I think perhaps with time, instead of there being a politicisation of humanitarian aid, there will be a humanisation of politics.\\"\\r\\nUnited States president George H. W. Bush presented Hepburn with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of her work with UNICEF, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences posthumously awarded her the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her contribution to humanity.[81][82] In 2002, at the United Nations Special Session on Children, UNICEF honoured Hepburn's legacy of humanitarian work by unveiling a statue, \\"The Spirit of Audrey\\", at UNICEF's New York headquarters. Her service for children is also recognised through the US Fund for UNICEF's Audrey Hepburn Society.[83][84]\\r\\nIn 1952, Hepburn became engaged to James Hanson,[85] whom she had known since her early days in London. She called it \\"love at first sight\\", but after having her wedding dress fitted and the date set, she decided the marriage would not work because the demands of their careers would keep them apart most of the time.[86] She issued a public statement about her decision, saying \\"When I get married, I want to be really married\\".[87] In the early 1950s, she also dated future Hair producer Michael Butler.[88]\\r\\nAt a cocktail party hosted by mutual friend Gregory Peck, Hepburn met American actor Mel Ferrer, and suggested that they star together in a play.[49][49][89] The meeting led them to collaborate in Ondine, during which they began a relationship. Eight months later, on 25 September 1954, they were married in Brgenstock, Switzerland,[90] while preparing to star together in the film War and Peace (1955).\\r\\nHepburn had two miscarriages, one in March 1955,[91] and another in 1959, after she fell from a horse during the filming of The Unforgiven (1960). When she became pregnant for the third time, she took a year off work to prevent miscarriage; their son, Sean Hepburn Ferrer, was born on 17 July 1960. She had two more miscarriages in 1965 and 1967.[92]\\r\\nDespite the insistence from gossip columns that their marriage would not last, Hepburn claimed that she and Ferrer were inseparable and happy together, though she admitted that he had a bad temper.[93] Ferrer was rumoured to be too controlling, and had been referred to by others as being her \\"Svengali\\" √ø an accusation that Hepburn laughed off.[94] William Holden was quoted as saying, \\"I think Audrey allows Mel to think he influences her.\\" After a 14-year marriage, the couple divorced in 1968.[95]\\r\\nHepburn met her second husband, Italian psychiatrist Andrea Dotti, on a Mediterranean cruise with friends in June 1968. She believed she would have more children and possibly stop working. They married on 18 January 1969; their son, Luca Dotti, was born on 8 February 1970. While pregnant with Luca in 1969, Hepburn was more careful, resting for months before delivering the baby via caesarean section. She wanted to have a third child, but had another miscarriage in 1974.[96] Dotti was unfaithful and she had a romantic relationship with actor Ben Gazzara during the filming of the 1979 movie Bloodline.[97] The Dotti-Hepburn marriage lasted thirteen years and was dissolved in 1982.[98]\\r\\nFrom 1980 until her death, Hepburn was in a relationship with Dutch actor Robert Wolders,[24] the widower of actress Merle Oberon. She had met Wolders through a friend during the later years of her second marriage. In 1989, she called the nine years she had spent with him the happiest years of her life, and stated that she considered them married, just not officially.[99]\\r\\nUpon returning from Somalia to Switzerland in late September 1992, Hepburn began suffering from abdominal pain. While initial medical tests in Switzerland had inconclusive results, a laparoscopy performed at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles in early November revealed a rare form of abdominal cancer belonging to a group of cancers known as pseudomyxoma peritonei.[100] Having grown slowly over several years, the cancer had metastasised as a thin coating over her small intestine. After surgery, Hepburn began chemotherapy.[101]\\r\\nHepburn and her family returned home to Switzerland to celebrate her last Christmas. As she was still recovering from surgery, she was unable to fly on commercial aircraft. Her longtime friend, fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy, arranged for socialite Rachel Lambert \\"Bunny\\" Mellon to send her private Gulfstream jet, filled with flowers, to take Hepburn from Los Angeles to Geneva. She spent her last days in hospice care at her home in Tolochenaz, Vaud and was occasionally well enough to take walks in her garden, but gradually became more confined to bedrest.[102]\\r\\nOn the evening of 20 January 1993, Hepburn died in her sleep at home. After her death, Gregory Peck went on camera and tearfully recited her favourite poem, \\"Unending Love\\" by Rabindranath Tagore.[103] Funeral services were held at the village church of Tolochenaz on 24 January 1993. Maurice Eindiguer, the same pastor who wed Hepburn and Mel Ferrer and baptised her son Sean in 1960, presided over her funeral, while Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan of UNICEF delivered a eulogy. Many family members and friends attended the funeral, including her sons, partner Robert Wolders, half-brother Ian Quarles van Ufford, ex-husbands Andrea Dotti and Mel Ferrer, Hubert de Givenchy, executives of UNICEF, and fellow actors Alain Delon and Roger Moore.[104] Flower arrangements were sent to the funeral by Gregory Peck, Elizabeth Taylor, and the Dutch royal family.[105] Later on the same day, Hepburn was interred at the Tolochenaz Cemetery.[106]\\r\\n\\"How shall I sum up my life?\\r\\nI think I've been particularly lucky.\\"\\r\\nAudrey Hepburn's legacy has endured long after her death. The American Film Institute named Hepburn third among the Greatest Female Stars of All Time. She is one of few entertainers who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy and Tony Awards. She won a record three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. In her last years, she remained a visible presence in the film world. She received a tribute from the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1991 and was a frequent presenter at the Academy Awards. She received the BAFTA Lifetime Achievement Award in 1992. She was the recipient of numerous posthumous awards including the 1993 Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and competitive Grammy and Emmy Awards. She has been the subject of many biographies since her death including the 2000 dramatisation of her life titled The Audrey Hepburn Story which starred Jennifer Love Hewitt and Emmy Rossum as the older and younger Hepburn respectively.[108] In January 2009, Hepburn was named on The Times list of the top 10 British actresses of all time.[109]\\r\\nHepburn's image is widely used in advertising campaigns across the world. In Japan, a series of commercials used colourised and digitally enhanced clips of Hepburn in Roman Holiday to advertise Kirin black tea. In the United States, Hepburn was featured in a 2006 Gap commercial which used clips of her dancing from Funny Face, set to AC/DC's \\"Back in Black\\", with the tagline \\"It's Back √ø The Skinny Black Pant\\". To celebrate its \\"Keep it Simple\\" campaign, the Gap made a sizeable donation to the Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund.[110] In 2012, Hepburn was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork √ø the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover √ø to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.[111] In 2013, a computer-manipulated representation of Hepburn was used in a television advert for the British chocolate bar Galaxy.[112][113] On 4 May 2014, Google featured a doodle on its homepage on what would have been Hepburn's 85th birthday.[114]\\r\\nSean Ferrer founded the Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund[115] in memory of his mother shortly after her death. The US Fund for UNICEF also founded the Audrey Hepburn Society:[116] chaired by Luca Dotti, it celebrates UNICEF's biggest donors and has raised almost US$100,000,000 to date. Dotti also became patron of the Pseudomyxoma Survivor charity, dedicated to providing support to patients of the rare cancer Hepburn suffered from, pseudomyxoma peritonei,[117] and the rare disease ambassador since 2014 and for 2015 on behalf of European Organisation for Rare Diseases.[118]\\r\\nHepburn was noted for her fashion choices and distinctive look, to the extent that journalist Mark Tungate has described her as a recognisable brand.[119] When she first rose to stardom in Roman Holiday (1953), she was seen as an alternative feminine ideal that appealed more to women than to men, in comparison to the curvy and more sexual Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor.[120][121] With her short hair style, thick eyebrows, slim body and \\"gamine\\" looks, she presented a look which young women found easier to emulate than those of more sexual film stars.[122] In 1954, fashion photographer Cecil Beaton declared Hepburn the \\"public embodiment of our new feminine ideal\\" in Vogue, and wrote that \\"Nobody ever looked like her before World War II ... Yet we recognise the rightness of this appearance in relation to our historical needs. The proof is that thousands of imitations have appeared.\\"[121] The magazine and its British version frequently reported on her style throughout the following decade.[123] Alongside model Twiggy, Hepburn has been cited as one of the key public figures who made being very slim fashionable.[122]\\r\\nAdded to the International Best Dressed List in 1961, Hepburn was associated with a minimalistic style, usually wearing clothes with simple silhouettes which emphasised her slim body, monochromatic colours, and occasional statement accessories.[124] In the late 1950s, Audrey Hepburn popularised plain black leggings.[125] Academic Rachel Moseley describes the combination of \\"slim black trousers, flat ballet-style pumps and a fine black jersey\\" as one of her signature looks alongside little black dresses, noting that this style was new at the time when women still wore skirts and high heels more often than trousers and flat shoes.[122]\\r\\nHepburn was in particular associated with French fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy, who was first hired to design her on-screen wardrobe for her second Hollywood film, Sabrina (1954), when she was still unknown as a film actor and he a young couturier just starting his fashion house.[126] Although initially disappointed that \\"Miss Hepburn\\" was not Katharine Hepburn as he had mistakenly thought, Givenchy and Hepburn formed a lifelong friendship.[126][127] She became his muse,[126][127] and the two became so closely associated with each other that academic Jayne Sheridan has stated \\"we might ask 'Did Audrey Hepburn create Givenchy or was it the other way around?'\\".[128]\\r\\nIn addition to Sabrina, Givenchy designed her costumes for Love in the Afternoon (1957), Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), Funny Face (1957), Charade (1963), Paris When It Sizzles (1964) and How to Steal a Million (1966), as well as clothed her off screen.[126] According to Moseley, fashion plays an unusually central role in many of Hepburn's films, stating that \\"the costume is not tied to the character, functioning 'silently' in the mise-en-scne, but as 'fashion' becomes an attraction in the aesthetic in its own right\\".[129] Hepburn herself stated that Givenchy \\"gave me a look, a kind, a silhouette. He has always been the best and he stayed the best. Because he kept the spare style that I love. What is more beautiful than a simple sheath made an extraordinary way in a special fabric, and just two earrings?\\"[130] She also became the face of Givenchy's first perfume, L'Interdit, in 1957.[131] In addition to her partnership with Givenchy, Hepburn was credited with boosting the sales of Burberry trench coats when she wore one in Breakfast at Tiffany's, and was associated with Italian footwear brand Tod's.[132]\\r\\nIn her private life, Hepburn preferred to wear casual and comfortable clothes, contrary to the haute couture she wore on screen and at public events.[133] Despite being admired for her beauty, she never considered herself attractive, stating in a 1959 interview that \\"you can even say that I hated myself at certain periods. I was too fat, or maybe too tall, or maybe just plain too ugly... you can say my definiteness stems from underlying feelings of insecurity and inferiority. I couldn't conquer these feelings by acting indecisive. I found the only way to get the better of them was by adopting a forceful, concentrated drive.\\"[134] In 1989, she stated that \\"my look is attainable ... Women can look like Audrey Hepburn by flipping out their hair, buying the large glasses and the little sleeveless dresses.\\"[124]\\r\\nHepburn's influence as a style icon continues several decades after the height of her acting career in the 1950s and 1960s. Moseley notes that especially after her death in 1993, she became increasingly admired, with magazines frequently advising readers on how to get her look and fashion designers using her as inspiration.[135][122] In 2004, Hepburn was named the \\"most beautiful woman of all time\\"[136] and \\"most beautiful woman of the 20th century\\"[137] in polls by Evian and QVC respectively, and in 2015, was voted \\"the most stylish Brit of all time\\" in a poll commissioned by Samsung.[138] Her film costumes fetch large sums of money in auctions: one of the \\"little black dresses\\" designed by Givenchy for Breakfast at Tiffany's was sold by Christie's for a record sum of S467,200 in 2006.[139][e]\\r\\nOn 19 April 2015 a robot called Sophia, modelled after Hepburn, was activated.[143][144]","input":"What did audrey hepburn do for a living?"},{"output":"in the early and mid-1990s","context":"Privatization in Russia describes the series of post-Soviet reforms that resulted in large-scale privatization of Russia's state-owned assets, particularly in the industrial, energy, and financial sectors. Most privatization took place in the early and mid-1990s under Boris Yeltsin, who assumed the presidency following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate ownership of enterprises and property had essentially remained illegal throughout the Soviet era, with Soviet communism emphasizing national control over all means of production but human labor.[1] Under the Soviet Union, the number of state enterprises was estimated at 45,000.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the later years of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev relaxed restrictions on private property and introduced initial market reforms. Privatization shifted Russia from the Soviet planned economy towards a market economy, and resulted in a dramatic rise in the level of economic inequality and a collapse in GDP and industrial output.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivatization facilitated the transfer of significant wealth to a relatively small group of business oligarchs and New Russians, particularly natural gas and oil executives.[4] This economic transition has been described as katastroika[5] and as \\"the most cataclysmic peacetime economic collapse of an industrial country in history\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nA few \\"strategic\\" assets, including much of the Russian defense industry, were not privatized during the 1990s. The mass privatization of this era remains a highly contentious issue in Russian society, with many Russians calling for revision or reversal of the reforms.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1980s, as part of the perestroika reformation movement, legislation championed by Mikhail Gorbachevwho pledged to build a \\"mixed socialist economy\\"[7]effectively transferred some controlling rights over enterprises from the government to the employees and management. In 1987, over the opposition of some of his allies,[8] Gorbachev succeeded in passing a \\"law on state enterprise\\" through the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, which granted work collectives a greater role in running enterprises.[9] In 1988, the Law on Cooperatives legitimized \\"socialist cooperatives,\\" which functionally operated as private companies and were permitted to directly deal with foreign companies, and reduced reliance on central planning.[10] Later that year, private Soviet farmers were permitted to rent land from the state, purchase equipment, and hire workers, a significant step away from mandated collective farming following decades of dominance by state-owned agricultural concerns. The new regulations were seen as an effort to break state farms into smaller units and address critical food shortages in the Soviet Union.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legislation also enabled these enterprises to withdraw from associations on their own, which led to the process of so-called spontaneous privatization in which control over some industrial assets was acquired by their managers. However, this accounted for only several thousand enterprises, a small fraction of the Soviet industry.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1990, the Soviet parliament granted Gorbachev emergency privatization powers, including the authority to transform state enterprises into joint-stock companies with shares offered on stock exchanges.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the largest privatization efforts during the Soviet era was the transformation of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy into a joint stock company known as Rosneftgaz in September 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the months before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, soon-to-be president Boris Yeltsin began assembling a team of economic reformers led by Yegor Gaidar, then a young reformist economist, and including Anatoly Chubais. The reform team initially considered Swedish social democracy as a model for Russia, but Gaidar opted instead to study Hungary as a template and was influenced by Poland's use of shock therapy. Both Gaidar and Chubais were convinced that despite Russia's uniquely non-capitalist economic history, a market economy could successfully take hold in the country.[12]  Following the August 1991 coup d'tat attempt, the economic situation in the country dramatically worsened and an acute food shortage emerged. In October, Yeltsin delivered a speech in which he declared that price controls would be lifted on January 1, 1992, over Gaidar's recommendation that no specific date for the freeing of prices be given.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n Privatization took place on a much wider scale in the early 1990s, when the government of Russia deliberately set a goal to sell its assets to the Russian public. Upon the Soviet Union's collapse, the new government was forced to manage the huge and inefficient state enterprise sector inherited from the Soviet economy. Privatization was carried out by the State Committee for State Property Management of the Russian Federation under Chubais with the primary goal being to transform the formerly state-owned enterprises into profit-seeking businesses, which would not be dependent on government subsidies for their survival. To distribute property quickly and to win over popular support, the reformers decided to rely mostly on the mechanism of free voucher privatization, which was earlier implemented in Czechoslovakia. The Russian government believed that the open sale of state-owned assets, as opposed to the voucher program, would have likely resulted in the further concentration of ownership among the Russian mafia and the nomenklatura, which they sought to avoid. Nevertheless, contrary to the government's expectations, insiders managed to acquire control over most of the assets, which remained largely dependent on government support for years to come. From 1992 to 1994, ownership of 15,000 firms was transferred from state control via the voucher program.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, although several of the initial objectives had not been fully achieved by the end of the vouchers program, a great deal of assets did fall into private ownership remarkably quickly and worked to provide some basis for market competition. Voucher privatization took place between 1992-1994 and roughly 98 percent of the population participated. The vouchers, each corresponding to a share in the national wealth, were distributed equally among the population, including minors. They could be exchanged for shares in the enterprises to be privatized. Because most people were not well-informed about the nature of the program or were very poor, they were quick to sell their vouchers for money, unprepared or unwilling to invest.[citation needed] Most vouchersand, hence, most shareswound up being acquired by the management of the enterprises. Although Russia's initial privatization legislation attracted widespread popular support given its promise to distribute the national wealth among the general public and ordinary employees of the privatized enterprises, eventually the public felt deceived.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivatization of the oil sector was regulated by presidential decree 1403 approved on November 17, 1992. Vertically integrated companies were created by joining some oil-producing enterprises and refineries into open-stock companies. Starting in 1994 many former state oil companies were privatized. This privatization has been partial because the federal government has obtained ownership positions in several companies and has also retained full control over the transport of oil onto lucrative world markets.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, facing severe fiscal deficit and in desperate need of funds for the 1996 presidential elections, the government of Boris Yeltsin adopted a \\"loans-for-share\\" scheme proposed by banker Vladimir Potanin and endorsed by Anatoly Chubais, then a deputy prime minister, whereby some of the largest state industrial assets (including state-owned shares in Norilsk Nickel, Yukos, Lukoil, Sibneft, Surgutneftegas, Novolipetsk Steel, and Mechel) were leased through auctions for money lent by commercial banks to the government. The auctions were rigged and lacked competition, being largely controlled by favored insiders with political connections or used for the benefit of the commercial banks themselves.[17] As neither the loans nor the leased enterprises were returned in time, this effectively became a form of selling, or privatizing, state assets at very low prices.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2004 to 2006, the government took control of formally privatized companies in certain \\"strategic\\" sectors. oil, aviation, power generation equipment, machine-building and finance. For example, the state-owned defense equipment company Rosoboronexport took control of Avtovaz, the primary producer of Russian cars. In June 2006, it took 60% control of VSMPO-Avisma, a company that accounts for two-thirds of the worlds titanium production. In 2007, United Aircraft Building Corporation, a company that is 51% government controlled, combined all of the Russian companies producing aircraft.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2010, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev had ordered regional governments to decide on privatization of non-core assets by July 2011. Arkady Dvorkovich, then a top Kremlin economic aide, said regional privatization proceeds could amount to several billion rubles in 2011, and regional authorities must prioritize the sale of utility companies, financial institutions, manufacturing and transportation assets and the media.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 2012, after becoming prime minister, Medvedev said Russia should carry out its privatization program regardless of market volatility.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a session of the World Economic Forum in October 2012, Medvedev said \\"It is vital for our country to continue the course towards privatization\\". He stressed that had assured participants in the World Economic Forum session that \\"does not want to see an economy totally controlled by the state\\".[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2010 the Russian government approved a plan to privatize a wide range of state property from energy to agriculture and banking to transportation.[22]","input":"When did the massive privatization of russian economy occur?"},{"output":"a trade settlement","context":"Elmina Castle was erected by the Portuguese in 1482 as S?o Jorge da Mina (St. George of the Mine) Castle, also known simply as Mina or Feitoria da Mina) in present-day Elmina, Ghana (formerly the Gold Coast). It was the first trading post built on the Gulf of Guinea, so is the oldest European building in existence south of the Sahara. First established as a trade settlement, the castle later became one of the most important stops on the route of the Atlantic slave trade. The Dutch seized the fort from the Portuguese in 1637, and took over all the Portuguese Gold Coast in 1642. The slave trade continued under the Dutch until 1814; in 1872, the Dutch Gold Coast, including the fort, became a possession of the British Empire.\\r\\nBritain granted the Gold Coast its independence in 1957, and control of the castle was transferred to the nation formed out of the colony, present-day Ghana. Today Elmina Castle is a popular historical site, and was a major filming location for Werner Herzog's 1987 drama film Cobra Verde. The castle is recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people living along the West African coast at Elmina around the fifteenth century were presumably Fante. The Fante ethnicity bears an uncertain relationship to \\"Akan,\\" itself a word connoting originality from the root word, \\"kan\\", to be first or original. Among their ancestors were merchants and miners trading gold into the Mediterranean and Near Eastern worlds from medieval times. The ancestors of the Akan-speakers of the forests however undoubtedly came from north of the forest.\\r\\nThe people on the West African coast were organized into numerous populations that were drawn according to kinship lines. Family was extremely important in society, and family heads were united in communities under a recognized local authority. Along the Gold Coast alone, more than twenty independent kingdom-states existed. Elmina lay between two different Fante kingdoms, Fetu and Eguafo. West Africans nurtured ancient connections to other parts of the world. Common metals trade, iconic artistic forms, and agricultural borrowing show that trans-Saharan and regional coastal connections thrived. The Portuguese in 1471 were the first Europeans to visit the Gold Coast as such, but not necessarily the first sailors to reach the port.\\r\\nThe Portuguese first reached what became known as the Gold Coast in 1471. Prince Henry the Navigator first sent ships to explore the African coast in 1418. The Portuguese had several motives for voyaging south. They were attracted by rumors of fertile African lands that were rich in gold and ivory. They also sought a southern route to India so as to circumvent Arab traders and establish direct trade with Asia. In line with the strong religious sentiments of the time, another focus of the Portuguese was Christian proselitism. They also sought to form an alliance with the legendary Prester John, who was believed to be the leader of a great Christian nation somewhere in Africa.\\r\\nThese motives prompted the Portuguese to develop the Guinea trade. They made gradual progress down the African coast, each voyage reaching a point further along than the last. After fifty years of coastal exploration, the Portuguese finally reached Elmina in 1471, during the reign of King Afonso V. However, because Portuguese royalty had lost interest in African exploration as a result of meager returns, the Guinea trade was put under the oversight of the Portuguese trader, Fern?o Gomes. Upon reaching present day Elmina, Gomes discovered a thriving gold trade already established among the natives and visiting Arab and Berber traders. He established his own trading post, and it became known to the Portuguese as A Mina (the Mine) because of the gold that could be found there.\\r\\nTrade between Elmina and Portugal grew throughout the decade following the establishment of the trading post under Gomes. In 1481, the recently crowned Jo?o II decided to build a fort on the coast in order to ensure the protection of this trade, which was once again held as a royal monopoly. King Jo?o sent all of the materials needed to build the fort on ten caravels and two transport ships. The supplies, which included everything from heavy foundation stones to roof tiles, were sent, in pre-fitted form, along with provisions for six hundred men. Under the command of Diogo de Azambuja, the fleet set sail on 12 December 1481 and arrived at Elmina, in a village called Of Two Parts[1] a little over a month later, on 19 January 1482. Some historians note that Christopher Columbus was among those to make the voyage to the Gold Coast with this fleet.\\r\\nUpon arrival, Azambuja contracted a Portuguese trader, who had lived at Elmina for some time, to arrange and interpret an official meeting with the local chief, Kwamin Ansah (interpreted from the Portuguese, \\"Caramansa\\"). Concealing his self-interest with elegant manners and friendliness, Azambuja told the chief of the great advantages in building a fort, including protection from the very powerful king of Portugal. During the meeting, Azambuja and Chief Kwamin Ansah both participated in a massive peace ritual that included a feast, musicians, and many participants, both Portuguese and native.[1] Chief Kwamin Ansah, while accepting Azambuja, as he had any other Portuguese trader who arrived on his coast, was wary of a permanent settlement. However, with firm plans already in place, the Portuguese would not be deterred. After offering gifts, making promises, and hinting at the consequences of noncompliance, the Portuguese finally received Kwamin Ansah's reluctant agreement.\\r\\nWhen construction began the next morning, the chiefs reluctance was proved to be well-founded. In order to build the fort in the most defensible position on the peninsula, the Portuguese had to demolish the homes of some of the villagers, who consented only after they had been compensated. The Portuguese also tried to quarry a nearby rock that the people of Elmina, who were animists, believed to be the home of the god of the nearby River Benya. Prior to the demolition of the quarry and homes, Azambuja sent a Portuguese crew member, Jo?o Bernaldes with gifts to deliver to Chief Kwamin Ansah and the villagers. Azambuja sent brass basins, shawls, and other gifts in hopes of winning the goodwill of the villagers, so they would not be upset during the demolition of their homes and sacred rocks. However, Jo?o Bernaldes did not deliver the gifts until after construction began, by which time the villagers became upset upon witnessing the demolition without forewarning or compensation.[1] In response to this, the local people forged an attack that resulted in several Portuguese deaths. Finally, an understanding was reached, but continued opposition led the Portuguese to burn the local village in retaliation. Even in this tense atmosphere, the first story of the tower was completed after only twenty days; this was the result of having brought so much prefabricated building materials. The remainder of the fort and an accompanying church were completed soon afterward, despite resistance.\\r\\nThe fort was the first pre-fabricated building of European origin to have been planned and executed in Sub-Saharan Africa. Upon its completion, Elmina was established as a proper city. Azambuja was named governor, and King Jo?o added the title \\"Lord of Guinea\\" to his noble titles. S?o Jorge da Mina took on the military and economic importance that had previously been held by the Portuguese factory at Arguim Island on the southern edge of the Moorish world. At the height of the gold trade in the early sixteenth century, 24,000 ounces of gold were exported annually from the Gold Coast, accounting for one-tenth of the worlds supply.\\r\\nThe new fort, signifying the permanent involvement of Europeans in West Africa, had a considerable effect on Africans living on the coast. At the urging of the Portuguese, Elmina declared itself an independent state whose Governor then took control of the towns affairs. The people of Elmina were offered Portuguese protection against attacks from neighboring coastal tribes, with whom the Portuguese had much less genial relations (even though they were friendly with the powerful trading nations in the African interior.) If any locals attempted to trade with a nation other than Portugal, the Portuguese reacted with aggressive force, often by forming alliances with the betraying nations enemies. Hostility between groups increased, and the traditional organization of native societies suffered, especially after the Portuguese introduced them to fire-arms, which made the dominance of the stronger nations easier.\\r\\nTrade with the Europeans helped make certain goods, such as cloth and beads, more available to the coastal people, but European involvement also disrupted traditional trade routes between coastal people and northern people by cutting out the African middlemen. The population of Elmina swelled with traders from other towns hoping to trade with the Portuguese, who gradually established a West-African monopoly.\\r\\nBy the seventeenth century, most trade in West Africa concentrated on the sale of slaves. S?o Jorge da Mina played a significant part in the West African Slave Trade. The castle acted as a depot where slaves were bought in from different Kingdoms in West Africa. The slaves, often captured in the African interior by the slave-catchers of coastal peoples, were sold to Portuguese traders in exchange for goods such as textiles and horses. The slaves were held captive in the castle before exiting through the castles infamous Door of No Return to be transported and resold in newly colonized Brazil and other Portuguese colonies. Up to 1,000 male and 500 female slaves were shackled and crammed in the castles dank, poorly ventilated dungeons, with no space to lie down and very little light. Without water or sanitation, the floor of the dungeon was littered with human waste and many captives fell seriously ill. The men were separated from the women, and the captors regularly raped the helpless women. The castle also featured confinement cells  small pitch-black spaces for prisoners who revolted or were seen as rebellious. Once the slaves set foot in the castle, they could spend up to three months in captivity under these dreadful conditions before being shipped off to the New World. An environment of harsh contrasts, the castle also had some extravagant chambers, devoid of the stench and misery of the dungeons, only a couple of meters below. For example, the British governor and officers quarters were spacious and airy, with beautiful parquet floors and scenic views of the blue waters of Atlantic. There was also a chapel in the castle enclosure for the officers, traders and their families as they went about their normal day-to-day life completely detached from the unfathomable human suffering they were consciously inflicting. In 1637 the fort was taken over by the Dutch, who made it the capital of the Dutch Gold Coast. During the period of Dutch control, they built a new, smaller fortress on a nearby hill to protect St. George Castle from inland attacks. This fort was called Fort Coenraadsburg. The Dutch continued the triangular Atlantic slave route until 1814, when they abolished the slave trade, pursuant to the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814. In 1872 the British took over the Dutch territory pursuant to the Anglo-Dutch Sumatra treaties of 1871.\\r\\nThe castle was extensively restored by the Ghanaian government in the 1990s. Renovation of the castle continues. Today, Elminas economy is sustained by tourism and fishing. Elmina Castle is preserved as a Ghanaian national museum and the monument was designated as a World Heritage Monument under UNESCO in 1979. It is a place of pilgrimage for many African Americans seeking to connect with their long lost heritage[citation requested][dead link] The bridge leading into the castle is one of the highest priority tasks in the project. As of August 2006, the bridge renovation has been completed and construction on the upper terraces continues.\\r\\nElmina Castle Interior View of Church\\r\\nElmina Castle Interior\\r\\nElmina Castle Male and Female Slave Entrances\\r\\nElmina Castle Memorial Plaque\\r\\nElmina Castle Slave Export Gate\\r\\nElmina Castle Slave Holding Cell\\r\\nElmina Castle Slave Holding Cell\\r\\nElmina Castle Gun Defences\\r\\nElmina Castle","input":"What was the purpose of the elmina castle?"},{"output":"1,195","context":"This is a list of 1,198 schools known as Kendriya Vidyalayas; 1,195 are in India and three are abroad.[1] A total of 11,21,012 students and 56,445 employees are on the rolls as of  1?February?2015[update].

The shocks continued, with greater or less interruption, from the 14th to the 25th of the month, highlighted by three violent shaking events, which destroyed churches and other buildings, producing loss of life.[1] Coinciding with the tectonic activity was an increased in volcanic activity in Taal Volcano in southwestern Luzon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luzon provinces of Manila, Cavite, Bulacan, Laguna, Pampanga, and Nueva Ecija, were the chief victims from the terrible convulsions with Manila and Laguna receiving the most damage.  In many places, buildings were converted into shapeless heaps of ruins, and the materials of their prosperity buried beneath the rubbish.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vibrations began during the months of April and May, in the northern provinces of Luzon. The center of oscillation, as indicated by the directions registered at Manila, appears to coincide with a volcano, which has been long extinct, situated between Lepanto (now part of Kalinga) and Abra provinces, in the Central Cordillera of Luzon, in latitude 16 22' N and longitude 127 E, according to the Spanish Observatory of San Fernando. At first the movements were weak and little frequent, but in the month of June they became quite intense, and extended from north to south over a large zone. This direction never changed; and the few discordances recorded appear to have been a result of haste or want of care in the method of taking the observations, exactness being hardly attainable without special instruments for the purpose.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nTaal Volcano was observed to start showing increase in activity from the 8th of June and sometimes at night the crater is covered with glare.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in July some vibrations were felt, but from the 5th to the 14th none were recorded at Manila or any point on the island.  On the July 14 at 12:53?p.m., as a storm from the northeast of Luzon was threatening as indicated by an extraordinary fall of the barometer, the first shock occurred.  After this first tremor, there were two more shocks at the end of an hour and a half. On the 15th and 16th no perceptible shocks occurred; and on the 17th, only two small shocks.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 18th at 12:40?p.m., occurred the first great shock described as one of oscillation, also of \\"trepidation,\\" and spoken of commonly at the time as one of rotation. Its duration was 70 seconds.[1]  The people immediately ran for places of security, and those in the streets were filled with confusion, Some ran without a fixed direction; others fell on their knees, giving forth fearful cries. The sight presented by the city was frightful in the extreme; for seventy mortal seconds the city was in oscillation, and the inclinations threatened to raze to the ground the creaking edifices; the noise of the falling buildings increased the general panic.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately, The first shocks were slight, which gave time for people to run out of the houses to places of security accounting for lesser loss of life. The quake also happened on a Sunday, the public and private establishments being closed, permitted the families to be collected. Had the earthquake happened at night with the majority using lamp with kerosene oil, nothing could have stopped a fallen lamp from spreading fire to a fallen building.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Manila, among the buildings which sustained damage on the 18th, was the Mint House, which suffered considerably in the first story.  Orders were given to pull down the buildings which threatened any danger to the pedestrians, and engineers were going around surveying the buildings, examining the interior of the dwellings, ordering out the inhabitants where danger existed.  The pillars supporting some of the wooden houses were found forced into the earth by one-fourth of their length.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom then on, small tremors continued throughout the day.  The frightened, terrified look of the people going through the streets, the slightest noise being sufficient to startle and set every soul running out of the houses to the middle of the streets, and to the squares, every slight shock of the earth strikes terror into the soul of every one, each and every one expecting unheard-of calamity.  Whole families were emigrating from the city to the country on a large scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe view during the earthquake from the vessels in Pasig River, was, as described by an eyewitness, something to be seen to be appreciated. The rocking to and fro of the buildings was something terrific, the vessels moving about and bumping each other as though in a heavy seaway; the water of the river, bubbling up and mixed with the black mud of the river, was all the colour of ink; hundreds of people rushed off to the ships and remained all night. In Manila Bay, the same bubbling appearance was observable on the water, and the shock was distinctly felt on board the ships; the water's depth close in shore had been shallowed by some four feet in some places.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Lingayen, Pangasinan, some 200 kilometres (120?mi) north of Manila, the earthquake occurred at 12:42?p.m., reported as violent, oscillating NE to SE, with a duration of 1 minute 50 seconds accompanied by deep subterranean noise.  In Santa Cruz, Laguna province, 60 kilometres (37?mi) SE of Manila, the shock was also felt at 12:42?p.m. and continued for more than a minute. The Government House, the Convent, the Telegraphic Office and the rest of the province formed a single mass of ruins.  In Tayabas, Quezon, Quezon province, the oscillation continued for 2 minutes and 30 seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the occasion of the earthquake, the people in Cavite across the bay saw Manila enveloped in a dense cloud of dust, and thought that Manila was completely destroyed.  A very interesting phenomenon was also observed in Cavite. During the intensity of the earthquake, in the anchorage of Cavite, columns of black mud were seen to burst up, with a strong smell of sulphur.  The very interesting phenomenon was also observed in Manila a few days previous to the destructive earthquake of 1863, in front of the Colgante suspension bridge on Pasig River.  A column of blackish water was seen to burst up, which attracted the attention of the people. In 1869, the same phenomenon occurred in Manila, then also previous to an earthquake.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Ca?acao, Cavite and a few other places crevices were opened, and from them fine sand and dirty water were ejected. In one of these crevices that opened in Nueva Ecija, the crack was so wide and deep it was reported that an old man and a boy disappeared in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day after, July 19 in the afternoon, Taal Volcano started issuing large mass of smoke, according to a telegraphic news from Taal, Batangas.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom that first shock on July 18, there was an uninterrupted series of small shocks which continued until July 20 at 3:40?p.m., when then occurred a repetition of extraordinary violence, with movements of oscillation and trembling (\\"trepidation\\") lasting 45 seconds. The earth shook again reducing to complete ruins the buildings partially destroyed and damaged buildings being secured, startling many workmen who were engaged in the reconstructing the City.  Clouds of dust covered the whole town in a few seconds afterwards and obscuring the view of everything.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the earthquake ceased, the authorities turned out into the streets, amongst whom the first were the Governor-General, the Archbishop and General Director of the Civil Administration, the Civil Governor, and the Colonial Secretary, giving to every one who saluted them a consoling word.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrevices were opened in several places, and among them the Plaza de Palacio. Numerous buildings have sustained damage, some of them completely razed to the ground. The highest buildings suffered most, such as churches, palaces, and towers. The belfry of the Manila Cathedral that survived the great 1863 earthquake fell in. A detailed description of list of damage would be considered too long and almost unnecessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newly reconstructed Manila Cathedral, destroyed by the 1863 earthquake, with the surviving belfry from the previous cathedral.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe belfry destroyed in the afternoon of July 20, 1880.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sensations produced amongst the inhabitants who remain in Manila were painful indeed, but fortunately several persons with true courage were going round, and with words of consolation, trying to diminish the anxiety of the alarmed and terror-stricken people.\\r\\n\\r\\nTelegraphic news from the provinces were received, giving the time and strength of the shock felt at each place. In Bi?an, Laguna province, the Church, Court House, and all the brick houses were destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne circumstance as a precursor of tranquility was the eruption of the Taal Volcano, which was ignited the day before, sending forth a large quantity of smoke, a fact which may be regarded as a favorable change in the geological state.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith those ever-present movements of trepidation at short intervals, the pendulum continued oscillating during all the evening in a NE and SW direction. At 10:40?p.m., occurred the third violent repetition that lasted 55 seconds; the violence of earthquake was even greater than that afternoon of the 20th.  It was also greater than that of the 18th.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state of the city and the whole provinces of Luzon, where all the brick buildings, together with some of the wooden houses with metallic roofs, have sustained damage of more or less consideration, and with especially those of Manila which are in a complete ruin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Governor-General sent by telegraph the details of the earthquake of the 18th on the afternoon of the 20th to Spain, but as soon as that was forwarded, the terrific earthquake of the 20th was felt at 3:40?p.m., owing to which he began to telegraph anew, after going through the streets to infuse peace into the minds of the inhabitants with his presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the shocks of the night of the 20th, the part of the bell tower of the old Cathedral that was still standing, came almost completely to the ground, the debris falling upon two adjoining houses which had been rendered uninhabitable for the last two days.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Santa Ana, Manila all the brick houses came to the ground, some of them built at great expense, and with iron roofs. The church was rendered useless, and a mass was said the day before in the middle of the field by all the residents.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the port city of Cavite, large numbers of inhabitants have abandoned their houses, to go to the neighboring village of San Roque, in view of the security offered by houses of light construction. The panic is great, and terror is painted in all faces. Those who could not leave this place contented themselves by living in lower houses, fearing a repetition of the earthquake.  In Ca?acao, the public buildings have sustained more or less damage, and in some places boiling water was poured forth from crevices in the earth opened by the shocks.  In a place called Sapa, in the village of Pandacan in Manila, several crevices were opened, some of two palms wide, from which a kind of clay was thrown out; the day before these crevices were somewhat reduced in width.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the opinion of persons from the Observatory in Manila run by the Jesuits, the center of the great geological commotion of the last few days was described as covering Manila and Laguna especially. In the rest of the provinces the effect was believed to be of smaller consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greatest portion of the private establishments, both inside and outside the walls of Manila, were closed, and the sight was a mournful one to contemplate; very few pedestrians were to be seen, and the carriage traffic was considerably reduced.  Many local families passed the night of the 20th in the fields and public grounds, some of them being exposed to the rain which fell at daylight.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pastoral letter was published by the Archbishop of Manila of that time, Fray Pedro Payo, infusing consolation and devotion into the people asking them to practice penitence in order to decrease the anger of God. According to this pastoral, a mass was to be celebrated in the camp of Bagumbayan on the 22nd, to which the army and navy, public officers, would have to be present by order of the Governor General.\\r\\n\\r\\nVibrations continued, but there was a marked diminution in frequency and intensity. A reassuring wire from the Jesuit Fathers regarding the earthquake reported that the commotions continue, but it is observed in them a sensible decrease in the shortness of the intervals as well as in the intensity of the shocks. The pendulum of the seismometer, which had not been quiet since the 18th up to 3 p.m. of the 21st, that morning and evening had been several times in complete quietness.  From the 21st in the morning, the state of Taal volcano has improved and presumed returning to its normal condition, as reported from Lipa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mass in Bagumbayan camp took place this day. The ceremony was imposing in the extreme, after which the Pastoral Benediction and a sermon followed. The congregation dispersed in processional form.\\r\\n\\r\\nA petition was sent to the Secretary of State for the Colonies by wire, requesting an increase in the public works staff to give a greater impulse to the works of reconstruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn immense number of residents sought refuge afloat on board the steamers in the bay and in the port, and also in every insignificant vessel in the harbor during the shakings. In the Cadiz alone there are no less than twenty families, with some forty or more children; some forty people were in the Churruca, and as many in the Elcano; eighty in the Salvadora.  Even in the dredging vessel five or six families found refuge shortly after the violent trepidation of the 20th and several more in the lorcha and boats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seismometer pendulum at the Manila Observatory, which had not been quiet since the 18th until 3 p.m. of the 21st, was motionless for long intervals in the three following days. On the 25th, at 4:02?a.m., another shock was felt. It was of feeble intensity, yet of interest since the record bears evidence as to the gradual change in the center of seismic radiation which had been in progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning the 8th of June, Taal Volcano was observed to be more active than normal, and sometimes at night the crater was covered with a glare. From 17th to the 21st of July, subterranean noises were heard, and many witnesses in Talisay, a town located along the shores of Taal Lake some 6 miles (9.7?km) distant from Volcano Island, reported small balls of fire (apparently about 2.5 feet (0.76?m) in diameter) appeared periodically above the crater.  These balls after reaching a considerable height burst into small fragments, some of which fell back into the crater and the remainder upon the exterior slope.[3]  This increased in activity and eruption of July 20 though is not accounted as an eruption of Taal Volcano based on the eruption history of Taal.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nSan Agustin Church in Manila, which survived the great earthquakes of 1645 and 1863, was severely damaged by the tremors of 1880.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earthquake changed San Agustin into a single-belfry church.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe severest shocks seem to have been felt over the whole island of Luzon about 400 miles (640?km) North to South, and 200 miles (320?km) East to West.  From observations taken it seems that the difference in the time between the extreme points was not more than ten minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears that at the time of the great shock on the 18th, it was ebb tide; and the water in Pasig River suddenly rose 3.5 feet (1.1?m), and almost as suddenly fell again. Thousands of fish were found lying on the surface of the water in the bay.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was calculated that the top of a building thirty feet from the ground was thrown 5 feet (1.5?m) out of its perpendicular; and one of the towers of the cathedral oscillated over 20 feet (6.1?m).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one of the provinces, the local houses, which are built of bamboo and thatch, were sent flying; that canoes were thrown out of the water; and the growing rice torn out of the ground. The earth sunk in many places, the bed of one river had sunk 6 feet (1.8?m). Great chasms, 10 to 12 feet (3.0 to 3.7?m) wide and of immense depth, were ripped in the earth.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe churches of Guadalupe (now Guadalupe Viejo in Makati), Paco, Pandacan, Santa Ana, San Sebastian Church and San Miguel were in ruins. Within the walls of Manila the San Augustin Church, San Francisco Church and Santo Domingo Church were very seriously damaged. The Landnay barracks were down and the soldiers took refuge in one of the cigar factories. The barracks near the Luneta went down and the men built nipa huts there.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the earthquakes of 1880 a commission composed of engineers of public works was appointed to study the ruins caused by these earthquakes, to point out the defects in the structure of the buildings that had been damaged, and to formulate rules which would be more practical than the ones previously drawn up for the rebuilding and repairing of the city.  Jose Centeno, engineer of mines, was entrusted with this task. His memoir, \\"\\"Temblores de tierra occuridos en Julio de 1880 en la Isla de Luzon,\\" is one of the best that has been published from a descriptive point of view. He personally covered the whole territory in which these earthquakes had been most violent, and hence was able to determine, with the precision possible in such cases, the meizoseismic areas of the three destructive earthquakes that took place from July 14 to 21.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nReconstruction of the city was undertaken by civil engineers who adopted the traditional combination formula, while adapting this to the adverse seismic conditions.  It was recommended that the ground floor of buildings should be constructed using a timber framework with multiple ties and that the external walls should be brick-built.[8]  Heavy roofing made from tiles was discouraged in favor of the new lighter galvanized iron.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe front structure of Fort Santiago in Manila with tiled roof before it was destroyed by the earthquake of 1880.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reconstructed structure with galvanized iron roof in 1903.","input":"What is the most destructive earthquake in luzon?"},{"output":"Iowa-class battleship","context":"USS Wisconsin (BB-64) is an Iowa-class battleship, the second ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of the U.S. state of Wisconsin. She was built at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and launched on 7 December 1943 (the second anniversary of the Pearl Harbor raid), sponsored by the wife of Governor Walter Goodland of Wisconsin.\\r\\nDuring her career, Wisconsin served in the Pacific Theater of World War II, where she shelled Japanese fortifications and screened United States aircraft carriers as they conducted air raids against enemy positions. During the Korean War, Wisconsin shelled North Korean targets in support of United Nations and South Korean ground operations, after which she was decommissioned. She was reactivated on 1 August 1986; after a modernization program, she participated in Operation Desert Storm in January and February 1991.\\r\\nWisconsin was last decommissioned in September 1991 after a total of 14 years of active service in the fleet, and having earned a total of six battle stars for service in World War II and Korea, as well as a Navy Unit Commendation for service during the January/February 1991 Gulf War. She currently functions as a museum ship operated by Nauticus, The National Maritime Center in Norfolk, Virginia. Wisconsin was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register (NVR) 17 March 2006, and, as of 14 December 2009, has been donated for permanent use as a museum ship. On 15 April 2010, the City of Norfolk officially took over ownership of the ship.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWisconsin was one of the \\"fast battleship\\" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the Bureau of Construction and Repair. She was the third of four completed ships of the Iowa?class of battleships.[4] Her keel was laid down on 25 January 1941, at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She was launched on 7 December 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Goodland, wife of Walter S. Goodland, the Governor of Wisconsin, and commissioned on 16 April 1944, with Captain Earl E. Stone in command.[5][6]\\r\\nWisconsin's main battery consisted of nine 16?in (406?mm)/50 cal Mark 7 guns, which could hurl 2,700?lb (1,200?kg) armor-piercing shells some 20?mi (32?km). The secondary battery consisted of 20 5?in (127?mm)/38 cal guns in ten twin turrets, which could fire at targets up to 10?mi (16?km) away. With the advent of air power and the need to gain and maintain air superiority came a need to protect the growing fleet of allied aircraft carriers; to this end, Wisconsin was fitted with an array of Oerlikon 20 mm and Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns to defend allied carriers from enemy airstrikes. When reactivated in 1986, Wisconsin had her 20?mm and 40?mm AA guns removed, and was outfitted with Phalanx CIWS mounts for protection against enemy missiles and aircraft, and Armored Box Launchers and Quad Cell Launchers designed to fire Tomahawk missiles and Harpoon missiles, respectively.[7] Wisconsin and her sister ship Missouri were fitted with thicker traverse bulkhead armor, 14.5 inches (368?mm), compared to 11.3 inches (287?mm) in the first two ships of her class, the Iowa and New Jersey.[8]\\r\\nWisconsin is numerically the highest numbered US battleship built. Although her keel was laid after the USS?Missouri's, she was commissioned before the Missouri's commissioning date.[4][9] Thus, Wisconsin's construction began after Missouri's, and finished earlier. Iowa and Wisconsin were finally stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 March 2006 making them the last battleships on a navy list in the world.\\r\\nAfter the ship's trials and initial training in the Chesapeake Bay, Wisconsin departed Norfolk, Virginia, on 7 July 1944, bound for the British West Indies. Following her shakedown cruise (conducted out of Trinidad) she returned to the builder's yard for alterations and repairs.[5]\\r\\nOn 24 September 1944, Wisconsin sailed for the west coast, transiting the Panama Canal, and reporting for duty with the Pacific Fleet on 2 October. The battleship later moved to Hawaiian waters for training exercises and then headed for the Western Caroline Islands. Upon reaching the Caroline Island Ulithi she joined Admiral William F. Halsey's 3rd Fleet on 9 December.[5][10]\\r\\nDue to the length of time it took to build her, Wisconsin missed much of the initial thrust into Japanese-held territory, having arrived at a time when the reconquest of the Philippines was well underway. As a part of that movement, the planners had envisioned landings on the southwest coast of Mindoro, south of Luzon. From that point, American forces could threaten Japanese shipping lanes through the South China Sea. In preparation for the coming invasion of Mindoro, Wisconsin was assigned to protect the 3rd Fleet's Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 38), as they conducted air raids at Manila to soften up Japanese positions.[5]\\r\\nOn 18 December, the ships of TF 38 unexpectedly found themselves in a fight for their lives when Typhoon Cobra overtook the force√øseven fleet and six light carriers, eight battleships, 15 cruisers, and about 50 destroyers√øduring their attempt to refuel at sea. At the time the ships were operating about 300?mi (480?km) east of Luzon in the Philippine Sea.[11] The carriers had just completed three days of heavy raids against Japanese airfields, suppressing enemy aircraft during the American amphibious operations against Mindoro in the Philippines. The task force rendezvoused with Captain Jasper T. Acuff and his fueling group 17 December with the intention of refueling all ships in the task force and replacing lost aircraft.[12] Although the sea had been growing rougher all day, the nearby cyclonic disturbance gave relatively little warning of its approach. On 18 December, the small but violent typhoon overtook the Task Force while many of the ships were attempting to refuel. Many of the ships were caught near the center of the storm and buffeted by extreme seas and hurricane-force winds. Three destroyers, Hull, Monaghan, and Spence, capsized and sank with nearly all hands, while a cruiser, five aircraft carriers, and three destroyers suffered serious damage.[11] Approximately 790 officers and men were lost or killed, with another 80 injured. Fires occurred in three carriers when planes broke loose in their hangars and some 146 planes on various ships were lost or damaged beyond economical repair by fires, impact damage, or by being swept overboard.[12] Wisconsin reported two injured sailors as a result of the typhoon,[13] but otherwise proved her seaworthiness as she escaped the storm unscathed.[5][12]\\r\\nWisconsin's next operation was to assist with the occupation of Luzon. Bypassing the southern beaches, American amphibious forces went ashore at Lingayen Gulf, the scene of initial Japanese assaults to take Luzon nearly three years before.[5]\\r\\nWisconsin, armed with heavy anti-aircraft batteries, performed escort duty for TF 38's fast carriers during air strikes against Formosa, Luzon, and the Nansei Shoto to neutralize Japanese forces there and to cover the unfolding Allied Lingayen Gulf operations. Those strikes, lasting from 3√ø22 January 1945, included a thrust into the South China Sea, in the hope that major units of the Imperial Japanese Navy could be drawn into battle.[5]\\r\\nWisconsin's carrier group launched air strikes between Saigon and Camranh Bay, French Indochina, on 12 January, resulting in severe losses for the enemy. TF 38's warplanes sank 41 ships and heavily damaged docks, storage areas, and aircraft facilities. Formosa, already struck on 3√ø4 January, was raided again on 9 January 15 January, and 21 January. Throughout January Wisconsin shielded the carriers as they conducted air raids at Hong Kong, Canton, Hainan Island, the Canton oil refineries, the Hong Kong Naval Station, and Okinawa.[5]\\r\\nWisconsin was assigned to the 5th Fleet when Admiral Raymond A. Spruance relieved Admiral Halsey as Commander of the Fleet. She moved northward with the redesignated TF 58 as the carriers headed for the Tokyo area. On 16 February, the task force approached the Japanese coast under cover of adverse weather conditions and achieved complete tactical surprise. As a result, Wisconsin and the other ships shot down 322 enemy planes and destroyed 177 more on the ground. Japanese shipping, both naval and merchant, also suffered drastically, as did hangars and aircraft installations.[5]\\r\\nWisconsin and the task force moved to Iwo Jima on 17 February to provide direct support for the landings slated to take place on 19 February. They revisited Tokyo on 25 February and hit the island of Hachino off the coast of Honsh the next day, resulting in heavy damage to ground facilities; additionally, American planes sank five small vessels and destroyed 158 planes.[5]\\r\\nWisconsin's task force stood out of Ulithi on 14 March bound for Japan. The mission of that group was to eliminate airborne resistance from the Japanese homeland to American forces off Okinawa. Enemy fleet units at Kure and Kobe, on southern Honsh, reeled under the impact of the explosive blows delivered by TF 58's airmen. On 18√ø19 March, from a point 100?mi (160?km) southwest of Kysh, TF 58 hit enemy airfields on that island; unfortunately, allied anti-aircraft fire on 19 March failed to stop an attack on the carrier Franklin. That afternoon, Wisconsin and the task force retired from Kysh, screening the blazing and battered flattop, and shooting down 48 attackers.[5]\\r\\nOn 24 March, Wisconsin trained her 16?in (410?mm) guns on targets ashore on Okinawa. Together with the other battle-wagons of the task force, she pounded Japanese positions and installations in preparation for the landings. Japanese resistance, while fierce, was doomed to failure by dwindling numbers of aircraft and trained pilots.[5]\\r\\nWhile TF 58's planes were dealing with Yamato and her escorts, enemy aircraft attacked the American surface units. Combat air patrols (CAP) shot down 15 enemy planes, and ships' gunfire shot down another three, but not before one kamikaze attack penetrated the CAP and screen to crash on the flight deck of the fleet carrier Hancock. On 11 April, the Japanese renewed their kamikaze attacks; and only drastic maneuvers and heavy barrages of gunfire saved the task force. Combat air patrols shot down 17 planes, and ships' gunfire shot down 12. The next day, 151 enemy aircraft attacked TF 58, but Wisconsin, together with other units of the screens for the vital carriers, kept the kamikaze pilots at bay and destroyed them before they could reach their targets. Over the days that ensued, Japanese kamikaze attacks managed to crash into three carriersIntrepid, Bunker Hill and Enterpriseon successive days.[5]\\r\\nBy 4 June, a typhoon was swirling through the Fleet. Wisconsin rode out the storm unscathed, but three cruisers, two carriers, and a destroyer suffered serious damage. Offensive operations were resumed on 8 June with a final aerial assault on Kysh. Japanese aerial response was virtually nonexistent; 29 planes were located and destroyed. On that day, one of Wisconsin's floatplanes landed and rescued a downed pilot from the carrier Shangri-La.[5]\\r\\nWisconsin ultimately put into Leyte Gulf and dropped anchor there on 13 June for repairs and replenishment. Three weeks later, on 1 July, the battleship and her escorts sailed once more for Japanese home waters for carrier air strikes on the enemy's heartland. Nine days later, carrier planes from TF 38 destroyed 72 enemy aircraft on the ground and smashed industrial sites in the Tokyo area. Wisconsin and the other ships made no attempt whatsoever to conceal the location of their armada, due in large part to a weak Japanese response to their presence.[5]\\r\\nOn 16 July, Wisconsin fired her 16?in (410?mm) guns at the steel mills and oil refineries at Muroran, Hokkaido. Two days later, she wrecked industrial facilities in the Hitachi Miro area, on the coast of Honsh-, northeast of Tokyo itself. During that bombardment, British battleships of the British Pacific Fleet contributed their heavy shellfire. By that point in the war, Allied warships such as Wisconsin were able to shell the Japanese homeland almost at will.[5]\\r\\nTF 38's planes subsequently blasted the Japanese naval base at Yokosuka, and put the former fleet flagship Nagato out of action, one of the two remaining Japanese battleships. Throughout July and into August, Admiral Halsey's airmen visited destruction upon the Japanese, the last instance being against Tokyo on 13 August. Two days later, the Japanese surrendered, ending World War II.[5]\\r\\nWisconsin, as part of the occupying force, arrived at Tokyo Bay on 5 September, three days after the formal surrender occurred on board the battleship Missouri. During Wisconsin's brief career in World War II, she had steamed 105,831?mi (170,318?km) since commissioning; had shot down three enemy planes; had claimed assists on four occasions; and had fueled her screening destroyers on some 250 occasions.[5]\\r\\nShifting subsequently to Okinawa, the battleship embarked homeward-bound GIs on 22 September 1945, as part of Operation Magic Carpet staged to bring soldiers, sailors, and marines home from the far-flung battlefronts of the Pacific. Departing Okinawa on 23 September, Wisconsin reached Pearl Harbor on 4 October, remaining there for five days before she pushed on for the west coast on the last leg of her state-side bound voyage. She reached San Francisco on 15 October.[5]\\r\\nHeading for the east coast of the United States soon after the start of the new year, 1946, Wisconsin transited the Panama Canal from 11√ø13 January and reached Hampton Roads, Virginia on 18 January. Following a cruise south to Guantnamo Bay, Cuba, the battleship entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for overhaul. After repairs and alterations that consumed the summer months, Wisconsin sailed for South American waters.[5]\\r\\nOver the weeks that ensued, the battleship visited Valparaso, Chile, from 1√ø6 November; Callao, Peru, from 9√ø13 November; Balboa, Canal Zone, from 16√ø20 November; and La Guaira, Venezuela, from 22√ø26 November, before returning to Norfolk on 2 December 1946.[5]\\r\\nWisconsin spent nearly all of 1947 as a training ship, taking naval reservists on two-week cruises throughout the year. Those voyages commenced at Bayonne, New Jersey, and saw visits conducted at Guantnamo Bay, Cuba, and the Panama Canal Zone. While underway at sea, the ship would perform various drills and exercises before the cruise would end where it had started, at Bayonne. During June and July 1947, Wisconsin took United States Naval Academy midshipmen on cruises to northern European waters.[5]\\r\\nIn January 1948, Wisconsin reported to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Norfolk for inactivation. Placed out of commission, in reserve on 1 July, Wisconsin was assigned to the Norfolk group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.[5]\\r\\nHer sojourn in \\"mothballs\\", however, was comparatively brief, due to the North Korean invasion of South Korea in late June 1950. Wisconsin was recommissioned on 3 March 1951 with Captain Thomas Burrowes in command.[5] After shakedown training, the revitalized battleship conducted two midshipmen training cruises, taking the officers-to-be to Edinburgh, Scotland; Lisbon, Portugal; Halifax, Nova Scotia; New York City; and Guantnamo Bay, Cuba, before she returned to Norfolk. While leaving New York, Wisconsin was accidentally grounded on mud flats in New York Harbor, but was freed on 23 August 1951 with no damage to the ship.[14]\\r\\nWisconsin departed Norfolk on 25 October, bound for the Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal on 29 October and reached Yokosuka, Japan, on 21 November. There, she relieved New Jersey as flagship for Vice Admiral H. M. Martin, Commander, 7th Fleet.[5]\\r\\nOn 26 November, with Vice Admiral Martin and Rear Admiral F.P. Denebrink, Commander, Service Force, Pacific, embarked, Wisconsin departed Yokosuka for Korean waters to support the fast carrier operations of TF 77. She left the company of the carrier force on 2 December and, screened by the destroyer Wiltsie, provided gunfire support for the Republic of Korea (ROK) Corps in the Kasong-Kosong area. After disembarking Admiral Denebrink on 3 December at Kangnung, the battleship resumed station on the Korean \\"bombline\\", providing gunfire support for the American 1st Marine Division. Wisconsin's shelling accounted for a tank, two gun emplacements, and a building.[5] She continued her gunfire support task for the 1st Marine Division and 1st ROK Corps through 6 December, accounting for enemy bunkers, artillery positions, and troop concentrations.[5] On one occasion during that time, the battleship received a request for call-fire support and provided three star-shells for the 1st ROK Corps, illuminating an enemy attack that was consequently repulsed with considerable enemy casualties.[5]\\r\\nAfter being relieved on the gunline by the heavy cruiser Saint Paul on 6 December, Wisconsin briefly retired from gunfire support duties. She resumed them, however, in the Kasong-Kosong area on 11 December screened by the destroyer Twining. The following day, 12 December, saw the helicopter embarkation on Wisconsin of Rear Admiral H. R. Thurber, Commander, Battleship Division 2 (BatDiv 2), as part of his inspection trip in the Far East.[5]\\r\\nWisconsin continued her naval gunfire support duties on the \\"bombline,\\" shelling enemy bunkers, command posts, artillery positions, and trench systems through 14 December. She departed the \\"bombline\\" on that day to render special gunfire support duties in the Kojo area shelling coastal targets in support of United Nations (UN) troops ashore. That same day, Wisconsin returned to the Kasong-Kosong area. On 15 December, she disembarked Admiral Thurber by helicopter. The next day, Wisconsin departed Korean waters, heading for Sasebo to rearm.[5]\\r\\nReturning to the combat zone on 17 December, Wisconsin embarked United States Senator Homer Ferguson of Michigan on 18 December. That day, the battleship supported the 11th ROK invasion with night illumination fire that enabled the ROK troops to repulse a North Korean assault with heavy enemy casualties.[5][6] Departing the \\"bombline\\" on 19 December, the battleship transferred Ferguson by helicopter to the carrier Valley Forge.[5]\\r\\nOn 20 December, Wisconsin participated in a coordinated air-surface bombardment of Wonsan to neutralize pre-selected targets in its area. The ship shifted its bombardment station to the western end of Wonsan harbor, hitting boats and small craft in the inner swept channel with her 5-inch (127mm) guns during the afternoon and helping forestall attempts to assault the friendly-held islands nearby. Wisconsin then made an anti-boat sweep to the north, firing her 5-inch batteries on suspected boat concentrations. She then provided gunfire support to UN troops operating at the \\"bombline\\" until 22 December, when she rejoined the carrier task force.[5]\\r\\nOn 28 December, Cardinal Francis Spellman, on a Korean tour over the Christmas holidays, helicoptered aboard the ship to celebrate Mass for the Catholic members of the crew. He left as he came, off Pohang. On New Year's Eve day Wisconsin put into Yokosuka.[5]\\r\\nWisconsin departed that port on 8 January 1952 and returned to Korean waters. She reached Pusan the following day and entertained the President of South Korea, Syngman Rhee, and his wife, on 10 January. The couple received full military honors as they came on board, which Rhee reciprocated by awarding Vice Admiral Martin the ROK Order of the Military Merit.[5][6]\\r\\nWisconsin returned to the \\"bombline\\" on 11 January, and over the ensuing days delivered heavy gunfire support for the 1st Marine Division and the 1st ROK Corps. As before, her primary targets were command posts, shelters, bunkers, troop concentrations and mortar positions. As before, she stood ready to deliver call-fire support as needed, shelling enemy troops in the open on 14 January at the request of the ROK 1st Corps.[5]\\r\\nRearming once more at Sasebo, she shortly joined TF 77 off the coast of Korea and resumed support at the \\"bombline\\" on 23 January. Three days later, she shifted again to the Kojo region, to participate in a coordinated air and gun strike. That same day, the battleship returned to the \\"bombline\\" and shelled the command post and communications center for the 15th North Korean Division during call-fire missions for the 1st Marine Division.[5][6]\\r\\nReturning to Wonsan at the end of January, Wisconsin bombarded enemy guns at Hodo Pando before she was rearmed at Sasebo. The battleship rejoined TF 77 on 2 February, and the next day blasted railway buildings and marshaling yards at Hodo Pando and Kojo before rejoining TF 77. After replenishment at Yokosuka a few days later, she returned to the Kosong area and resumed gunfire support. During that time, she destroyed railway bridges and a small shipyard while conducting call-fire missions on enemy command posts, bunkers, and personnel shelters, making numerous cuts on enemy trench lines in the process.[5]\\r\\nOn 26 February, Wisconsin arrived at Pusan where Vice Admiral Shon, the ROK Chief of Naval Operations; United States Ambassador J.J. Muccio; and Rear Admiral Scott-Montcrief, Royal Navy, Commander, Task Group 95.12 (TG 95.12), visited the battleship. Departing that South Korean port the following day, Wisconsin reached Yokosuka on 2 March, and a week later she shifted to Sasebo to prepare to return to Korean waters.[5]\\r\\nWisconsin arrived off Songjin, Korea on 15 March and concentrated her gunfire on enemy railway transport. Early that morning, she destroyed a communist troop train trapped outside a destroyed tunnel. That afternoon, she received the first direct hit in her history, when one of four shells from a North Korean 152mm gun battery struck the shield of a starboard 40?mm mount; Although little material damage resulted, three men were injured.[5][6] Wisconsin subsequently destroyed that battery with a full 16-inch (406?mm) salvo before continuing her mission.[5][6] After lending a hand to support once more the 1st Marine Division with her heavy rifles, the battleship returned to Japan on 19 March.[5]\\r\\nRelieved as flagship of the 7th Fleet on 1 April by sister ship Iowa, Wisconsin departed Yokosuka, bound for the United States. En route home, she touched briefly at Guam, where she took part in the successful test of the Navy's largest floating dry-dock on 4√ø5 April, the first ever to accommodate an Iowa-class battleship. She continued her homeward-bound voyage via Pearl Harbor and arrived at Long Beach, California on 19 April before continuing on for Norfolk.[5]\\r\\nOn 9 June, Wisconsin resumed her role as a training ship, taking midshipmen to Greenock, Scotland; Brest, France; and Guantnamo Bay, Cuba, before returning to Norfolk. She departed Hampton Roads on 25 August and participated in the NATO exercise Operation Mainbrace, which was held out of Greenock, Scotland. After her return to Norfolk, Wisconsin underwent an overhaul in the naval shipyard there. Wisconsin remained in the Atlantic fleet throughout 1952 and into 1953, training midshipmen and conducting exercises. After a month of routine maintenance Wisconsin departed Norfolk on 9 September 1953, bound for the Far East.[5]\\r\\nSailing via the Panama Canal to Japan, Wisconsin relieved New Jersey as 7th Fleet flagship on 12 October. During the months that followed, Wisconsin visited the Japanese ports of Kobe, Sasebo Navy Yard, Yokosuka, Otaru, and Nagasaki. She spent Christmas at Hong Kong and was ultimately relieved of flagship duties on 1 April 1954 and returned to the United States soon thereafter, reaching Norfolk, via Long Beach and the Panama Canal, on 4 May.[5]\\r\\nEntering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 11 June, Wisconsin underwent a brief overhaul and commenced a midshipman training cruise on 12 July. After revisiting Greenock, Brest, and Guantnamo Bay, the ship returned to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for repairs. Shortly thereafter, Wisconsin participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises as flagship for Commander, Second Fleet. Departing Norfolk in January 1955, Wisconsin took part in Operation Springboard, during which time she visited Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Then, upon returning to Norfolk, the battleship conducted another midshipman's cruise that summer, visiting Edinburgh; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Guantnamo Bay before returning to the United States.[5]\\r\\nUpon completion of a major overhaul at the New York Naval Shipyard, Wisconsin headed south for refresher training in the Caribbean Sea, later taking part in another Springboard exercise. During that cruise, she again visited Port-au-Prince and added Tampico, Mexico, and Cartagena, Colombia, to her list of ports of call. She returned to Norfolk on the last day of March 1955 for local operations.[5] On 19 October, while operating in the East River in New York Harbor, Wisconsin was accidentally grounded. However, the ship was freed in about an hour without any serious damage.[14]\\r\\nThroughout April 1956 and into May, Wisconsin operated locally off the Virginia Capes. On 6 May, the battleship collided with the destroyer Eaton in a heavy fog; Wisconsin put into Norfolk with extensive damage to her bow, and one week later entered dry dock at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.[14] A novel experiment sped her repairs and enabled the ship to carry out her scheduled midshipman training cruise that summer. A 120-ton, 68?foot (21?m) section of the bow of Wisconsin's incomplete sister ship Kentucky was transported by barge, in one section, from Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Corporation of Newport News, Virginia, across Hampton Roads to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.[5] Working around the clock, Wisconsin's ships force and shipyard personnel completed the operation which grafted on the new bow in 16 days. On 28 June 1956, the ship was ready for sea.[6][14]\\r\\nWisconsin resumed her midshipman training on 9 July 1956. That autumn, Wisconsin participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises off the coast of the Carolinas, returning to port on 8 November 1956. Entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard a week later, the battleship underwent major repairs that were not finished until 2 January 1957.[5]\\r\\nAfter local operations off the Virginia capes on 3√ø4 January 1957 and from 9√ø11 January, Wisconsin departed Norfolk on 16 January, reporting to Commander, Fleet Training Group, at Naval Station Guantnamo Bay, Cuba. Wisconsin served as Admiral Henry Crommelin's flagship during the ensuing shore bombardment practices and other exercises held off the isle of Culebra, Puerto Rico, from 2√ø4 February. Sailing for Norfolk upon completion of the training period, the battleship arrived on 7 February and resumed local operations off Norfolk. On 27 March, Wisconsin sailed for the Mediterranean Sea, reaching Gibraltar on 6 April, she pushed on that day to rendezvous with TF 60 in the Aegean Sea before reporting to Turkey for the NATO Exercise Red Pivot.[5]\\r\\nDeparting Xeros Bay on 14 April, she arrived at Naples four days later, Wisconsin conducted exercises in the eastern Mediterranean. In the course of those operational training evolutions, she rescued a pilot and crewman who survived the crash of a plane from the aircraft carrier Forrestal.[6] Wisconsin reached Valencia, Spain, on 10 May and, three days later, entertained prominent civilian and military officials of the city.[5]\\r\\nDeparting Valencia on 17 April, Wisconsin reached Norfolk on 27 May. En route, she was called upon to sink a Boeing KC-97F-55-BO Stratofreighter, 51-0258, which had ditched in the Atlantic on 9 May, 550?km (343.8 mls) SE of the Azores Islands following a double engine failure, and subsequently floated for ten days.[15]\\r\\nOn 27 May, Rear Admiral L.S. Parks relieved Rear Admiral Crommelin as Commander, BatDiv 2. Departing Norfolk on 19 June, the battleship, over the ensuing weeks, conducted a midshipman training cruise through the Panama Canal to South American waters, and reached Valparaiso on 3 July. Eight days later, the battleship headed back to the Panama Canal and the Atlantic.[5]\\r\\nAfter exercises at Guantnamo Bay and off Culebra, Wisconsin reached Norfolk on 5 August and conducted local operations that lasted into September. She then participated in NATO exercises which took her across the North Atlantic to the British Isles.[5]\\r\\nWisconsin's days as an active fleet unit were numbered, and she prepared to make her last cruise. On 4 November, she departed Norfolk with a large group of prominent guests on board. Reaching New York City on 6 November, the battleship disembarked her guests and, on 8 November, headed for Bayonne, New Jersey, to commence a pre-inactivation overhaul. She was placed out of commission at Bayonne on 8 March 1958, and joined the United States Navy reserve fleet (better known as the \\"Mothball Fleet\\") there, leaving the United States Navy without an active battleship for the first time since 1895.[5] Subsequently taken to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Wisconsin remained there with her sister ship Iowa into the 1980s.[5] While berthed in the Philadelphia Naval Yard, an electrical fire damaged the ship and left her as the Iowa-class battleship in the worst material condition prior to her 1980s reactivation.[16]\\r\\nAs part of President Ronald Reagan's Navy Secretary John F. Lehman's effort to create a \\"600-ship Navy,\\" Wisconsin was reactivated 1 August 1986, a Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) crew established, and the ship moved under tow to the Avondale Shipyard in New Orleans, Louisiana, to commence pre-recommissioning workups. The battleship was then towed from the Avondale Shipyard and arrived at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi on 2 January 1987 to receive weapons system upgrades for her modernization.[5][6] During the modernization, Wisconsin had all of her remaining 20 mm Oerlikon and 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns removed, due to their ineffectiveness against modern jet fighters and enemy anti-ship missiles; additionally, the two 5?in (130?mm) gun mounts located at mid-ship and in the aft on the port and starboard side of the battleship were removed.[17]\\r\\nOver the next several months, the ship was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available. Among the new weapon systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, eight Armored Box Launcher (ABL) mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles, and a quartet of the United States Navy's Phalanx Close in Weapon System (CIWS) 20mm Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft.[17][18][19] Wisconsin also received eight RQ-2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, which are remotely controlled drones that replaced the helicopters previously used to spot for her nine 16?in (410?mm) guns.[20] Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire control systems for her guns and missiles, and improved electronic warfare capabilities.[17] Armed as such, Wisconsin was formally recommissioned on 22 October 1988 in Pascagoula, Mississippi under the command of Captain Jerry M. Blesch, USN. Assigned to the United States Atlantic Fleet, she was subsequently homeported at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, where she became the centerpiece of her own surface action group (SAG), also referred to as a battleship battle group (BBBG).\\r\\nDuring the renovation, pieces of the teak deck were removed and made into commemorative pieces, but they were not marked with an edition number indicating how many were actually created. A brass plaque with the ships name appears on the left and an inscription reading:\\r\\nWisconsin spent the first part of 1989 conducting training exercises in the Atlantic Ocean and off the coast of Puerto Rico before returning to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a post recommissioning shakedown that lasted the rest of the year. In mid-1990 the battleship participated in a fleet exercise.[6]\\r\\nOn 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. In the middle of the month, President George H. W. Bush, in keeping with the Carter Doctrine, sent the first of several hundred thousand troops, along with a strong force of naval support to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf area to support a multi-national force in a standoff with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. On 7 August, Wisconsin and her battle group were ordered to deploy in defense of Kuwait for Operation Desert Shield, and they arrived in the Persian Gulf on 23 August.[6] On 15 January 1991, Operation Desert Storm commenced operations, and Wisconsin found herself serving alongside her younger sister Missouri, just as she had done in Korea forty years previously. Both Wisconsin and Missouri launched Tomahawk Missile attacks against Iraq; they were among the first ships to fire cruise missiles during the 1991 Gulf War. Wisconsin served as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of Operation Desert Storm and firing a total of 24 of her own TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign.[21] Wisconsin also assumed the responsibility of the local anti-surface warfare coordinator for the Northern Persian Gulf Surface Action Group.[6]\\r\\nWisconsin, escorted by Nicholas, relieved Missouri on 6 February, then answered her first combat call for gunfire support since March 1952. The most recently recommissioned battleship sent 11 shells across 19?mi (31?km) of space to destroy an Iraqi artillery battery in southern Kuwait during a mission called in by USMC OV-10 Bronco aircraft. Using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) as a spotter in combat for the first time, Wisconsin pounded an Iraqi communications compound on 7 February. Her main guns lobbed 24 shells on Iraqi artillery sites, missile facilities, and electronic warfare sites along the coast. That evening she targeted naval sites with her 16?in (410?mm) guns, firing 50 rounds which severely damaged or sunk 15 Iraqi boats, and destroyed several piers at the Khawr al-Mufattah marina.[6] In response to calls for fire support from US and coalition forces, Wisconsin's turrets boomed again on 9 February, blasting bunkers and artillery sites, and shelling Iraqi troop positions near Khafji after the Iraqis were ousted from the city by Saudi and Qatari armor.[6] On 21 February, one of Wisconsin's UAVs observed several trucks resupplying an Iraqi command post; in response, Wisconsin trained her 16?in (410?mm) guns on the complex, leveling or heavily damaging 10 of the buildings.[6] Wisconsin and Missouri alternated positions on the gun line, using their 16?in (410?mm) guns to destroy enemy targets and soften defenses along the Kuwait coastline for a possible amphibious assault.[6][21]\\r\\nOn the night of 23 February, Missouri and Wisconsin turned their big guns on Kuwait's Faylaka Island to support the US-led coalition ground offensive to free Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation forces. The two ships were to conduct a diversionary assault aimed at convincing the Iraqi forces arrayed along the shores of Faylaka Island that Coalition forces were preparing to launch an amphibious invasion.[21] As part of this attack, Missouri and Wisconsin were directed to shell known Iraqi defensive positions on the island. Shortly after Missouri completed her shelling of Faylaka Island, Wisconsin, while still over the horizon (and thus out of visual range of the Iraqi forces) launched her RQ-2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to spot for her 16?in (410?mm) guns. As Wisconsin's drone approached Faylaka Island, the pilot of the drone was instructed to fly the vehicle low over Iraqi positions so that the soldiers would know that they were once again being targeted by a battleship.[20] Iraqi troops on the ground heard the Pioneers distinctive buzzing sound, and having witnessed the effects of Missouri's artillery strike on their trench line, the Iraqi troops decided to signal their willingness to surrender by waving makeshift white flags, an action dutifully noted aboard Wisconsin. Amused at this sudden development, the men assigned to the drones aircrew called Wisconsin's commanding officer, Captain David S. Bill III, and asked, \\"Sir, they want to surrender, what should I do with them?\\"[20] This surrender to Wisconsin's Pioneer has since become one of the most remembered moments of the Gulf War; the incident was also the first-ever surrender of enemy troops to an unmanned aircraft controlled by a ship.[22][23] Wisconsin drone also carried out a number of reconnaissance missions on occupied Kuwait before the coalition's ground offensive.[6]\\r\\nThe next day, Wisconsin answered two separate call fire support missions for coalition forces by suppressing Iraqi troops barricaded in a pair of bunkers. After witnessing the effects of Wisconsin's strike against the Iraqi positions an elated Saudi marine commander commented over the radio, \\"I wish we had a battleship in our navy.\\"[6]\\r\\nBoth Wisconsin and Missouri passed the million-pound mark of ordnance delivered on Iraqi targets by the time president George H. W. Bush ended hostilities on 28 February. With one last salvo from her big guns, Wisconsin fired the last naval gunfire support mission of the war,[21] and thus was the final battleship in world history to see action. Wisconsin remained in the Persian Gulf after the cease-fire took effect, and returned home on 28 March 1991. During the eight months Wisconsin spent in the Persian Gulf, she had flown 348 UAV hours, recorded 661 safe helicopter landings, steamed 46,000?nmi (53,000?mi; 85,000?km), fired 319 16?in (410?mm) rounds,[24] 881 5-inch (130?mm) rounds, 5,200 20?mm Phalanx CIWS rounds.,[6] and launched 24 Tomahawk cruise missiles.[24] Since all four remaining battleships were decommissioned and stricken following the Gulf War, this was the last time that United States battleships actively participated in a war.[18]\\r\\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the absence of a perceived threat to the United States came drastic cuts in the defense budget. The high cost of maintaining and operating battleships as part of the United States Navy's active fleet became uneconomical; as a result, Wisconsin was decommissioned on 30 September 1991 after 14 total years of active service, and joined the Reserve Fleet at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register (NVR) on 12 January 1995, then on 15 October 1996, she was moved to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, and on 12 February 1998, she was restored to the Naval Vessel Register. On 7 December 2000, the battleship was towed from Portsmouth, Virginia and berthed adjacent to Nauticus, The National Maritime Center in Norfolk. On 16 April 2001 the battleship's weather decks were opened to the public by the Hampton Roads Naval Museum, a U.S. Navy museum charged with Wisconsin's interpretation and public visitation. The ship was still owned by the Navy and was considered part of the mothball fleet.[6][18][25]\\r\\nWisconsin was named along with Iowa) as one of two US Navy battleships to be maintained in the United States Navy reserve fleets in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996[26] as shore bombardment vessels. However, Wisconsin was then over 60?years old and would have required extensive modernization to return to the fleet since most of her technology dated back to World War II, and the missile and electronic warfare equipment added to the battleship during her 1988√ø89 modernization were considered obsolete.[17] Furthermore, during the 1991 Gulf War, she was said to be hindered by Iraqi naval mines, and reports on the Internet suggest that the majority of the shore bombardments were successfully carried out by US Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates and their 3?in (76?mm) guns.[21] In addition, the cost of modernizing the battleships was estimated to be around $500?million for reactivation and $1.5?billion for a full modernization program.[27]\\r\\nOn 17 March 2006, the Secretary of the Navy exercised his authority to strike Iowa and Wisconsin from the NVR, which cleared the way for both ships to be donated for use as museums; however, the United States Congress remained \\"deeply concerned\\" over the loss of naval surface gunfire support that the battleships provided, and noted that \\"...navy efforts to improve upon, much less replace, this capability have been highly problematic.\\"[28] Partially as a consequence, Congress passed Pub.L. 109√ø163, the National Defense Authorization Act 2006, requiring that the battleships be kept and maintained in a state of readiness should they ever be needed again.[29] Congress had ordered that the following measures be implemented to ensure that Wisconsin could be returned to active duty if needed:\\r\\nThese four conditions closely mirror the original three conditions that the Nation Defense Authorization Act of 1996 laid out for the maintenance of Wisconsin while she was in the Mothball Fleet.[17][26] It was unlikely that these conditions would impede a plan to turn Wisconsin into a permanent museum ship at her berth in Norfolk.\\r\\nOn 14 December 2009 the US Navy officially transferred Wisconsin to the city of Norfolk, ending the requirement for the ship to be preserved for possible recall to active duty. The US Navy had paid the city of Norfolk $2.8?million between 2000 and 2009 to maintain the ship.[30] A formal ceremony transferring the ship to the city of Norfolk took place on 16 April 2010.[31] Wisconsin was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 28 March 2012.\\r\\nWisconsin earned five battle stars for her World War II service, and one for the Korean War. The ship also received the Combat Action Ribbon and Navy Unit Commendation for actions in the Korean War and Operation Desert Storm in 1991. She also received over a dozen more awards for World War II, the Korean War and Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm.[32]","input":"What type of ship is the uss wisconsin?"},{"output":"Hawai?i island (the Big Island) is the biggest and youngest island in the chain, built from five volcanoes.

Formerly the group was known to Europeans and Americans as the \\"Sandwich Islands\\", a name chosen by James Cook in honor of the then First Lord of the Admiralty John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. The contemporary name is derived from the name of the largest island, Hawaii Island.\\r\\nThe Hawaiian monarchy was overthrown in 1893. The islands were subsequently put under the control of a republic, which the United States annexed in 1898.[1] The U.S. state of Hawaii now occupies the archipelago almost in its entirety (including the uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands), with the sole exception of Midway Island, which instead separately belongs to the United States as one of its unincorporated territories within the United States Minor Outlying Islands.\\r\\nThe Hawaiian Islands are the exposed peaks of a great undersea mountain range known as the Hawaiian√øEmperor seamount chain, formed by volcanic activity over a hotspot in the Earth's mantle. The islands are about 1,860 miles (3,000?km) from the nearest continent.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain James Cook visited the islands on January 18, 1778 and named them the \\"Sandwich Islands\\" in honor of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, who was one of his sponsors as the First Lord of the Admiralty.[3] This name was in use until the 1840s, when the local name \\"Hawaii\\" gradually began to take precedence.[4]\\r\\nThe Hawaiian Islands have a total land area of 6,423.4 square miles (16,636.5?km2). Except for Midway, which is an unincorporated territory of the United States, these islands and islets are administered as Hawaiithe 50th state of the United States.[5]\\r\\nThe eight main islands of Hawaii (also called the Hawaiian Windward Islands) are listed here. All except Kahoolawe are inhabited.[6]\\r\\nSmaller islands, atolls, and reefs (all west of Ni?ihau are uninhabited) form the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, or Hawaiian Leeward Islands:\\r\\nThe state of Hawaii counts 137 \\"islands\\" in the Hawaiian chain.[17] This number includes all minor islands and islets, or very small island, offshore of the main islands (listed above) and individual islets in each atoll. These are just a few:\\r\\nThis chain of islands, or archipelago, developed as the Pacific Plate moved slowly northwestward over a hotspot in the Earth's mantle at a rate of approximately 32 miles (51?km) per million years. Thus, the southeast island is volcanically active, whereas the islands on the northwest end of the archipelago are older and typically smaller, due to longer exposure to erosion. The age of the archipelago has been estimated using potassium-argon dating methods.[18] From this study and others,[19][20] it is estimated that the northwestern most island, Kure Atoll, is the oldest at approximately 28 million years (Ma); while the southeastern most island, Hawai?i, is approximately 0.4 Ma (400,000 years). The only active volcanism in the last 200 years has been on the southeastern island, Hawai?i, and on the submerged but growing volcano to the extreme southeast, Lo?ihi. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory of the USGS documents recent volcanic activity and provides images and interpretations of the volcanism.\\r\\nAlmost all of the magma of the hotspot has the composition of basalt, and so the Hawaiian volcanoes are composed almost entirely of this igneous rock. There is very little coarser-grained gabbro and diabase. Nephelinite is exposed on the islands but is extremely rare. The majority of eruptions in Hawai?i are Hawaiian-type eruptions because basaltic magma is relatively fluid compared with magmas typically involved in more explosive eruptions, such as the andesitic magmas that produce some of the spectacular and dangerous eruptions around the margins of the Pacific basin.\\r\\nHawai?i island (the Big Island) is the biggest and youngest island in the chain, built from five volcanoes. Mauna Loa, taking up over half of the Big Island, is the largest shield volcano on the Earth. The measurement from sea level to summit is more than 2.5 miles (4?km), from sea level to sea floor about 3.1 miles (5?km).[21]\\r\\nThe Hawaiian Islands have many earthquakes, generally caused by volcanic activity. Most of the early earthquake monitoring took place in Hilo, by missionaries Titus Coan, Sarah J. Lyman and her family. From 1833 to 1896, approximately 4 or 5 earthquakes were reported per year.[22]\\r\\nHawaii accounted for 7.3% of the United States' reported earthquakes with a magnitude 3.5 or greater from 1974 to 2003, with a total 1533 earthquakes. Hawaii ranked as the state with the third most earthquakes over this time period, after Alaska and California.[23]\\r\\nOn October 15, 2006, there was an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.7 off the northwest coast of the island of Hawaii, near the Kona area of the big island. The initial earthquake was followed approximately five minutes later by a magnitude 5.7 aftershock. Minor-to-moderate damage was reported on most of the Big Island. Several major roadways became impassable from rock slides, and effects were felt as far away as Honolulu, Oahu, nearly 150 miles (240?km) from the epicenter. Power outages lasted for several hours to days. Several water mains ruptured. No deaths or life-threatening injuries were reported.\\r\\nEarthquakes are monitored by the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory run by the USGS.\\r\\nThe Hawaiian Islands are subject to tsunamis, great waves that strike the shore. Tsunamis are most often caused by earthquakes somewhere in the Pacific. The waves produced by the earthquakes travel at speeds of 400√ø500 miles per hour (600√ø800?km/h) and can affect coastal regions thousands of miles (kilometers) away.\\r\\nTsunamis may also originate from the Hawaiian Islands. Explosive volcanic activity can cause tsunamis. The island of Moloka?i had a catastrophic collapse or debris avalanche over a million years ago; this underwater landslide likely caused tsunamis. The Hilina Slump on the island of Hawai?i is another potential place for a large landslide and resulting tsunami.\\r\\nThe city of Hilo on the Big Island has been most affected by tsunamis, where the in-rushing water is accentuated by the shape of Hilo Bay. Coastal cities have tsunami warning sirens.\\r\\nA tsunami resulting from an earthquake in Chile hit the islands on February 27, 2010. It was relatively minor, but local emergency management officials utilized the latest technology and ordered evacuations in preparation for a possible major event. The Governor declared it a \\"good drill\\" for the next major event.\\r\\nA tsunami resulting from an earthquake in Japan hit the islands on March 11, 2011. It was relatively minor, but local officials ordered evacuations in preparation for a possible major event. The tsunami caused about $30.1 million in damages.[24]\\r\\nThe endemic plant and animal species of the Hawaiian Islands developed in nearly complete isolation over about 70 million years.[clarification needed] Prior to human arrival, the only native mammals were the Hawaiian hoary bat and the Hawaiian monk seal.[25][not in citation given]\\r\\nHuman contact, first by Polynesians, introduced new trees, other plants and animals. These included voracious species such as rats and pigs, who took a heavy toll on native birds and invertebrates that evolved in the absence of such predators. The growing population also brought deforestation, forest degradation, treeless grasslands, and environmental degradation. As a result, many species which depended on forest habitats and food became extinct. As humans cleared land for farming, monocultural crop production replaced multi-species systems.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe arrival of the Europeans had a more significant impact, with the promotion of large-scale single-species export agriculture and livestock grazing. This led to increased clearing of forests, and the development of towns, adding many more species to the list of extinct animals of the Hawaiian Islands. As of 2009[update], many of the remaining endemic species are considered endangered.[26]\\r\\nOn June 15, 2006, President George W. Bush issued a public proclamation creating Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument under the Antiquities Act of 1906. The Monument encompasses the northwestern Hawaiian Islands and surrounding waters, forming the largest[27] marine wildlife reserve in the world. In August 2010, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee added Papahnaumokukea to its list of World Heritage Sites.[28][29][30] On August 26, 2016, President Barack Obama greatly expanded Papahnaumokukea, quadrupling it from its original size.[31][32][33]\\r\\nThe climate of the Hawaiian Islands is tropical but it experiences many different climates, depending on altitude and weather.[34] The islands receive most rainfall from the trade winds on their north and east flanks (the windward side) as a result of orographic precipitation.[34] Coastal areas in general and especially the south and west flanks or leeward sides, tend to be drier.[34]\\r\\nIn general, the lowlands of Hawaiian Islands receive most of their precipitation during the winter months (October to April).[34] Drier conditions generally prevail from May to September.[34] The tropical storms, and occasional hurricanes, tend to occur from July through November.[34]\\r\\nCoordinates: 21N 157W? / ?21N 157W? / 21; -157","input":"Which island of the hawaiian island chain is the youngest?"},{"output":"eight","context":"This is a list of NBA players with most championships won as a player.

Relatively easy to build with unskilled, often forced, labour, but still militarily formidable, these castles were built across northern Europe from the 10th century onwards, spreading from Normandy and Anjou in France, into the Holy Roman Empire in the 11th century. The Normans introduced the design into England and Wales following their invasion in 1066. Motte-and-bailey castles were adopted in Scotland, Ireland, the Low Countries and Denmark in the 12th and 13th centuries. By the end of the 13th century, the design was largely superseded by alternative forms of fortification, but the earthworks remain a prominent feature in many countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA motte-and-bailey castle was made up of two structures, a motte, a type of mound√øoften artificial√øtopped with a wooden or stone structure known as a keep; and at least one bailey, a fortified enclosure built next to the motte. The term \\"motte and bailey\\" is a relatively modern one, and is not medieval in origin.[2] The word \\"motte\\" is the French version of the Latin mota, and in France the word motte was initially an early word for a turf; it then became used to refer to a turf bank, and by the 12th century was used to refer to the castle design itself.[3] The word \\"bailey\\" comes from the Norman-French baille, or basse-cour, referring to a low yard.[4] In medieval sources, the Latin term castellum was used to describe the bailey complex within these castles.[5]\\r\\nOne contemporary account of these structures comes from Jean de Colmieu around 1130, describing the Calais region in northern France. De Colmieu described how the nobles would build \\"a mound of earth as high as they can and dig a ditch about it as wide and deep as possible. The space on top of the mound is enclosed by a palisade of very strong hewn logs, strengthened at intervals by as many towers as their means can provide. Inside the enclosure is a citadel, or keep, which commands the whole circuit of the defences. The entrance to the fortress is by means of a bridge, which, rising from the outer side of the moat and supported on posts as it ascends, reaches to the top of the mound.\\"[6] At Durham Castle, contemporaries described how the motte-and-bailey superstructure arose from the \\"tumulus of rising earth\\" with a keep rising \\"into thin air, strong within and without\\" with a \\"stalwart house...glittering with beauty in every part\\".[7]\\r\\nMottes were made out of earth and flattened on top, and it can be very hard to determine whether a mound is artificial or natural without excavation.[8] Some were also built over older artificial structures, such as Bronze Age barrows.[9] The size of mottes varied considerably, with these mounds being 3 metres to 30 metres in height (10 feet to 100 feet), and from 30 to 90 metres (98 to 295?ft) in diameter.[10] This minimum height of 3 metres (9.8 feet) for mottes is usually intended to exclude smaller mounds which often had non-military purposes.[11] In England and Wales, only 7% of mottes were taller than 10 metres (33 feet) high; 24% were between 10 and 5 metres (33 and 16?ft), and 69% were less than 5 metres (16 feet) tall.[12] A motte was protected by a ditch around it, which would typically have also been a source of the earth and soil for constructing the mound itself.[13]\\r\\nA keep and a protective wall would usually be built on top of the motte. Some walls would be large enough to have a wall-walk around them, and the outer walls of the motte and the wall-walk could be strengthened by filling in the gap between the wooden walls with earth and stones, allowing it to carry more weight; this was called a garillum.[14] Smaller mottes could only support simple towers with room for a few soldiers, whilst larger mottes could be equipped with a much grander building.[15] Many wooden keeps were designed with a bretasche, a square building that overhung from the upper floors of the building, enabling better defences and a more sturdy structural design.[16] The early 12th-century chronicler Lambert of Ardres described the wooden keep on top of the motte at the castle of Ardres, where the \\"first storey was on the surface of the ground, where were cellars and granaries, and great boxes, tuns, casks, and other domestic utensils. In the storey above were the dwelling and common living-rooms of the residents in which were the larders, the rooms of the bakers and butlers, and the great chamber in which the lord and his wife slept...In the upper storey of the house were garret rooms...In this storey also the watchmen and the servants appointed to keep the house took their sleep\\".[17] Wooden structures on mottes could be protected by skins and hides to prevent them being easily set alight during a siege.[15]\\r\\nThe bailey was an enclosed courtyard overlooked by the motte and surrounded by a wooden fence called a palisade and another ditch.[18] The bailey was often kidney-shaped to fit against a circular motte, but could be made in other shapes according to the terrain.[18] The bailey would contain a wide number of buildings, including a hall, kitchens, a chapel, barracks, stores, stables, forges or workshops, and was the centre of the castle's economic activity.[19] The bailey was linked to the motte either by a flying bridge stretching between the two, or, more popularly in England, by steps cut into the motte.[20] Typically the ditch of the motte and the bailey joined, forming a figure of eight around the castle.[21] Wherever possible, nearby streams and rivers would be dammed or diverted, creating water-filled moats, artificial lakes and other forms of water defences.[22]\\r\\nIn practice, there was a wide number of variations to this common design.[23] A castle could have more than one bailey: at Warkworth Castle an inner and an outer bailey was constructed, or alternatively, several baileys could flank the motte, as at Windsor Castle.[24] Some baileys had two mottes, such as those at Lincoln.[24] Some mottes could be square instead of round, such as at Cabal Trump.[24] Instead of single ditches, occasionally double-ditch defences were built, as seen at Berkhamsted.[24] Local geography and the intent of the builder produced many unique designs.[25]\\r\\nVarious methods were used to build mottes. Where a natural hill could be used, scarping could produce a motte without the need to create an artificial mound, but more commonly much of the motte would have to be constructed by hand.[20] Four methods existed for building a mound and a tower: the mound could either be built first, and a tower placed on top of it; the tower could alternatively be built on the original ground surface and then buried within the mound; the tower could potentially be built on the original ground surface and then partially buried within the mound, the buried part forming a cellar beneath; or the tower could be built first, and the mound added later.[26]\\r\\nRegardless of the sequencing, artificial mottes had to be built by piling up earth; this work was undertaken by hand, using wooden shovels and hand-barrows, possibly with picks as well in the later periods.[27] Larger mottes took disproportionately more effort to build than their smaller equivalents, because of the volumes of earth involved.[27] The largest mottes in England, such as Thetford, are estimated to have required up to 24,000 man-days of work; smaller ones required perhaps as little as 1,000.[28] Contemporary accounts talk of some mottes being built in a matter of days, although these low figures have led to suggestions by historians that either these figures were an underestimate, or that they refer to the construction of a smaller design than that later seen on the sites concerned.[29] Taking into account estimates of the likely available manpower during the period, historians estimate that the larger mottes might have taken between four and nine months to build.[30] This contrasted favourably with stone keeps of the period, which typically took up to ten years to build.[31] Very little skilled labour was required to build motte and bailey castles, which made them very attractive propositions if forced peasant labour was available, as was the case after the Norman invasion of England.[20] Where the local workforce had to be paid √ø such as at Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 using imported labourers √ø the costs would rise quickly, in this case reaching S20.[32]\\r\\nThe type of soil would make a difference to the design of the motte, as clay soils could support a steeper motte, whilst sandier soils meant that a motte would need a more gentle incline.[15] Where available, layers of different sorts of earth, such as clay, gravel and chalk, would be used alternatively to build in strength to the design.[33] Layers of turf could also be added to stabilise the motte as it was built up, or a core of stones placed as the heart of the structure to provide strength.[34] Similar issues applied to the defensive ditches, where designers found that the wider the ditch was dug, the deeper and steeper the sides of the scarp could be, making it more defensive.[15] Although militarily a motte was, as Norman Pounds describes it, \\"almost indestructible\\", they required frequent maintenance.[35] Soil wash was a problem, particularly with steeper mounds, and mottes could be clad with wood or stone slabs to protect them.[20] Over time, some mottes suffered from subsidence or damage from flooding, requiring repairs and stabilisation work.[36]\\r\\nAlthough motte-and-bailey castles are the best known castle design, they were not always the most numerous in any given area.[37] A popular alternative was the ringwork castle, involving a palisade being built on top of a raised earth rampart, protected by a ditch. The choice of motte and bailey or ringwork was partially driven by terrain, as mottes were typically built on low ground, and on deeper clay and alluvial soils.[38] Another factor may have been speed, as ringworks were faster to build than mottes.[39] Some ringwork castles were later converted into motte-and-bailey designs, by filling in the centre of the ringwork to produce a flat-topped motte.[40] The reasons for why this decision was taken are unclear; motte-and-bailey castles may have been felt to be more prestigious, or easier to defend; another theory is that like the terpen in Netherlands, or Vorburg and Hauptburg in Lower Rhineland, raising the height of the castle was done to create a drier site.[40]\\r\\nThe motte-and-bailey castle is a particularly northern European phenomenon, most numerous in Normandy and Britain, but also seen in Denmark, Germany, Southern Italy and occasionally beyond.[41] European castles first emerged in the 9th and 10th centuries, after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes and local territories became threatened by the Magyars and the Norse.[42] Against this background, various explanations have been put forward to explain the origins and spread of the motte-and-bailey design across northern Europe; there is often a tension among the academic community between explanations that stress military and social reasons for the rise of this design.[43] One suggestion is that these castles were built particularly in order to protect against external attack?√ø the Angevins, it is argued, began to build them to protect against the Viking raids, and the design spread to deal with the attacks along the Slav and Hungarian frontiers.[44] Another argument is that, given the links between this style of castle and the Normans, who were of Viking descent, it was in fact originally a Viking design, transported to Normandy and Angers.[45] The motte-and-bailey castle was certainly effective against assault, although as historian Andr Debord suggests, the historical and archaeological record of the military operation of motte-and-bailey castles remains relatively limited.[46]\\r\\nAn alternative approach focuses on the links between this form of castle and what can be termed a feudal mode of society. The spread of motte-and-bailey castles was usually closely tied to the creation of local fiefdoms and feudal landowners, and areas without this method of governance rarely built these castles.[47] Yet another theory suggests that the design emerged as a result of the pressures of space on ringworks, and that the earliest motte-and-baileys were converted ringworks.[48][nb 1] Finally, there may be a link between the local geography and the building of motte-and-bailey castles, which are usually built on low-lying areas, in many cases subject to regular flooding.[49] Regardless of the reasons behind the initial popularity of the motte-and-bailey design, however, there is widespread agreement that the castles were first widely adopted in Normandy and Angevin territory in the 10th and 11th centuries.[50]\\r\\nThe earliest purely documentary evidence for motte-and-bailey castles in Normandy and Angers comes from between 1020 and 1040, but a combination of documentary and archaeological evidence pushes the date for the first motte and bailey castle, at Vincy, back to 979.[3] The castles were built by the more powerful lords of Anjou in the late 10th and 11th centuries, in particular Fulk III and his son, Geoffrey II, who built a great number of them between 987 and 1060.[51] Many of these earliest castles would have appeared quite crude and rustic by later standards, belying the power and prestige of their builders.[52] William the Conqueror, as the Duke of Normandy, is believed to have adopted the motte-and-bailey design from neighbouring Anjou.[53] Duke William went on to prohibit the building of castles without his consent through the Consuetudines et Justicie, with his legal definition of castles centring on the classic motte-and-bailey features of ditching, banking and palisading.[54]\\r\\nBy the 11th century, castles were built throughout the Holy Roman Empire, which then spanned central Europe. They now typically took the form of an enclosure on a hilltop, or, on lower ground, a tall, free-standing tower (German Bergfried.)[55] The largest castles, known in German as Hohenburgen, had well-defined inner and outer courts, but no mottes.[56] The motte-and-bailey design began to spread into Alsace and the northern Alps from France during the first half of the 11th century, spreading further into Bohemia and Austria in the subsequent years.[57] This form of castle was closely associated with the colonisation of newly cultivated areas within the Empire, as new lords were granted lands by the emperor and built castles close to the local gr‹ád, or town.[58] Motte-and-bailey castle building substantially enhanced the prestige of local nobles, and it has been suggested that their early adoption was because they were a cheaper way of imitating the still more prestigious hohenburgen, but this is usually regarded as unlikely.[59] In many cases, bergfrieds were converted into motte and bailey designs by burying existing castle towers within the mounds.[59]\\r\\nIn England, William invaded from Normandy in 1066, resulting in three phases of castle building in England, around 80% of which were in the motte-and-bailey pattern.[60] The first of these was the establishment by the new king of royal castles in key strategic locations, including many towns.[61] These urban castles could make use of the existing town's walls and fortification, but typically required the demolition of local houses to make space for them.[62] This could cause extensive damage: records suggest that in Lincoln 166 houses were destroyed, with 113 in Norwich and 27 in Cambridge.[63] The second and third waves of castle building in the late-11th century were led by the major magnates and then the more junior knights on their new estates.[64] Some regional patterns in castle building can be seen √ø relatively few castles were built in East Anglia compared to the west of England or the Marches, for example; this was probably due to the relatively settled and prosperous nature of the east of England and reflected a shortage of unfree labour for constructing mottes.[65] In Wales, the first wave of the Norman castles were again predominantly made of wood in a mixture of motte-and-bailey and ringwork designs.[66] The Norman invaders spread up the valleys, using this form of castle to occupy their new territories.[67] After the Norman conquest of England and Wales, the building of motte-and-bailey castles in Normandy accelerated as well, resulting in a broad swath of these castles across the Norman territories, around 741 motte-and-bailey castles in England and Wales alone.[68]\\r\\nHaving become well established in Normandy, Germany and Britain, motte-and-bailey castles began to be adopted elsewhere, mainly in northern Europe, during the 12th and 13th centuries. Conflict through the Low Countries encouraged castle building in a number of regions from the late 12th century to the 14th century.[69] In Flanders, the first motte and bailey castles began relatively early at the end of the 11th century.[70] The rural motte-and-bailey castles followed the traditional design, but the urban castles often lacked the traditional baileys, using parts of the town to fulfil this role instead.[71] Motte-and-bailey castles in Flanders were particularly numerous in the south along the Lower Rhine, a fiercely contested border.[72] Further along the coast in Friesland, the relatively decentralised, egalitarian society initially discouraged the building of motte and bailey castles, although terpen, raised \\"dwelling mounds\\" which lacked towers and were usually lower in height than a typical motte, were created instead.[73] By the end of the medieval period, however, the terpen gave way to hege wieren, non-residential defensive towers, often on motte-like mounds, owned by the increasingly powerful nobles and landowners.[73] On Zeeland the local lords had a high degree of independence during the 12th and 13th centuries, owing to the wider conflict for power between neighbouring Flanders and Friesland.[74] The Zeeland lords had also built terpen mounds, but these gave way to larger werven constructions√øeffectively mottes√øwhich were later termed bergen.[75] Sometimes both terpen and werven are called vliedburg, or \\"refuge castles\\".[76] During the 12th and 13th centuries a number of terpen mounds were turned into werven mottes, and some new werven mottes were built from scratch.[77] Around 323 known or probable motte and bailey castles of this design are believed to have built within the borders of the modern Netherlands.[11]\\r\\nIn neighbouring Denmark, motte-and-bailey castles appeared somewhat later in the 12th and 13th centuries and in more limited numbers than elsewhere, due to the less feudal society.[78] Except for a handful of mote and bailey castles in Norway, built in the first half of the 11th century and including the royal residence in Oslo, the design did not play a role further north in Scandinavia.[79]\\r\\nThe Norman expansion into Wales slowed in the 12th century but remained an ongoing threat to the remaining native rulers. In response, the Welsh princes and lords began to build their own castles, frequently motte-and-bailey designs, usually in wood.[80] There are indications that this may have begun from 1111 onwards under Prince Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, with the first documentary evidence of a native Welsh castle being at Cymmer in 1116.[81] These timber castles, including Tomen y Rhodywdd, Tomen y Faerdre, Gaer Penrh?s, were of equivalent quality to the equivalent Norman fortifications in the area, and it can prove difficult to distinguish the builders of some sites from the archaeological evidence alone.[82]\\r\\nMotte-and-bailey castles in Scotland emerged as a consequence of the centralising of royal authority in the 12th century.[83] David I encouraged Norman and French nobles to settle in Scotland, introducing a feudal mode of landholding and the use of castles as a way of controlling the contested lowlands.[84] The quasi-independent polity of Galloway, which had resisted the rule of David and his predecessors, was a particular focus for this colonisation.[85] The size of these Scottish castles, primarily wooden motte and bailey constructions, varied considerably, from larger designs such as the Bass of Inverurie to smaller castles like Balmaclellan.[86]\\r\\nMotte-and-bailey castles were introduced to Ireland following the Norman invasion of Ireland that began between 1166 and 1171 under first Richard de Clare and then Henry II of England, with the occupation of southern and eastern Ireland by a number of Anglo-Norman barons.[87] The rapid Norman success depended on key economic and military advantages; their cavalry enabled Norman successes in battles, and castles enabled them to control the newly conquered territories.[88] The new lords rapidly built castles to protect their possessions; most of these were motte-and-bailey constructions, many of them strongly defended.[89] Unlike Wales, the indigenous Irish lords do not appear to have constructed their own castles in any significant number during the period.[90][nb 2] Between 350 and 450 motte-and-bailey castles are believed to remain today, although the identification of these earthwork remains can be contentious.[92]\\r\\nA small number of motte-and-bailey castles were built outside of northern Europe. In the late-12th century, the Normans invaded southern Italy and Sicily; although they had the technology to build more modern designs, in many cases wooden motte-and-bailey castles were built instead for reasons of speed.[93] The Italians came to refer to a range of different castle types as motta, however, and there may not have been as many genuine motte-and-bailey castles in southern Italy as was once thought on the basis of the documentary evidence alone.[94] In addition, there is evidence of the Norman crusaders building a motte and bailey using sand and wood in Egypt in 1221 during the Fifth Crusade.[95]\\r\\nMotte-and-bailey castles became a less popular design in the mid-medieval period. In France, they were not built after the start of the 12th century, and mottes ceased to be built in most of England after around 1170, although they continued to be erected in Wales and along the Marches.[96] Many motte-and-bailey castles were occupied relatively briefly; in England many had been abandoned or allowed to lapse into disrepair by the 12th century.[97] In the Low Countries and Germany, a similar transition occurred in the 13th and 14th centuries.\\r\\nOne factor was the introduction of stone into castle building. The earliest stone castles had emerged in the 10th century, with stone keeps being built on mottes along the Catalonia frontier and several, including Chateau de Langeais, in Angers.[98] Although wood was a more powerful defensive material than was once thought, stone became increasingly popular for military and symbolic reasons.[99] Some existing motte-and-bailey castles were converted to stone, with the keep and the gatehouse usually the first parts to be upgraded.[100] Shell keeps were built on many mottes, circular stone shells running around the top of the motte, sometime protected by a further chemise, or low protective wall, around the base. By the 14th century, a number of motte and bailey castles had been converted into powerful stone fortresses.[101]\\r\\nNewer castle designs placed less emphasis on mottes. Square Norman keeps built in stone became popular following the first such construction in Langeais in 994. Several were built in England and Wales after the conquest; by 1216 there were around 100 in the country.[102] These massive keeps could be either erected on top of settled, well established mottes, or could have mottes built around them √ø so-called \\"buried\\" keeps.[103] The ability of mottes, especially newly built mottes, to support the heavier stone structures, was limited, and many needed to be built on fresh ground.[104] Concentric castles, relying on several lines of baileys and defensive walls, made increasingly little use of keeps or mottes at all.[105]\\r\\nAcross Europe, motte-and-bailey construction came to an end. At the end of the 12th century the Welsh rulers began to build castles in stone, primarily in the principality of North Wales and usually along the higher peaks where mottes were unnecessary.[81] In Flanders, decline came in the 13th century as feudal society changed.[70] In the Netherlands, cheap brick started to be used in castles from the 13th century onwards in place of earthworks, and many mottes were levelled, to help develop the surrounding, low-lying fields; these \\"levelled mottes\\" are a particularly Dutch phenomenon.[106] In Denmark, motte and baileys gave way in the 14th century to a castrum-curia model, where the castle was built with a fortified bailey and a fortified mound, somewhat smaller than the typical motte.[107] By the 12th century, the castles in Western Germany began to thin in number, due to changes in land ownership, and various mottes were abandoned.[108] In Germany and Denmark, motte-and-bailey castles also provided the model for the later wasserburg, or \\"water castle\\", a stronghold and bailey construction surrounded by water, and widely built in the late medieval period.[109]\\r\\nIn England, motte-and-bailey earthworks were put to various uses over later years; in some cases, mottes were turned into garden features in the 18th century, or reused as military defences during the Second World War.[110] Today, almost no mottes of motte-and-bailey castles remain in regular use in Europe, with one of the few exceptions being that at Windsor Castle, converted for the storage of royal documents.[111] The landscape of northern Europe remains scattered with their earthworks, and many form popular tourist attractions as part of the European heritage industry.","input":"When were the motte and bailey castles built?"},{"output":"Basseterre, St. Kitts","context":"The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) is the central bank for the Eastern Caribbean dollar and is the monetary authority for the members of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), with the exception of the British Virgin Islands and Martinique.

The purpose of the wars is often to eliminate demonic beings or lords and rulers who pursue war want only for ambition (wicked wishes) and domination (for worldly pleasures). Hindu teachings prescribe war as the final option, to be employed only after all peaceful methods are exhausted.

Most New Zealanders earn wage or salary income, with a median personal income in 2013 of NZ$28,500.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the demonym for a New Zealand citizen is New Zealander, the informal \\"Kiwi\\" is commonly used both internationally[7] and by locals.[8] The name derives from the kiwi, a native flightless bird, which is the national symbol of New Zealand. The Mori loanword \\"Pkeh\\" usually refers to New Zealanders of European descent, although some reject this appellation,[9][10] and some Mori use it to refer to all non-Polynesian New Zealanders.[11] Most people born in New Zealand or one of the realm's external territories (Tokelau, the Ross Dependency, the Cook Islands and Niue) before 2006 are New Zealand citizens. Further conditions apply for those born from 2006 onwards.[12]\\r\\nIn June 2016, New Zealand has an estimated population of 4,693,000,[13] up from the 4,027,947 recorded in the 2006 census.[14] The median child birthing age was 30 and the total fertility rate is 2.1?births per woman in 2010. In Mori populations the median age is 26 and fertility rate 2.8.[15] In 2010 the age-standardised mortality rate was 3.8?deaths per 1000 (down from 4.8 in 2000) and the infant mortality rate for the total population was 5.1?deaths per 1000 live births.[15] The life expectancy of a New Zealand child born in 2014-16 was 83.4?years for females, and 79.9?years for males.[3] Life expectancy at birth is forecast to increase from 80?years to 85?years in 2050 and infant mortality is expected to decline.[16] In 2050 the population is forecast to reach 5.3?million, the median age to rise from 36?years to 43?years and the percentage of people 60?years of age and older rising from 18?percent to 29?percent.[16] (The number of people aged 65 and over increased by 22?percent between the 2006 and 2013 censuses.[17]) During early migration in 1858, New Zealand had 131 males for every 100 females, but following changes in migration patterns and the modern longevity advantage of women, females came to outnumber males in 1971.[18] As of 2012 there are 0.99 males per female, with males dominating under 15 years and females dominating in the 65 years and older range.[19]\\r\\nNew Zealand's population density is relatively low, at 17.5 per square kilometre (45.3 per square mile)  (June 2016 estimate).[13] The vast majority of the population live on the main North and South Islands, with New Zealand's major inhabited smaller islands being Waiheke Island (9,150), the Chatham and Pitt Islands (610), and Stewart Island (381).[13] Over three-quarters of the population live in the North Island (76.6 percent), with one-third of the total population living in the Auckland Region. This region is also the fastest growing, accounting for 46?percent of New Zealand's total population growth. Most Mori live in the North Island (86.0?percent), although less than a quarter (23.8?percent) live in Auckland.[21] New Zealand is a predominantly urban country, with 86.4?percent of the population living in an urban area. About 73.0?percent of the population live in the 17 main urban areas (population of 30,000 or more) and 53.7?percent live in the four largest cities of Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington, and Hamilton.[13]\\r\\nApproximately 14?percent of the population live in four different categories of rural areas as defined by Statistics New Zealand. About 18?percent of the rural population live in areas that have a high urban influence (roughly 12.9 people per square kilometre), many working in the main urban area. Rural areas with moderate urban influence and a population density of about 6.5?people per square kilometre account for 26?percent of the rural population. Areas with low urban influence where the majority of the residents work in the rural area house approximately 42?percent of the rural population. Remote rural areas with a density of less than 1 person per square kilometre account for about 14?percent of the rural population.[22]\\r\\nBefore local government reforms in the late 1980s, a borough council with more than 20,000 people could be proclaimed a city.[23][24] The boundaries of councils tended to follow the edge of the built-up area, so there was little difference between the urban area and the local government area. In 1989, all councils were consolidated into regional councils (top tier) and territorial authorities (second tier) which cover a much wider area and population than the old city councils.[25] Today a territorial authority must have a predominantly urban population of at least 50,000 before it can be officially recognised as a city.[26] The 20 largest urban areas are listed below:\\r\\nEast Polynesians were the first people to reach New Zealand about 1280, followed by the early European explorers, notably James Cook in 1769 who explored New Zealand three times and mapped the coastline. Following the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 when the country became a British colony, immigrants were predominantly from Britain, Ireland and Australia. Due to restrictive policies, limitations were placed on non-European immigrants.[28] During the gold rush period (1858-1880s) large number of young men came from California and Victoria to New Zealand goldfields. Apart from British, there were Irish, North Germans, Scandinavians, Italian and many Chinese. The Chinese were sent special invitations by the Otago Chamber of Commerce in 1866. By 1873 they made up 40 percent of the diggers in Otago and 25 percent of the diggers in Westland.[29] From 1900 there was also significant Dutch, Dalmatian,[30] Italian, and German immigration together with indirect European immigration through Australia, North America, South America and South Africa.[31] Following the Great Depression policies were relaxed and migrant diversity increased. In 2008√ø09, a target of 45,000 migrants was set by the New Zealand Immigration Service (plus a 5,000 tolerance).[32]\\r\\nJust over 25 percent of New Zealand's population at the 2013 census was born overseas, up from 23 percent in 2006 and 20 percent in 2001. Over half (51.6 percent) of New Zealand's overseas-born population lives in the Auckland Region, including 72 percent of the country's Pacific Island-born population, 64 percent of its Asian-born population, and 56 percent of its Middle Eastern and African- born population.[33] In the late 2000s, Asia overtook the British Isles as the largest source of overseas migrants; today around 32 percent of overseas-born New Zealand residents were born in Asia (mainly China, India, the Philippines and South Korea) compared to 26 percent born in the UK and Ireland.[34] The number of fee-paying international students increased sharply in the late 1990s, with more than 20,000 studying in public tertiary institutions in 2002.[35]\\r\\nTo be eligible for entry under the skilled migrant plan applicants are assessed by an approved doctor for good health, provide a police certificate to prove good character and speak sufficient English. Migrants working in some occupations (mainly health) must be registered with the appropriate profession body before they can work within that area.[36] Skilled migrants are assessed by Immigration New Zealand and applicants that they believe will contribute are issued with a residential visa, while those with potential are issued with a work to resident visa.[37] Under the work to residency process applicants are given a temporary work permit for two years and are then eligible to apply for residency.[38] Applicants with a job offer from an accredited New Zealand employer, cultural or sporting talent, looking for work where there has been a long-term skill shortage or to establish a business can apply for work to residency.[38][39]\\r\\nWhile most New Zealanders live in New Zealand, there is also a significant diaspora abroad, estimated as of 2001 at over 460,000 or 14?percent of the international total of New Zealand-born. Of these, 360,000, over three-quarters of the New Zealand-born population residing outside of New Zealand, live in Australia. Other communities of New Zealanders abroad are concentrated in other English-speaking countries, specifically the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, with smaller numbers located elsewhere.[40] Nearly one quarter of New Zealand's highly skilled workers live overseas, mostly in Australia and Britain, more than any other developed nation.[41] However many educated professionals from Europe and lesser developed countries have recently migrated to New Zealand.[42][43] A common pathway for New Zealanders to move to the UK is through a job offer via the Tier 2 (General) visa, which grants a 3-year initial stay in the country and can later be extended with three more years. After 5 years the person can apply for permanent residency. Another popular option is the UK Working Holiday visa, also known as \\"Youth Mobility Scheme\\" (YMS), which grants New Zealanders 2-year rights to live and work in the UK.[44]\\r\\nNew Zealand is a multiethnic society, and home to people of many different national origins. Originally composed solely of the Mori who arrived in the thirteenth century, the ethnic makeup of the population later became dominated by New Zealanders of European descent.[45] In the nineteenth century, European settlers brought diseases for which the Mori had no immunity. By the 1890s, the Mori population was approximately 40 percent of its size pre-contact.[45] The Mori population increased during the twentieth century,[46] though it remains a minority.\\r\\nAt the latest census in 2013, 14.9?percent identified as Mori, 11.8?percent of the population were Asians (deriving from various nations in Asia), 7.4?percent were of Pacific Islander origin (including from the Cook Islands, Niue, and Tokelau, all of which are dependent states of New Zealand in the Pacific), and 1.2?percent were individuals of Middle-Eastern, Latin American, and African descent (MELAA).[n 2] Approximately three-quarters of the population were of European descent.[4] Most New Zealanders are of English,[47] Scottish[48] and Irish ancestry,[49] with smaller percentages of other European ancestries such as Dutch, Dalmatian, French, German and Scandinavian.[50] Auckland was the most diverse region with 59.3?percent identifying as Europeans, 23.1?percent as Asian, 10.7?percent as Mori, and 14.6?percent as Pacific Islanders.[51]\\r\\nAll major ethnic groups increased when compared with the 2006 census,[52] in which 67.6?percent identified as European, 14.6?percent as Mori, 9.2?percent as Asian, and 6.9?percent of Pacific Islander origin. An additional 11.1?percent identified themselves simply as a \\"New Zealander\\" (or similar), and 1.0?percent identified with other ethnicities.[53] There was significant public discussion about usage of the term \\"New Zealander\\" during the months leading up to the 2006 census.[54] The number of people identifying with this term increased from approximately 80,000 (2.4?percent) in 2001 to just under 430,000 people (11.1?percent) in 2006.[55] The European grouping significantly decreased from 80.0 percent of the population in 2001 to 67.6 percent in 2006, however, this is broadly proportional to the large increase in \\"New Zealanders\\".[55] The number of people identifying as a \\"New Zealander\\" dropped back to under 66,000 in 2013.[55]\\r\\nAs recorded in the 2013 census, the largest Mori iwi is Ngpuhi with 125,601 people (or 18.8 percent of people of Mori descent).[21] Since 2006, the number of people of Mori descent stating Ngpuhi as their iwi increased by 3,390 people (2.8?percent). The second-largest was Ngti Porou, with 71,049 people (down 1.2?percent from 2006). Ngi Tahu was the largest in the South Island and the third-largest overall, with a count of 54,819 people (an increase of 11.4?percent from 2006). A total of 110,928 people (or 18.5?percent) of Mori descent did not know their iwi (an increase of 8.4?percent compared with 2006).[21] A group of Mori migrated to Rkohu, now known as the Chatham Islands, where they developed their distinct Moriori culture.[56][57] The Moriori population was decimated, first, by disease brought by European sealers and whalers and, second, by Taranaki Mori, with only 101 surviving in 1862 and the last known full-blooded Moriori dying in 1933.[57] The number of people identifying as having Moriori descents increased from 105 in 1991 to 945 in 2006,[58] but decreased to 738 in 2013.[59]\\r\\nRecent increases in interracial marriages has resulted in the New Zealand population of Mori, Asian and Pacific Islander descent growing at a higher rate than those of European descent.[60] In 2013, 11.2?percent of people identified with more than one ethnic group,[55] compared with 10.4?percent in 2006.[61] The ethnic diversity of New Zealand is projected to increase. Europeans (including \\"New Zealanders\\") will remain the largest group, although it is predicted to fall to 70?percent in 2026. The Asian, Pacific and Mori groups are the fastest growing and will increase to 3.4?percent, 10?percent and 16?percent, respectively.[62] In 2013, the ethnicity of the population aged under 18 years was 71 percent European, 25 percent Mori, 13 percent Pacific, 12 percent Asian, and 1 percent MELAA.[4][63] The population aged 65?years or older consisted of 87.8 percent European, 5.6 percent Mori, 4.7 percent Asian and 2.4 percent Pacific.[17]\\r\\nThe maps below (taken from 2013 census data[4]) show the percentages of people in each census area unit identifying themselves as European, Mori, Asian, or Pacific Islander (as defined by Statistics New Zealand). As people could identify themselves with multiple groups, percentages are not cumulative.\\r\\nEnglish has long been entrenched as a de facto national language due to its widespread use.[64] In the 2013 census, 96.1?percent of respondents spoke English.[5] The New Zealand English dialect is mostly non-rhotic with an exception being the Southern Burr found principally in Southland and parts of Otago.[65] It is similar to Australian English and many speakers from the Northern Hemisphere are unable to tell the accents apart.[66] In New Zealand English the short i (as in kit) has become centralised, leading to the phrase fish and chips sounding like \\"fush and chups\\" to the Australian ear.[67] The words rarely and really, reel and real, doll and dole, pull and pool, witch and which, and full and fill can sometimes be pronounced as homophones.[68][69][65] Some New Zealanders pronounce the past participles grown, thrown and mown using two syllables, whereas groan, throne and moan are pronounced as one syllable.[70] New Zealanders often reply to a question or emphasise a point by adding a rising intonation at the end of the sentence.[71]\\r\\nInitially, the Mori language (te reo Mori) was permitted in native schools to facilitate English instruction, but as time went on official attitudes hardened against any use of the language. Mori were discouraged from speaking their own language in schools and work places and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas.[72] The language underwent a revival beginning in the 1970s, and now more people speak Mori.[73][74] The future of the language was the subject of a claim before the Waitangi Tribunal in 1985. As a result, Mori was declared an official language in 1987.[75] In the 2013 census, 21.3?percent of Mori peopleand 3.7?percent of all respondents, including some non-Mori peoplereported conversational fluency in the language.[76][n 3] There are now Mori language immersion schools and two Mori Television channels, the only nationwide television channels to have the majority of their prime-time content delivered in Mori.[78] Many places have officially been given dual Mori and English names in recent years.\\r\\nIn the 2013 census, 20,235 people reported the ability to use New Zealand Sign Language. This is down 16?percent on the 2006 census.[5] NZSL was declared one of New Zealand's official languages in 2006.[79]\\r\\nSamoan is the most widely spoken non-official language (2.2?percent),[n 4] followed by Hindi (1.7?percent), \\"Northern Chinese\\" (including Mandarin, 1.3?percent) and French (1.2?percent).[5] A considerable proportion of first- and second-generation migrants are multilingual.\\r\\nEducation follows the three-tier model, which includes primary schools, followed by secondary schools (high schools) and tertiary education at universities or polytechnics. The Programme for International Student Assessment ranked New Zealand's education as the seventh highest in 2009.[80] The Education Index, published with the UN's 2014 Human Development Index and based on data from 2013, listed New Zealand at 0.917, ranked second after Australia.[81]\\r\\nPrimary and secondary schooling is compulsory for children aged 6 to 16[82] with most children starting at 5. Early leaving exemptions may be granted to 15-year-old students that have been experiencing some ongoing difficulties at school or are unlikely to benefit from continued attendance.[83] Parents and caregivers can home school their children if they obtain approval from the Ministry of Education and prove that their child will be taught \\"as regularly and as well as in a registered school\\".[84] There are 13 school years and attending state (public) schools is nominally free from a person's fifth birthday until the end of the calendar year following their 19th birthday.[84][85]\\r\\nThe academic year in New Zealand varies between institutions, but generally runs from late January until mid-December for primary and secondary schools and polytechnics, and from late February until mid-November for universities. New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99?percent,[86] and over half of the population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification.[82][n 5] In the adult population 14.2?percent have a bachelor's degree or higher, 30.4?percent have some form of secondary qualification as their highest qualification and 22.4?percent have no formal qualification.[87]\\r\\nNew Zealand does not have a state religion,[89] but the principal religion is Christianity. As recorded in the 2013 census, about 49?percent of the population identified themselves as Christians,[n 7] although regular church attendance is estimated at 15?percent.[90] Another 41.9?percent indicated that they had no religion (up from 34.7?percent in 2006[91]) and around 6?percent affiliated with other religions.[88]\\r\\nThe indigenous religion of the Mori population was animistic, but with the arrival of missionaries from the early nineteenth century most of the Mori population converted to Christianity.[92] In the 2013 census, 2,595 Mori still identify themselves as adhering to traditional Mori beliefs.[88] The largest Christian denominations are Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Presbyterianism. There are also significant numbers of Christians who identify themselves with Methodist, Pentecostal, Baptist and Latter-day Saint churches, and the New Zealand-based Rtana church has adherents among Mori.[88] Immigration and associated demographic change in recent decades has contributed to the growth of minority religions,[93] especially Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam.[94][95]\\r\\nNew Zealand's early economy was based on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber.[96] During the 1880s agricultural products became the highest export earner and farming was a major occupation within New Zealand.[97] Farming is still a major employer, with 75 000 people indicating farming as their occupation during the 2006 census,[98] although dairy farming has recently taken over from sheep as the largest sector.[97] The largest occupation recorded during the census was sales assistant with 93,840 people.[98] Most people are on wages or salaries (59.9 percent), with the other sources of income being interest and investments (24.1 percent) and self-employment (16.6 percent).[99]\\r\\nIn 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank.[100] In 2010 the estimated gross domestic product (GDP) at purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita was roughly US$28,250, between the thirty-first and fifty-first highest for all countries.[n 8] The median personal income in 2006 was $24,400. This was up from $15,600 in 1996, with the largest increases in the $50,000 to $70,000 bracket.[104] The median income for men was $31,500, $12,400 more than women.[105] The highest median personal income were for people identifying with the European or \\"other\\" ethnic group, while the lowest was from the Asian ethnic group. The median income for people identifying as Mori was $20,900.[106] In 2013, the median personal income had risen slightly to $28,500.[6]\\r\\nUnemployment peaked above 10?percent in 1991 and 1992,[107] before falling to a record low of 3.7?percent in 2007 (ranking third from twenty-seven comparable OECD nations).[108] Unemployment rose back to 7?percent in late 2009.[109] In the June 2017 quarter, unemployment had fallen to 4.8?percent. This is the lowest unemployment rate since December 2008, after the start of the global financial crisis, when it was 4.4 percent.[110] Most New Zealanders do some form of voluntary work, more women volunteer (92 percent) than males (86 percent).[111] Home ownership has declined since 1991, from 73.8?percent to 66.9?percent in 2006.[112]","input":"What is the total population of new zealand?"},{"output":"a persistent high-pressure region in the atmosphere of Jupiter, producing an anticyclonic storm 22 south of the planet's equator","context":"The Great Red Spot is a persistent high-pressure region in the atmosphere of Jupiter, producing an anticyclonic storm 22 south of the planet's equator. It has been continuously observed for 188 years, since 1830.[1] Earlier observations from 1665 to 1713 are believed to be of the same storm; if this is correct, it has existed for at least 350 years.[2][3]\\r\\nSuch storms are not uncommon within the turbulent atmospheres of gas giants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot may have existed since before 1665, but the present spot was first seen only after 1830 and well-studied only after a prominent apparition in 1879.  The storm people had seen in the 1600s may have been a different storm than the one we see today.[4] A long gap separates its period of current study after 1830 from its seventeenth-century discovery; whether the original spot dissipated and reformed, whether it faded, or even if the observational record was simply poor, are all unknown.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, its first sighting is often credited to Robert Hooke, who described a spot on the planet in May 1664; however, it is likely that Hooke's spot was in the wrong belt altogether (the North Equatorial Belt, versus the current Great Red Spot's location in the South Equatorial Belt). Much more convincing is Giovanni Cassini's description of a \\"permanent spot\\" the following year.[6] With fluctuations in visibility, Cassini's spot was observed from 1665 to 1713; however, the 118-year observational gap makes the identity of the two spots inconclusive, and the older spot's shorter observational history and slower motion than the modern spot make their identity unlikely.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nA minor mystery concerns a Jovian spot depicted in a 1711 canvas by Donato Creti, which is exhibited in the Vatican.[8][9] Part of a series of panels in which different (magnified) heavenly bodies serve as backdrops for various Italian scenes, and all overseen by the astronomer Eustachio Manfredi for accuracy, Creti's painting is the first known to depict the Great Red Spot as red. No Jovian feature was explicitly described in writing as red before the late 1800s.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 25, 1979,[10] when the Voyager 1 spacecraft was 9.2 million kilometres (5.7 million miles) from Jupiter it transmitted the first detailed image of the Great Red Spot back to Earth. Cloud details as small as 160 kilometres (100 miles) across were visible. The colorful, wavy cloud pattern seen to the left (west) of the Red Spot is a region of extraordinarily complex and variable wave motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the start of 2004, the Great Red Spot had approximately half the longitudinal extent it had a century ago, when it reached a size of 40,000 kilometres. At the present rate of reduction it would become circular by 2040. It is not known how long the spot will last, or whether the change is a result of normal fluctuations.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nA smaller spot, designated Oval BA, formed recently (March 2000) from the merger of three white ovals,[12][13] has turned reddish in color. Astronomers have named it the Little Red Spot or Red, Jr. As of June 5, 2006, the Great Red Spot and Oval BA appeared to be approaching convergence.[14] The storms pass each other about every two years but the passings of 2002 and 2004 were of little significance. Amy Simon-Miller, of the Goddard Space Flight Center, predicted the storms would have their closest passing on July 4, 2006. She worked with Imke de Pater and Phil Marcus of UC Berkeley, and a team of professional astronomers since April 2006 to study the storms using the Hubble Space Telescope; on July 20, the two storms were photographed passing each other by the Gemini Observatory without converging.[15] In May 2008 a third storm turned red.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot should not be confused with the Great Dark Spot, a feature observed near the northern pole of Jupiter in 2000 with the Cassini√øHuygens spacecraft.[17] Note that a feature in the atmosphere of Neptune was also called the Great Dark Spot. The latter feature was imaged by Voyager 2 in 1989, and may have been an atmospheric hole rather than a storm and it was no longer present as of 1994 (although a similar spot had appeared farther to the north).\\r\\n\\r\\nNASA's Juno Spacecraft flew over the Great Red Spot on July 11, 2017, taking several images of the Spot from about 5,000 miles (8,000?km) above the surface.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oval object rotates counter-clockwise, with a period of about six Earth days[19] or fourteen Jovian days. Measuring 10,159 miles (16,350 kilometers) in width (as of April 3, 2017) Jupiter's Great Red Spot is 1.3 times as wide as Earth.[20] The cloud-tops of this storm are about eight kilometres above the surrounding cloud-tops.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared data have long indicated that the Great Red Spot is colder (and thus, higher in altitude) than most of the other clouds on the planet.[21] However, recent infrared measurements of the upper atmosphere show far more heat above the Great Red Spot than the rest of the planet; \\"acoustic waves\\" rising from the storm have been proposed as an explanation for Jupiter's temperature.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nCareful tracking of atmospheric features revealed the spot's counter-clockwise circulation as far back as 1966, observations dramatically confirmed by the first time-lapse movies from the Voyager fly-bys.[23] The spot is confined by a modest eastward jet stream to its south and a very strong westward one to its north.[24] Though winds around the edge of the spot peak at ~120 metres per second (432 kilometres per hour), currents inside it seem stagnant, with little inflow or outflow.[25] The rotation period of the spot has decreased with time, perhaps as a direct result of its steady reduction in size.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot's latitude has been stable for the duration of good observational records, typically varying by about a degree. Its longitude, however, is subject to constant variation.[27][28]\\r\\nBecause Jupiter does not rotate uniformly at all latitudes, astronomers have defined\\r\\nthree different systems for defining the longitude. System II is used for latitudes of more than 10, and was originally based on the average rotational period of the Great Red Spot of 9h?55m?42s.[29][30] Despite this, however, the spot has \\"lapped\\" the planet in System II at least 10 times since the early nineteenth century. Its drift rate has changed dramatically over the years and has been linked to the brightness of the South Equatorial Belt, and the presence or absence of a South Tropical Disturbance.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not known exactly what causes the Great Red Spot's reddish color. Theories supported by laboratory experiments suppose that the color may be caused by complex organic molecules, red phosphorus, or a compound containing sulphur, but a consensus has yet to be reached.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot varies greatly in hue, from almost brick-red to pale salmon, or even white. In fact, the spot occasionally \\"disappears\\", becoming evident only through the Red Spot Hollow, which is its niche[clarify] in the South Equatorial Belt (SEB). Its visibility is apparently coupled to the SEB; when the belt is bright white, the spot tends to be dark, and when it is dark, the spot is usually light. These periods when the spot is dark or light occur at irregular intervals; as of 1997, during the preceding 50 years, the spot was darkest in the periods 1961√ø1966, 1968√ø1975, 1989√ø1990, and 1992√ø1993.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no definitive theory as to what causes the formation or color of the Great Red Spot. Laboratory studies are examining the effects that cosmic rays or UV Light from the Sun have on the chemical composition of the clouds of Jupiter. One question is whether the Sun's radiation reacts with ammonium hydrosulfide in the planet's outer atmosphere to create the deep red color.[32] Research has shown that the storm produces extreme amounts of heat because it simultaneously generates gravity waves and acoustic waves. When these turbulent energy waves collide 500?mi (800?km) above the red spot, they create extremely high temperatures in the planet's upper atmosphere.

[1]\\r\\nThe modern traveller can be expected to have packages containing clothing, toiletries, small possessions, trip necessities, and on the return-trip, souvenirs. For some people, luggage and the style thereof is representative of the owner's wealth.\\r\\nBaggage (not luggage),[2] or baggage train, can also refer to the train of people and goods, both military and of a personal nature, which commonly followed pre-modern armies on campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuggage has changed over time. Historically the most common types of luggage were chests or trunks made of wood or other heavy materials. These would be shipped by professional movers. Since the Second World War smaller and more lightweight suitcases and bags that can be carried by an individual have become the main form of luggage.\\r\\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word baggage comes from Old French bagage (from baguer \\"tie up\\") or from bagues (\\"bundles\\"). It may also be related to the word bag.[3]\\r\\nAlso according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word luggage originally meant inconveniently heavy baggage and comes from the verb lug and the suffix -age.[4]\\r\\nLuggage carriers √ø light-weight wheeled carts or harnesses on which luggage could be temporarily place or that can be temporarily attached to luggage √ø date at least to the 1930s, such as in US patent 2,132,316 \\"Luggage carrier\\" by Anne W. Newton (filed 1937, published 1938).[5] These were refined over the following decades, as reflected in patents such as US patent 2,650,105 A \\"Luggage carriage\\" (filed 1949, published 1953)[6] and US patent 2,670,969 \\"Luggage carriage harness,[7] both by Kent R. Costikyan.[8] However, the wheels were external to the suitcases. Patents were published for wheeled luggage √ø a wheeled trunk in 1887, and a wheeled suitcase in 1945 √ø but these were not successfully commercialized.[9]\\r\\nThe first commercially successful rolling suitcases was invented in 1970, when Bernard D. Sadow applied for a patent that was granted in 1972 as United States patent 3,653,474 for \\"Rolling Luggage\\".[10] The patent application cited the increase in air travel, and \\"baggage handling [having] become perhaps the single biggest difficulty encountered by an air passenger\\", as background of the invention.[11] Sadow's four-wheeled suitcases, pulled using a loose strap, were later surpassed in popularity by suitcases that feature two wheels and are pulled in an upright position using a long handle. These were invented in 1987 by US pilot Robert Plath, and initially sold to crew members. Plath later commercialized them, after travelers became interested after seeing them in use by crew members, and founded the Travelpro company, which marketing the suitcases under the trademark \\"Rollaboard\\".[10][12][13] The terms rollaboard and roll-aboard are used generically, however. While initially designed for carry-on use (to navigate through a large terminal), as implied by the analogous name, similar designs are also used for checked baggage.\\r\\nMore recently, four-wheeled luggage with casters has become popular, notably since their use by Samsonite in the 2004 version of their signature Silhouette line.[14] These are otherwise similar in design to two-wheel roll-aboards, with a vertical orientation and a retracting handle, but are designed to be pushed beside or in front of the traveler, rather than pulled behind them. These are often referred to as \\"spinner\\" luggage, since they can spin about their vertical axis.\\r\\nSadow attributes the late invention of luggage on wheels to a \\"macho thing\\" where \\"men would not accept suitcases with wheels\\".[10] Others attribute the late invention to \\"the abundance of luggage porters with carts in the 1960s, the ease of curbside drop-offs at much smaller airports and the heavy iron casters then available.\\"[15]\\r\\nSome vehicles have an area specifically for luggage to be held, called the automobile \\"trunk\\" in the United States. Items stored in the hold are known as hold luggage. A typical example would be a suitcase. If travelling by coach passengers will often be expected to place their own luggage in the hold, before boarding. Aeroplanes in contrast are loaded by professional baggage handlers.\\r\\nPassengers are allowed to carry a limited number of smaller bags with them in the vehicle, these are known as hand luggage (more commonly referred to as carry-on in North America), and contain valuables and items needed during the journey. There is normally storage space provided for hand luggage, either under seating, or in overhead lockers. Trains often have luggage racks at the ends of the carriage near the doors, or above the seats if there are compartments. There are differing views between North America and Europe in relation to the rules concerning the amount of baggage carried on to aircraft. In North America there is considerable debate as to whether passengers carry too many bags on board and that their weight could be a risk to other passengers and flight safety. US airlines are beginning to introduce weight and size restrictions for carry-on baggage. Whereas in Europe, many airlines, especially low-cost airlines, impose what is commonly known as \\"the one-bag rule\\". This is a restriction imposed to stop excessive weight on board and airlines claim that this policy allows them to speed the boarding of the aircraft. Airports in Europe have mounted a campaign with the European Commission in an attempt to overturn these hand luggage regulations.[citation needed] They claim that it is affecting their duty-free and other airport retail sales and is reducing their revenues.\\r\\nIn airport terminals, a baggage claim or reclaim area is an area where arriving passengers claim checked-in baggage after disembarking from an airline flight. At most airports and many train stations, baggage is delivered to the passenger on a baggage carousel.\\r\\nLeft luggage, also luggage storage or bag storage, is a place where one can temporarily store one's luggage so as to not have to carry it. Left luggage is not synonymous with lost luggage. Often at an airport or train station there may be a staffed 'left luggage counter' or simply a coin-operated or automated locker system. With higher threats of terrorism all around the globe, this type of public storage is disappearing.[citation needed]. Left luggage is often a concern; one such example includes when Ben Carson interjected My luggage! before walking away from a CNN interview.\\r\\nLuggage forwarding, also known as luggage shipping or luggage logistics, is a type of speciality shipping service that has been available for approximately 10 years and has grown in demand, particularly after the September 11, 2001 attacks. The purpose of luggage forwarding is to reduce the hassles of baggage handling commonly experienced by airline passengers at airports.\\r\\nBaggage can also refer to the train of people and goods, both military and of a personal nature, which commonly followed pre-modern armies on campaign. The baggage was considered a strategic resource and guarded by a rear guard. Its loss was considered to weaken and demoralize an army, leading to rearguard attacks such as that at the Battle of Agincourt.","input":"When was the first suitcase with wheels invented?"},{"output":"6 days, 8 hours and 52 minutes","context":"Australia's Highway 1 is a network of highways that circumnavigate the country, joining all mainland state capitals. At a total length of approximately 14,500?km (9,000?mi) it is among the longest national highways in the world, a list including the Trans-Siberian Highway (over 11,000?km or 6,800?mi) and the Trans-Canada Highway (8,030?km or 4,990?mi). Every day more than a million people travel on a part of it.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHighway 1 was created as part of the National Route Numbering system, adopted in 1955.[2] The route was compiled from an existing network of state and local roads and tracks.[2] Highway 1 is the only route to reach across all Australian states and territories, with the exception of the Australian Capital Territory. Many of the other national routes are tributaries of Highway 1.\\r\\nUnder the original Highway 1 scheme, certain major traffic routes that ran parallel to the main route were designated National Route Alternative 1. Most of these route designations have been replaced by either a state route designation, or an alpha-numeric route designation, depending on which state the section is in. An example of the Alternative 1 designation remaining is on the old Princes Highway route from Dandenong to South Melbourne in Victoria.\\r\\nThe entirety of Highway 1 was originally marked with a National Route 1 shield (black number on a white shield). In 1974, the segments of the route that were declared part of the National Highway network were updated to use the National Highway shield (gold number on a green shield).[3]\\r\\nSince that time, all states and territories except for Western Australia have adopted (or are in the process of adopting) alphanumeric route numbers. As a consequence, much of Highway 1 is now marked with a M1, A1 or B1 route marker (depending on the route's quality and importance). A notable exception is in Tasmania, which was the first state to adopt alphanumeric route numbers but Highway 1 is still marked with a National Highway 1 shield.\\r\\nIn South Australia, sections of Highway 1 which were once part of the National Highway are marked as A1 or M1 but retain the National Highway \\"shield\\".\\r\\nFrom Sydney, it heads southwards to Melbourne and then on to Adelaide via the Eastern Distributor, Southern Cross Drive, General Holmes Drive, The Grand Parade, President Avenue, Princes Highway (NSW), Princes Motorway, Princes Highway (VIC), Princes Freeway (east), Monash Freeway, CityLink, West Gate Freeway, Princes Freeway (west), Geelong Ring Road, Princes Highway (SA). From then on to Perth via Port Wakefield Road, Augusta Highway, Eyre Highway, Coolgardie-Esperance Highway, South Coast Highway and South Western Highway. It then heads to Darwin via Brand Highway, North West Coastal Highway, Great Northern Highway, Victoria Highway, and Stuart Highway.\\r\\nFrom Darwin, Highway 1 follows the Stuart Highway to Daly Waters, and thereafter the Carpentaria Highway to Borroloola. The Savannah Way is the largely unsignposted route for Highway 1 between the QLD/NT border, east of Borroloola, and Normanton, Queensland.\\r\\nFrom there, it follows the Gulf Developmental Road and Kennedy Highway to Cairns and southwards via Bruce Highway to Brisbane and then back to Sydney via the Pacific Motorway (QLD/NSW), Pacific Highway (NSW), Pacific Motorway (NSW), Pacific Highway (Sydney), Gore Hill Freeway, Warringah Freeway, Sydney Harbour Tunnel, and the Cahill Expressway.\\r\\nIn Tasmania it starts at the Brooker Highway in Hobart and heads towards Launceston via the Midland Highway. At Launceston it becomes the Bass Highway to Burnie. Highway 1 ends at Burnie; the Bass Highway continues to Marrawah on the west coast as Highway A2.\\r\\nLarge sections of Highway 1 are shared with the Australian National Highway, though the two are not synonymous. For instance, the Princes Highway from Sydney to Melbourne is part of Highway 1, but is not part of the National Highway, which follows the Hume Highway and Freeway.\\r\\nWith such a vast and incomparable length, road conditions vary greatly;[4] from multi-lane freeways in populous urban and rural areas, to sealed two-laners in remote areas, such as the Nullarbor Plain, to single lane roads, such as in northern Queensland.\\r\\nSome stretches are very isolated, such as the Eyre Highway, which crosses the Nullarbor Plain, and the Great Northern Highway, which runs close to the north-western coastline. Isolated roadhouses serving the small amount of passing traffic are often the only signs of human activity for hundreds of kilometres.\\r\\nHighway 1 has been described as a \\"death trap\\",[4] particularly two-lane sections in northern Queensland, due to driver fatigue.[4] The vast distances between destinations and limited rest areas, especially those suitable to trucks, contribute to the problem.[4]\\r\\nHighway 1 covers practically every major inhabited part of Australia. Large capital cities, busy holiday resorts, dramatic coastlines, forests ranging from tropical to temperate gum forests, giant karri stands, scrubland, deserts, and huge tropical swamps are some of the variety of landscapes that can be found along the route.\\r\\nStretches of Highway 1 are very popular with interstate and overseas tourists. A drive around Highway 1 with a major detour to Uluru and back again practically covers most of Australia. The number 1 shield became part of the bush landscape to many travellers, truckers, and country people.\\r\\nOn the 18th June 2017 team 'Highway One to Hell set a new world record for a complete lap of Australia[5].

When Odisha became a state on 1 April 1936, this poem was made the state anthem of Odisha.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poem envisages a UTKAL that maintains her self-respect and dignity from a position of confidence and strength rather than insecurity and fear.This movement for a separate province also gathered momentum in Odisha.The Utkal Sammilani (a federation of Odias) was leading this movement. This influenced the poet Laxmikanta Mohapatra, who was then young and energetic. He started writing Vande\\r\\nUtkal Janani (Glory to the Mother Utkal) and some other fiery songs with a patriotic motive.\\r\\nWell known national poet of Odisha Banchhanidhi Mohanty was also a good singer. He used to sing Laxmikanta's patriotic songs throughout Odisha and inspired everyone. Once Rabindra Nath Tagore wrote in one of his essays i.e. \\"A Vision of India's History\\" that 'the history of India has been the history of a struggle between the mechanical spirit of conformity in social organization and the creative spirit of man which seeks freedom and love in self-expression' justifies Laxmikanta as a true patriotic poet. It seems to be more powerful and in all\\r\\nits stanzas, the glory as well as the speciality of Odisha have been portrayed which amaze everyone who listens the song. This in quite a\\r\\ndifferent situation being inspired by the God. The rhythm of Mother Odisha's natural beauty and charming surroundings really haunted his\\r\\nimagination.

In a meeting at Bhadrak, where the poet Kantakabi was felicitated, the then young leader of Odisha Harekrushna Mahtab admitted that the poet Laxmikanta's patriotic songs have inspired him a lot. In the past, Marathas, Mughals and Britishers ruled Odisha and its geographical boundaries changed from time to time accordingly. But one will find in this song Bande Utkal Janani that Odisha's natural beauty, God's bounty and boundaries remained unchanged. Odisha's high tradition of arts and crafts in the temples, culture or literature and the peaceful social living, all these things exist in this beautiful song which yet inspires and attracts everybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe State Government's decision to stand up to pay respect when the song is played has been praised.Therefore, it was made compulsory at the end of any Odisha Legislative Assembly Session and in the beginning of school prayer in State Govt. schools in Odisha during the 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\n????? ????? ????,\\r\\n???? ?????? ???? ??????,\\r\\n????, ????, ?????\\r\\n\\r\\n???-?????-?????-?????,\\r\\n???????-???????-????,\\r\\n????? ????????-????-?????,\\r\\n????, ????, ?????\\r\\n\\r\\n?? ?? ?????? ????? ?????,\\r\\n??? ???????? ???? ??????,\\r\\n?? ?? ?????? ???? ???????,\\r\\n????, ????, ?????\\r\\n\\r\\n?????? ????-???????-????????,\\r\\n????????????-?????????-??????,\\r\\n?????????-???-???????,\\r\\n????, ????, ?????\\r\\n\\r\\n?????? ?????? ??????-????,\\r\\n??????????-?????-????,\\r\\n????? ????????-???????-???????,\\r\\n????, ????, ?????\\r\\n\\r\\n????? ?????-??????-????,\\r\\n??????-?????-????????-????,\\r\\n????????????-?????-??????,\\r\\n????, ????, ?????\\r\\n\\r\\n?????????? ???????-???????,\\r\\n???? ???????-???????? ?????????,\\r\\n?????, ??????, ?????????,\\r\\n????, ????, ?????[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBande utkala-janani,\\r\\nCharu-hasamayi charu-bhasamayi,\\r\\nJanani, janani, janani!?\\r\\n\\r\\nPuta-payodhi-bidhouta-?arira,\\r\\nTalatamala-susobhita-tira,\\r\\n?ubhra-tatinikula-?ikara-?amira,\\r\\nJanani, janani, janani!?\\r\\n\\r\\nGhana-Ghana-banabhumi-rajita-ange,\\r\\nNila-bhudhra-mala saje tarange,\\r\\nKalakala-mukharita-charu-bihange,\\r\\nJanani, janani, janani!?\\r\\n\\r\\nSundara?ali-susobhita-k?etra,\\r\\nGyana-bigyana-pradar?ita-netra,\\r\\nJogi-ru?igana-utaja-pabitra,\\r\\nJanani, janani, janani!?\\r\\n\\r\\nSundara-mandira-mandita-de?a,\\r\\nCaru-kalabali-?obhita-be?a,\\r\\nPunya-tirthacaya-purna-prade?a,\\r\\nJanani, janani, janani!?\\r\\n\\r\\nUtkala-surabara-darpita-geha,\\r\\nArikula-?onita-carcita-deha,\\r\\nBiswa-bhumandala-krtabar-sneha,\\r\\nJanani, janani, janani!?\\r\\n\\r\\nKabikulamauli-sunandana-bandya,\\r\\nBhubana-bigho?ita-kirti-anindya,\\r\\nDhanye, punye, cire ?aranye?!\\r\\nJanani, janani, janani!?\\r\\n\\r\\nI adore Thee, O!

Groups are usually described as indigenous when they maintain traditions or other aspects of an early culture that is associated with a given region. Not all indigenous peoples share this characteristic, sometimes having adopted substantial elements of a colonising culture, such as dress, religion or language. Indigenous peoples may be settled in a given region (sedentary) or exhibit a nomadic lifestyle across a large territory, but they are generally historically associated with a specific territory on which they depend. Indigenous societies are found in every inhabited climate zone and continent of the world.[1][2]\\r\\nSince indigenous peoples are often faced with threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being and their access to the resources on which their cultures depend, political rights have been set forth in international law by international organizations such as the United Nations, the International Labour Organization and the World Bank.[1] The United Nations has issued a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) to guide member-state national policies to the collective rights of indigenous people, such as culture, identity, language and access to employment, health, education and natural resources. Estimates put the total population of indigenous peoples from 220 million to 350 million.[3]\\r\\nInternational Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is celebrated on 9 August each year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adjective indigenous was historically used to describe animals and plant origins. During the late twentieth century, the term Indigenous people began to be used to describe a legal category in indigenous law created in international and national legislations; it refers to culturally distinct groups affected by colonization.[4]It is derived from the Latin word indigena, which is based on the root gen- 'to be born' with an archaic form of the prefix in 'in'.[5] Any given people, ethnic group or community may be described as indigenous in reference to some particular region or location that they see as their traditional tribal land claim.[6] Other terms used to refer to indigenous populations are aboriginal, native, original, or first (as in Canada's First Nations).\\r\\nThe use of the term peoples in association with the indigenous is derived from the 19th century anthropological and ethnographic disciplines that Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines as \\"a body of persons that are united by a common culture, tradition, or sense of kinship, which typically have common language, institutions, and beliefs, and often constitute a politically organized group\\".[7]\\r\\nJames Anaya, former Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, has defined indigenous peoples as \\"living descendants of pre-invasion inhabitants of lands now dominated by others. They are culturally distinct groups that find themselves engulfed by other settler societies born of forces of empire and conquest\\".[8][9]\\r\\nThey form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal system. The International Day of the World's Indigenous People falls on 9 August as this was the date of the first meeting in 1982 of the United Nations Working Group of Indigenous Populations of the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities of the Commission on Human Rights.\\r\\nThroughout history, different states designate the groups within their boundaries that are recognized as indigenous peoples according to international or national legislation by different terms. Indigenous people also include people indigenous based on their descent from populations that inhabited the country when non-indigenous religions and cultures arrivedor at the establishment of present state boundarieswho retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions, but who may have been displaced from their traditional domains or who may have resettled outside their ancestral domains.\\r\\nThe status of the indigenous groups in the subjugated relationship can be characterized in most instances as an effectively marginalized, isolated or minimally participative one, in comparison to majority groups or the nation-state as a whole. Their ability to influence and participate in the external policies that may exercise jurisdiction over their traditional lands and practices is very frequently limited. This situation can persist even in the case where the indigenous population outnumbers that of the other inhabitants of the region or state; the defining notion here is one of separation from decision and regulatory processes that have some, at least titular, influence over aspects of their community and land rights.\\r\\nIn a ground-breaking 1997 decision involving the Ainu people of Japan, the Japanese courts recognised their claim in law, stating that \\"If one minority group lived in an area prior to being ruled over by a majority group and preserved its distinct ethnic culture even after being ruled over by the majority group, while another came to live in an area ruled over by a majority after consenting to the majority rule, it must be recognised that it is only natural that the distinct ethnic culture of the former group requires greater consideration.\\"[10]\\r\\nThe presence of external laws, claims and cultural mores either potentially or actually act to variously constrain the practices and observances of an indigenous society. These constraints can be observed even when the indigenous society is regulated largely by its own tradition and custom. They may be purposefully imposed, or arise as unintended consequence of trans-cultural interaction. They may have a measurable effect, even where countered by other external influences and actions deemed beneficial or that promote indigenous rights and interests.\\r\\nIn 1982 the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) accepted as a preliminary definition a formulation put forward by Mr. Jos R. Martnez-Cobo, Special Rapporteur on Discrimination against Indigenous Populations. This definition has some limitations, because the definition applies mainly to pre-colonial populations, and would likely exclude other isolated or marginal societies.[11]\\r\\nIndigenous communities, peoples, and nations are those that, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing in those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal systems.\\r\\nThe primary impetus in considering indigenous identity comes from the post-colonial movements and considering the historical impacts on populations by the European imperialism. The first paragraph of the Introduction of a report published in 2009 by the Secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues published a report,[12] states\\r\\nFor centuries, since the time of their colonization, conquest or occupation, indigenous peoples have documented histories of resistance, interface or cooperation with states, thus demonstrating their conviction and determination to survive with their distinct sovereign identities. Indeed, indigenous peoples were often recognized as sovereign peoples by states, as witnessed by the hundreds of treaties concluded between indigenous peoples and the governments of the United States, Canada, New Zealand and others.[13]\\r\\nIn May 2016, the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) affirmed that indigenous people (also termed aboriginal people, native people, or autochthonous people) are distinctive groups protected in international or national legislation as having a set of specific rights based on their linguistic and historical ties to a particular territory, prior to later settlement, development, and or occupation of a region.[14] The session affirms that since indigenous peoples are vulnerable to exploitation, marginalization, oppression, forced assimilation, and genocide by nation states formed from colonizing populations or by politically dominant, different ethnic groups, special protection of individuals and communities maintaining ways of life indigenous to their regions, are entitled to special protection.\\r\\nGreek sources of the Classical period acknowledge the prior existence of indigenous people(s), whom they referred to as \\"Pelasgians\\". These peoples inhabited lands surrounding the Aegean Sea before the subsequent migrations of the Hellenic ancestors claimed by these authors. The disposition and precise identity of this former group is elusive, and sources such as Homer, Hesiod and Herodotus give varying, partially mythological accounts. However, it is clear that cultures existed whose indigenous characteristics were distinguished by the subsequent Hellenic cultures (and distinct from non-Greek speaking \\"foreigners\\", termed \\"barbarians\\" by the historical Greeks).\\r\\nGreco-Roman society flourished between 250?BC and 480?AD and commanded successive waves of conquests that gripped more than half of the globe. But because already existent populations within other parts of Europe at the time of classical antiquity had more in common culturally speaking with the Greco-Roman world, the intricacies involved in expansion across the European frontier were not so contentious relative to indigenous issues.[15]\\r\\nBut when it came to expansion in other parts of the world, namely Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, then totally new cultural dynamics had entered into the equation, so to speak, and one sees here of what was to take the Americas, South East Asia, and the Pacific by storm a few hundred years later. The idea that peoples who possessed cultural customs and racial appearances strikingly different from those of the colonizing power is no new idea borne out of the Medieval period or the Enlightenment.\\r\\nThe rapid and extensive spread of the various European powers from the early 15th century onwards had a profound impact upon many of the indigenous cultures with whom they came into contact. The exploratory and colonial ventures in the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Pacific often resulted in territorial and cultural conflict, and the intentional or unintentional displacement and devastation of the indigenous populations.\\r\\nThe Canary Islands had an indigenous population called the Guanches whose origin is still the subject of discussion among historians and linguists.[16]\\r\\nIndigenous societies range from those who have been significantly exposed to the colonizing or expansionary activities of other societies (such as the Maya peoples of Mexico and Central America) through to those who as yet remain in comparative isolation from any external influence (such as the Sentinelese and Jarawa of the Andaman Islands).\\r\\nPrecise estimates for the total population of the world's Indigenous peoples are very difficult to compile, given the difficulties in identification and the variances and inadequacies of available census data. The United Nations estimates that there are over 370 million indigenous people living in over 70 countries worldwide.[17] This would equate to just fewer than 6% of the total world population. This includes at least 5000 distinct peoples[18] in over 72 countries.\\r\\nContemporary distinct indigenous groups survive in populations ranging from only a few dozen to hundreds of thousands and more. Many indigenous populations have undergone a dramatic decline and even extinction, and remain threatened in many parts of the world. Some have also been assimilated by other populations or have undergone many other changes. In other cases, indigenous populations are undergoing a recovery or expansion in numbers.\\r\\nCertain indigenous societies survive even though they may no longer inhabit their \\"traditional\\" lands, owing to migration, relocation, forced resettlement or having been supplanted by other cultural groups. In many other respects, the transformation of culture of indigenous groups is ongoing, and includes permanent loss of language, loss of lands, encroachment on traditional territories, and disruption in traditional lifeways due to contamination and pollution of waters and lands.\\r\\nIndigenous populations are distributed in regions throughout the globe. The numbers, condition and experience of indigenous groups may vary widely within a given region. A comprehensive survey is further complicated by sometimes contentious membership and identification.\\r\\nIn the post-colonial period, the concept of specific indigenous peoples within the African continent has gained wider acceptance, although not without controversy. The highly diverse and numerous ethnic groups that comprise most modern, independent African states contain within them various peoples whose situation, cultures and pastoralist or hunter-gatherer lifestyles are generally marginalized and set apart from the dominant political and economic structures of the nation. Since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought recognition of their rights as distinct indigenous peoples, in both national and international contexts.\\r\\nThough the vast majority of African peoples are indigenous in the sense that they originate from that continent and middle and south east Asiain practice, identity as an indigenous people per the modern definition is more restrictive, and certainly not every African ethnic group claims identification under these terms. Groups and communities who do claim this recognition are those who, by a variety of historical and environmental circumstances, have been placed outside of the dominant state systems, and whose traditional practices and land claims often come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by governments, companies and surrounding dominant societies.\\r\\nGiven the extensive and complicated history of human migration within Africa, being the \\"first peoples in a land\\" is not a necessary precondition for acceptance as an indigenous people. Rather, indigenous identity relates more to a set of characteristics and practices than priority of arrival. For example, several populations of nomadic peoples such as the Tuareg of the Sahara and Sahel regions now inhabit areas where they arrived comparatively recently; their claim to indigenous status (endorsed by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights) is based on their marginalization as nomadic peoples in states and territories dominated by sedentary agricultural peoples.\\r\\nIndigenous peoples of the American continent are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the arrival of European colonizers and settlers (i.e., Pre-Columbian). Indigenous peoples who maintain, or seek to maintain, traditional ways of life are found from the high Arctic north to the southern extremities of Tierra del Fuego.\\r\\nThe impact of European colonization of the Americas on the indigenous communities has been in general quite severe, with many authorities estimating ranges of significant population decline primarily due to disease but also violence. The extent of this impact is the subject of much continuing debate. Several peoples shortly thereafter became extinct, or very nearly so.\\r\\nAll nations in North and South America have populations of indigenous peoples within their borders. In some countries (particularly Latin American), indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national populationin Bolivia they account for an estimated 56√ø70% of the total nation, and at least half of the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region and include such ethnonyms as Native Americans, Amerindians, and American Indians. In Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries one finds the use of terms such as pueblos indgenas, amerindios, povos nativos, povos indgenas, and in Peru, Comunidades Nativas (Native Communities), particularly among Amazonian societies like the Urarina[19] and Matss. In Chile there are indigenous tribes like the Mapuches in the Center-South and the Aymaras in the North, also the Rapa Nui indigenous to Easter Island are a Polynesian tribe.\\r\\nIn Brazil, the term ndio (Portuguese pronunciation:?[??d?i.u] or ??d?ju) is used by most of the population, the media, the indigenous peoples themselves and even the government (FUNAI is acronym for the Funda??o Nacional do ndio) (National Indio Foundation), although its Hispanic equivalent indio is widely not considered politically correct and falling into disuse.\\r\\nIndigenous peoples in Canada comprise the First Nations,[20] Inuit[21] and Mtis.[22] The descriptors \\"Indian\\" and \\"Eskimo\\" are falling into disuse in Canada.[23][24] There are currently over 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands encompassing 1,272,790 2006 peoples spread across Canada with distinctive Aboriginal cultures, languages, art, and music.[25][26][27] National Aboriginal Day recognises the cultures and contributions of Aboriginals to the history of Canada\\r\\nThe Inuit have achieved a degree of administrative autonomy with the creation in 1999 of the territories of Nunavik (in Northern Qubec), Nunatsiavut (in Northern Labrador) and Nunavut, which was until 1999 a part of the Northwest Territories. The self-ruling Danish territory of Greenland is also home to a majority population of indigenous Inuit (about 85%).\\r\\nIn the United States, the combined populations of Native Americans, Inuit and other indigenous designations totalled 2,786,652 (constituting about 1.5% of 2003 US census figures). Some 563 scheduled tribes are recognized at the federal level, and a number of others recognized at the state level.\\r\\nIn Mexico, approximately 6,000,000 (constituting about 6.7% of 2005 Mexican census figures) identify as Indgenas (Spanish for natives or indigenous peoples). In the southern states of Chiapas, Yucatn and Oaxaca they constitute 26.1%, 33.5% and 35.3%, respectively, of the population. In these states several conflicts and episodes of civil war have been conducted, in which the situation and participation of indigenous societies were notable factors (see for example EZLN).\\r\\nThe Amerindians make up 0.4% of all Brazilian population, or about 700,000 people.[28] Indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although the majority of them live in Indian reservations in the North and Center-Western part of the country. On 18 January 2007, FUNAI reported that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted tribes in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005. With this addition Brazil has now overtaken the island of New Guinea as the country having the largest number of uncontacted tribes.[29]\\r\\nThe vast regions of Asia contain the majority of the world's present-day Indigenous populations, about 70% according to IWGIA figures.[30]\\r\\nThe Yazidis are indigenous to the Sinjar mountain range in northern Iraq.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe indigenous people of Northern Iraq are the Assyrians.[31] They claim descent from the ancient Neo-Assyrian Empire and Akkadians, and lived in what was Assyria, their original homeland. Their homeland is primarily occupied by the Kurdish autonomous region.\\r\\nThe indigenous people of modern Eastern Turkey, parts of the South Caucasus and much of Azerbaijan (Armenian Highlands) are the Armenians, They have a history in the region dating back to at least 2,450 BCE with the story of Hayk told by Movses Khorenatsi, however much like the Assyrians with whom they share several similarities including the Armenian Genocide and Assyrian Genocide, along with the two peoples becoming victims and minorities within their own land.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe indigenous peoples of the Chittagong Hill Tracts are the Buddhist Chakma people (Jumma people).\\r\\nThe most substantial populations are in India, which constitutionally recognizes a range of \\"Scheduled Castes and Tribes\\" within its borders. These various peoples (collectively referred to as Dalit, Adivasis, or tribal peoples) number about 68 million (1991 census figures, approximately 8% of the total national population).\\r\\nThere are also indigenous people residing in the hills of Northern, North-eastern and Southern India like the Ladakhi, Kinnaurs, Lepcha, Bhutia (of Sikkim), Naga (of Nagaland), indigenous Assamese communities, Munda people of Chota Nagpur Plateau, Mizo (of Mizoram), Kodava (of Kodagu), Toda, Kurumba, Kota (of the Nilgiris), Irulas and others.\\r\\nThe Jats are indigenous people of ancient India, and can be tracked down to 4th century BC.[32]\\r\\nThe Russians invaded Siberia and conquered the indigenous natives in the 17th-18th centuries.\\r\\nNivkh people are an ethnic group indigenous to Sakhalin, having a few speakers of the Nivkh language, but their fisher culture has been endangered due to the development of oil field of Sakhalin from 1990s.[33]\\r\\nAinu people are an ethnic group indigenous to Hokkaid, the Kuril Islands, and much of Sakhalin. As Japanese settlement expanded, the Ainu were pushed northward and fought against the Japanese in Shakushain's Revolt and Menashi-Kunashir Rebellion, until by the Meiji period they were confined by the government to a small area in Hokkaid, in a manner similar to the placing of Native Americans on reservations.[34]\\r\\nThe Dzungar Oirats are the natives of Dzungaria in Northern Xinjiang.\\r\\nThe Pamiris are the native people of Tashkurgan in Xinjiang.\\r\\nThe Ryukyuan people are indigenous to the Ryukyu Islands.\\r\\nThe languages of Taiwanese aborigines have significance in historical linguistics, since in all likelihood Taiwan was the place of origin of the entire Austronesian language family, which spread across Oceania.[35][36][37]\\r\\nThe Malay Singaporeans are the indigenous people of Singapore, inhabiting it since the Austronesian migration. They have established Kingdom of Singapura back in the 13th century. The name Singapore itself comes from the Malay word Singapura (Singa=Lion, Pura=City) which means the Lion City.\\r\\nThe Cham are the indigenous people of the former state of Champa which was conquered by Vietnam in the Cham√øVietnamese wars during Nam ti?n. The Cham in Vietnam are only recognized as a minority, and not as an indigenous people by the Vietnamese government despite being indigenous to the region.\\r\\nThe Degar (Montagnards) are the natives of the Central Highlands (Vietnam) and were conquered by the Vietnamese in the Nam ti?n.\\r\\nThe Khmer Krom are the native people of the Mekong Delta and Saigon which were acquired by Vietnam from Cambodian King Chey Chettha II in exchange for a Vietnamese princess.\\r\\nThe Javanese, Sundanese, Bantenese, Betawi, Tengger, Osing, Badui, Madurese, Malays, Batak, Minangkabau, Acehnese, Lampung, Kubu, Dayak, Banjar, Makassarese, Buginese, Mandar, Minahasa, Buton, Gorontalo, Toraja, Bajau, Balinese, Sasak, Nuaulu, Manusela, Wemale, Dani, Bauzi, Asmat are indigenous peoples in Indonesia. There are over 300 ethnic groups in Indonesia.[38] 200 million of those are of Native Indonesian ancestry.\\r\\nThe indigenous people of Cordillera Administrative Region in the Philippines are the Igorot people.\\r\\nThe indigenous peoples of Mindanao are the Lumad peoples and the Moro (Tausug, Maguindanao Maranao and others) who also live in the Sulu archipelago.\\r\\nIn Europe, present-day indigenous populations as recognized by the UN are relatively few, mainly confined to its north and far east. Nevertheless, the ethnic groups traditionally inhabiting most, if not all, European countries are considered to be indigenous to Europe. This includes the majority populations.\\r\\nNotable minority indigenous populations in Europe include the Basque people of northern Spain and southern France, the Sami people of northern Scandinavia, the Nenets and other Samoyedic peoples of the northern Russian Federation, and the Komi peoples of the western Urals, beside the Circassians in the North Caucasus.\\r\\nIn Australia the indigenous populations are the Aboriginal Australians, within which are many different nations and tribes, and the Torres Strait Islanders. These groups are often spoken of as Indigenous Australians.\\r\\nMany of the present-day Pacific Island nations in the Oceania region were originally populated by Polynesian, Melanesian and Micronesian peoples over the course of thousands of years. European colonial expansion in the Pacific brought many of these under non-indigenous administration. During the 20th century several of these former colonies gained independence and nation-states were formed under local control. However, various peoples have put forward claims for Indigenous recognition where their islands are still under external administration; examples include the Chamorros of Guam and the Northern Marianas, and the Marshallese of the Marshall Islands.\\r\\nThe remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were recently found on the islands of Palau in Micronesia.[39]\\r\\nIn most parts of Oceania, indigenous peoples outnumber the descendants of colonists. Exceptions include New Zealand and Hawaii. According to the 2013 census, New Zealand Mori make up 14.9% of the population of New Zealand, with less than half (46.5%) of all Mori residents identifying solely as Mori. The Mori are indigenous to Polynesia and settled New Zealand relatively recently, the migrations were thought to have occurred in the 13th century CE. In New Zealand pre-contact Mori tribes were not a single people, thus the more recent grouping into tribal (iwi) arrangements has become a more formal arrangement in more recent times. Many Mori tribal leaders signed a treaty with the British, the Treaty of Waitangi, which formed the modern geo-political entity that is New Zealand.\\r\\nThe independent state of Papua New Guinea (PNG) has a majority population of indigenous societies, with more than 700 different tribal groups recognized out of a total population of just over 5 million.[citation needed] The PNG Constitution and other Acts identify traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure, and explicitly set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within the modern state. However, conflicts and disputes concerning land use and resource rights continue between indigenous groups, the government, and corporate entities.\\r\\nIndigenous peoples confront a diverse range of concerns associated with their status and interaction with other cultural groups, as well as changes in their inhabited environment. Some challenges are specific to particular groups; however, other challenges are commonly experienced.[40] These issues include cultural and linguistic preservation, land rights, ownership and exploitation of natural resources, political determination and autonomy, environmental degradation and incursion, poverty, health, and discrimination.\\r\\nThe interaction between indigenous and non-indigenous societies throughout history has been complex, ranging from outright conflict and subjugation to some degree of mutual benefit and cultural transfer. A particular aspect of anthropological study involves investigation into the ramifications of what is termed first contact, the study of what occurs when two cultures first encounter one another. The situation can be further confused when there is a complicated or contested history of migration and population of a given region, which can give rise to disputes about primacy and ownership of the land and resources.\\r\\nWherever indigenous cultural identity is asserted, common societal issues and concerns arise from the indigenous status. These concerns are often not unique to indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of Indigenous peoples, it may be noted that they share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures of Indigenous peoples are being lost and that indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into their surrounding societies. This is borne out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the Sakha and Komi peoples (two of the northern indigenous peoples of Russia), who now control their own autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian Inuit, who form a majority of the territory of Nunavut (created in 1999). In Australia, a landmark case, Mabo v Queensland (No 2),[41] saw the High Court of Australia reject the idea of terra nullius. This rejection ended up recognizing that there was a pre-existing system of law practiced by the Meriam people.\\r\\nIt is also sometimes argued that it is important for the human species as a whole to preserve a wide range of cultural diversity as possible, and that the protection of indigenous cultures is vital to this enterprise.\\r\\nThe Bangladesh Government has stated that there are \\"no Indigenous Peoples in Bangladesh\\".[42] This has angered the Indigenous Peoples of Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh, collectively known as the Jumma.[43] Experts have protested against this move of the Bangladesh Government and have questioned the Government's definition of the term \\"Indigenous Peoples\\".[44][45] This move by the Bangladesh Government is seen by the Indigenous Peoples of Bangladesh as another step by the Government to further erode their already limited rights.[46]\\r\\nBoth Hindu and Chams have experienced religious and ethnic persecution and restrictions on their faith under the current Vietnamese government, with the Vietnamese state confisticating Cham property and forbidding Cham from observing their religious beliefs. Hindu temples were turned into tourist sites against the wishes of the Cham Hindus. In 2010 and 2013 several incidents occurred in Thnh Tn and Ph??c Nh?n villages where Cham were murdered by Vietnamese. In 2012, Vietnamese police in Chau Giang village stormed into a Cham Mosque, stole the electric generator, and also raped Cham girls.[47] Cham in the Mekong Delta have also been economically marginalised, with ethnic Vietnamese settling on land previously owned by Cham people with state support.[48]\\r\\nThe French, the Communist North Vietnamese, and the anti-Communist South Vietnamese all exploited and persecuted the Montagnards. North Vietnamese Communists forcibly recruited \\"comfort girls\\" from the indigenous Montagnard peoples of the Central Highlands and murdered those who didn't comply, inspired by Japan's use of comfort women.[49] The Vietnamese viewed and dealt with the indigenous Montagnards in the CIDG from the Central Highlands as \\"savages\\" and this caused a Montagnard uprising against the Vietnamese.[50] The Vietnamese were originally centered around the Red River Delta but engaged in conquest and seized new lands such as Champa, the Mekong Delta (from Cambodia) and the Central Highlands during Nam Tien, while the Vietnamese received strong Chinese influence in their culture and civilization and were Sinicized, and the Cambodians and Laotians were Indianized, the Montagnards in the Central Highlands maintained their own native culture without adopting external culture and were the true indigenous natives of the region, and to hinder encroachment on the Central Highlands by Vietnamese nationalists, the term Pays Montagnard du Sud-Indochinois PMSI emerged for the Central Highlands along with the natives being addressed by the name Montagnard.[51] The tremendous scale of Vietnamese Kinh colonists flooding into the Central Highlands has significantly altered the demographics of the region.[52] The anti-ethnic minority discriminatory policies by the Vietnamese, environmental degradation, deprivation of lands from the natives, and settlement of native lands by a massive amount of Vietnamese settlers led to massive protests and demonstrations by the Central Highland's indigenous native ethnic minorities against the Vietnamese in January√øFebruary 2001 and this event gave a tremendous blow to the claim often published by the Vietnamese government that in Vietnam There has been no ethnic confrontation, no religious war, no ethnic conflict. And no elimination of one culture by another.[53]\\r\\nIn December 1993, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People, and requested UN specialized agencies to consider with governments and indigenous people how they can contribute to the success of the Decade of Indigenous People, commencing in December 1994. As a consequence, the World Health Organization, at its Forty-seventh World Health Assembly, established a core advisory group of indigenous representatives with special knowledge of the health needs and resources of their communities, thus beginning a long-term commitment to the issue of the health of indigenous peoples.[54]\\r\\nThe WHO notes that \\"Statistical data on the health status of indigenous peoples is scarce. This is especially notable for indigenous peoples in Africa, Asia and eastern Europe\\", but snapshots from various countries, where such statistics are available, show that indigenous people are in worse health than the general population, in advanced and developing countries alike: higher incidence of diabetes in some regions of Australia;[55] higher prevalence of poor sanitation and lack of safe water among Twa households in Rwanda;[56] a greater prevalence of childbirths without prenatal care among ethnic minorities in Vietnam;[57] suicide rates among Inuit youth in Canada are eleven times higher than the national average;[58] infant mortality rates are higher for indigenous peoples everywhere.[59]\\r\\nIndigenous peoples have been denoted primitives, savages[60] or uncivilized. These terms were common during the heights of European colonial expansion, but still continue in certain societies in modern times .[61]\\r\\nDuring the 17th century, indigenous peoples were commonly labeled \\"uncivilized\\". Some philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes considered indigenous people to be merely 'savages', while others are purported to have considered them to be \\"noble savages\\". Those who were close to the Hobbesian view tended to believe themselves to have a duty to \\"civilize\\" and \\"modernize\\" the indigenous. Although anthropologists, especially from Europe, used to apply these terms to all tribal cultures, it has fallen into disfavor as demeaning and is, according to many anthropologists, not only inaccurate, but dangerous.\\r\\nSurvival International runs a campaign to stamp out media portrayal of indigenous peoples as 'primitive' or 'savages'.[62] Friends of Peoples Close to Nature considers not only that indigenous culture should be respected as not being inferior, but also sees their way of life as a lesson of sustainability and a part of the struggle within the \\"corrupted\\" western world, from which the threat stems.[63]\\r\\nAfter World War I, however, many Europeans came to doubt the morality of the means used to \\"civilize\\" peoples. At the same time, the anti-colonial movement, and advocates of indigenous peoples, argued that words such as \\"civilized\\" and \\"savage\\" were products and tools of colonialism, and argued that colonialism itself was savagely destructive. In the mid 20th century, European attitudes began to shift to the view that indigenous and tribal peoples should have the right to decide for themselves what should happen to their ancient cultures and ancestral lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrica\\r\\n\\r\\nAsia\\r\\n\\r\\nEurope\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth America\\r\\n\\r\\nOceania\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth America","input":"What are the original inhabitants of a region or country called?"},{"output":"Imperial Iran","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Persian Empire (Persian: ???????? ??????, translit. ?ahan?ahiye Iran, lit.

Master chief petty officers are addressed as \\"Master Chief (last name)\\" in the colloquial and they constitute the top 1.25% of the enlisted members of the maritime forces.[1]\\r\\nPrior to 1958, chief petty officer was the highest enlisted rate in both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard. This changed on 20 May 1958 with the passage of Public Law 85-422, the Military Pay Act of 1958, which established two new enlisted pay grades of E-8 and E-9 in all five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. In the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, the new E-8 pay grade was titled Senior Chief Petty Officer and the new E-9 pay grade as Master Chief Petty Officer, with the first selectees promoting to their respective grades in 1959 and 1960.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Navy, advancement to master chief petty officer is similar to that of chief petty officer and senior chief petty officer. It carries requirements of time in service, superior evaluation scores, and selection by a board of master chiefs. Similarly, senior chief petty officers and chief petty officers are chosen by selection boards. In the Coast Guard, advancement to master chief petty officer is similar to other advancements consisting of competition with other advancement-eligible senior chief petty officers. Eligible candidates are prioritized based on written examination scores, evaluations, award points, time in service, and time in grade. Master chief petty officers are then selected monthly from this prioritization list as positions become available.\\r\\nPetty officers of all grades possess both a rate (the enlisted term for rank) and rating (job, similar to a military occupational specialty (MOS) in other branches). The full title (most commonly used[3]) is a combination of the two. Thus, a master chief petty officer with the rating of fire controlman would properly be called a master chief fire controlman.\\r\\nEach rating has an official abbreviation, such as FC for fire controlman, FT for fire control technician, and STS for sonar technician, submarines. When combined with the rate abbreviation (CM for master chief), it produces the full rate designation, such as FCCM for master chief fire controlman. It is not uncommon practice to refer to the master chief by this shorthand in all but the most formal correspondence (such as printing and inscription on awards). Mostly, though, they are simply called \\"Master Chief\\", regardless of rating.\\r\\nThe rate insignia for a master chief is a white eagle with spread wings above three chevrons. The chevrons are topped by a rocker(arc) that goes behind the eagle. Two inverted silver stars (a reference to the stars used on the sleeves of line officers) are placed above the eagle. Between the arc and the top chevron is the specialty mark of the enlisted rating. This is used on the service dress blue, dinner dress blue jacket, and dinner dress white jacket uniforms. On other uniforms, the insignia used for shirt collars and caps is the one that has become universally accepted as the symbol of the chief petty officer. This is a gold foul anchor (note: the proper term is \\"foul anchor\\", not \\"fouled\\") superimposed with a silver \\"USN\\" (Navy) or a silver shield (Coast Guard). As on the rating badge, this is capped by two five-pointed stars, showing one ray down.\\r\\nMaster chief petty officers are generally considered to be the technical experts in their fields. They serve at sea and ashore in commands of all sizes. Many master chiefs choose to enter the command master chief petty officer program. If selected, a master chief receives additional leadership training and is assigned to a command as the command master chief (CMDCM). The command master chief is the senior enlisted person at a command and as such works as a liaison between the commanding officer and the enlisted ranks, serving as the senior enlisted leader. In this capacity, the CMDCM assists the commanding officer in issues of quality of life, discipline, training, and morale. On submarines, the CMDCM is called the chief of the boat or \\"COB\\".

Davis and Levi Strauss on May 20, 1873","context":"Jeans are a type of trousers, typically made from denim or dungaree cloth. Often the term \\"jeans\\" refers to a particular style of trousers, called \\"blue jeans,\\" which were invented by Jacob W. Davis in partnership with Levi Strauss & Co. in 1871[1] and patented by Jacob W. Davis and Levi Strauss on May 20, 1873. Prior to the Levi Strauss patented trousers, the term \\"blue jeans\\" had been long in use for various garments (including trousers, overalls, and coats), constructed from blue colored denim.[2] Originally designed for cowboys and miners, jeans became popular in the 1950s among teenagers, especially members of the greaser subculture. Jeans were a common fashion item in the 1960s hippie subculture and they continued to be popular in the 1970s and 1980s youth subcultures of punk rock and heavy metal. Historic brands include Levi's, Lee, and Wrangler.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch on the trade of jean fabric shows that it emerged in the cities of Genoa, Italy, and N?mes, France. Gnes, the French word for Genoa, may be the origin of the word \\"jeans\\". In N?mes, weavers tried to reproduce jean but instead developed a similar twill fabric that became known as denim, from de N?mes, meaning \\"from N?mes\\". Genoas jean was a fustian textile of \\"medium quality and of reasonable cost,\\" very similar to cotton corduroy for which Genoa was famous, and was \\"used for work clothes in general.\\" The Genoese navy equipped its sailors with jeans, as they needed a fabric which could be worn wet or dry.[3][4] N?mess \\"denim\\" was coarser, considered higher quality, and was used \\"for over garments such as smocks or overalls\\".[5] Nearly all Indigo, needed for dyeing, came from indigo bush plantations in Lahore (a city in Pakistan) till the late 19th century. It was replaced by indigo synthesis methods developed in Germany.[6]\\r\\nBy the 17th century, jean was a crucial textile for working-class people in Northern Italy. This is seen in a series of genre paintings from around the 17th century attributed to an artist now named The Master of the Blue Jeans.[7] The ten paintings depict impoverished scenes with lower-class figures wearing a fabric that looks like denim. The fabric would have been Genoese jean, which was cheaper. Genre painting came to prominence in late 16th century, and the low-life subject matter in all ten paintings places them among others that portray similar scenes.[8]\\r\\nDungaree was mentioned for the first time in the 17th century, when it was referred to as cheap, coarse thick cotton cloth, often colored blue but sometimes white, worn by impoverished people in what was then a region of Bombay, India a dockside village called Dongri. This cloth was \\"dungri\\" in Hindi. Dungri was exported to England and used for manufacturing of cheap, robust working clothes. It was rumored that men would carry dead dung beetles in their pocket for luck. In English, the word \\"dungri\\" became pronounced as \\"dungaree\\".[9]\\r\\nThe term jeans appears first in 1795, when a Swiss banker by the name Jean-Gabriel Eynard and his brother Jacques went to Genoa and both were soon heading a flourishing commercial concern. In 1800 Massena's troops entered the town and Jean-Gabriel was entrusted with their supply. In particular he furnished them with uniforms cut from blue cloth called \\"bleu de Genes\\" whence later derives the famous garment known worldwide as \\"blue jeans\\".[10]\\r\\nLevi Strauss, as a young man in 1851, went from Germany to New York to join his older brothers who ran a goods store. In 1853, he moved to San Francisco to open his own dry goods business. Jacob Davis was a tailor who often bought bolts of cloth from the Levi Strauss & Co. wholesale house. In 1872, Davis wrote to Strauss asking to partner with him to patent and sell clothing reinforced with rivets.[11] The copper rivets were to reinforce the points of stress, such as pocket corners and at the bottom of the button fly. Levi accepted Davis's offer,[12] and the two men received US patent No. 139,121 for an \\"Improvement in Fastening Pocket-Openings\\" on May 20, 1873.[13]\\r\\nDavis and Strauss experimented with different fabrics. An early attempt was brown cotton duck, a bottom-weight fabric.[a] Finding denim a more suitable material for work-pants, they began using it to manufacture their riveted pants. The denim used was produced by an American manufacturer. Popular legend incorrectly states that it was imported from Nimes, France. A popular myth is that Strauss initially sold brown canvas pants to miners, later dyed them blue, turned to using denim, and only after Davis wrote to him, added rivets.[11]\\r\\nInitially, Strauss' jeans were simply sturdy trousers worn by factory workers, miners, farmers, and cattlemen throughout the North American West.[14][15] During this period, men's jeans had the fly down the front, whereas women's jeans had the fly down the left side.[16] When Levi Strauss & Co. patented the modern, mass-produced prototype in the year 1873, there were two pockets in the front and one on the back with copper rivets. Later, the jeans were redesigned to today's industry standard of five pockets including a little watch pocket and copper rivets.[10]\\r\\nFewer jeans were made during World War II, but 'waist overalls' were introduced to the world by US soldiers, who sometimes wore them off duty.[17][citation needed] By the 1960s, both men's and women's jeans had the zipper down the front. Historic photographs indicate that in the decades before they became a staple of fashion, jeans generally fit quite loosely, much like a pair of bib overalls without the bib. Indeed, until 1960, Levi Strauss called its flagship product \\"waist overalls\\" rather than \\"jeans\\".\\r\\nAfter James Dean popularized them in the movie Rebel Without a Cause, wearing jeans became a symbol of youth rebellion during the 1950s.[18] During the 1960s the wearing of jeans became more acceptable, and by the 1970s it had become general fashion in the United States for casual wear.[19]\\r\\nExamples of intentional denim distressing strictly to make them more fashionable can be seen as early as 1935 in Vogue's June issue.[20] Michael Belluomo, editor of Sportswear International Magazine, Oct/Nov 1987, P. 45, wrote that in 1965, Limbo, a boutique in the New York East Village, was \\"the first retailer to wash a new pair of jeans to get a used, worn effect, and the idea became a hit.\\" He continued, \\"[Limbo] hired East Village artists to embellish the jeans with patches, decals, and other touches, and sold them for $200.\\" In the early 1980s the denim industry introduced the stone-washing technique developed by GWG also known as \\"Great Western Garment Co.\\" Donald Freeland of Edmonton, Alberta pioneered the method,[21] which helped to bring denim to a larger and more versatile market. Acceptance of jeans continued through the 1980s and 1990s. Originally an esoteric fashion choice, in the 2010s jeans may be seen being worn by people of all genders and ages.[22]\\r\\nTraditionally, jeans were dyed to a blue color using natural indigo dye. Most denim is now dyed using synthetic indigo. Approximately 20?thousand tons of indigo are produced annually for this purpose, though only a few grams of the dye are required for each pair.[23] For other colors of denim other dyes must be used. Currently, jeans are produced in any color that can be achieved with cotton.\\r\\nFor more information on dyeing, refer to denim and the discussion there of using pigment dyes.\\r\\nIn 1962 Levi Strauss introduced pre-shrunk jeans, which did not shrink further after purchase, allowing the consumer to buy their correct size.[24] These jeans were known as the 505 regular fit jeans. The 505 are almost identical to the 501s with the exception of the button-fly. The Levi's Corporation also introduced a slim boot-cut fit known as 517 and 527. The difference between the two is the 517s sit at the waist line and the 527s sit below the waist line. Later, Levi's would develop other styles and fits such as the loose, slim, comfort, relaxed, skinny, and a regular fit with a tapered leg.\\r\\nThe used or \\"acid wash\\" look is created by means of abrading the jeans and/or treating them with chemicals, such as acryl resin, phenol, a hypochlorite, potassium permanganate, caustic soda, acids etc.[25]\\r\\nRipping or distressing of jeans, though also arising naturally as a result of wear and tear, is sometimes deliberately performed by suppliers - with distressed clothing sometimes selling for more than a nondistressed pair. For example, Pucci sold \\"embellished mid-rise boyfriend jeans\\" for S600 GBP ($860 USD).[26]\\r\\nConsumers wanting jeans that appear worn can buy jeans that have been specially treated. To give the fabrics the worn look, sandblasting done with chemicals or by adding pumice stone to the washing process or abrading with sandpaper is often done.\\r\\nA typical pair of blue jeans uses 919 gallons (3479 liters) of water during its life cycle. This includes the water to irrigate the cotton crop, manufacture the jeans, and the numerous washes by the consumer.[27]\\r\\nThe production of jeans with a \\"used look\\" can be more environmentally damaging than regular jeans[28][citation needed], depending on how the waste compounds are processed. Sandblasting and treating with sandpaper has the risk of causing silicosis to the workers, and in Turkey, more than 5,000 textile workers have been stricken with this disease, and 46 people are known to have died. Some companies have announced they are banning the use of sandblasting.[29]\\r\\nDespite most jeans being \\"pre-shrunk\\", they are still sensitive to slight further shrinkage and loss of color from being washed. The Levi Strauss company recommends avoiding washing jeans as much as possible. Carl Chiara, Levi Strauss director of brand and special projects, has a credo: The less you wash your jeans, the better your jeans become.[30] These and other suggestions to avoid washing jeans where possible have encountered criticism. Cory Warren, editor of LS&Co. Unzipped, clarifies in a response to such a criticism:\\r\\nOur advice is to wash less often, but clearly, you have to judge for yourself what's appropriate. Hot day, dirty job? Wash your jeans. Please! Cold day, office job? Maybe you can wear them twice or more before they go back to the washing machine. Personally, if I wear a pair of jeans to work on Fridaycool climate, office jobI tend to wear them on Saturday. And if Saturday is spent indoors and I'm not spilling food all over myself, I might even wear them on Sunday.\\r\\nFor those who prefer to refrain from washing their jeans there have been suggestions to freeze them in order to kill the germs that cause odor. However, this advice has been disputed as ineffective and replaced with the suggestion of baking them for ten minutes at 250 degrees Fahrenheit.[31] (120?C).\\r\\nJeans are covered under laws regarding trousers. As well, there have been some notable legal cases involving jeans specifically:\\r\\nIn Rome, Italy in 1992, a 45-year-old driving instructor was accused of rape. When he picked up an 18-year-old girl for her first driving lesson, he allegedly raped her for an hour, then told her that if she was to tell anyone he would kill her. Later that night she told her parents and her parents agreed to help her press charges. While the alleged rapist was convicted and sentenced, the Italian Supreme Court overturned the conviction in 1998 because the victim wore tight jeans. It was argued that she must have necessarily had to help her attacker remove her jeans, thus making the act consensual (\\"because the victim wore very, very tight jeans, she had to help him remove them...and by removing the jeans...it was no longer rape but consensual sex\\"). The Italian Supreme Court stated in its decision \\"it is a fact of common experience that it is nearly impossible to slip off tight jeans even partly without the active collaboration of the person who is wearing them.\\"[32] This ruling sparked widespread feminist protest. The day after the decision, women in the Italian Parliament protested by wearing jeans and holding placards that read \\"Jeans: An Alibi for Rape.\\" As a sign of support, the California Senate and Assembly followed suit. Soon Patricia Giggans, Executive Director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, (now Peace Over Violence) made Denim Day an annual event. As of 2011 at least 20 U.S. states officially recognize Denim Day in April. Wearing jeans on this day has become an international symbol of protest against erroneous and destructive attitudes about sexual assault. As of 2008 the Italian Supreme Court has overturned their findings, and there is no longer a \\"denim\\" defense to the charge of rape.\\r\\nIn 2014, an Indian family court in Mumbai ruled that a husband objecting to his wife wearing a kurta and jeans and forcing her to wear a sari amounts to cruelty inflicted by the husband and can be a ground to seek divorce.[33] The wife was thus granted a divorce on the ground of cruelty as defined under section 27(1)(d) of Special Marriage Act, 1954.[33]\\r\\nNorth America accounts for 39% of global purchases for jeans, followed by Western Europe at 20%, Japan and Korea at 10% and the rest of the world at 31%.[34]\\r\\nUnited States consumers spent more than US$14 billion on jeans in 2004 and US$15 billion in 2005.[35] US consumers bought US$13.8 billion of men's and women's jeans in the year that ended 30 April 2011, according to market-research firm NPD Group.[36]\\r\\nIn the Soviet Union, jeans were the symbol of the Western way of life. The \\"jeans fever\\" in the USSR started in 1957 during the World Festival of Youth and Students.[37] According to a 1961 Russian textile dictionary, jeans were initially referred to as a \\"worker's uniform\\" (…æ“≥ “π, rabochii kostyum).[38]\\r\\nThe jeans brand Rokotov and Fainberg is named after the defendants in the Rokotov√øFaibishenko case, who were executed for, among other things, trafficking in jeans.[37]\\r\\nAlthough not outright banned, jeans were hard to come by in USSR. It was seen as a symbol of rebellion by the Soviet youth who wanted to emulate the style of film and rock stars of the West. The Soviet government resisted supplying the market with jeans as that would mean responding to the market, a capitalist principle.[39] People went to great lengths, sometimes resorting to violence and other illegal activities to obtain real Western made jeans. This led to the creation of black markets and bootlegging of jeans, which since has become an important cultural element in the history of the Soviet Union.[40]\\r\\nIn 2014, teens were buying more fashion and athleisure clothing from brands such as Nike and Lululemon over denim classics from brands like Abercrombie & Fitch.[41] Activewear on 2014 comprised 28% of teens' apparel purchases, up from 6% in 2008. In 2014, Nike, Lululemon, Under Armour, and Adidas were the most popular brands for athletic apparel among teen consumers. Fashion retailers have begun to adjust their offerings accordingly. Bloomberg reports that Levi's, which is the world's most iconic denim company, stuck to its core product (denim) instead of adapting to consumer trends. As a result, Levi's sales decreased from over USD 7 billion to USD 4.8 billion in 2015.[42]\\r\\nDistressed denim emerged from the cultural punk movement in the 1970s. Early punks tore apart consumer goods as an expression of their anger towards society.[43] Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols manifested the British punk ideology, which was fighting against the status quo and Margaret Thatchers rigid conservative government. Denim became a key target of this politically fueled deconstruction, with both men and women donning torn pants and jackets, accessorized with safety pins and slogans. The trend became popular again in the 1990s with the emergence of grunge fashion. If punk was anti-fashion, grunge was non-fashion. The grunge youth wore loose-fitting ripped jeans, flannel shirts or woolen Pendletons layered over T-shirts. Their anti-conformist approach to fashion led to the popularization of the casual chic look, a trend which continued into the 2000s.\\r\\nMedia reported in 2017 that the trend of low-rise jeans, famous in 1990s and 2000s as sagging, was coming back in fashion due to celebrities like Justin Bieber endorsing it.[44]\\r\\nHow denim fabric is stored in the factory.\\r\\nAutomated cutting machines are used in RMG factory to cut the pieces.\\r\\nP P Spray and P P Sponging being applied to jeans to give them a new look.\\r\\nAdding 3D crunching, whiskers, and wrinkles to jeans to make them look more used.\\r\\nApplying permanent wrinkles to jeans.\\r\\nHand scraping of jeans.\\r\\nResin treatment process on jeans.\\r\\nTacking on jeans (adds strength to high-stress areas).\\r\\nSocks dyeing machine in a washing plant for washing jeans.\\r\\nThe process of washing and drying jeans.\\r\\nThe final steps of preparing jeans for market.\\r\\nChecking the fit on a live model.\\r\\nQuality checking and quality assurance.\\r\\nJeans denim pants are displayed for the buyer in the RMG factory showroom.","input":"Who created the first pair of blue jeans ans?"},{"output":"November 10, 1983","context":"Microsoft Windows was announced by Bill Gates on November 10, 1983.[1] Microsoft introduced Windows as a graphical user interface for MS-DOS, which had been introduced a couple of years earlier. In the 1990s, the product line evolved from an operating environment into a fully complete, modern operating system over two lines of development, each with their own separate codebase.\\r\\nThe first versions of Windows (1.0 through to 3.11) were programs run from MS-DOS which then took over the screen and launched an application called Program Manager; later on, Windows 95, though still being based on MS-DOS, was its own operating system, using a 16-bit DOS-based kernel and a 32-bit user space. Windows 95 introduced many features that have been part of the product ever since, including the Start menu, the taskbar, and Windows Explorer (renamed File Explorer in Windows 8). In 1997, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 4 which included the (at the time) controversial Windows Desktop Update. It aimed to integrate Internet Explorer and the web into the user interface and also brought many new features into Windows, such as the ability to display JPEG images as the desktop wallpaper and single window navigation in Windows Explorer. In 1998, Microsoft released Windows 98, which also included the Windows Desktop Update and Internet Explorer 4 by default. The inclusion of Internet Explorer 4 and the Desktop Update led to an anti-trust case in the United States. Windows 98 also includes plug and play, which allows devices to work when plugged in without requiring a system reboot or manual configuration, and USB support out of the box. Windows ME, the last DOS-based version of Windows, was aimed at consumers and released in 2000. It introduced System Restore, Help and Support Center, updated versions of the Disk Defragmenter and other system tools.\\r\\nIn 1993, Microsoft released Windows NT 3.1, the first version of the newly-developed Windows NT operating system. Unlike the Windows 9x series of operating systems, it is a fully 32-bit operating system. NT 3.1 introduced NTFS, a file system designed to replace the older File Allocation Table (FAT) which was used by DOS and the DOS-based Windows operating systems. In 1996, Windows NT 4.0 was released, which includes a fully 32-bit version of Windows Explorer written specifically for it, making the operating system work just like Windows 95. Windows NT was originally designed to be used on high-end systems and servers, however with the release of Windows 2000, many consumer-oriented features from Windows 95 and Windows 98 were included, such as the Windows Desktop Update, Internet Explorer 5, USB support and Windows Media Player. These consumer-oriented features were continued and further extended in Windows XP, which introduced a new theme called Luna, a more user-friendly interface, updated versions of Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer, and extended features from Windows Me, such as the Help and Support Center and System Restore. Windows Vista focused on securing the Windows operating system against computer viruses and other malicious software by introducing features such as User Account Control. New features include Windows Aero, updated versions of the standard games (e.g. Solitaire), Windows Movie Maker, and Windows Mail to replace Outlook Express. Despite this, Windows Vista was critically panned for its poor performance on older hardware and its at-the-time high system requirements. Windows 7 followed two and a half years later, and despite technically having higher system requirements,[2][3] reviewers noted that it ran better than Windows Vista.[4] Windows 7 also removed many extra features, such as Windows Movie Maker, Windows Photo Gallery and Windows Mail, instead requiring users download a separate Windows Live Essentials to gain those features and other online services. Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, a free upgrade for Windows 8, introduced many controversial changes, such as the replacement of the Start menu with the Start Screen, the removal of the Aero glass interface in favor of a flat, colored interface as well as the introduction of \\"Metro\\" apps (later renamed Universal Windows Platform apps) and the Charms Bar user interface element, all of which received considerable criticism from reviewers.[5][6][7]\\r\\nThe current version of Windows, Windows 10, reintroduced the Start menu and added the ability to run Universal Windows Platform apps in a window instead of always in full screen. Windows 10 was well-received, with many reviewers stating that Windows 10 is what Windows 8 should have been.[8][9][10] Windows 10 also marks the last version of Windows to be traditionally released. Instead, \\"feature updates\\" are released twice a year with names such as \\"Anniversary Update\\" and \\"Fall Creators Update\\" that introduce new capabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first independent version of Microsoft Windows, version 1.0, released on November 20, 1985, achieved little popularity. The project was briefly codenamed \\"Interface Manager\\" before the windowing system was developed - contrary to popular belief that it was the original name for Windows and Rowland Hanson, the head of marketing at Microsoft, convinced the company that the name Windows would be more appealing to customers.[11]\\r\\nWindows 1.0 was not a complete operating system, but rather an \\"operating environment\\" that extended MS-DOS, and shared the latter's inherent flaws and problems.\\r\\nThe first version of Microsoft Windows included a simple graphics painting program called Windows Paint; Windows Write, a simple word processor; an appointment calendar; a card-filer; a notepad; a clock; a control panel; a computer terminal; Clipboard; and RAM driver. It also included the MS-DOS Executive and a game called Reversi.\\r\\nMicrosoft had worked with Apple Computer to develop applications for Apple's new Macintosh computer, which featured a graphical user interface. As part of the related business negotiations, Microsoft had licensed certain aspects of the Macintosh user interface from Apple; in later litigation, a district court summarized these aspects as \\"screen displays\\". In the development of Windows 1.0, Microsoft intentionally limited its borrowing of certain GUI elements from the Macintosh user interface, to comply with its license. For example, windows were only displayed \\"tiled\\" on the screen; that is, they could not overlap or overlie one another.\\r\\nMicrosoft Windows version 2 came out on December 9, 1987, and proved slightly more popular than its predecessor. Much of the popularity for Windows 2.0 came by way of its inclusion as a \\"run-time version\\" with Microsoft's new graphical applications, Excel and Word for Windows. They could be run from MS-DOS, executing Windows for the duration of their activity, and closing down Windows upon exit.\\r\\nMicrosoft Windows received a major boost around this time when Aldus PageMaker appeared in a Windows version, having previously run only on Macintosh. Some computer historians[who?] date this, the first appearance of a significant and non-Microsoft application for Windows, as the start of the success of Windows.\\r\\nVersions 2.0x used the real-mode memory model, which confined it to a maximum of 1 megabyte of memory. In such a configuration, it could run under another multitasker like DESQview, which used the 286 protected mode.\\r\\nLater, two new versions were released: Windows/286 2.1 and Windows/386 2.1. Like prior versions of Windows, Windows/286 2.1 used the real-mode memory model, but was the first version to support the High Memory Area. Windows/386 2.1 had a protected mode kernel with LIM-standard EMS emulation. All Windows and DOS-based applications at the time were real mode, running over the protected mode kernel by using the virtual 8086 mode, which was new with the 80386 processor.\\r\\nVersion 2.03, and later 3.0, faced challenges from Apple over its overlapping windows and other features Apple charged mimicked the ostensibly copyrighted \\"look and feel\\" of its operating system and \\"embodie[d] and generated a copy of the Macintosh\\" in its OS. Judge William Schwarzer dropped all but 10 of Apple's 189 claims of copyright infringement, and ruled that most of the remaining 10 were over uncopyrightable ideas.\\r\\nWindows 3.0, released in May 1990, improved capabilities given to native applications. It also allowed users to better multitask older MS-DOS based software compared to Windows/386, thanks to the introduction of virtual memory.\\r\\nWindows 3.0's user interface finally resembled a serious competitor to the user interface of the Macintosh computer. PCs had improved graphics by this time, due to VGA video cards, and the protected/enhanced mode allowed Windows applications to use more memory in a more painless manner than their DOS counterparts could. Windows 3.0 could run in real, standard, or 386 enhanced modes, and was compatible with any Intel processor from the 8086/8088 up to the 80286 and 80386. This was the first version to run Windows programs in protected mode, although the 386 enhanced mode kernel was an enhanced version of the protected mode kernel in Windows/386.\\r\\nWindows 3.0 received two updates. A few months after introduction, Windows 3.0a was released as a maintenance release, resolving bugs and improving stability. A \\"multimedia\\" version, Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions 1.0, was released in October 1991. This was bundled with \\"multimedia upgrade kits\\", comprising a CD-ROM drive and a sound card, such as the Creative Labs Sound Blaster Pro. This version was the precursor to the multimedia features available in Windows 3.1 (first released in April 1992) and later, and was part of Microsoft's specification for the Multimedia PC.\\r\\nThe features listed above and growing market support from application software developers made Windows 3.0 wildly successful, selling around 10 million copies in the two years before the release of version 3.1. Windows 3.0 became a major source of income for Microsoft, and led the company to revise some of its earlier plans. Support was discontinued on December 31, 2001.[12]\\r\\nDuring the mid to late 1980s, Microsoft and IBM had cooperatively been developing OS/2 as a successor to DOS. OS/2 would take full advantage of the aforementioned protected mode of the Intel 80286 processor and up to 16?MB of memory. OS/2 1.0, released in 1987, supported swapping and multitasking and allowed running of DOS executables.\\r\\nIBM licensed Windows's GUI for OS/2 as Presentation Manager, and the two companies stated that it and Windows 2.0 would be almost identical.[13] Presentation Manager was not available with OS/2 until version 1.1, released in 1988. Its API was incompatible with Windows. Version 1.2, released in 1989, introduced a new file system, HPFS, to replace the FAT file system.\\r\\nBy the early 1990s, conflicts developed in the Microsoft/IBM relationship. They cooperated with each other in developing their PC operating systems, and had access to each other's code. Microsoft wanted to further develop Windows, while IBM desired for future work to be based on OS/2. In an attempt to resolve this tension, IBM and Microsoft agreed that IBM would develop OS/2 2.0, to replace OS/2 1.3 and Windows 3.0, while Microsoft would develop a new operating system, OS/2 3.0, to later succeed OS/2 2.0.\\r\\nThis agreement soon fell apart however, and the Microsoft/IBM relationship was terminated. IBM continued to develop OS/2, while Microsoft changed the name of its (as yet unreleased) OS/2 3.0 to Windows NT. Both retained the rights to use OS/2 and Windows technology developed up to the termination of the agreement; Windows NT, however, was to be written anew, mostly independently (see below).\\r\\nAfter an interim 1.3 version to fix up many remaining problems with the 1.x series, IBM released OS/2 version 2.0 in 1992. This was a major improvement: it featured a new, object-oriented GUI, the Workplace Shell (WPS), that included a desktop and was considered by many to be OS/2's best feature. Microsoft would later imitate much of it in Windows 95. Version 2.0 also provided a full 32-bit API, offered smooth multitasking and could take advantage of the 4?gigabytes of address space provided by the Intel 80386. Still, much of the system had 16-bit code internally which required, among other things, device drivers to be 16-bit code also. This was one of the reasons for the chronic shortage of OS/2 drivers for the latest devices. Version 2.0 could also run DOS and Windows 3.0 programs, since IBM had retained the right to use the DOS and Windows code as a result of the breakup.\\r\\nIn response to the impending release of OS/2 2.0, Microsoft developed Windows 3.1 (first released in April 1992), which included several improvements to Windows 3.0, such as display of TrueType scalable fonts (developed jointly with Apple), improved disk performance in 386 Enhanced Mode, multimedia support, and bugfixes. It also removed Real Mode, and only ran on an 80286 or better processor. Later Microsoft also released Windows 3.11, a touch-up to Windows 3.1 which included all of the patches and updates that followed the release of Windows 3.1 in 1992.\\r\\nIn 1992 and 1993, Microsoft released Windows for Workgroups (WfW), which was available both as an add-on for existing Windows 3.1 installations and in a version that included the base Windows environment and the networking extensions all in one package. Windows for Workgroups included improved network drivers and protocol stacks, and support for peer-to-peer networking. There were two versions of Windows for Workgroups, WfW 3.1 and WfW 3.11. Unlike prior versions, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 ran in 386 Enhanced Mode only, and needed at least an 80386SX processor. One optional download for WfW was the \\"Wolverine\\" TCP/IP protocol stack, which allowed for easy access to the Internet through corporate networks.\\r\\nAll these versions continued version 3.0's impressive sales pace. Even though the 3.1x series still lacked most of the important features of OS/2, such as long file names, a desktop, or protection of the system against misbehaving applications, Microsoft quickly took over the OS and GUI markets for the IBM PC. The Windows API became the de facto standard for consumer software.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Microsoft continued to develop Windows NT. The main architect of the system was Dave Cutler, one of the chief architects of VMS at Digital Equipment Corporation (later acquired by Compaq, now part of Hewlett-Packard).[14] Microsoft hired him in October 1988 to create a successor to OS/2, but Cutler created a completely new system instead. Cutler had been developing a follow-on to VMS at DEC called Mica, and when DEC dropped the project he brought the expertise and around 20 engineers with him to Microsoft. DEC also believed he brought Mica's code to Microsoft and sued.[15] Microsoft eventually paid US$150 million and agreed to support DEC's Alpha CPU chip in NT.\\r\\nWindows NT Workstation (Microsoft marketing wanted Windows NT to appear to be a continuation of Windows 3.1) arrived in Beta form to developers at the July 1992 Professional Developers Conference in San Francisco.[16] Microsoft announced at the conference its intentions to develop a successor to both Windows NT and Windows 3.1's replacement (Windows 95, codenamed Chicago), which would unify the two into one operating system. This successor was codenamed Cairo. In hindsight, Cairo was a much more difficult project than Microsoft had anticipated and, as a result, NT and Chicago would not be unified until Windows XPalbeit Windows 2000, oriented to business, had already unified most of the systems bolts and gears, it was XP that was sold to home consumers like Windows 95 and came to be viewed as the final unified OS. Parts of Cairo have still not made it into Windows as of 2017 - most notably, the WinFS file system, which was the much touted Object File System of Cairo. Microsoft announced that they have discontinued the separate release of WinFS for Windows XP and Windows Vista[17] and will gradually incorporate the technologies developed for WinFS in other products and technologies, notably Microsoft SQL Server.\\r\\nDriver support was lacking due to the increased programming difficulty in dealing with NT's superior hardware abstraction model. This problem plagued the NT line all the way through Windows 2000. Programmers complained that it was too hard to write drivers for NT, and hardware developers were not going to go through the trouble of developing drivers for a small segment of the market. Additionally, although allowing for good performance and fuller exploitation of system resources, it was also resource-intensive on limited hardware, and thus was only suitable for larger, more expensive machines.\\r\\nHowever, these same features made Windows NT perfect for the LAN server market (which in 1993 was experiencing a rapid boom, as office networking was becoming common). NT also had advanced network connectivity options and NTFS, an efficient file system. Windows NT version 3.51 was Microsoft's entry into this field, and took away market share from Novell (the dominant player) in the following years.\\r\\nOne of Microsoft's biggest advances initially developed for Windows NT was a new 32-bit API, to replace the legacy 16-bit Windows API. This API was called Win32, and from then on Microsoft referred to the older 16-bit API as Win16. The Win32 API had three levels implementations: the complete one for Windows NT, a subset for Chicago (originally called Win32c) missing features primarily of interest to enterprise customers (at the time) such as security and Unicode support, and a more limited subset called Win32s which could be used on Windows 3.1 systems. Thus Microsoft sought to ensure some degree of compatibility between the Chicago design and Windows NT, even though the two systems had radically different internal architectures. Windows NT was the first Windows operating system based on a hybrid kernel.\\r\\nAs released, Windows NT 3.x went through three versions (3.1, 3.5, and 3.51); changes were primarily internal and reflected back end changes. The 3.5 release added support for new types of hardware and improved performance and data reliability; the 3.51 release was primarily to update the Win32 APIs to be compatible with software being written for the Win32c APIs in what became Windows 95.\\r\\nAfter Windows 3.11, Microsoft began to develop a new consumer oriented version of the operating system codenamed Chicago. Chicago was designed to have support for 32-bit preemptive multitasking like OS/2 and Windows NT, although a 16-bit kernel would remain for the sake of backward compatibility. The Win32 API first introduced with Windows NT was adopted as the standard 32-bit programming interface, with Win16 compatibility being preserved through a technique known as \\"thunking\\". A new object oriented GUI was not originally planned as part of the release, although elements of the Cairo user interface were borrowed and added as other aspects of the release (notably Plug and Play) slipped.\\r\\nMicrosoft did not change all of the Windows code to 32-bit; parts of it remained 16-bit (albeit not directly using real mode) for reasons of compatibility, performance, and development time. Additionally it was necessary to carry over design decisions from earlier versions of Windows for reasons of backwards compatibility, even if these design decisions no longer matched a more modern computing environment. These factors eventually began to impact the operating system's efficiency and stability.\\r\\nMicrosoft marketing adopted Windows 95 as the product name for Chicago when it was released on August 24, 1995. Microsoft had a double gain from its release: first, it made it impossible for consumers to run Windows 95 on a cheaper, non-Microsoft DOS; secondly, although traces of DOS were never completely removed from the system and MS DOS 7 would be loaded briefly as a part of the booting process, Windows 95 applications ran solely in 386 enhanced mode, with a flat 32-bit address space and virtual memory. These features make it possible for Win32 applications to address up to 2 gigabytes of virtual RAM (with another 2?GB reserved for the operating system), and in theory prevented them from inadvertently corrupting the memory space of other Win32 applications. In this respect the functionality of Windows 95 moved closer to Windows NT, although Windows 95/98/ME did not support more than 512 megabytes of physical RAM without obscure system tweaks.\\r\\nIBM continued to market OS/2, producing later versions in OS/2 3.0 and 4.0 (also called Warp). Responding to complaints about OS/2 2.0's high demands on computer hardware, version 3.0 was significantly optimized both for speed and size. Before Windows 95 was released, OS/2 Warp 3.0 was even shipped preinstalled with several large German hardware vendor chains. However, with the release of Windows 95, OS/2 began to lose market share.\\r\\nIt is probably impossible to choose one specific reason why OS/2 failed to gain much market share. While OS/2 continued to run Windows 3.1 applications, it lacked support for anything but the Win32s subset of Win32 API (see above). Unlike with Windows 3.1, IBM did not have access to the source code for Windows 95 and was unwilling to commit the time and resources to emulate the moving target of the Win32 API. IBM later introduced OS/2 into the United States v. Microsoft case, blaming unfair marketing tactics on Microsoft's part.\\r\\nMicrosoft went on to release five different versions of Windows 95:\\r\\nOSR2, OSR2.1, and OSR2.5 were not released to the general public; rather, they were available only to OEMs that would preload the OS onto computers. Some companies sold new hard drives with OSR2 preinstalled (officially justifying this as needed due to the hard drive's capacity).\\r\\nThe first Microsoft Plus! add-on pack was sold for Windows 95.\\r\\nWindows NT 4.0 was the successor of 3.51 (1995) and 3.5 (1994). Microsoft released Windows NT 4.0 to manufacturing in July 1996, one year after the release of Windows 95. Major new features included the new Explorer shell from Windows 95, scalability and feature improvements to the core architecture, kernel, USER32, COM and MSRPC.[18]\\r\\nWindows NT 4.0 came in four versions:\\r\\nOn June 25, 1998, Microsoft released Windows 98 (codenamed Memphis). It included new hardware drivers and the FAT32 file system which supports disk partitions that are larger than 2?GB (first introduced in Windows 95 OSR2). USB support in Windows 98 is marketed as a vast improvement over Windows 95. The release continued the controversial inclusion of the Internet Explorer browser with the operating system that started with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 1. The action eventually led to the filing of the United States v. Microsoft case, dealing with the question of whether Microsoft was introducing unfair practices into the market in an effort to eliminate competition from other companies such as Netscape.[19]\\r\\nIn 1999, Microsoft released Windows 98?Second Edition, an interim release. One of the more notable new features was the addition of Internet Connection Sharing, a form of network address translation, allowing several machines on a LAN (Local Area Network) to share a single Internet connection. Hardware support through device drivers was increased and this version shipped with Internet Explorer 5. Many minor problems that existed in the first edition were fixed making it, according to many, the most stable release of the Windows 9x family.[citation needed]\\r\\nMicrosoft released Windows 2000 on February 17, 2000. It has the version number Windows NT 5.0. Windows 2000 has had four official service packs. It was successfully deployed both on the server and the workstation markets. Amongst Windows 2000's most significant new features was Active Directory, a near-complete replacement of the NT 4.0 Windows Server domain model, which built on industry-standard technologies like DNS, LDAP, and Kerberos to connect machines to one another. Terminal Services, previously only available as a separate edition of NT 4, was expanded to all server versions. A number of features from Windows 98 were incorporated also, such as an improved Device Manager, Windows Media Player, and a revised DirectX that made it possible for the first time for many modern games to work on the NT kernel. Windows 2000 is also the last NT-kernel Windows operating system to lack product activation.\\r\\nWhile Windows 2000 upgrades were available for Windows 95 and Windows 98, it was not intended for home users.[20]\\r\\nWindows 2000 was available in four editions:\\r\\nIn September 2000, Microsoft released a successor to Windows 98 called Windows ME, short for \\"Millennium Edition\\". It was the last DOS-based operating system from Microsoft. Windows ME introduced a new multimedia-editing application called Windows Movie Maker, came standard with Internet Explorer 5.5 and Windows Media Player 7, and debuted the first version of System Restore √ø a recovery utility that enables the operating system to revert system files back to a prior date and time. System Restore was a notable feature that would continue to thrive in later versions of Windows, including XP, Vista, and Windows 7.\\r\\nWindows ME was conceived as a quick one-year project that served as a stopgap release between Windows 98 and Windows XP. Many of the new features were available from the Windows Update site as updates for older Windows versions (System Restore and Windows Movie Maker were exceptions). Windows ME was criticized for stability issues, as well as for lacking real mode DOS support, to the point of being referred to as the \\"Mistake Edition\\"[21] or \\"Many Errors.\\" Windows ME was the last operating system to be based on the Windows 9x (monolithic) kernel and MS-DOS.\\r\\nOn October 25, 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP (codenamed \\"Whistler\\"). The merging of the Windows NT/2000 and Windows 95/98/Me lines was finally achieved with Windows XP. Windows XP uses the Windows NT 5.1 kernel, marking the entrance of the Windows NT core to the consumer market, to replace the aging 16/32-bit branch. The initial release met with considerable criticism, particularly in the area of security, leading to the release of three major Service Packs. Windows XP SP1 was released in September 2002, SP2 came out in August 2004 and SP3 came out in April 2008. Service Pack 2 provided significant improvements and encouraged widespread adoption of XP among both home and business users. Windows XP lasted longer as Microsoft's flagship operating system than any other version of Windows, from October 25, 2001 to January 30, 2007 when it was succeeded by Windows Vista.\\r\\nWindows XP is available in a number of versions:\\r\\nOn April 25, 2003 Microsoft launched Windows Server 2003, a notable update to Windows 2000 Server encompassing many new security features, a new \\"Manage Your Server\\" wizard that simplifies configuring a machine for specific roles, and improved performance. It has the version number NT 5.2. A few services not essential for server environments are disabled by default for stability reasons, most noticeable are the \\"Windows Audio\\" and \\"Themes\\" services; users have to enable them manually to get sound or the \\"Luna\\" look as per Windows XP. The hardware acceleration for display is also turned off by default, users have to turn the acceleration level up themselves if they trust the display card driver.\\r\\nDecember 2005, Microsoft released Windows Server 2003 R2, which is actually Windows Server 2003 with SP1 (Service Pack 1) plus an add-on package. Among the new features are a number of management features for branch offices, file serving, printing and company-wide identity integration.\\r\\nWindows Server 2003 is available in six editions:\\r\\nWindows Server 2003 R2, an update of Windows Server 2003, was released to manufacturing on December 6, 2005. It is distributed on two CDs, with one CD being the Windows Server 2003 SP1 CD. The other CD adds many optionally installable features for Windows Server 2003. The R2 update was released for all x86 and x64 versions, except Windows Server 2003 R2 Enterprise Edition, which was not released for Itanium.\\r\\nOn April 25, 2005, Microsoft released Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Windows Server 2003, x64 Editions in Standard, Enterprise and Datacenter SKUs. Windows XP Professional x64 Edition is an edition of Windows XP for x86-64 personal computers. It is designed to use the expanded 64-bit memory address space provided by the x86-64 architecture.[22]\\r\\nWindows XP Professional x64 Edition is based on the Windows Server 2003 codebase; with the server features removed and client features added. Both Windows Server 2003 x64 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition use identical kernels.[23]\\r\\nWindows XP Professional x64 Edition is not to be confused with Windows XP 64-bit Edition, as the latter was designed for Intel Itanium processors.[24][25] During the initial development phases, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition was named Windows XP 64-Bit Edition for 64-Bit Extended Systems.[26]\\r\\nIn July 2005, Microsoft released a thin-client version of Windows XP Service Pack 2, called Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs (WinFLP). It is only available to Software Assurance customers. The aim of WinFLP is to give companies a viable upgrade option for older PCs that are running Windows 95, 98, and ME that will be supported with patches and updates for the next several years. Most user applications will typically be run on a remote machine using Terminal Services or Citrix.\\r\\nWindows Home Server (codenamed Q, Quattro) is a server product based on Windows Server 2003, designed for consumer use. The system was announced on January 7, 2007 by Russel Adolfo. Windows Home Server can be configured and monitored using a console program that can be installed on a client PC. Such features as Media Sharing, local and remote drive backup and file duplication are all listed as features. The release of Windows Home Server Power Pack 3 added support for Windows 7 to Windows Home Server.\\r\\nWindows Vista was released on November 30, 2006 to business customers - consumer versions followed on January 30, 2007. Windows Vista intended to have enhanced security by introducing a new restricted user mode called User Account Control, replacing the \\"administrator-by-default\\" philosophy of Windows XP. Vista was the target of much criticism and negative press, and in general was not well regarded; this was seen as leading to the relatively swift release of Windows 7.\\r\\nOne major difference between Vista and earlier versions of Windows, Windows 95 and later, is that the original start button was replaced with the Windows icon in a circle (called the Start Orb). Vista also features new graphics features, the Windows Aero GUI, new applications (such as Windows Calendar, Windows DVD Maker and some new games including Chess, Mahjong, and Purble Place),[27] Internet Explorer 7, Windows Media Player 11, and a large number of underlying architectural changes. Windows Vista has the version number NT 6.0. Since its release, Windows Vista has had two service packs.\\r\\nWindows Vista ships in six editions:[28]\\r\\nAll editions (except Starter edition) are currently available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. The biggest advantage of the 64-bit version is breaking the 4?gigabyte memory barrier, which 32-bit computers cannot fully access.\\r\\nWindows Server 2008, released on February 27, 2008, was originally known as Windows Server Codename \\"Longhorn\\". Windows Server 2008 builds on the technological and security advances first introduced with Windows Vista, and is significantly more modular than its predecessor, Windows Server 2003.\\r\\nWindows Server 2008 ships in ten editions:\\r\\nWindows 7 was released to manufacturing on July 22, 2009, and reached general retail availability on October 22, 2009.[29][30] It was previously known by the codenames Blackcomb and Vienna. Windows 7 has the version number NT 6.1. Since its release, Windows 7 has had one service pack.\\r\\nSome features of Windows 7 are faster booting, Device Stage, Windows PowerShell, less obtrusive User Account Control, multi-touch, and improved window management.[31] Features included with Windows Vista and not in Windows 7 include the sidebar (although gadgets remain) and several programs that were removed in favor of downloading their Windows Live counterparts.\\r\\nWindows 7 ships in six editions:[32]\\r\\nIn some countries (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland)[citation needed], there are other editions that lack some features such as Windows Media Player, Windows Media Center and Internet Explorer - these editions were called names such as \\"Windows 7 N.\\" Microsoft focuses on selling Windows 7 Home Premium and Professional. All editions, except the Starter edition, are available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Unlike the corresponding Vista editions, the Professional and Enterprise editions are supersets of the Home Premium edition.\\r\\nAt the Professional Developers Conference (PDC) 2008, Microsoft also announced Windows Server 2008 R2, as the server variant of Windows 7. Windows Server 2008 R2 ships in 64-bit versions (x64 and Itanium) only.\\r\\nIn 2010, Microsoft released Windows Thin PC or WinTPC, which is a feature- and size-reduced locked-down version of Windows 7 expressly designed to turn older PCs into thin clients. WinTPC is available for software assurance customers and relies on cloud computing in a business network. Wireless operation is supported since WinTPC has full wireless stack integration, but wireless operation may not be as good as the operation on a wired connection.[33][34]\\r\\nWindows Home Server 2011 code named 'Vail'[35] was released on April 6, 2011.[36] Windows Home Server 2011 is built on the Windows Server 2008 R2 code base and removed the Drive Extender drive pooling technology in the original Windows Home Server release.[37] Windows Home Server 2011 is considered a \\"major release\\".[35] Its predecessor was built on Windows Server 2003. WHS 2011 only supports x86-64 hardware.\\r\\nMicrosoft decided to discontinue Windows Home Server 2011 on July 5, 2012 while including its features into Windows Server 2012 Essentials.[38] Windows Home Server 2011 was supported until April 12, 2016.[39]\\r\\nOn October 26, 2012, Microsoft released Windows 8 to the public. One edition, Windows RT, runs on some system-on-a-chip devices with mobile 32-bit ARM (ARMv7) processors. Windows 8 features a redesigned user interface, designed to make it easier for touchscreen users to use Windows. The interface introduced an updated Start menu known as the Start screen, and a new full-screen application platform. The desktop interface is also present for running windowed applications, although Windows RT will not run any desktop applications not included in the system. On the Building Windows 8 blog, it was announced that a computer running Windows 8 can boot up much faster than Windows 7.[40] New features also include USB 3.0 support, the Windows Store, the ability to run from USB drives with Windows To Go, and others. Windows 8 was given the kernel number NT 6.2, with its successor 8.1 receiving the kernel number 6.3. So far, neither has had any service packs yet, although many consider Windows 8.1 to be a service pack for Windows 8.\\r\\nWindows 8 is available in the following editions:\\r\\nThe first public preview of Windows Server 2012 and was also shown by Microsoft at the 2011 Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference.[41]\\r\\nWindows 8 Release Preview and Windows Server 2012 Release Candidate were both released on May 31, 2012.[42] Product development on Windows 8 was completed on August 1, 2012, and it was released to manufacturing the same day.[43] Windows Server 2012 went on sale to the public on September 4, 2012. Windows 8 went on sale October 26, 2012.\\r\\nWindows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 were released on October 17, 2013. Windows 8.1 is available as an update in the Windows store for Windows 8 users only and also available to download for clean installation.[44] The update adds new options for resizing the live tiles on the Start screen.[45]\\r\\nWindows 10, codenamed Threshold, is the current release of the Microsoft Windows operating system. Unveiled on September 30, 2014, it was released on July 29, 2015.[46] It was distributed without charge to Windows 7 and 8.1 users for one year after release. A number of new features like Cortana, the Microsoft Edge web browser, the ability to view Windows Store apps as a window instead of fullscreen, virtual desktops, revamped core apps, Continuum, and a unified Settings app were all features debuted in Windows 10. Microsoft has announced that Windows 10 will be the last major version of its series of operating systems to be released. Instead, Microsoft will release major updates to the operating system via download or in Windows Update, similar to the way updates are delivered in macOS.[47]\\r\\nSo far, four major versions of Windows 10 have been released, with the Fall Creators Update being released on October 17, 2017:\\r\\nWindows Server 2016 is a release of the Microsoft Windows Server operating system that was unveiled on September 30, 2014. Windows Server 2016 was officially released at Microsoft's Ignite Conference, September 26√ø30, 2016.[54]","input":"When was the first version of microsoft windows released?"},{"output":"the portion of a bay called Egg Harbor (known today as Little Egg Harbor) by the Dutch sailors because of the eggs found in nearby gull nests","context":"Little Egg Harbor Township is a township in Ocean County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the township's population was 20,065,[10][11][12] reflecting an increase of 4,120 (+25.8%) from the 15,945 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 2,612 (+19.6%) from the 13,333 counted in the 1990 Census.[20] The 2010 population was the highest recorded in any decennial census.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally part of Burlington County, Little Egg Harbor took its name from the portion of a bay called Egg Harbor (known today as Little Egg Harbor) by the Dutch sailors because of the eggs found in nearby gull nests. The first known account of the town was made by Captain Cornelius Jacobsen May in 1614.[21][22]\\r\\nThe first European to settle the township was Hendrick Jacobs Falkenberg, who likely arrived by 1693 when he does not appear on a census of the Swedes along the Delaware River, where he had lived for nearly three decades.[23] Though he was from Holstein (now in Germany), his first wife was a Finn and part of the Swedish community. Falkenberg settled on an 800-acre tract of land that he had acquired from the Lenni Lenape Native Americans in 1674, and a 1697 deed re-confirmed this earlier purchase. This tract included the two islands of Monhunk and Minnicunk later known as Osborn Island and Wills Island.[24] Falkenberg was a linguist, fluent in the Lenape language, and was considered southern New Jersey's foremost language interpreter involving land transactions between the Indians and the European settlers, particularly the English Quakers.[25]\\r\\nThe Little Egg Harbor Massacre took place in October 1778 during the American Revolutionary War, as British Army Major Patrick Ferguson was wreaking havoc on Colonial shipping in the Mullica River. Kazimierz Pu?aski and his newly raised forces were ordered to oppose his actions. Pulaski's Legion, along with three companies of light infantry, three troops of light horse, and one artillery detachment, came too late to be of great use against Ferguson's operations. But their arrival did stop Ferguson from raiding the iron works at Batsto, and stemmed their attacks on privateers at The Forks of the Mullica River.\\r\\nThey then set up camp on a farm. A deserter, Lt. Gustav Juliet, found Ferguson and told him of Pulaski's encampment; he mentioned that morale was fairly low, and security almost nonexistent, so that a surprise attack would be devastating. Ferguson promptly loaded 250 of his best men onto boats and rowed them, in the dark, some 10 miles (16?km) to Osborne Island. He then marched them a further 2 miles (3.2?km) to the site of the infantry outpost, which comprised 50 men a short distance from the main encampment. At first light, Ferguson ordered the attack; only five of his quarry were taken alive. Pulaski eventually led his mounted troops up, causing Ferguson to retreat to his boats minus a few men that had fallen into the colonists' hands. A memorial on Radio Road commemorates the attack.[26]\\r\\nLittle Egg Harbor Township was formed on February 13, 1740, as Egg Harbour Township from portions of Northampton Township (now Mount Holly Township), while the area was still part of Burlington County. It was incorporated as one of New Jersey's 104 in the Township Act of 1798 by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. While in Burlington County, portions of the township were taken to form Washington Township (November 19, 1802) and Bass River Township (March 30, 1864). Little Egg Harbor Township became part of Ocean County on March 30, 1891, after which further portions of the township were ceded to create Long Beach Township (March 23, 1899) and Tuckerton (February 18, 1901).[27]\\r\\nThe Tuckerton Wireless Tower (393331N 742214W? / ?39.5585N 74.3706W? / 39.5585; -74.3706), at 825 feet (251?m) in height, was built in 1912[28][29] by the German \\"Hochfrequenzmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft Fr Drahtlose Telegraphie\\" company (The High Frequency Machine Corporation for Wireless Telegraphy, often referred to as HOMAG) when the present-day Mystic Island was called Hickory Island. The tower was used to communicate with an identical radio telegraph station in Eilvese, Germany starting on Jun 19, 1914, less than two weeks before the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand. The station continued to communicate with Eilvese [30] until America entered World War I on April 6, 1917.[31] It is rumored that it was used to send the message to order the attack by a German U-boat on the RMS Lusitania. After President Wilson's Declaration of Neutrality, the President's Executive Order 2042[32] required the US Navy to take over the station on September 9, 1914, to assure the neutrality of messages sent to and from the station.[33] However, the station continued to be operated by German nationals employed by HOMAG and continued to communicate only with the Eilvese radio station.[34]\\r\\nWhen America entered the war, all U.S. radio stations were seized and shut down by Executive Order 2605A on April 30, 1917.[35] The remaining German personnel at Tuckerton immediately became war prisoners and were replaced by U.S. Navy personnel. The Navy used the Tuckerton Radio Station for transatlantic communications while the naval radio stations in New Brunswick, New Jersey and Sayville, New York were undergoing major transmitter and antenna upgrades. Tuckerton was used for fleet broadcasts after installations of 200 kilowatt transmitters at New Brunswick and Sayville were completed in June 1918.\\r\\nAfter the war, the Tuckerton Wireless Station was included in German war reparations paid to America. Shortly afterwards, it was sold to RCA which operated it until 1948 as a backup to their famous Radio Central facility in Rocky Point, New York.[31] In 1921, RCA installed two massive Alexanderson alternators, which were removed in 1948. For transatlantic communications, the radio station operated under the call signs WCI and WGG. For coastal communications, after World War I, the station operated under the callsign WSC. The 820-foot (250?m) steel tower, anchored by three large concrete blocks, was taken down on December 27, 1955.[36] The three huge anchor blocks still exist today, in a backyard on North Ensign Drive and in the middle of South Ensign Drive and Staysail Drive. Many smaller anchor blocks providing foundations for smaller towers that supported the umbrella antenna are still visible in the lagoons. Remains of the large tower can be seen in scraps at the Giffordtown Museum.[37]\\r\\nWhile the township was formed in the 1700s, Little Egg Harbor remained predominantly rural and undeveloped well into the late 20th century. It wasn't until the late 1950s until any major development was started. During this time, the construction of manufactured waterfront bungalows on lagoons were built and marketed as vacation properties, most notably Mystic Islands, Holly Lake Harbor, as well as Atlantis; the latter of which a \\"research home\\" was constructed to test hundreds of components and finishing materials for possible inclusion in model homes.[38] Most of the population were seasonal residents from either New York, Philadelphia, or other parts of New Jersey. Several developments were constructed in the decades following around the Mystic Islands area, mostly consisting of townhomes, duplex, and small single-family homes meant to act as either vacation homes or year-round residence.\\r\\nIn 1979, Pinelands Regional High School opened in the growing township, serving students from Little Egg Harbor, Tuckerton, Bass River, and Eagleswood; those students formerly went to Southern Regional High School in Manahawkin.[39]\\r\\nIt wasn't until the 2000s when the population of the township boomed. The town was one of the fastest-growing in Ocean County, next to Barnegat.[40] The formerly sparsely-developed Radio Road, Mathistown Road, and Center Street were the sites of several new housing developments, shopping centers, and offices. While 75% of the growth came from new retirement communities, the former resort town dubbed \\"Little Treasure on the Bay\\" saw an influx of year-round residents and families, having become more of a suburb.[41]\\r\\nLittle Egg Harbor Township made national headlines after the November 3, 2004, Little Egg Harbor Intermediate School Bombing when a fighter jet on a training mission from the 113th Wing of the District of Columbia Air National Guard, based at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, shot seven bullets into the Intermediate School's roof, and many others into the parking lot. Only a few custodians were in the school, and nobody was injured. The plane had been on a training mission at the Warren Grove Gunnery Range, a 2,400-acre (10?km2) area about 3.5 miles (5.6?km) from the school. The school was repaired during the New Jersey Teachers' Convention, using $519,000 paid by the Air Force to the school district.[42]\\r\\nOn the morning of August 28, 2011, Tropical Storm Irene made its second U.S. landfall in Brigantine, though initial reports placed it at the Little Egg Inlet on the border with Galloway Township. At the time it was believed to be the first hurricane to make landfall in New Jersey since 1903,[43] but later analysis by the National Hurricane Center determined that the storm had weakened to tropical storm status by the time it made its second landfall.[44] On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused widespread damage and flooding to the township, damaging roughly 4,000 homes, especially in the Mystic Island section.[45] On the one-year anniversary of the storm, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie visited the township's Community Center to celebrate both the reopening of the storm-damaged building as well as the recovery efforts from the storm.[46]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 73.053 square miles (189.206?km2), including 47.368 square miles (122.682?km2) of land and 25.685 square miles (66.524?km2) of water (35.16%).[1][2]\\r\\nMystic Island (2010 Census population of 8,493[47]) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located in the southern part of the township.[48][49][50]\\r\\nOther unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Atlantis, Edge Cove, Giffordtown, Jessies Point, Nugentown, Parkertown, Storm Island, Tucker Beach and West Tuckerton.[51]\\r\\nThe township borders the Ocean County municipalities of Barnegat Township, Beach Haven, Eagleswood Township, Long Beach Township and Stafford Township; Galloway Township in Atlantic County; and both Bass River Township and Woodland Township in Burlington County.[52] Little Egg Harbor completely surrounds the independent municipality of Tuckerton, which became independent when it was incorporated in 1901.[27] Little Egg Harbor and Tuckerton share the same ZIP code.\\r\\nAs of the 2010 United States Census, there were 20,065 people, 8,060 households, and 5,674 families residing in the township. The population density was 423.6 per square mile (163.6/km2). There were 10,324 housing units at an average density of 218.0 per square mile (84.2/km2). The racial makeup of the township was 94.19% (18,899) White, 1.35% (271) Black or African American, 0.16% (33) Native American, 1.24% (249) Asian, 0.01% (2) Pacific Islander, 1.51% (303) from other races, and 1.54% (308) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.22% (1,047) of the population.[10]\\r\\nThere were 8,060 households out of which 25.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 55.5% were married couples living together, 10.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.6% were non-families. 24.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.46 and the average family size was 2.90.[10]\\r\\nIn the township, the population was spread out with 20.4% under the age of 18, 6.7% from 18 to 24, 22.3% from 25 to 44, 29.0% from 45 to 64, and 21.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 45.4 years. For every 100 females there were 92.3 males. For every 100 females ages 18 and older there were 89.8 males.[10]\\r\\nThe Census Bureau's 2006-2010 American Community Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median household income was $59,365 (with a margin of error of +/- $3,765) and the median family income was $66,345 (+/- $4,466).

The life cycles of Plasmodium species involve development in a blood-feeding insect host which then injects parasites into a vertebrate host during a blood meal. Parasites grow within a vertebrate body tissue (often the liver) before entering the bloodstream to infect red blood cells. The ensuing destruction of host red blood cells can result in disease, called malaria. During this infection, some parasites are picked up by a blood-feeding insect, continuing the life cycle.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlasmodium is a member of the phylum Apicomplexa, a large group of parasitic eukaryotes. Within Apicomplexa, Plasmodium is in the order Haemosporida and family Plasmodiidae. Over 200 species of Plasmodium have been described, many of which have been subdivided into 14 subgenera based on parasite morphology and host range. Evolutionary relationships among different Plasmodium species do not always follow taxonomic boundaries; some species that are morphologically similar or infect the same host turn out to be distantly related.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecies of Plasmodium are distributed globally wherever suitable hosts are found. Insect hosts are most frequently mosquitoes of the genera Culex and Anopheles. Vertebrate hosts include reptiles, birds, and mammals. Plasmodium parasites were first identified in the late 19th century by Charles Laveran. Over the course of the 20th century, many other species were discovered in various hosts and classified, including five species that regularly infect humans: P. vivax, P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. knowlesi. P. falciparum is by far the most lethal in humans, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths per year. A number of drugs have been developed to treat Plasmodium infection; however, the parasites have evolved resistance to each drug developed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genus Plasmodium consists of all eukaryotes in the phylum Apicomplexa that both undergo the asexual replication process of merogony inside host red blood cells and produce the crystalline pigment hemozoin as a byproduct of digesting host hemoglobin.[2] Plasmodium species contain many features that are common to other eukaryotes, and some that are unique to their phylum or genus. The Plasmodium genome is separated into 14 chromosomes contained in the nucleus. Plasmodium parasites maintain a single copy of their genome through much of the life cycle, doubling the genome only for a brief sexual exchange within the midgut of the insect host.[3] Attached to the nucleus is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which functions similarly to the ER in other eukaryotes. Proteins are trafficked from the ER to the Golgi apparatus which generally consists of a single membrane-bound compartment in Apicomplexans.[4] From here proteins are trafficked to various cellular compartments or to the cell surface.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike other apicomplexans, Plasmodium species have several cellular structures at the apical end of the parasite that serve as specialized organelles for secreting effectors into the host. The most prominent are the bulbous rhoptries which contain parasite proteins involved in invading the host cell and modifying the host once inside.[5] Adjacent to the rhoptries are smaller structures termed micronemes that contain parasite proteins required for motility as well as recognizing and attaching to host cells.[6] Spread throughout the parasite are secretory vesicles called dense granules that contain parasite proteins involved in modifying the membrane that separates the parasite from the host, termed the parasitophorous vacuole.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecies of Plasmodium also contain two large membrane-bound organelles of endosymbiotic origin, the mitochondrion and the apicoplast, both of which play key roles in the parasite's metabolism. Unlike mammalian cells which contain many mitochondria, Plasmodium cells contain a single large mitochondrion that coordinates its division with that of the Plasmodium cell.[7] Like in other eukaryotes, the Plasmodium mitochondrion is capable of generating energy in the form of ATP via the citric acid cycle; however, this function is only required for parasite survival in the insect host, and is not needed for growth in red blood cells.[7] A second organelle, the apicoplast, is derived from a secondary endosymbiosis event, in this case the acquisition of a red algae by the Plasmodium ancestor.[8] The apicoplast is involved in the synthesis of various metabolic precursors, including fatty acids, isoprenoids, iron-sulphur clusters, and components of the heme biosynthesis pathway.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe life cycle of Plasmodium involves several distinct stages in the insect and vertebrate hosts. Parasites are generally introduced into a vertebrate host by the bite of an insect host (generally a mosquito, with the exception of some Plasmodium species of reptiles).[10] Parasites first infect the liver or other tissue, where they undergo a single large round of replication before exiting the host cell to infect erythrocytes.[11] At this point, some species of Plasmodium of primates can form a long-lived dormant stage called a hypnozoite.[12] It can remain in the liver for more than a year.[13] However, for most Plasmodium species, the parasites in infected liver cells are only what are called merozoites. After emerging from the liver, they enter red blood cells, as explained above. They then go through continuous cycles of erythrocyte infection, while a small percentage of parasites differentiate into a sexual stage called a gametocyte which is picked up by an insect host taking a blood meal. In some hosts, invasion of erythrocytes by Plasmodium species can result in disease, called malaria. This can sometimes be severe, rapidly followed by death of the host (e.g. P. falciparum in humans). In other hosts, Plasmodium infection can apparently be asymptomatic.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the red blood cells, the merozoites grow first to a ring-shaped form and then to a larger form called a trophozoite. Trophozoites then mature to schizonts which divide several times to produce new merozoites. The infected red blood cell eventually bursts, allowing the new merozoites to travel within the bloodstream to infect new red blood cells. Most merozoites continue this replicative cycle, however some merozoites upon infecting red blood cells differentiate into male or female sexual forms called gametocytes. These gametocytes circulate in the blood until they are taken up when a mosquito feeds on the infected vertebrate host, taking up blood which includes the gametocytes.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mosquito, the gametocytes move along with the blood meal to the mosquito's midgut. Here the gametocytes develop into male and female gametes which fertilize each other, forming a zygote. Zygotes then develop into a motile form called an ookinete, which penetrates the wall of the midgut. Upon traversing the midgut wall, the ookinete embeds into the gut's exterior membrane and develops into an oocyst. Oocysts divide many times to produce large numbers of small elongated sporozoites. These sporozoites migrate to the salivary glands of the mosquito where they can be injected into the blood of the next host the mosquito bites, repeating the cycle.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlasmodium belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa, a taxonomic group of single-celled parasites with characteristic secretory organelles at one end of the cell.[14] Within Apicomplexa, Plasmodium is within the order Haemosporida, a group that includes all apicomplexans that live within blood cells.[15] Based on the presence of the pigment hemozoin and the method of asexual reproduction, the order is further split into four families, of which Plasmodium is in the family Plasmodiidae.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genus Plasmodium consists of over 200 species, generally described on the basis of their appearance in blood smears of infected vertebrates.[17] These speces have been categorized on the basis of their morphology and host range into 14 subgenera:[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecies infecting monkeys and apes (the higher primates) with the exceptions of P. falciparum and P. reichenowi (which together make up the subgenus Laverania) are classified in the subgenus Plasmodium. Parasites infecting other mammals including lower primates (lemurs and others) are classified in the subgenus Vinckeia. The five subgenera Bennettinia, Giovannolaia, Haemamoeba, Huffia, and Novyella contain the known avian malarial species.[18] The remaining subgenera: Asiamoeba, Carinamoeba, Lacertamoeba, Ophidiella, Paraplasmodium, and Sauramoeba contain the diverse groups of parasites found to infect reptiles.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recent studies of Plasmodium species using molecular methods have implied that the group's evolution has not perfectly followed taxonomy.[2] Many Plasmodium species that are morphologically similar or infect the same hosts turn out to be only distantly related.[20] In the 1990s, several studies sought to evaluate evolutionary relationships of Plasmodium species by comparing ribosomal RNA and a surface protein gene from various species, finding the human parasite P. falciparum to be more closely related to avian parasites than to other parasites of primates.[16] However, later studies sampling more Plasmodium species found the parasites of mammals to form a clade along with the genus Hepatocystis, while the parasites of birds or lizards appear to form a separate clade with evolutionary relationships not following the subgenera:[16][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeucocytozoon\\r\\n\\r\\nHaemoproteus\\r\\n\\r\\nPlasmodium of lizards and birds\\r\\n\\r\\nSubgenus Laverania\\r\\n\\r\\nSubgenus Plasmodium\\r\\n\\r\\nSubgenus Vinckeia\\r\\n\\r\\nHepatocystis (parasites of bats)\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimates for when different Plasmodium lineages diverged have differed broadly. Estimates for the diversification of the order Haemosporida range from around 16.2 million to 100 million years ago.[16] There has been particular interest in dating the divergence of the human parasite P. falciparum from other Plasmodium lineages due to its medical importance. For this, estimated dates range from 110,000 to 2.5 million years ago.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Plasmodium species are parasitic and must pass between a vertebrate host and an insect host to complete their life cycles. Different species of Plasmodium display different host ranges, with some species restricted to a single vertebrate and insect host, while other species can infect several species of vertebrates and/or insects.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlasmodium parasites have been described in a broad array of vertebrate hosts including reptiles, birds, and mammals.[22] While many species can infect more than one vertebrate host, they are generally specific to one of these classes (such as birds).[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nHumans are primarily infected by five species of Plasmodium, with the overwhelming majority of severe disease and death caused by Plasmodium falciparum.[23] Some species that infect humans can also infect other primates, and zoonoses of certain species (e.g. P. knowlesi) from other primates to humans are common.[23] Non-human primates also contain a variety of Plasmodium species that do not generally infect humans. Some of these can cause severe disease in primates, while others can remain in the host for prolonged periods without causing disease.[24] Many other mammals also carry Plasmodium species, such as a variety of rodents, ungulates, and bats. Again, some species of Plasmodium can cause severe disease in some of these hosts, while many appear not to.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 150 species of Plasmodium infect a broad variety of birds. In general each species of Plasmodium infects one to a few species of birds.[26] Plasmodium parasites that infect birds tend to persist in a given host for years or for the life time of the host, although in some cases Plasmodium infections can result in severe illness and rapid death.[27][28] Unlike with Plasmodium species infecting mammals, those infecting birds are distributed across the globe.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecies from several subgenera of Plasmodium infect diverse reptiles. Plasmodium parasites have been described in most lizard families and, like avian parasites, are spread worldwide.[29] Again, parasites can result either in severe disease or be apparently asymptomatic depending on the parasite and the host.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of drugs have been developed over the years to control Plasmodium infection in vertebrate hosts, particularly in humans. Quinine was used as a frontline antimalarial from the 17th century until widespread resistance emerged in the early 20th century.[30] Resistance to quinine spurred the development of a broad array of antimalarial medications through the 20th century including chloroquine, proguanil, atovaquone, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, mefloquine, and artemisinin.[30] In all cases, parasites resistant to a given drug have emerged within a few decades of the drugs deployment.[30] To combat this, antimalarial drugs are frequently used in combination, with artemisinin combination therapies currently the gold standard for treatment.[31] In general, antimalarial drugs target the life stages of Plasmodium parasites that reside within vertebrate red blood cells, as these are the stages that tend to cause disease.[32] However, drugs targeting other stages of the parasite life cycle are under development in order to prevent infection in travelers and to prevent transmission of sexual stages to insect hosts.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to a vertebrate host, all Plasmodium species also infect a bloodsucking insect host, generally a mosquito (although some reptile-infecting parasites are transmitted by sandflies). Mosquitoes of the genera Culex, Anopheles, Culiseta, Mansonia and Aedes act as insect hosts for various Plasmodium species. The best studied of these are the Anopheles mosquitoes which host the Plasmodium parasites of human malaria, as well as Culex mosquitoes which host the Plasmodium species that cause malaria in birds. Only female mosquitoes are infected with Plasmodium, since only they feed on the blood of vertebrate hosts.[34] Different species affect their insect hosts differently. Sometimes, insects infected with Plasmodium have reduced lifespan and reduced ability to produce offspring.[35] Further, some species of Plasmodium appear to cause insects to prefer to bite infected vertebrate hosts over non-infected hosts.[35][36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlasmodium was first identified when Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran described parasites in the blood of malaria patients in 1880.[38] He named the parasite Oscillaria malariae.[38] In 1885, zoologists Ettore Marchiafava and Angelo Celli reexamined the parasite and termed it a member of a new genus, Plasmodium, named for the resemblance to the multinucleate cells of slime molds of the same name.[39][notes 1] The fact that several species may be involved in causing different forms of malaria was first recognized by Camillo Golgi in 1886.[38] Soon thereafter, Giovanni Batista Grassi and Raimondo Filetti named the parasites causing two different types of human malaria Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae.[38] In 1897, William Welch identified and named Plasmodium falciparum. This was followed by the recognition of the other two species of Plasmodium which infect humans: Plasmodium ovale (1922) and Plasmodium knowlesi (identified in long-tailed macaques in 1931; in humans in 1965).[38] The contribution of insect hosts to the Plasmodium life cycle was described in 1897 by Ronald Ross and in 1899 by Giovanni Batista Grassi, Amico Bignami and Giuseppe Bastianelli.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1966, Cyril Garnham proposed separating Plasmodium into nine subgenera based on host specificity and parasite morphology.[17] This included four subgenera that had previously been proposed for bird-infecting Plasmodium species by A. Corradetti in 1963.[40][18] This scheme was expanded upon by Sam R. Telford in 1988 when he reclassified Plasmodium parasites that infect reptiles, adding five subgenera.[19][17] In 1997, G. Valkiunas reclassified the bird-infecting Plasmodium species adding a fifth subgenus: Bennettinia.[18][41]","input":"What type of reproduction takes place in plasmodium?"},{"output":"A chicken coop or hen house","context":"A chicken coop or hen house is a small house where, typically, female chickens or other fowl are kept safe and secure. There are nest boxes found inside the hen houses for egg-laying, and perches on which the birds can sleep. \\r\\n\\r\\nA chicken coop usually has an indoor area where the chickens can sleep and nest, as well as a fenced-in outdoor area where chickens will feed and spend the majority of the day (which is typically made from chicken wire). The coop should be cleaned after every two weeks, and the straw shifted every day, similar to a litter box. At night, the coop should be locked with all the birds inside of it, so that they are protected from predators. Both the inside and outdoor floors of a chicken coop are often strewn with a loose material such as straw or wood chips to deal with chicken droppings and to provide ventilation. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe purpose of a chicken coop is to protect chickens from bad weather - heat, cold, wind and rain and secure them from predators-especially foxes and cats. One method to protect chickens is to put an isolation material between two layers of wood or bricks. As too much heat can prove to be fatal, windows should be oriented in such a way as to prevent overheating, and proper ventilation measures should be taken to prevent infectious bronchitis and overheating as well. The hens can be released outside by daylight but should be locked in a coop at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a long-standing controversy over the basic need for a chicken coop. One philosophy, known as the \\"fresh air school\\"   is that chickens are mostly hardy but can be brought low by confinement, poor air quality and darkness, hence the need for a highly ventilated or open-sided coop with conditions more like the outdoors, even in winter.[1]  However, others who keep chickens believe they are prone to illness in outdoor weather and need a controlled-environment coop. This has led to two housing designs for chickens: fresh-air houses with wide openings and nothing more than wire mesh between chickens and the weather (even in Northern winters), or closed houses with doors, windows and hatches which can shut off most ventilation.[2] Regardless of design, experts agree that proper ventilation of the chicken coop is crucial for the health and well-being of the birds. Poorly ventilated chicken coops can lead to heat stress or stroke, and to the build-up of toxic fumes within the coop.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBackyard coops are small and often enclosed within a fenced area (sometimes bounded by chicken wire), thus creating a more natural living environment, one in which the chickens can roam freely and forage for food. If this kind of \\"yarding\\" is both floorless and reasonably mobile, it is called a chicken tractor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of small coops in urban areas of wealthy countries has been growing. This growth has led to the marketing of manufactured chicken coops, such as Eglu, which are designed for more cramped spaces and a tidier look.  Manufactured chicken coops are primarily marketed towards urban coop owners and are often more expensive than building one's own coop.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nUrban settings may have laws which regulate backyard keeping of fowl. For example, Oakland, California, bans roosters[5] and has a rule stating that hens must be kept at least twenty feet away from dwellings, schools and churches.[6]","input":"What is the shelter of a hen called?"},{"output":"The jaguar","context":"The jaguar (Panthera onca), is a wild cat species and the only extant member of the genus Panthera native to the Americas. The jaguar's present range extends from Southwestern United States and Mexico across much of Central America and south to Paraguay and northern Argentina. Though there are single cats now living within the western United States, the species has largely been extirpated from the United States since the early 20th century. It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List; and its numbers are declining. Threats include loss and fragmentation of habitat.[1]\\r\\nThe jaguar is the largest cat species in the Americas and the third-largest after the tiger and the lion. This spotted cat closely resembles the leopard, but is usually larger and sturdier. It ranges across a variety of forested and open terrains, but its preferred habitat is tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest, swamps and wooded regions. The jaguar enjoys swimming and is largely a solitary, opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush predator at the top of the food chain. As a keystone species it plays an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and regulating prey populations.\\r\\nThe jaguar has an exceptionally powerful bite, even relative to the other big cats.[2] This allows it to pierce the shells of armored reptiles[3] and to employ an unusual killing method: it bites directly through the skull of prey between the ears to deliver a fatal bite to the brain.[4]\\r\\nWhile international trade in jaguar or its body parts is prohibited, the cat is still frequently killed, particularly in conflicts with ranchers and farmers in South America. Although reduced, its range remains large. Given its historical distribution, the jaguar has featured prominently in the mythology of numerous indigenous American cultures, including those of the Maya and Aztec.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word 'jaguar' is thought to derive from the Tupian word yaguara, meaning \\"beast of prey\\".[5] The word entered English presumably via the Amazonian trade language Tupinamb, via Portuguese jaguar.[6][7] The specific word for jaguar is yaguaret, with the suffix -et meaning \\"real\\" or \\"true\\".[8]\\r\\nThe word 'panther' derives from classical Latin panthra, itself from the ancient Greek pnthr (?ƒ≤).[9] The Greek pan- (?), meaning \\"all\\", and thr (ƒ≤?), meaning \\"prey\\" bears the meaning of \\"predator of all animals\\". Use of the word for a beast originated in antiquity in the Orient, probably from India to Persia to Greece.[10]\\r\\nIn Mexican Spanish, its nickname is el tigre: 16th century Spaniards had no native word in their language for the jaguar, which is smaller than a lion, but bigger than a leopard, nor had ever encountered it in the Old World, and so named it after the tiger, since its ferocity would have been known to them through Roman writings and popular literature during the Renaissance.[11]\\r\\nOnca is the Portuguese on?a, with the cedilla dropped for typographical reasons, found in English as ounce for the snow leopard, Panthera uncia. It derives from the Latin lyncea lynx, with the letter L confused with the definite article (Italian lonza, Old French l'once).[12]\\r\\nThe jaguar is the only extant New World member of the genus Panthera. Results of DNA analysis shows the lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, snow leopard, and clouded leopard share a common ancestor, and that this group is between six and ten million years old; the fossil record points to the emergence of Panthera just two to 3.8 million years ago.[13] The Panthera are thought to have evolved in Asia.[14] The jaguar is thought to have diverged from a common ancestor of the Panthera species at least 1.5 million years ago and to have entered the American continent in the Early Pleistocene via Beringia, the land bridge that once spanned the Bering Strait. Results of jaguar mitochondrial DNA analysis indicates that the species' lineage evolved between 280,000 and 510,000 years ago.[15]\\r\\nPhylogenetic studies generally have shown the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) is basal to this group.[16][17][18][14] The position of the remaining species varies between studies and is effectively unresolved.\\r\\nBased on morphological evidence, British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock concluded the jaguar is most closely related to the leopard.[16] However, DNA evidence is inconclusive and the position of the jaguar relative to the other species varies between studies.[16][17][18][14] Fossils of extinct Panthera species, such as the European jaguar (Panthera gombaszoegensis) and the American lion (Panthera atrox), show characteristics of both the lion and the jaguar.[16]\\r\\nIn 1758, Carl Linnaeus described the jaguar in his work Systema Naturae and gave it the scientific name Felis onca.[19] In the 19th and 20th centuries, several jaguar type specimens formed the basis for descriptions of subspecies.[20] In 1939, Reginald Innes Pocock recognized eight subspecies based on geographic origins and skull morphology of these specimens.[21] Pocock did not have access to sufficient zoological specimens to critically evaluate their subspecific status, but expressed doubt about the status of several. Later consideration of his work suggested only three subspecies should be recognized. The description of P. o. palustris was based on a fossil skull.[22] The author of Mammal Species of the World listed nine subspecies and both P. o. palustris or P. o. paraguensis separately.[20]\\r\\nResults of morphologic and genetic research indicate a clinal north√øsouth variation between populations, but no evidence for subspecific differentiation.[15][23] A subsequent, more detailed study confirmed the predicted population structure within jaguar populations in Colombia.[24]\\r\\nIUCN Red List assessors for the species and the Cat Classification Taskforce of the Cat Specialist Group do not recognize any jaguar subspecies as valid.[1][25] The following table is based on the classification of the species provided in Mammal Species of the World.[20]\\r\\nThe jaguar, a compact and well-muscled animal, is the largest cat in the New World and the largest carnivorous mammal in Central and South America.[26] Size and weight vary considerably: weights are normally in the range of 56√ø96?kg (124√ø211 lb). Larger males have been recorded to weigh as much as 158?kg (348?lb)[27][28] (roughly matching a tigress or lioness; however note this animal was weighed with a full stomach).[29] The smallest females have low weights of 36?kg (79?lb).[27] Females are typically 10√ø20 percent smaller than males. The length, from the nose to the base of the tail, of the cats varies from 1.12 to 1.85?m (3.7 to 6.1?ft). Their tails are the shortest of any big cat, at 45 to 75?cm (18 to 30?in) in length.[27][30] Their legs are also short, considerably shorter when compared to a small tiger or lion in a similar weight range, but are thick and powerful. The jaguar stands 63 to 76?cm (25 to 30?in) tall at the shoulders.[31] Compared to the similarly colored leopard, the jaguar is bigger, heavier and relatively stocky in build.[22]\\r\\nFurther variations in size have been observed across regions and habitats, with size tending to increase from the north to south. A study of the jaguar in the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve on the Mexican Pacific coast, showed ranges of just about 50?kg (110?lb), about the size of a female cougar.[32] Jaguars in Venezuela or Brazil are much larger with average weights of about 95?kg (220?lb) in males and of about 56 kilograms (123?lb) to 78 kilograms (172?lb) in females.[22] In the Brazilian Pantanal, weights of 136 kilograms (300?lb) or more are not uncommon in old males,[33] with the highest recorded weight, for a Jaguar weighed on an empty stomach being 148 kilograms (326?lb).[34] Forest jaguars are frequently darker and considerably smaller than those found in open areas (the Pantanal is an open wetland basin), possibly due to the smaller numbers of large, herbivorous prey in forest areas.[35]\\r\\nA short and stocky limb structure makes the jaguar adept at climbing, crawling, and swimming.[31] The head is robust and the jaw extremely powerful, it has the third highest bite force of all felids, after the tiger and lion. A 100?kg (220?lb) jaguar can bite with a force of 503.6 kgf (1110?lbf) at canine teeth and 705.8 kgf (1556?lbf) at carnassial notch.[36] This strength adaptation allows the jaguar to pierce turtle shells.[3] A comparative study of bite force adjusted for body size ranked it as the top felid, alongside the clouded leopard and ahead of the tiger and lion.[37] It has been reported that \\"an individual jaguar can drag an 800?lb (360?kg) bull 25?ft (7.6?m) in its jaws and pulverize the heaviest bones\\".[38] The jaguar hunts wild animals weighing up to 300?kg (660?lb) in dense jungle, and its short and sturdy physique is thus an adaptation to its prey and environment.\\r\\nThe base coat of the jaguar is generally a tawny yellow, but can range to reddish-brown, for most of the body. However, the ventral areas are white.[31] The cat is covered in rosettes for camouflage in the dappled light of its forest habitat. The spots vary over individual coats and between individual jaguars: rosettes may include one or several dots, and the shapes of the dots vary. The spots on the head and neck are generally solid, as are those on the tail, where they may merge to form a band.[22]\\r\\nWhile the jaguar closely resembles the leopard, it is sturdier and heavier, and the two animals can be distinguished by their rosettes: the rosettes on a jaguar's coat are larger, fewer in number, usually darker, and have thicker lines and small spots in the middle that the leopard lacks. Jaguars also have rounder heads and shorter, stockier limbs compared to leopards.[39]\\r\\nColor morphism occurs in the species. A near-black melanistic form occurs regularly. Jaguars with melanism appear entirely black, although their spots are still visible on close examination.\\r\\nThe black morph is less common than the spotted form, but at about six percent of the population,[40] it is several orders of magnitude above the mutation rate. Hence, it is being supported by selection. Some evidence indicates the melanism allele is dominant.[41] The black form may be an example of heterozygote advantage; breeding in captivity is not yet conclusive on this. Melanistic jaguars (or black jaguars) occur primarily in parts of South America, and are virtually unknown in wild populations residing in the subtropical and temperate regions of North America; they have never been documented north of Mexicos Isthmus of Tehuantepec.[42]\\r\\nMelanistic jaguars are informally known as black panthers, but (as with all forms of polymorphism) they do not form a separate species.\\r\\nExtremely rare albino individuals, sometimes called white panthers, also occur among jaguars, as with the other big cats.[35] As usual with albinos in the wild, selection keeps the frequency close to the rate of mutation.\\r\\nAt present, the jaguar's range extends from Mexico through Central America to South America, including much of Amazonian Brazil. The countries included in this range are Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica (particularly on the Osa Peninsula), Ecuador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, the United States and Venezuela. It is now locally extinct in El Salvador and Uruguay.[1]\\r\\nThe jaguar has been an American cat since crossing the Bering Land Bridge during the Pleistocene epoch; the immediate ancestor of modern animals is Panthera onca augusta, which was larger than the contemporary cat.[24] It occurs in the 400?km2 Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, the 5,300?km2 Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve in Mexico, the approximately 15,000?km2 Man~ National Park in Peru, the approximately 26,000?km2 Xingu National Park in Brazil, and numerous other reserves throughout its range.\\r\\nThe inclusion of the United States in the list is based on occasional sightings in the southwest, particularly in Arizona,[43] New Mexico and Texas. In the early 20th century, the jaguar's range extended as far north as the Grand Canyon, and as far west as Southern California.[44] The jaguar is a protected species in the United States under the Endangered Species Act, which has stopped the shooting of the animal for its pelt. In 1996 and from 2004 on, hunting guides and wildlife officials in Arizona photographed and documented jaguars in the southern part of the state.[45] Between 2004 and 2007, two or three jaguars have been reported by researchers around Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge in southern Arizona. One of them, called 'Macho B', had been previously photographed in 1996 in the area.[46] For any permanent population in the USA to thrive, protection from killing, an adequate prey base, and connectivity with Mexican populations are essential.[47] In February 2009, a 53.5?kg (118?lb) jaguar was caught, radio-collared and released in an area southwest of Tucson, Arizona; this is farther north than had previously been expected and represents a sign there may be a permanent breeding population of jaguars within southern Arizona. The animal was later confirmed to be indeed the same male individual ('Macho B') that was photographed in 2004.[48] On 2 March 2009, Macho B was recaptured and euthanized after he was found to be suffering from kidney failure; the animal was thought to be 16 years old, older than any known wild jaguar.[49]\\r\\nCompletion of the United States√øMexico barrier as currently proposed will reduce the viability of any population currently residing in the United States, by reducing gene flow with Mexican populations, and prevent any further northward expansion for the species.[50]\\r\\nThe historic range of the species included much of the southern half of the United States, and in the south extended much farther to cover most of the South American continent. In total, its northern range has receded 1,000?km (621?mi) southward and its southern range 2,000?km (1243?mi) northward. Ice age fossils of the jaguar, dated between 40,000 and 11,500 years ago, have been discovered in the United States, including some at an important site as far north as Missouri. Fossil evidence shows jaguars of up to 190?kg (420?lb), much larger than the contemporary average for the animal.[51]\\r\\nThe habitat of the cat includes the rain forests of South and Central America, open, seasonally flooded wetlands, and dry grassland terrain. Of these habitats, the jaguar much prefers dense forest;[35] the cat has lost range most rapidly in regions of drier habitat, such as the Argentine pampas, the arid grasslands of Mexico, and the southwestern United States.[1] The cat will range across tropical, subtropical, and dry deciduous forests (including, historically, oak forests in the United States). The jaguar prefers to live by rivers, swamps, and in dense rainforest with thick cover for stalking prey. Jaguars have been found at elevations as high as 3,800?m, but they typically avoid montane forest and are not found in the high plateau of central Mexico or in the Andes.[35] The jaguars preferred habitats are usually swamps and wooded regions, but jaguars also live in scrublands and deserts.[52]\\r\\nThe adult jaguar is an apex predator, meaning it exists at the top of its food chain and is not preyed on in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a keystone species, as it is assumed, through controlling the population levels of prey such as herbivorous and granivorous mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems.[32][53] However, accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while controlling for the effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases in the absence of the keystone predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects.[54] However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the keystone predator hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.[55]\\r\\nThe jaguar also has an effect on other predators. The jaguar and the cougar, the next-largest feline of the Americas, are often sympatric (related species sharing overlapping territory) and have often been studied in conjunction. Where sympatric with the jaguar, the cougar is smaller than normal and is smaller than the local jaguars. The jaguar tends to take larger prey, usually over 22?kg (49?lb) and the cougar smaller, usually between 2 and 22?kg (4.4 and 48.5?lb), reducing the latter's size.[56][57] This situation may be advantageous to the cougar. Its broader prey niche, including its ability to take smaller prey, may give it an advantage over the jaguar in human-altered landscapes;[32] while both are classified as near-threatened species, the cougar has a significantly larger current distribution.\\r\\nJaguar females reach sexual maturity at about two years of age, and males at three or four. The cat is believed to mate throughout the year in the wild, although births may increase when prey is plentiful.[58] Research on captive male jaguars supports the year-round mating hypothesis, with no seasonal variation in semen traits and ejaculatory quality; low reproductive success has also been observed in captivity.[59] Female estrus is 6√ø17 days out of a full 37-day cycle, and females will advertise fertility with urinary scent marks and increased vocalization.[58] Both sexes will range more widely than usual during courtship.\\r\\nPairs separate after mating, and females provide all parenting. The gestation period lasts 93√ø105 days; females give birth to up to four cubs, and most commonly to two. The mother will not tolerate the presence of males after the birth of cubs, given a risk of infanticide; this behavior is also found in the tiger.[60]\\r\\nThe young are born blind, gaining sight after two weeks. Cubs are weaned at three months, but remain in the birth den for six months before leaving to accompany their mother on hunts.[61] They will continue in their mother's company for one to two years before leaving to establish a territory for themselves. Young males are at first nomadic, jostling with their older counterparts until they succeed in claiming a territory. Typical lifespan in the wild is estimated at around 12√ø15 years; in captivity, the jaguar lives up to 23 years, placing it among the longest-lived cats.[33]\\r\\nLike most cats, the jaguar is solitary outside mother√øcub groups. Adults generally meet only to court and mate (though limited noncourting socialization has been observed anecdotally[60]) and carve out large territories for themselves. Female territories, which range from 25 to 40?km2 in size, may overlap, but the animals generally avoid one another. Male ranges cover roughly twice as much area, varying in size with the availability of game and space, and do not overlap. The territory of a male can contain those of several females.[60][62] The jaguar uses scrape marks, urine, and feces to mark its territory.[63][64]\\r\\nLike the other big cats, the jaguar is capable of roaring[65][66] and does so to warn territorial and mating competitors away; intensive bouts of counter-calling between individuals have been observed in the wild.[3] Their roar often resembles a repetitive cough, and they may also vocalize mews and grunts.[33] Mating fights between males occur, but are rare, and aggression avoidance behavior has been observed in the wild.[63] When it occurs, conflict is typically over territory: a male's range may encompass that of two or three females, and he will not tolerate intrusions by other adult males.[60]\\r\\nThe jaguar is often described as nocturnal, but is more specifically crepuscular (peak activity around dawn and dusk). Both sexes hunt, but males travel farther each day than females, befitting their larger territories. The jaguar may hunt during the day if game is available and is a relatively energetic feline, spending as much as 50√ø60 percent of its time active.[35] The jaguar's elusive nature and the inaccessibility of much of its preferred habitat make it a difficult animal to sight, let alone study.\\r\\nLike all cats, the jaguar is an obligate carnivore, feeding only on meat. It is an opportunistic hunter and its diet encompasses at least 87 species.[35] The jaguar can take virtually any terrestrial or riparian vertebrate found in Central or South America, with a preference for large prey. The jaguar is more of a dietary generalist than its Old World cousins: the American tropics have a high diversity of small animals but relatively low populations and diversity of the large ungulates which this genus favors.[56] They regularly take adult caimans,[67] deer, capybaras, tapirs, peccaries, dogs, zorros, and sometimes even anacondas.[22] However, the cat will eat any small species that can be caught, including frogs, mice, birds (mainly ground-based species such as cracids), fish, sloths, monkeys, and turtles; a study conducted in Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, for example, revealed that the diets of jaguars there consisted primarily of armadillos and pacas.[63] Some jaguars will also take domestic livestock.[68] El Jefe, one of the few jaguars that were reported in the United States,[69][70] has also been found to kill and eat American black bears, as deduced from hairs found within his scats and the partly consumed carcass of a black bear sow with the distinctive puncture marks to the skull left by jaguars. This indicates that jaguars might have once preyed on black bears when the species was still present in the area. Spectacled bears are also known to avoid jaguars, possibly because they may constitute occasional prey items.[71]\\r\\nThere is evidence that jaguars in the wild consume the roots of Banisteriopsis caapi.[72]\\r\\nWhile the jaguar often employs the deep throat-bite and suffocation technique typical among Panthera, it sometimes uses a killing method unique amongst cats: it pierces directly through the temporal bones of the skull between the ears of prey (especially the capybara) with its canine teeth, piercing the brain.[73] This may be an adaptation to \\"cracking open\\" turtle shells; following the late Pleistocene extinctions, armored reptiles such as turtles would have formed an abundant prey base for the jaguar.[3][35] The skull bite is employed with mammals in particular; with reptiles such as the caiman, the jaguar may leap onto the back of the prey and sever the cervical vertebrae, immobilizing the target. When attacking sea turtles, including the huge leatherback sea turtle which weighs about 385?kg (849?lb) on average, as they try to nest on beaches, the jaguar will bite at the head, often beheading the prey, before dragging it off to eat.[74] Reportedly, while hunting horses, a jaguar may leap onto their back, place one paw on the muzzle and another on the nape and then twist, dislocating the neck. Local people have anecdotally reported that when hunting a pair of horses bound together, the jaguar will kill one horse and then drag it while the other horse, still living, is dragged in their wake.[75] With prey such as smaller dogs, a paw swipe to the skull may be sufficient to kill it.\\r\\nThe jaguar is a stalk-and-ambush rather than a chase predator. The cat will walk slowly down forest paths, listening for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target's blind spot with a quick pounce; the species' ambushing abilities are considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers, and are probably a product of its role as an apex predator in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses as large as a heifer can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels.[60]\\r\\nOn killing prey, the jaguar will drag the carcass to a thicket or other secluded spot. It begins eating at the neck and chest, rather than the midsection. The heart and lungs are consumed, followed by the shoulders.[60] The daily food requirement of a 34?kg (75?lb) animal, at the extreme low end of the species' weight range, has been estimated at 1.4?kg (3.1?lb).[44] For captive animals in the 50√ø60?kg (110√ø130?lb) range, more than 2?kg (4.4?lb) of meat daily are recommended.[76] In the wild, consumption is naturally more erratic; wild cats expend considerable energy in the capture and kill of prey, and they may consume up to 25?kg (55?lb) of meat at one feeding, followed by periods of famine.[77]\\r\\nUnlike all other Panthera species, jaguars very rarely attack humans. However, jaguar attacks appear to be on the rise with increased human encroachment on their habitat and a decrease in prey populations.[78] Sometimes jaguars in captivity attack zookeepers.[79] In addition, it appears that attacks on humans had been more common in the past, at least after conquistadors arrived in the Americas, to the extent that the jaguar had a fearsome reputation in the Americas, akin to the lion and tiger in the Old World. Nevertheless, even in those times, the jaguar's chief prey was the capybara, not the human, and Charles Darwin reported a saying of Native Americans that people would not have to fear the jaguar much, as long as capybaras were abundant.[80]\\r\\nJaguar populations are rapidly declining. The animal is considered Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN),[1] meaning it may be threatened with extinction in the near future. The loss of parts of its range, including its virtual elimination from its historic northern areas and the increasing fragmentation of the remaining range, have contributed to this status. The 1960s had particularly significant declines, with more than 15,000 jaguar skins brought out of the Brazilian Amazon yearly; the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of 1973 brought about a sharp decline in the pelt trade.[81] Detailed work performed under the auspices of the Wildlife Conservation Society revealed the specieshas lost 37% of its historic range, with its status unknown in an additional 18 percent. More encouragingly, the probability of long-term survival was considered high in 70% of its remaining range, particularly in the Amazon basin and the adjoining Gran Chaco and Pantanal.[82]\\r\\nThe major risks to the jaguar include deforestation across its habitat, increasing competition for food with human beings, especially in dry and unproductive habitat,[1][83] poaching, hurricanes in northern parts of its range, and the behavior of ranchers who will often kill the cat where it preys on livestock. When adapted to the prey, the jaguar has been shown to take cattle as a large portion of its diet; while land clearance for grazing is a problem for the species, the jaguar population may have increased when cattle were first introduced to South America, as the animals took advantage of the new prey base. This willingness to take livestock has induced ranch owners to hire full-time jaguar hunters.[33]\\r\\nThe skins of wild cats and other mammals have been highly valued by the fur trade for many decades. From the beginning of the 20th-century Jaguars were hunted in large numbers, but over-harvest and habitat destruction reduced the availability and induced hunters and traders to gradually shift to smaller species by the 1960s. The international trade of jaguar skins had its largest boom between the end of the Second World War and the early 1970, due to the growing economy and lack of regulations. From 1967 onwards, the regulations introduced by national laws and international agreements diminished the reported international trade from as high as 13000 skins in 1967, through 7000 skins in 1969, until it became negligible after 1976, although illegal trade and smuggling continue to be a problem. During this period, the biggest exporters were Brazil and Paraguay, and the biggest importers were the USA and Germany.[84]\\r\\nThe jaguar is listed on CITES Appendix I, which means that all international trade in jaguars or their parts is prohibited. Hunting jaguars is prohibited in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, the United States, and Venezuela. Hunting of jaguars is restricted in Brazil, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru.[1] Trophy hunting is still permitted in Bolivia, and it is not protected in Ecuador or Guyana. In the US, it is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.\\r\\nJaguar conservation is complicated because of the species' large range spaning 18 countries with different policies and regulations. Specific areas of high importance for jaguar conservation, so-called \\"Jaguar Conservation Units\\" (JCU) were determined in 2000. These are large areas inhabited by at least 50 jaguars. Each unit was assessed and evaluated on the basis of size, connectivity, habitat quality for both jaguar and prey, and jaguar population status. That way, 51 Jaguar Conservation Units were determined in 36 geographic regions as priority areas for jaguar conservation including:[82]\\r\\nRecent studies underlined that to maintain the robust exchange across the jaguar gene pool necessary for maintaining the species, it is important that jaguar habitats are interconnected. To facilitate this, a new project, the Paseo del Jaguar, has been established to connect several jaguar hotspots.[85]\\r\\nIn 1986, the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary was established in Belize as the world's first protected area for jaguar conservation.[86]\\r\\nGiven the inaccessibility of much of the species' range, particularly the central Amazon, estimating jaguar numbers is difficult. Researchers typically focus on particular bioregions, thus species-wide analysis is scant. In 1991, 600√ø1,000 (the highest total) were estimated to be living in Belize. A year earlier, 125√ø180 jaguars were estimated to be living in Mexico's 4,000-km2 (2400-mi2) Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, with another 350 in the state of Chiapas. The adjoining Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala, with an area measuring 15,000?km2 (9,000?mi2), may have 465√ø550 animals.[87] Work employing GPS telemetry in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per 100?km2 in the critical Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may inflate the actual numbers of cats.[88]\\r\\nIn setting up protected reserves, efforts generally also have to be focused on the surrounding areas, as jaguars are unlikely to confine themselves to the bounds of a reservation, especially if the population is increasing in size. Human attitudes in the areas surrounding reserves and laws and regulations to prevent poaching are essential to make conservation areas effective.[89]\\r\\nTo estimate population sizes within specific areas and to keep track of individual jaguars, camera trapping and wildlife tracking telemetry are widely used, and feces may be sought out with the help of detector dogs to study jaguar health and diet.[90][91] Current conservation efforts often focus on educating ranch owners and promoting ecotourism.[92] The jaguar is generally defined as an umbrella species √ø its home range and habitat requirements are sufficiently broad that, if protected, numerous other species of smaller range will also be protected.[93] Umbrella species serve as \\"mobile links\\" at the landscape scale, in the jaguar's case through predation. Conservation organizations may thus focus on providing viable, connected habitat for the jaguar, with the knowledge other species will also benefit.[92]\\r\\nEcotourism setups are being used to generate public interest in charismatic animals such as the jaguar, while at the same time generating revenue that can be used in conservation efforts. Audits done in Africa have shown that ecotourism has helped in African cat conservation. As with large African cats, a key concern in jaguar ecotourism is the considerable habitat space the species requires, so if ecotourism is used to aid in jaguar conservation, some considerations need to be made as to how existing ecosystems will be kept intact, or how new ecosystems that are large enough to support a growing jaguar population will be put into place.[94]\\r\\nThe only extant cat native to North America that roars,[95] the jaguar was recorded as an animal of the Americas by Thomas Jefferson in 1799.[96] Jaguars are still occasionally sighted in Arizona and New Mexico, such as El Jefe,[97][98] prompting actions for its conservation by authorities.[95] For example, on the 20th of August, 2012, the USFWS proposed setting aside 838,232 acres in Arizona and New Mexico  an area larger than Rhode Island  as critical jaguar habitat.[99]\\r\\nIn pre-Columbian Central and South America, the jaguar was a symbol of power and strength. Among the Andean cultures, a jaguar cult disseminated by the early Chavn culture became accepted over most of what is today Peru by 900 BC. The later Moche culture of northern Peru used the jaguar as a symbol of power in many of their ceramics.[100][101][102] In the religion of the Muisca, who inhabited the cool Altiplano Cundiboyacense in the Colombian Andes, the jaguar was considered a sacred animal and during their religious rituals the people dressed in jaguar skins.[103] The skins were traded with the lowland peoples of the tropical Llanos Orientales.[104] The name of zipa Nemequene was derived from the Muysccubun words nymy and quyne, meaning \\"force of the jaguar\\".[105][106]\\r\\nIn Mesoamerica, the Olmecan early and influential culture of the Gulf Coast region roughly contemporaneous with the Chavndeveloped a distinct \\"were-jaguar\\" motif of sculptures and figurines showing stylised jaguars or humans with jaguar characteristics. In the later Maya civilization, the jaguar was believed to facilitate communication between the living and the dead and to protect the royal household. The Maya saw these powerful felines as their companions in the spiritual world, and a number of Maya rulers bore names that incorporated the Mayan word for jaguar (b'alam in many of the Mayan languages). Balam (Jaguar) remains a common Maya surname, and it is also the name of Chilam Balam, a legendary author to whom are attributed 17th and 18th-centuries Maya miscellanies preserving much important knowledge. The Aztec civilization shared this image of the jaguar as the representative of the ruler and as a warrior. The Aztecs formed an elite warrior class known as the Jaguar Knights. In Aztec mythology, the jaguar was considered to be the totem animal of the powerful deity Tezcatlipoca.[60][107]\\r\\nThe jaguar and its name are widely used as a symbol in contemporary culture. It is the national animal of Guyana, and is featured in its coat of arms.[108] The flag of the Department of Amazonas, a Colombian department, features a black jaguar silhouette pouncing towards a hunter.[109] The jaguar also appears in banknotes of Brazilian real. The jaguar is also a common fixture in the mythology of many contemporary native cultures in South America,[110] usually being portrayed as the creature which gave humans the power over fire.\\r\\nJaguar is widely used as a product name, most prominently for a British luxury car brand. The name has been adopted by sports franchises, including the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars and the Mexican soccer club Chiapas F.C. The crest of Argentina's national federation in rugby union features a jaguar; however, because of a journalist error, the country's national team is nicknamed Los Pumas.[111] In the spirit of the ancient Mayan culture, the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City adopted a red jaguar as the first official Olympic mascot.[112]","input":"What is the largest cat in the americas?"},{"output":"late 19th century","context":"The evolution of birds began in the Jurassic Period, with the earliest birds derived from a clade of theropoda dinosaurs named Paraves.[1] Birds are categorized as a biological class, Aves. For more than a century, the small theropod dinosaur Archaeopteryx lithographica from the Late Jurassic period was considered to have been the earliest bird. Modern phylogenies place birds in the dinosaur clade Theropoda. According to the current consensus, Aves and a sister group, the order Crocodilia, together are the sole living members of an unranked \\"reptile\\" clade, the Archosauria. Four distinct lineages of bird survived the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event 66 million years ago, giving rise to ostriches and relatives (Paleognathae), ducks and relatives (Anseriformes), ground-living fowl (Galliformes), and modern birds (Neoaves).\\r\\nPhylogenetically, Aves is usually defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of a specific modern bird species (such as the house sparrow, Passer domesticus), and either Archaeopteryx,[2] or some prehistoric species closer to Neornithes (to avoid the problems caused by the unclear relationships of Archaeopteryx to other theropods).[3] If the latter classification is used then the larger group is termed Avialae. Currently, the relationship between dinosaurs, Archaeopteryx, and modern birds is still under debate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is significant evidence that birds emerged within theropod dinosaurs, specifically, that birds are members of Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids, among others.[4] As more non-avian theropods that are closely related to birds are discovered, the formerly clear distinction between non-birds and birds becomes less so. This was noted already in the 19th century, with Thomas Huxley writing:\\r\\nWe have had to stretch the definition of the class of birds so as to include birds with teeth and birds with paw-like fore limbs and long tails. There is no evidence that Compsognathus possessed feathers; but, if it did, it would be hard indeed to say whether it should be called a reptilian bird or an avian reptile.[5]\\r\\nDiscoveries in northeast China (Liaoning Province) demonstrate that many small theropod dinosaurs did indeed have feathers, among them the compsognathid Sinosauropteryx and the microraptorian dromaeosaurid Sinornithosaurus. This has contributed to this ambiguity of where to draw the line between birds and reptiles.[6] Cryptovolans, a dromaeosaurid found in 2002 (which may be a junior synonym of Microraptor) was capable of powered flight, possessed a sternal keel and had ribs with uncinate processes. Cryptovolans seems to make a better \\"bird\\" than Archaeopteryx which lacks some of these modern bird features. Because of this, some paleontologists have suggested that dromaeosaurs are actually basal birds whose larger members are secondarily flightless, i.e. that dromaeosaurs evolved from birds and not the other way around. Evidence for this theory is currently inconclusive, but digs continue to unearth fossils (especially in China) of feathered dromaeosaurs. At any rate, it is fairly certain that flight utilizing feathered wings existed in the mid-Jurassic theropods. The Cretaceous unenlagiine Rahonavis also possesses features suggesting it was at least partially capable of powered flight.\\r\\nAlthough ornithischian (bird-hipped) dinosaurs share the same hip structure as birds, birds actually originated from the saurischian (lizard-hipped) dinosaurs if the dinosaurian origin theory is correct. They thus arrived at their hip structure condition independently. In fact, a bird-like hip structure also developed a third time among a peculiar group of theropods, the Therizinosauridae.\\r\\nAn alternate theory to the dinosaurian origin of birds, espoused by a few scientists, notably Larry Martin and Alan Feduccia, states that birds (including maniraptoran \\"dinosaurs\\") evolved from early archosaurs like Longisquama.[7] This theory is contested by most other paleontologists and experts in feather development and evolution.[8]\\r\\nThe basal bird Archaeopteryx, from the Jurassic, is well known as one of the first \\"missing links\\" to be found in support of evolution in the late 19th century. Though it is not considered a direct ancestor of modern birds, it gives a fair representation of how flight evolved and how the very first bird might have looked. It may be predated by Protoavis texensis, though the fragmentary nature of this fossil leaves it open to considerable doubt whether this was a bird ancestor. The skeleton of all early bird candidates is basically that of a small theropod dinosaur with long, clawed hands, though the exquisite preservation of the Solnhofen Plattenkalk shows Archaeopteryx was covered in feathers and had wings.[5] While Archaeopteryx and its relatives may not have been very good fliers, they would at least have been competent gliders, setting the stage for the evolution of life on the wing.\\r\\nThe evolutionary trend among birds has been the reduction of anatomical elements to save weight. The first element to disappear was the bony tail, being reduced to a pygostyle and the tail function taken over by feathers. Confuciusornis is an example of their trend. While keeping the clawed fingers, perhaps for climbing, it had a pygostyle tail, though longer than in modern birds. A large group of birds, the Enantiornithes, evolved into ecological niches similar to those of modern birds and flourished throughout the Mesozoic. Though their wings resembled those of many modern bird groups, they retained the clawed wings and a snout with teeth rather than a beak in most forms. The loss of a long tail was followed by a rapid evolution of their legs which evolved to become highly versatile and adaptable tools that opened up new ecological niches.[9]\\r\\nThe Cretaceous saw the rise of more modern birds with a more rigid ribcage with a carina and shoulders able to allow for a powerful upstroke, essential to sustained powered flight. Another improvement was the appearance of an alula, used to achieve better control of landing or flight at low speeds. They also had a more derived pygostyle, with a ploughshare-shaped end. An early example is Yanornis. Many were coastal birds, strikingly resembling modern shorebirds, like Ichthyornis, or ducks, like Gansus. Some evolved as swimming hunters, like the Hesperornithiformes √ø a group of flightless divers resembling grebes and loons. While modern in most respects, most of these birds retained typical reptilian-like teeth and sharp claws on the manus.\\r\\nThe modern toothless birds evolved from the toothed ancestors in the Cretaceous.[10] While the earlier primitive birds, particularly the Enantiornithes, continued to thrive and diversify alongside the pterosaurs through this geologic period until they became extinct due to the K√øT extinction event. All but a few groups of the toothless Neornithes were also cut short. The surviving lineages of birds were the comparatively primitive Paleognathae (ostrich and its allies), the aquatic duck lineage, the terrestrial fowl, and the highly volant Neoaves.\\r\\nModern birds are classified in Neornithes, which are now known to have evolved into some basic lineages by the end of the Cretaceous (see Vegavis). The Neornithes are split into the paleognaths and neognaths.\\r\\nThe paleognaths include the tinamous (found only in Central and South America) and the ratites, which nowadays are found almost exclusively on the Southern Hemisphere. The ratites are large flightless birds, and include ostriches, rheas, cassowaries, kiwis and emus. A few scientists propose that the ratites represent an artificial grouping of birds which have independently lost the ability to fly in a number of unrelated lineages.[11] In any case, the available data regarding their evolution is still very confusing, partly because there are no uncontroversial fossils from the Mesozoic. Phylogenetic analysis supports the assertion that the ratites are polyphyletic and do not represent a valid grouping of birds.[12]\\r\\nThe basal divergence from the remaining Neognathes was that of the Galloanserae, the superorder containing the Anseriformes (ducks, geese and swans), and the Galliformes (chickens, turkeys, pheasants, and their allies). The presence of basal anseriform fossils in the Mesozoic and likely some galliform fossils implies the presence of paleognaths at the same time, in spite of the absence of fossil evidence.\\r\\nThe dates for the splits are a matter of considerable debate amongst scientists. It is agreed that the Neornithes evolved in the Cretaceous and that the split between the Galloanserae and the other neognaths - the Neoaves - occurred before the Cretaceous√øPaleogene extinction event, but there are different opinions about whether the radiation of the remaining neognaths occurred before or after the extinction of the other dinosaurs.[13] This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence, with molecular dating suggesting a Cretaceous radiation, a small and equivocal neoavian fossil record from Cretaceous, and most living families turning up during the Paleogene. Attempts made to reconcile the molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial.[13][14]\\r\\nOn the other hand, two factors must be considered: First, molecular clocks cannot be considered reliable in the absence of robust fossil calibration, whereas the fossil record is naturally incomplete. Second, in reconstructed phylogenetic trees, the time and pattern of lineage separation corresponds to the evolution of the characters (such as DNA sequences, morphological traits etc.) studied, not to the actual evolutionary pattern of the lineages; these ideally should not differ by much, but may well do so in practice.[citation needed]\\r\\nConsidering this, it is easy to see that fossil data, compared to molecular data, tends to be more accurate in general, but also to underestimate divergence times: morphological traits, being the product of entire developmental genetics networks, usually only start to diverge some time after a lineage split would become apparent in DNA sequence comparison - especially if the sequences used contain many silent mutations.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe phylogenetic classification of birds is a contentious issue. Sibley & Ahlquist's Phylogeny and Classification of Birds (1990) is a landmark work on the classification of birds (although frequently debated and constantly revised). A preponderance of evidence suggests that most modern bird orders constitute good clades. However, scientists are not in agreement as to the precise relationships between the main clades. Evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem but no strong consensus has emerged. As of the mid-2000s, new fossil and molecular data provide an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders, and their relationships. For example, the Charadriiformes seem to constitute an ancient and distinct lineage, while the Mirandornithes and Cypselomorphae are supported by a wealth of anatomical and molecular evidence. The understanding of the interrelationships of lower level taxa also continues to increase, particularly in the massively diverse perching bird group Passeriformes.\\r\\nBird classification and phylogenetic analysis is still under debate and requires more research. A 2008 study published in Science examined DNA sequences from 169 species of birds that represented all of the major extant groups. The findings may necessitate a wholesale restructuring of the avian phylogenetic tree. The findings also supported unestablished relationships between orders and confirmed disputes over particular groupings.[15]\\r\\nEvolution generally occurs at a scale far too slow to be witnessed by humans. However, bird species are currently going extinct at a far greater rate than any possible speciation or other generation of new species. The disappearance of a population, subspecies, or species represents the permanent loss of a range of genes.\\r\\nAnother concern with evolutionary implications is a suspected increase in hybridization. This may arise from human alteration of habitats enabling related allopatric species to overlap. Forest fragmentation can create extensive open areas, connecting previously isolated patches of open habitat. Populations that were isolated for sufficient time to diverge significantly, but not sufficient to be incapable of producing fertile offspring may now be interbreeding so broadly that the integrity of the original species may be compromised. For example, the many hybrid hummingbirds found in northwest South America may represent a threat to the conservation of the distinct species involved.[16]\\r\\nSeveral species of birds have been bred in captivity to create variations on wild species. In some birds this is limited to color variations, while others are bred for larger egg or meat production, for flightlessness or other characteristics.","input":"When did the first birds appear in the fossil record?"},{"output":"Sweetened whipped cream is also called Chantilly cream","context":"Whipped cream is cream that is whipped by a whisk or mixer until it is light and fluffy. Whipped cream is often sweetened and sometimes flavored with vanilla. Sweetened whipped cream is also called Chantilly cream or crme chantilly (pronounced?[k??m ??tiji]).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhipped cream is an aerated colloid produced when air is incorporated into cream containing at least 35% fat. During whipping, partially coalesced fat molecules create a stabilized network which traps air bubbles.[1] The resulting colloid is roughly double the volume of the original cream. If, however, the whipping is continued, the fat droplets will stick together destroying the colloid and forming butter. Lower-fat cream (or milk) does not whip well, while higher-fat cream produces a more stable foam.[2]\\r\\nCream is usually whipped with a whisk, an electric or hand mixer, or a food processor. Results are best when the equipment and ingredients are cold.[3]\\r\\nWhipped cream is often flavored with sugar, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, orange, and so on.[4] Many 19th-century recipes recommend adding gum tragacanth to stabilize whipped cream;[5] a few include whipped egg whites. Various other substances, including gelatin and diphosphate (E450), are used in commercial stabilizers.[6][7][8][9]\\r\\nWhipped cream may also be made in a whipping siphon, typically using nitrous oxide as the gas, as carbon dioxide tends to give a sour taste.[10] The siphon may have replaceable cartridges or be sold as a pre-pressurized retail package. The gas dissolves in the butterfat under pressure, and when the pressure is released, produces bubbles and thus whipped cream.\\r\\nWhipped cream, often sweetened and aromatised, was popular in the 16th century,[11] with recipes in the writings of Cristoforo di Messisbugo (Ferrara, 1549),[12] Bartolomeo Scappi (Rome, 1570),[11] and Lancelot de Casteau (Lige, 1604).[13] It was called milk snow (neve di latte, neige de lait).[14] A 1545 English recipe, \\"A Dyschefull of Snow\\", includes whipped egg whites as well, and is flavored with rosewater and sugar.[15] (cf. snow cream) In these recipes, and until the end of the 19th century, naturally separated cream is whipped, typically with willow or rush branches, and the resulting foam on the surface would from time to time be skimmed off and drained, a process taking an hour or more.[2] By the end of the 19th century, centrifuge-separated, high-fat cream made it much faster and easier to make whipped cream. The French name crme fouette 'whipped cream' is attested in 1629,[16] and the English name \\"whipped cream\\" in 1673.[17] The name \\"snow cream\\" continued to be used in the 17th century.[18][19]\\r\\nVarious desserts consisting of whipped cream in pyramidal shapes with coffee, liqueurs, chocolate, fruits, and so on either in the mixture or poured on top were called crme en mousse 'cream in a foam', crme fouette, crme mousseuse 'foamy cream', mousse 'foam',[20] and fromage  la Chantilly 'Chantilly-style cheese'.[21][22] Modern mousses, including mousse au chocolat, are a continuation of this tradition.\\r\\nCream whipped in a whipping siphon with nitrous oxide was invented in the 1930s by both Charles Getz, working with G. Frederick Smith,[23][24] and Marshall Reinecke.[25] Both filed patents, which were later litigated. The Getz patents were originally deemed invalid, but were upheld on appeal.[10]\\r\\nCrme Chantilly is another name for whipped cream. The difference between \\"whipped cream\\" and \\"crme Chantilly\\" is not systematic. Some authors distinguish between the two, with crme Chantilly being sweetened, and whipped cream not.[26] However, most authors treat the two as synonyms,[27] with both being sweetened,[28][29] neither being sweetened,[5][30] or treating sweetening as optional.[31][32] Many authors use only one of the two names (for the sweetened or unsweetened version), so it is not clear if they distinguish the two.[33]\\r\\nThe invention of crme Chantilly is often credited incorrectly, and without evidence, to Fran?ois Vatel, ma?tre d'h?tel at the Chateau de Chantilly in the mid-17th century.[34][35] But the name Chantilly is first connected with whipped cream in the mid-18th century,[36] around the time that the Baronne d'Oberkirch praised the \\"cream\\" served at a lunch at the Hameau de Chantillybut did not say what exactly it was, or call it Chantilly cream.[37][38]\\r\\nThe names \\"crme Chantilly\\", \\"crme de Chantilly\\", \\"crme  la Chantilly\\", or \\"crme fouette  la Chantilly\\" only become common in the 19th century. In 1806, the first edition of Viard's Cuisinier Imprial mentions neither \\"whipped\\" nor \\"Chantilly\\" cream,[39] but the 1820 edition mentions both.[40]\\r\\nThe name Chantilly was probably used because the chateau had become a symbol of refined food.[41]\\r\\nImitations of whipped cream, often sold under the name whipped topping or squirty cream, are commercially available. They may be used for various reasons:\\r\\nWhipped topping normally contains some mixture of partially hydrogenated oil, sweeteners, water, and stabilizers and emulsifiers added to prevent syneresis, similar to margarine instead of the butter fat in the cream used in whipped cream.\\r\\nWhipped cream or crme Chantilly is a popular topping for fruit and desserts such as pie, ice cream (especially sundaes), cupcakes, cakes, milkshakes, waffles, hot chocolate, cheesecakes, Jello and puddings. It is also served on coffee, especially in the Viennese coffee house tradition, where coffee with whipped cream is known as Melange mit Schlagobers. Whipped cream is used as an ingredient in many desserts, for example as a filling for profiteroles and layer cakes.[43]","input":"What is the difference between whipped cream and chantilly?"},{"output":"a column of elements in the periodic table of the chemical elements","context":"In chemistry, a group (also known as a family[citation needed]) is a column of elements in the periodic table of the chemical elements. There are 18 numbered groups in the periodic table, and the f-block columns (between groups 3 and 4) are not numbered. The elements in a group have similar physical or chemical characteristics of the outermost electron shells of their atoms (i.e., the same core charge), as most chemical properties are dominated by the orbital location of the outermost electron. There are three systems of group numbering. The modern numbering group 1 to group 18 is recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). It replaces two older naming schemes that were mutually confusing. Also, groups may be identified by their topmost element or have a specific name. For example, group 16 is variously described as the oxygen group and as chalcogens.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn history, several sets of group names have been used:[1][2]\\r\\nSome other names have been proposed and used without gaining wide acceptance: volatile metals for group 12; icosagens for group 13; crystallogens, adamantogens, and merylides for group 14; and aerogens for group 18.\\r\\nTwo earlier group number systems exist: CAS (Chemical Abstracts Service) and old IUPAC. Both use numerals (Arabic or Roman) and letters A and B. Both systems agree on the numbers. The numbers indicate approximately the highest oxidation number of the elements in that group, and so indicate similar chemistry with other elements with the same numeral. The number proceeds in a linearly increasing fashion for the most part, once on the left of the table, and once on the right (see List of oxidation states of the elements), with some irregularities in the transition metals. However, the two systems use the letters differently. For example, potassium (K) has one valence electron. Therefore, it is located in group 1. Calcium (Ca) is in group 2, for it contains two valence electrons.\\r\\nIn the old IUPAC system the letters A and B were designated to the left (A) and right (B) part of the table, while in the CAS system the letters A and B are designated to main group elements (A) and transition elements (B). The old IUPAC system was frequently used in Europe, while the CAS is most common in America. The new IUPAC scheme was developed to replace both systems as they confusingly used the same names to mean different things. The new system simply numbers the groups increasingly from left to right on the standard periodic table. The IUPAC proposal was first circulated in 1985 for public comments,[1] and was later included as part of the 1990 edition of the Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry.[4]","input":"What is a group in the periodic table?"},{"output":"1922 and 1923","context":"The Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool is the largest of the many reflecting pools in Washington, D.C., United States.

Paved walking paths were added to the north and south sides of the pool to replace worn grass and to prevent further erosion.[4] Construction on the 18-month, $30.74 million project began in November 2010.

The Texas war of independence ended on April 21, 1836, but Mexico refused to recognize the independence of the Republic of Texas, and intermittent conflicts between the two states continued into the 1840s. The United States recognized the Republic of Texas in March 1837 but declined to annex the territory.[2]\\r\\nThe Republic-claimed borders were based upon the Treaties of Velasco between the newly created Texas Republic and Antonio L‹ápez de Santa Anna of Mexico. The eastern boundary had been defined by the Adams√øOns Treaty of 1819 between the United States and Spain, which recognised the Sabine River as the eastern boundary of Spanish Texas and western boundary of the Missouri Territory. Under the Adams√øOns Treaty of 1819 the United States had renounced its claim to Spanish land to the east of the Rocky Mountains and to the north of the Rio Grande which it claimed to have acquired as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.\\r\\nThe republic's southern and western boundary with Mexico continued to be disputed throughout the republic's existence. Texas claimed the Rio Grande as its southern boundary, while Mexico insisted that the Nueces River was the boundary. Texas was annexed by the United States on December 29, 1845 and was admitted to the Union as the 28th state on that day, with the transfer of power from the Republic to the new state formally taking place on February 19, 1846. However, the United States again inherited the southern and western border dispute with Mexico, which became a trigger for the Mexican√øAmerican War of 1846√ø48.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTexas had been one of the Provincias Internas of New Spain, a region known historiographically as Spanish Texas. Though claimed by Spain, it was not formally colonized by them until competing French interests at Fort St. Louis encouraged Spain to establish permanent settlements in the area.[3] Sporadic missionary incursions occurred into the area during the period from the 1690s√ø1710s, before the establishment of San Antonio as a permanent civilian settlement.[4] Owing to the area's high Native American populations and its remoteness from the population centers of New Spain, Texas remained largely unsettled by Europeans, although Spain maintained a small military presence to protect Christian missionaries working among Native American tribes, and to act as a buffer against the French in Louisiana and British North America. In 1762, France ceded to Spain most of its claims to the interior of North America, including its claim to Texas, as well as the vast interior that became Spanish Louisiana.[5] During the years 1799 to 1803, the height of the Napoleonic Empire, Spain returned Louisiana back to France, which promptly sold the territory to the United States. The status of Texas during these transfers was unclear and was not resolved until 1819, when the Adams√øOns Treaty ceded Spanish Florida to the United States, and established a clear boundary between Texas and Louisiana.[6]\\r\\nStarting in 1810, the territories of New Spain north of the Isthmus of Panama (including Texas) sought independence in the Mexican War of Independence. Many Americans fought on the side of Mexico against Spain in filibustering expeditions. One of these, the Gutirrez√øMagee Expedition (also known as the Republican Army of the North) consisted of a group of about 130 Americans under the leadership of Bernardo Gutirrez de Lara. Gutierrez de Lara initiated Mexico's secession from Spain with efforts contributed by Magee. Bolstered by new recruits, and led Samuel Kemper (who succeeded Magee after his death in battle in 1813), the expedition gained a series of victories against soldiers led by the Spanish governor, Manuel Mara de Salcedo. Their victory at the Battle of Rosillo Creek convinced Salcedo to surrender on April 1, 1813; he was executed two days later. On April 6, 1813, the victorious Republican Army of the North drafted a constitution and declared the independent Republic of Texas, with Gutirrez as its president.[7] Soon disillusioned with the Mexican leadership, the Americans under Kemper returned to the United States. The ephemeral Republic of Texas came to an end following the August 18, 1813 Battle of Medina, where the Spanish Army crushed the Republican Army of the North. The harsh reprisals against the Texas rebels created a deep distrust of the Royal Spanish authorities, and veterans of the Battle of Medina would later become leaders of the Texas Revolution and signatories of the Texas Declaration of Independence from Mexico some 20 years later.\\r\\nAlong with the rest of Mexico, Texas gained its independence from Spain following the Treaty of C‹árdoba, and the new Mexican state was organized under the Plan of Iguala which created Mexico as a constitutional monarchy under its first Emperor Agustn de Iturbide. During the transition from a Spanish territory to part of the independent country of Mexico, Stephen F. Austin led a group of American settlers known as the Old Three Hundred, who negotiated the right to settle in Texas with the Spanish Royal governor of the territory. Since Mexican independence had been ratified by Spain shortly thereafter, Austin would later travel to Mexico City to secure the support of the new country in his right to settle.[8] The establishment of Mexican Texas coincided with the Austin-led settlement, leading to animosity between Mexican authorities and ongoing American settlement of Texas. The First Mexican Empire was short lived, being replaced by a republican form of government in 1823. Following Austin's lead, additional groups of settlers, known as Empresarios, continued to colonize Mexican Texas from the United States. In 1830, Mexican President Anastasio Bustamante outlawed American immigration to Texas, following several conflicts with the Empresarios over the status of slavery in the region.[9] Angered at the interference of the Mexican government, the Empresarios held the Convention of 1832, which is considered the first formal step in what would later become the Texas Revolution.\\r\\nOn the eve of war, the American settlers in the area outnumbered Mexicans by a considerable margin.[10] Following a series of minor skirmishes between Mexican authorities and the settlers, the Mexican government, fearing open rebellion of their Anglo subjects, began to step up military presence in Texas throughout 1834 and early 1835. Mexican President Antonio L‹ápez de Santa Anna revoked the 1824 Constitution of Mexico and began to consolidate power in the central government under his own leadership. The Texian leadership under Austin began to organize its own military, and hostilities broke out on October 2, 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales, the first engagement of the Texas Revolution.[11] In November, 1835 a provisional government known as the Consultation was established to oppose the Santa Anna regime (but stopped short of declaring independence from Mexico). On March 1, 1836 the Convention of 1836 came to order, and the next day declared independence from Mexico, establishing the Republic of Texas.[12]\\r\\nThe second Congress of the Republic of Texas convened in October 1836 at Columbia (now West Columbia). Stephen F. Austin, known as the Father of Texas, died December 27, 1836, after serving two months as Secretary of State for the new Republic.\\r\\nIn 1836, five sites served as temporary capitals of Texas (Washington-on-the-Brazos, Harrisburg, Galveston, Velasco and Columbia), before President Sam Houston moved the capital to Houston in 1837. The next president, Mirabeau B. Lamar, moved the capital to the new town of Austin in 1839.\\r\\nThe first flag of the republic was the \\"Burnet Flag\\" (a single gold star on an azure field), followed in 1839 by official adoption of the Lone Star Flag.\\r\\nInternal politics of the Republic centred on two factions. The nationalist faction, led by Lamar, advocated the continued independence of Texas, the expulsion of the Native Americans (Indians), and the expansion of Texas to the Pacific Ocean. Their opponents, led by Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful coexistence with the Indians, when possible. The Texas Congress even passed a resolution over Houston's veto claiming the Californias for Texas.[13] The 1844 presidential election split the electorate dramatically, with the newer western regions of the Republic preferring the nationalist candidate Edward Burleson, while the cotton country, particularly east of the Trinity River, went for Anson Jones.[14]\\r\\nThe Comanche Indians furnished the main Indian opposition to the Texas Republic, manifested in multiple raids on settlements, capture and rape of female pioneers, torture killings, and trafficking in captive slaves.[15] In the late 1830s, Sam Houston negotiated a peace between Texas and the Comanches. Lamar replaced Houston as president in 1838 and reversed the Indian policies. He returned to war with the Comanches and invaded Comancheria itself. In retaliation, the Comanches attacked Texas in a series of raids. After peace talks in 1840 ended with the massacre of 34 Comanche leaders in San Antonio, the Comanches launched a major attack deep into Texas, known as the Great Raid of 1840. Under command of Potsanaquahip (Buffalo Hump), 500 to 700 Comanche cavalry warriors swept down the Guadalupe River valley, killing and plundering all the way to the shore of the Gulf of Mexico, where they sacked the towns of Victoria and Linnville. Houston became president again in 1841 and, with both Texians and Comanches exhausted by war, a new peace was established.[16]\\r\\nAlthough Texas achieved self-government, Mexico refused to recognize its independence.[17] On March 5, 1842, a Mexican force of over 500 men, led by Rfael Vsquez, invaded Texas for the first time since the revolution. They soon headed back to the Rio Grande after briefly occupying San Antonio. About 1,400 Mexican troops, led by the French mercenary general Adrin Woll, launched a second attack and captured San Antonio on September 11, 1842. A Texas militia retaliated at the Battle of Salado Creek while simultaneously, a mile and a half away, Mexican soldiers massacred a militia of fifty-three Texas volunteers who had surrendered after a skirmish.[18][19] That night, the Mexican Army retreated from the city of San Antonio back to Mexico.\\r\\nMexico's attacks on Texas intensified conflicts between political factions, including an incident known as the Texas Archive War. To \\"protect\\" the Texas national archives, President Sam Houston ordered them removed from Austin. The archives were eventually returned to Austin, albeit at gunpoint. The Texas Congress admonished Houston for the incident, and this episode in Texas history would solidify Austin as Texas's seat of government for the Republic and the future state.[20]\\r\\nThere were also domestic disturbances. The Regulator√øModerator War involved a land feud in Harrison and Shelby Counties in East Texas from 1839 to 1844. The feud eventually involved Nacogdoches, San Augustine, and other East Texas counties. Harrison County Sheriff John J. Kennedy and county judge Joseph U. Fields helped end the conflict, siding with the law-and-order party. Sam Houston ordered 500 militia to help end the feud.\\r\\nAfter gaining their independence, the Texas voters had elected a Congress of 14 senators and 29 representatives in September 1836. The Constitution allowed the first president to serve for two years and subsequent presidents for 3 years. In order to hold an office or vote, a person needed to be a citizen of the Republic.[21]\\r\\nHowever, it is important to note that citizenship was not granted to all previous inhabitants of Texas, and not all of them could even live legally within the limits of the Republic without the consent of Congress. In this regard, the Constitution of the Republic of Texas (1836) established major differences according to the ethnicity of each individual. Section 10 of the General Provisions of the constitution stated that all persons who were residing in Texas on the day of the Declaration of Independence were to be considered citizens of the Republic, excepting \\"Africans, the descendants of Africans, and Indians\\".[22] For new white immigrants, section 6 established that, in order to become citizens, they needed to live in the Republic for at least six months and take an oath. While regarding the black population, section 9 established that black persons who were brought to Texas as slaves were to remain slaves, and that not even their owner could emancipate them without the consent of Congress, while the Congress itself was not allowed to make laws affecting the slave trade or to declare emancipation. Section 9 also established that: \\"No free person of African descent, either in whole or in part, shall be permitted to reside permanently in the Republic, without the consent of Congress\\".[23]\\r\\nThe first Congress of the Republic of Texas convened in October 1836 at Columbia (now West Columbia). Stephen F. Austin, often referred to as the \\"Father of Texas,\\" died on December 27, 1836, after serving just two months as the republic's secretary of state. Due mainly to the ongoing war for independence, five sites served as temporary capitals of Texas in 1836: (Washington-on-the-Brazos, Harrisburg, Galveston, Velasco and Columbia). The capital was moved to the new city of Houston in 1837.\\r\\nIn 1839, a small pioneer settlement situated on the Colorado River in central Texas was chosen as the republic's seventh and final capital. Incorporated under the name Waterloo, the town was renamed Austin shortly thereafter in honor of Stephen F. Austin.\\r\\nThe court system inaugurated by Congress included a Supreme Court consisting of a chief justice appointed by the president and four associate justices, elected by a joint ballot of both houses of Congress for four-year terms and eligible for re-election. The associates also presided over four judicial districts. Houston nominated James Collinsworth to be the first chief justice. The county-court system consisted of a chief justice and two associates, chosen by a majority of the justices of the peace in the county. Each county was also to have a sheriff, a coroner, justices of the peace, and constables to serve two-year terms. Congress formed 23 counties, whose boundaries generally coincided with the existing municipalities.\\r\\nIn 1839, Texas became the first nation in the world to enact a homestead exemption under which a person's primary residence could not be seized by creditors.\\r\\nThe Texan leaders at first intended to extend their national boundaries to the Pacific Ocean, but ultimately decided to claim the Rio Grande as boundary, including much of New Mexico, which the Republic never controlled. They also hoped, after peace was made with Mexico, to run a railroad to the Gulf of California to give \\"access to the East Indian, Peruvian and Chilean trade.\\"[24] When negotiating for the possibility of annexation to the US in late 1836, the Texan government instructed its minister Wharton in Washington that if the boundary were an issue, Texas was willing to settle for a boundary at the watershed between the Nueces River and Rio Grande, and leave out New Mexico.[25] In 1840 the first and only census of the Republic of Texas was taken, recording a population of about 70,000 people. San Antonio and Houston were recorded as the largest and second largest cities respectively.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn March 3, 1837, US President Andrew Jackson appointed Alce La Branche American charg d'affaires to the Republic of Texas, thus officially recognizing Texas as an independent republic.[26] France granted official recognition of Texas on September 25, 1839, appointing Alphonse Dubois de Saligny to serve as charg d'affaires. The French Legation was built in 1841, and still stands in Austin as the oldest frame structure in the city.[27] Conversely, the Republic of Texas embassy in Paris was located in what is now the H?tel de Vend?me, adjacent to the Place Vend?me in Paris's 2e arrondissement.[28]\\r\\nThe Republic also received diplomatic recognition from Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Republic of Yucatn. The United Kingdom never granted official recognition of Texas due to its own friendly relations with Mexico, but admitted Texan goods into British ports on their own terms. In London, the original Embassy of the Republic of Texas still stands, and there is a restaurant with such a name west of Trafalgar Square. Immediately opposite the gates to St. James's Palace, Sam Houston's original Embassy of the Republic of Texas to the Court of St. James's is now a hat shop, but is clearly marked with a large plaque and a nearby restaurant is called Texas Embassy.[29] A plaque on the exterior of 3 St. James's Street in London notes the upper floors of the building (which have housed the noted wine merchant Berry Brothers and Rudd since 1698) housed the Texas Legation.\\r\\nOn February 28, 1845, the US Congress passed a bill that would authorize the United States to annex the Republic of Texas. On March 1, US President John Tyler signed the bill. The legislation set the date for annexation for December 29 of the same year. Faced with imminent American annexation of Texas, Charles Elliot and Alphonse de Saligny, the British and French ministers to Texas, were dispatched to Mexico City by their governments. Meeting with Mexico's foreign secretary, they signed a \\"Diplomatic Act\\" in which Mexico offered to recognize an independent Texas with boundaries that would be determined with French and British mediation. Texas President Anson Jones forwarded both offers to a specially elected convention meeting at Austin, and the American proposal was accepted with only one dissenting vote. The Mexican proposal was never put to a vote. Following the previous decree of President Jones, the proposal was then put to a vote throughout the republic.\\r\\nOn October 13, 1845, a large majority of voters in the republic approved both the American offer and the proposed constitution that specifically endorsed slavery and emigrants bringing slaves to Texas.[30] This constitution was later accepted by the US Congress, making Texas a US state on the same day annexation took effect, December 29, 1845 (therefore bypassing a territorial phase).[31] One of the motivations for annexation was the huge debts which the Republic of Texas government had incurred. As part of the Compromise of 1850, in return for $10,000,000 in Federal bonds, Texas dropped claims to territory which included parts of present-day Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Wyoming.\\r\\nThe resolution did include two unique provisions: First, it said up to four additional states could be created from Texas' territory with the consent of the State of Texas (and that new states north of the Missouri Compromise Line would be free states). Though the resolution did not make exceptions to the constitution,[32] the U.S. Constitution neither requires Congressional consent to the creation of new states to be ex post to applications nor to expire. To illustrate the strength of the latter caveat, the 27th Amendment was submitted to the states in 1789, yet was not ratified until 1992; thus, the expressed consent of Congress, via this resolution, to the creation of new states would not expire nor require renewal. Second, Texas did not have to surrender its public lands to the federal government. While Texas did cede all territory outside of its current area to the federal government in 1850, it did not cede any public lands within its current boundaries. Consequently, the lands in Texas owned by the federal government are those which were subsequently purchased by it. This also means the state government has control over oil reserves which were later used to fund the state's public university system through the Permanent University Fund.[33] In addition, the state's control over offshore oil reserves in Texas runs out to 3 nautical leagues (9 nautical miles, 10.357 statute miles, 16.668?km) rather than three nautical miles (3.45 statute miles, 5.56?km) as with other states.[34][35]","input":"When did texas become the lone star republic?"},{"output":"Indian general election of 1951√ø52","context":"Jawaharlal Nehru\\r\\nINC\\r\\nJawaharlal Nehru\\r\\nINC\\r\\nThe Indian general election of 1951√ø52 elected the first Lok Sabha since India became independent in August 1947.[1][2][3] Until this point, the Indian Constituent Assembly had served as an interim legislature.

This was over four times as many votes as the second-largest party. Jawaharlal Nehru became the first democratically elected Prime Minister of the country. In the first Lok Sabha polls held in 1951, India had around 173 million voters, out of an overall population of about 360 million.[4] Voter turnout was 45.7%.[5] In the 1952 Indian general election, Ravi Narayana Reddy from Telangana stood for the People's Democratic Front, (a pseudonym for the banned Communist Party of India), and polled more votes than Jawaharlal Nehru and also the first one entering in the parliament in independent India.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Independent India went to the polls, two former cabinet colleagues of Nehru established separate political parties to challenge the INC's supremacy. While Shyama Prasad Mookerjee went on to found the Jana Sangh in October 1951, Dalit leader Dr. B. R. Ambedkar revived the Scheduled Castes Federation (which was later named the Republican Party). Other parties which started coming to the forefront included the Kisan Mazdoor Praja Parishad, whose prime mover was Acharya Kripalani; the Socialist Party, which had Ram Manohar Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan's leadership to boast of; and the Communist Party of India. However, these smaller parties were unable to make an electoral stand against the Indian National Congress.\\r\\nThe first general elections, which were conducted for 489 seats in 401 constituencies, represented 25 Indian states.

The conference was organized by Otto von Bismarck, first Chancellor of Germany; its outcome, the General Act of the Berlin Conference, can be seen as the formalization of the Scramble for Africa. The conference ushered in a period of heightened colonial activity by European powers, which eliminated or overrode most existing forms of African autonomy and self-governance.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the conference, European diplomacy treated African indigenous people in the same manner as the New World natives, forming trading relationships with the indigenous chiefs. In the early 1800s the search for ivory, which was then often used in the production of luxurious products, led many white traders further into the interior of Africa.[3] By 1870, the momentum of European intervention with Africa quickly increased, which can be seen as The Conquest of Africa.[3] With the exception of trading posts along the coasts, the continent was essentially ignored.\\r\\nIn 1876, King Leopold II of Belgium, who had previously founded the International African Society that same year, invited Henry Morton Stanley to join him in researching and 'civilising' the continent. In 1878, the International Congo Society was also formed, with more economic goals, but still closely related to the former society. Lopold secretly bought off the foreign investors in the Congo Society, which was turned to imperialistic goals, with the African Society serving primarily as a philanthropic front.\\r\\nFrom 1878 to 1885, Stanley returned to the Congo, not as a reporter but as an envoy from Lopold with the secret mission to organize what would become known as the Congo Free State. French intelligence had discovered Leopold's plans, and France quickly engaged in its own colonial exploration. In 1881, French naval officer Pierre de Brazza was dispatched to central Africa, traveled into the western Congo basin, and raised the French flag over the newly founded Brazzaville, in what is currently the Republic of Congo. Finally, Portugal, which already had a long, but essentially abandoned colonial Empire in the area through the mostly defunct proxy state Kongo Empire, also claimed the area. Its claims were based on old treaties with Spain and the Roman Catholic Church. It quickly made a treaty on 26 February 1884 with its former ally, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, to block off the Congo Society's access to the Atlantic.\\r\\nBy the early 1880s, due to many factors including diplomatic maneuvers, subsequent colonial exploration, and recognition of Africa's abundance of valuable resources such as gold, timber, land, and markets, European interest in the continent had increased dramatically. Stanley's charting of the Congo River Basin (1874√ø77) removed the last terra incognita from European maps of the continent, and delineating the areas of British, Portuguese, French, and Belgian control. The powers raced to push these rough boundaries to their furthest limits and eliminate any potential local minor powers which might prove troublesome to European competitive diplomacy.\\r\\nFrance moved to take over Tunisia, one of the last of the Barbary Pirate states, under the pretext of another piracy incident. French claims by Pierre de Brazza were quickly solidified with French taking control of today's Republic of the Congo in 1881 and Guinea in 1884. Italy became part of the Triple Alliance, upsetting Bismarck's carefully laid plans with the state and forcing Germany to become involved in Africa.\\r\\nIn 1882, realizing the geopolitical extent of Portuguese control on the coasts, but seeing penetration by France eastward across Central Africa toward Ethiopia, the Nile, and the Suez Canal, Britain saw its vital trade route through Egypt and its Indian Empire threatened. Under the pretext of the collapsed Egyptian financing and a subsequent riot, in which hundreds of Europeans and British subjects were murdered or injured, the United Kingdom intervened in nominally Ottoman Egypt. Through it, the UK also ruled over the Sudan and what would later become British Somaliland.\\r\\nOwing to the European race for colonies, Germany started launching expeditions of its own, which frightened both British and French statesmen. Hoping to quickly soothe this brewing conflict, King Leopold II convinced France and Germany that common trade in Africa was in the best interests of all three countries. Under support from the British and the initiative of Portugal, Otto von Bismarck, German Chancellor, called on representatives of 13 nations in Europe as well as the United States to take part in the Berlin Conference in 1884 to work out joint policy on the African continent.\\r\\nThe conference was opened on November 15, 1884 and continued till its closure on 26 February 1885.[4] Whilst the number of plenipotentiaries varied per nation,[5] the following 14 countries did send representatives to attend the Berlin Conference and sign the subsequent Berlin Act:\\r\\nThe conference was convened on Saturday, November 15, 1884, at Bismarck's official residence on Wilhelmstrasse (site of the Congress of Berlin six years earlier).[7] Bismarck accepted the chairmanship. The British representative was Sir Edward Malet (Ambassador to the German Empire). Henry Morton Stanley attended as a U.S. delegate.[7]\\r\\nThe General Act fixed the following points:\\r\\nThe first reference in an international act to the obligations attaching to \\"spheres of influence\\" is contained in the Berlin Act.\\r\\nThe principle of effective occupation stated that powers could acquire rights over colonial lands only if they possessed them or had \\"effective occupation\\": in other words, if they had treaties with local leaders, if they flew their flag there, and if they established an administration in the territory to govern it with a police force to keep order. The colonial power could also make use of the colony economically. This principle became important not only as a basis for the European powers to acquire territorial sovereignty in Africa, but also for determining the limits of their respective overseas possessions, as effective occupation served in some instances as a criterion for settling disputes over the boundaries between colonies. But, as the Berlin Act was limited in its scope to the lands that fronted on the African coast, European powers in numerous instances later claimed rights over lands in the interior without demonstrating the requirement of effective occupation, as articulated in Article 35 of the Final Act.\\r\\nAt the Berlin Conference of 1885, the scope of the Principle of Effective Occupation was heavily contested between Germany and France. The Germans, who were new to the continent of Africa, essentially believed that as far as the extension of power in Africa was concerned, no colonial power should have any legal right to a territory, unless the state exercised strong and effective political control, and if so, only for a limited period of time, essentially an occupational force only. However, Britain's view was that Germany was a latecomer to the continent, and was assumptively unlikely to gain any new possessions, apart from already occupied territories, which were swiftly proving to be more valuable than British-occupied territories. Given that logic, it was generally assumed by Britain and France that Germany had an interest in embarrassing the other European powers on the continent and forcing them to give up their possessions if they could not muster a strong political presence. On the other side, the United Kingdom (UK) had large territorial control on the continent and wanted to keep them while minimising its responsibilities and administrative costs. In the end, the British view prevailed.\\r\\nThe disinclination to rule what the Europeans had conquered is apparent throughout the protocols of the Berlin Conference, but especially in \\"The Principle of Effective Occupation.\\" In line with Germany and Britain's opposing views, the powers finally agreed that this could be established by a European power establishing some kind of base on the coast, from which it was free to expand into the interior. The Europeans did not believe that the rules of occupation demanded European hegemony on the ground. The Belgians originally wanted to include that \\"effective occupation\\" required provisions that \\"cause peace to be administered\\", but other powers, specifically Britain and France, had that amendment struck out of the final document.\\r\\nThis principle, along with others that were written at the Conference allowed the Europeans to conquer Africa while doing as little as possible to administer or control it. The Principle of Effective Occupation did not apply so much to the hinterlands of Africa at the time of the conference. This gave rise to \\"hinterland theory,\\" which basically gave any colonial power with coastal territory the right to claim political influence over an indefinite amount of inland territory. Since Africa was irregularly shaped, this theory caused problems and was later rejected.[11]\\r\\nThe conference provided an opportunity to channel latent European hostilities towards one another outward, provide new areas for helping the European powers expand in the face of rising American, Russian, and Japanese interests, and form constructive dialogue for limiting future hostilities. For Africans, colonialism was introduced across nearly all the continent. When African independence was regained after World War II, it was in the form of fragmented states.[12]\\r\\nThe Scramble for Africa sped up after the Conference, since even within areas designated as their sphere of influence, the European powers still had to take possession under the Principle of Effectivity. In central Africa in particular, expeditions were dispatched to coerce traditional rulers into signing treaties, using force if necessary, as for example in the case of Msiri, King of Katanga, in 1891. Bedouin and Berber ruled states in the Sahara and Sub-Sahara were overrun by the French in several wars by the beginning of World War I. The British moved up from South Africa and down from Egypt conquering states such as the Mahdist State and the Sultanate of Zanzibar and, having already defeated the Zulu Kingdom in South Africa, in 1879, moving on to subdue and dismantle the independent Boer republics of Transvaal and Orange Free State.\\r\\nWithin a few years, Africa was at least nominally divided up south of the Sahara. By 1895, the only independent states were:\\r\\nThe following states lost their independence to the British Empire roughly a decade after (see below for more information):\\r\\nBy 1902, 90% of all the land that makes up Africa was under European control.

The subsequent resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. Nearly all of mainland China was soon under its control[a] and the ROC fled to the island of Taiwan. The One-China policy advocated by both governments precluded dual representation but, amid the Cold and Korean wars, the United States and its allies opposed the replacement of the ROC at the United Nations, although they were persuaded to pressure the government of the ROC to accept international recognition of Mongolia's independence in 1961. The United Kingdom, France, and other American allies individually shifted their recognitions of China to the PRC and Albania brought annual votes to replace the ROC with the PRC, but these were defeated sinceafter General Assembly Resolution 1668a change in recognition required a two-thirds vote.\\r\\nAmid the Sino-Soviet split and Vietnam War, American President Nixon entered into negotiations with Communist Chairman Mao, initially through a secret 1971 trip undertaken by Henry Kissinger to visit Zhou Enlai. On October 25, 1971, Albania's motion to recognize the People's Republic of China as the sole legal China was passed as General Assembly Resolution 2758. It was supported by most of the communist states (including the Soviet Union) and non-aligned countries (such as India), but also by some American allies such as the United Kingdom and France. Nixon then personally visited China the next year, beginning the normalization of Sino-American relations. Since that time, the Republic of China has softened its own One-China Policy and sought international recognition. These moves have been opposed and mostly blocked by the People's Republic of China, forcing the Republic of China to join international organizations under other names. These include \\"Chinese Taipei\\" at the International Olympic Committee.\\r\\nThe Republic of China's most recent request for admission was turned down in 2007,[1] but a number of Western governmentsled by the United Statesprotested to the UN's Office of Legal Affairs to force the global body and its secretary-general to stop using the reference Taiwan is a part of China.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Republic of China used its Security Council veto only once, to stop the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations in 1955 on the grounds it recognized all of Mongolia as part of China.[5][6][7]\\r\\nAs of June 2012[update], the People's Republic of China had used its Security Council veto eight times, fewer than other countries with the veto: in 1972 to veto the admission of Bangladesh (which it recognized as a province of Pakistan), in 1973 (in conjunction with the Soviet Union) to veto a resolution on the ceasefire in the Yom Kippur War, in 1997 to veto ceasefire observers to Guatemala (which recognised the ROC as the legitimate government of China),[8] in 1999 to veto an extension of observers to the Republic of Macedonia (same),[9] in 2007 (in conjunction with Russia) to veto criticizing Myanmar (Burma) on its human rights record,[10] in 2008 (with Russia) to veto sanctions against Zimbabwe,[11] in 2011 (with Russia) to veto sanctions against Syria,[12] and in February 2012 (with Russia) to veto for the second time a draft resolution calling for foreign military intervention in Syria.[13]\\r\\nThe ROC co-founded the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in 1943 (prior to the establishment of UN)[14] and is one of four members of its policy-making Central Committee.[15] UNRRA provided supplies and services to areas under occupation by the Axis Powers. The largest project undertaken by UNRRA was the China program which had a total estimated cost of $658.4 million. UNRRA China Office was opened in Shanghai at the end of 1944, and operated until the official termination of the office on December 31, 1947. Final work and responsibilities were finished by March, 1948.[16] UNRRA cooperated with Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, led by Jiang Tingfu, to distribute relief supplies in China.[17] UNRRA functions were later transferred to several UN agencies, including the International Refugee Organization and the World Health Organization.\\r\\nPeng Chun Chang of ROC was the Vice-Chairman of United Nations Commission on Human Rights that drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[18] Eleanor Roosevelt, as the driving force behind the Declaration, recalled in her memoirs:\\r\\nDr. Chang was a pluralist and held forth in charming fashion on the proposition that there is more than one kind of ultimate reality. The Declaration, he said, should reflect more than simply Western ideas and Dr. Humphrey would have to be eclectic in his approach...at one point Dr. Chang suggested that the Secretariat might well spend a few months studying the fundamentals of Confucianism!\\r\\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the UN General Assembly as Resolution 217 A(III) on December 10, 1948, as the result of the experience of the Second World War.[19] The ROC was one of the 48 states that voted for it.\\r\\nOn February 1, 1951, after cease fire negotiations failed, United Nations General Assembly passed resolution 498 and called the intervention of the People's Republic of China in Korea an act of aggression.[20]\\r\\nAs of June 2012[update], China had sent 3,362 military personnel to 13 UN peacekeeping operations in its first dispatch of military observers to the United Nations peacekeeping operations since military team to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\\r\\nThe International Criminal Court is a permanent tribunal to prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. The Court has jurisdiction if a situation is referred to the Court by the United Nations Security Council. As of May 2013, 122 states have ratified or acceded to the Rome Statute that established the Court, but the PRC is not one of them. The PRC, as well its neighbouring rival India, has been critical of the Court.[21]\\r\\nChina ranked 7th among member states for contributing 3.93% of United Nations Peacekeeping operations budget for 2013√ø2015. United States ranked first by contributing 27.14%.[22]\\r\\nThe 1954 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).[23] The Nobel Foundation noted that UNHCR, among other contributions, was asked by UN General Assembly (Resolution 1167[24] and 1784[25]), in 1957 and again in 1962, to assist Chinese refugees in Hong Kong[26][27] whose numbers are estimated at over one million. UNHCR assistance was also given to needy refugees among the Chinese refugees in Macao, and the Tibetan refugees in India and Nepal.[23] India hosted some 110,000 Tibetan refugees as of the end of 2001.[28] UNHCR estimates that there are 15,000 Tibetans who arrived in Nepal prior to 1990 and were recognized by the Government as refugees.[29]\\r\\nThe Republic of China (ROC) was a charter member of the United Nations and one of five permanent members of the Security Council until 1971. The ROC joined the United Nations as a founding member on October 24, 1945.\\r\\nThe \\"Big Four\\" victors of World War II (Nationalist China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States) [30] were the founding members of the United Nations that drafted the United Nations Charter in 1944, which was ratified on 26 June 1945 by the representatives of 50 countries.[31] China, in recognition of its long-standing fight against aggression, was accorded the honor of being the first to sign UN Charter.[3] President Franklin Roosevelt had acknowledged China's war effort in World War II and stated his desire to allow China to \\"play its proper role in maintaining peace and prosperity\\" in the world.[32] Thus, despite opposition from other leaders, especially Winston Churchill,[33] China became a permanent member of the Security Council from its creation in 1945.\\r\\nIn 1949, the Communist Party of China won the Chinese Civil War in mainland China and established the People's Republic of China (PRC), claiming to be the sole legitimate government of China. The ROC government retreated to the island of Taiwan (which it gained control of in 1945 at the end of hostilities in WWII), Quemoy Island, and the Matsu Islands. Until 1991, the ROC also actively claimed to be the sole legitimate government of China, and during the 1950s and 1960s this claim was accepted by the United States and most of its allies. While the PRC was an ally of the Soviet Union, the U.S. sought to prevent the Communist bloc from gaining another permanent seat in the Security Council. To protest the exclusion of the PRC, Soviet representatives boycotted the UN from January to August 1950, so they didn't veto the intervention of UN military forces in Korea.\\r\\nThe ROC complained to the UN against the Soviet Union for violating the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and the United Nations Charter in 1949; as a result, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 291 and 292, referring the complaint \\"to the Interim Committee of the General Assembly for continuous examination and study\\".[34] In 1952, the United Nations General Assembly found that the Soviet Union prevented the National Government of the ROC from re-establishing Chinese authority in Manchuria after Japan surrendered, and gave military and economic aid to the Chinese Communists, who founded the PRC in 1949, against the National Government of the ROC. Resolution 505 was passed to condemn the Soviet Union with 25 countries supporting, 9 countries opposing, 24 countries abstaining, and 2 countries non-voting. The resolution also affirmed the ROC as the \\"Central Government of China\\".[35][36]\\r\\nThe ROC used its veto only once. Recognition of the Soviets' violation of their friendship treaty abrogated its recognition of Mongolia's independence. It therefore vetoed its admission into the United Nations on 13 December 1955, claiming itas Outer Mongoliato be an integral part of China.[5][6][7] Mongolia's application had been tabled at the UN on 24 June 1946, but had been blocked by Western countries, as part of a protracted Cold War dispute about the admission of new members to the UN. The General Assembly, by Resolution 918 (X) of 8 December 1955, had recommended to the Security Council that this dispute should be ended by the admission, in a single resolution, of a list of eighteen countries. On 14 December 1955, the Security Council adopted a compromise proposed by the Soviet Union, and the General Assembly, by Resolution 995 (X), admitted sixteen countries into UN, omitting Mongolia and Japan from the list.[37][38] This postponed the admission of Mongolia until 1961, when the Soviet Union agreed to lift its veto on the admission of Mauritania, in return for the admission of Mongolia. Faced with pressure from nearly all the other African countries, the ROC relented under protest. Mongolia and Mauritania were both admitted to the UN on 27 October 1961.[39] The same year, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1668 made China's representation an \\"important question\\" requiring a two-thirds majority vote to alter.\\r\\nFrom the 1960s onwards, nations friendly to the PRC, led by the People's Republic of Albania under Enver Hoxha, moved an annual resolution in the General Assembly to expel the \\"representatives of Chiang Kai-shek\\" (an implicit reference to the ROC) and permit the PRC to represent China at the UN. Every year the United States was able to assemble enough votes to block this resolution. Both sides rejected compromise proposals to allow both states to participate in the UN, based on the One-China policy.[40]\\r\\nThe admission of newly independent developing nations in the 1960s gradually turned the General Assembly from being Western-dominated to being dominated by countries sympathetic to Beijing. Not only the newly founded developing countries, but also most of the Western countries eventually decided to recognise the PRC. During the 1950s and 1960s, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden, and France shifted their recognition of China from Taipei to Beijing. In the early 1970s, Canada, Turkey, and more western countries established diplomatic relations with the PRC, and severed diplomatic relations with the ROC.\\r\\nIn a Security Council meeting on 9 February 1971, Somalia objected to the credentials of the representative of Republic of China as China representation, and ROC and the United States responded that the question of China's representation should not be dealt with in the Security Council.[41][42]\\r\\nSeeking to place more diplomatic pressure on the Soviet Union, American president Richard Nixon sent his national security advisor Henry Kissinger on two trips to the People's Republic of China in July and October 1971 (the first of which was made in secret via Pakistan) to confer with Premier Zhou Enlai, then in charge of Chinese foreign policy.[43][44][45] His trips paved the way for the groundbreaking 1972 summit between Nixon, Zhou, and Communist Party of China Chairman Mao Zedong, as well as the formalization of relations between the two countries, ending 23 years of diplomatic isolation and mutual hostility in favor of a tacit strategic anti-Soviet alliance between China and the United States.\\r\\nOn 15 July 1971, 17 UN members requested that a question of the \\"Restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations\\" be placed on the provisional agenda of the twenty-sixth session of the UN General Assembly, claiming that the PRC, a \\"founding member of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council, had since 1949 been refused by systematic maneuvers the right to occupy the seat to which it is entitled ipso jure\\". On 25 September 1971, a draft resolution, A/L.630 and Add.l and 2, was submitted by 23 states including 17 of the states which had joined in placing the question on the agenda, to \\"restore to the People's Republic of China all its rights and expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek.\\" On 29 September 1971, another draft resolution, A/L.632 and Add.l and 2, sponsored by 22 members, was proposed declaring that any proposal to deprive the Republic of China of representation was an important question under Article 18 of the UN Charter, and thus would require a two-thirds supermajority for approval. A/L.632 and Add.l and 2 was rejected on 25 October 1971 by a vote of 59 to 55, with 15 abstentions.\\r\\nSaudi Arabia submitted a proposition allowing the ROC to retain its seat at the UN and its affiliated organizations \\"until the people of the Island of Taiwan are enabled by a referendum or a plebiscite\\" under the auspices of the UN to choose among three options: continued independence as a sovereign state with a neutral status defined by a treaty recorded by the UN; a confederation with the PRC; or a federation with the PRC,[46] but was not supported by the United States.[47]\\r\\nOn 25 October 1971, the United States moved that a separate vote be taken on the provisions in the resolution \\"to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupied at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it\\" in the draft resolution. This motion would have allowed the PRC to join the UN as \\"China's representative\\",[clarification needed] while allowing the ROC to remain a regular UN member (if there had been enough votes for it). The motion was rejected by a vote of 61 to 51, with 16 abstentions. The representative of ROC made a declaration that the rejection of the 22-power draft resolution calling for a two-thirds majority was a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter which governed the expulsion of Member States and that the delegation of the Republic of China had decided not to take part in any further proceedings of the General Assembly.[41] With the support from 26 African UN Member States[48] and in accordance with Article 18 of the UN Charter,[49] the Assembly then adopted Resolution 2758, with 76 countries supporting, 35 countries opposing, 17 countries abstaining, and 3 countries non-voting, withdrawing recognition of the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek as the legitimate representative of China, and recognizing the Government of PRC as the only legitimate representative of China to the United Nations.[50][51] At a Security Council meeting on November 23, 1971, after the General Assembly passed Resolution 2758, the President of the Council and the other representatives made statements welcoming the representatives of the People's Republic of China. The ROC lost not only its Security Council seat, but any representation in the UN.[41]\\r\\nFollowing the adoption of Resolution 2758, the Republic of China was no longer represented by a Permanent Representative at the UN. In addition to losing its seat in the UN, the UN Secretary-General concluded from the resolution that the General Assembly considered Taiwan to be a province of China, and thus it does not permit the ROC to become a party treaties for which it is the depository.[52]\\r\\nIn 1993 the ROC began campaigning to rejoin the UN separately from the People's Republic of China. A number of options were considered, including seeking membership in the specialized agencies, applying for observer status, applying for full membership, or having resolution 2758 revoked to reclaim the seat of China in the UN.[53]\\r\\nEvery year from 1993√ø2006, UN member states submitted a memorandum to the UN Secretary-General requesting that the UN General Assembly consider allowing the ROC to resume participating in the United Nations.[54] This approach was chosen, rather than a formal application for membership, because it could be enacted by the General Assembly, while a membership application would need Security Council approval, where the PRC held a veto.[53] Early proposals recommended admitting the ROC with parallel representation over China, along with the People's Republic of China, pending eventual reunification, citing examples of other divided countries which had become separate UN member states, such as East and West Germany and North and South Korea. Later proposals emphasized that the ROC was a separate state, over which the PROC had no effective sovereignty. These proposed resolutions referred to the ROC under a variety of names: \\"Republic of China in Taiwan\\" (1993√ø94), \\"Republic of China on Taiwan\\" (1995√ø97, 1999√ø2002), \\"Republic of China\\" (1998), \\"Republic of China (Taiwan)\\" (2003) and \\"Taiwan\\" (2004√ø06).\\r\\nHowever, all fourteen attempts were unsuccessful as the General Assembly's General Committee declined to put the issue on the Assembly's agenda for debate, under strong opposition from the PRC.[55]\\r\\nWhile all these proposals were vague, requesting the ROC be allowed to participate in UN activities without specifying any legal mechanism, in 2007 the ROC submitted a formal application under the name \\"Taiwan\\" for full membership in the UN.[56] On September 15, 2007, over 3,000 Taiwanese Americans and their supporters rallied in front of the UN building in New York City,[57] and over 300,000 Taiwanese people rallied in Taiwan,[58] all in support of the ROC joining the UN. The ROC also won the backing of many Members of the European Parliament on this issue.[59] However, the application was rejected by the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs citing General Assembly Resolution 2758,[60] without being forwarded to the Security Council. Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon stated that:\\r\\nThe position of the United Nations is that the People's Republic of China is representing the whole of China as the sole and legitimate representative Government of China. The decision until now about the wish of the people in Taiwan to join the United Nations has been decided on that basis. The resolution (General Assembly Resolution 2758) that you just mentioned is clearly mentioning that the Government of China is the sole and legitimate Government and the position of the United Nations is that Taiwan is part of China.[61]\\r\\nResponding to the UN's rejection of its application, the ROC government has stated that Taiwan is not now nor has it ever been under the jurisdiction of the PRC, and that since General Assembly Resolution 2758 did not clarify the issue of Taiwan's representation in the UN, it does not prevent Taiwan's participation in the UN as an independent sovereign nation.[62] The ROC argued that Resolution 2758 merely transferred the UN seat from the ROC to the PRC, but did not address the issue of Taiwan's representation in the UN. The ROC government also criticized Ban for asserting that Taiwan is part of China and returning the application without passing it to the Security Council or the General Assembly,[63] contrary to UN's standard procedure (Provisional Rules of Procedure of the Security Council, Chapter X, Rule 59).[64] The ROC emphasized that the United Nations has never taken a formal stance regarding the sovereignty of Taiwan. On the other hand, the PRC government, which has stated that Taiwan is part of China and firmly opposes the application of any Taiwan authorities to join the UN either as a member or an observer, praised that UN's decision \\"was made in accordance with the UN Charter and Resolution 2758 of the UN General Assembly, and showed the UN and its member states' universal adherence to the one-China principle\\".[65] A group of UN member states put forward a draft resolution for that autumn's UN General Assembly calling on the Security Council to consider the application.[56]\\r\\nBan Ki-moon also came under fire for this statement from the United States via non-official channels. There are unconfirmed reports that Ban's comments prompted the US to restate its position regarding the status of Taiwan. A Heritage Foundation article suggests that the US may have presented a dmarche stating among others that:\\r\\nIf the UN Secretariat insists on describing Taiwan as a part of the PRC, or on using nomenclature for Taiwan that implies such status, the United States will be obliged to disassociate itself on a national basis from such position.\\"[66]\\r\\nThe Wall Street Journal criticized Ban Ki-moon for rejecting the ROC's July 2007 application and regarded Ban's interpretation of Resolution 2758 (that Taiwan was part of China) as erroneous.[67] Nevertheless, Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon's statement reflected long-standing UN convention and is mirrored in other documents promulgated by the United Nations. For example, the UN's \\"Final Clauses of Multilateral Treaties, Handbook\\", 2003 (a publication which predated his tenure in Office) states:\\r\\n[r]egarding the Taiwan Province of China, the Secretary-General follows the General Assemblys guidance incorporated in resolution 2758 (XXVI)of the General Assembly of 25 October 1971 on the restoration of the lawful rights of the Peoples Republic of China in the United Nations. The General Assembly decided to recognize the representatives of the Government of the Peoples Republic of China as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations. Hence, instruments received from the Taiwan Province of China will not be accepted by the Secretary-General in his capacity as depositary.[68]\\r\\nIn 2008, two referendums by the ROC on joining the UN failed because of low voter participation. That autumn the ROC took a new approach, with its allies submitting a resolution requesting that the \\"Republic of China (Taiwan)\\" be allowed to have \\"meaningful participation\\" in the UN specialized agencies.[69] Again the issue was not put on the Assembly's agenda when the United Nations subcommittee ruled it would not let the General Assembly consider the ROC's application to join UN activities.[55][70] Shortly after this, the United States and the European Union both expressed their support for \\"Taiwan\\" (neither recognises the ROC) to have \\"meaningful participation\\" in UN agencies that do not require statehood, such as the World Health Organization.[71] In May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the World Health Organization to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name \\"Chinese Taipei\\". This was the ROC's first participation in an event organized by a UN-affiliated agency since 1971, as a result of the improved cross-strait relations since Ma Ying-jeou became the President of the Republic of China a year before.[72]\\r\\nIn 2009, the ROC chose not to bring the issue of its participation in the UN up for debate at the General Assembly for the first time since it began the campaign in 1993.[73][74]\\r\\nA 2013 United States congressional report describes US bipartisan \\"One China\\" policy as follows:\\r\\nThe United States has its own \\"one China\\" policy (vs. the PRC's \\"one China\\" principle) and position on Taiwan's status. Not recognizing the PRC's claim over Taiwan nor Taiwan as a sovereign state, U.S. policy has considered Taiwan's status as unsettled.[75]\\r\\nThe Constitution of the Republic of China still claims to be the government of the whole of China. Taiwan independence supporters say that the non-assertion of the claim is mainly due to PRC's public statement that any attempts to change the ROC constitution is interpreted as declaring independence, which will lead to \\"military actions\\" from the PRC.[citation needed] Given the PRC's attitude, even having the General Assembly admit the ROC or \\"Taiwan\\" as an observer, as with Palestine, would be problematic; the case of Palestine is different from that of the ROC because of the UN's commitment to a two-state solution for the Israeli√øPalestinian conflict but not for the Taiwan issue.\\r\\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC), commonly called China today, was admitted into the UN in 1971 on the 21st time of voting on its application. The PRC was admitted into the UN on a vote of 76 in favor, 35 opposed, and 17 abstentions.[76] In contrast with Republic of China's tactics to remain in the UN for past years, the PRC sees its ideological differences and national interests above international obligations enshrined by the United Nations as its national agenda to the UN in the subsequent voting records henceforth, especially when military conflicts arise for international intervention on some of world's most oppressive and totalitarian regimes or for United Nations peacekeeping forces to take the duties, the PRC will vote supporting the opposite side of United States of America or abstaining.[77][78][not in citation given]\\r\\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s that the United States' close ally, Pakistan, especially under the presidency of Ayub Khan, was carrying out messenger diplomacy to the PRC's entry into the UN by the United States' diplomacy to People's Republic of China in the time of Sino-Soviet split. This involved secret visits by American officials to the PRC. In 1971, Henry Kissinger made a secret visit to the PRC through Pakistan.[citation needed]\\r\\nSince the early 1980s, and particularly since 1989, by means of vigorous monitoring and the strict maintenance of standards, United Nations human rights organizations have encouraged China to move away from its insistence on the principle of noninterference, to take part in resolutions critical of human rights conditions in other nations, and to accept the applicability to itself of human rights norms and UN procedures. Even though China has continued to suppress political dissidents at home, and appears at times resolutely defiant of outside pressure to reform, Ann Kent argues that it has gradually begun to implement some international human rights standards.[79] On human rights issues, the PRC has been increasingly influential by the bargaining of its robust Macroeconomics growth[80] for the domestic social equality.[81] In 1995, they won 43 percent of the votes in the General Assembly; by 2006 they won 82 percent.[82]\\r\\nIn the 1991 Gulf War resolution, the PRC abstained, and it voted for the ultimatum to Iraq in the period leading up to the 2003 War in Iraq. Most observers believe that the PRC would have abstained had a resolution authorizing force against Iraq in 2003 reached the Security Council.[83][84]\\r\\nWhen an enlargement of the Security Council was discussed in 1995, China encouraged African states to demand their seats as a counter-move to Japan's ambitions, thereby nullified the Japanese initiative.[82]","input":"When did china become permanent member of un?"},{"output":"Nat Hickey","context":"This is a list of oldest and youngest National Basketball Association players. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a men's professional basketball league in North America. The NBA was founded in 1946 as the Basketball Association of America (BAA).[1] The league adopted its current name at the start of the 1949√ø50?season when it merged with the National Basketball League (NBL).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest person ever to play in the NBA was Nat Hickey, a coach who activated himself as a player for a game two days before his 46th birthday. The youngest player ever to play in the NBA was Andrew Bynum, who played his first game six days after his 18th birthday. The oldest active player is Atlanta Hawks guard/forward Vince Carter, who is currently 41 years old. The youngest active player in the NBA is Indiana Pacers forward/center Ike Anigbogu, the 47th pick in the 2017 NBA draft, who is currently 19 years old and became the second college player to go from one year of college to the NBA while still playing at 18 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest player ever to play in the NBA was Nat Hickey who played one game in the 1947√ø48 season when he was 45 years and 363 days old.[3] Hickey, who was coaching the Providence Steamrollers at the time, decided to activate himself and played in a game for the Steamrollers. In his first game as a player for the Steamrollers, he missed all six of his shot attempts and only scored two points from three free throw attempts; he only played in one more game before retiring as a player two days shy of his 46th birthday.[4] The second-oldest player is Kevin Willis. Willis, who had played 20 seasons (excluding the 1988√ø89 season he missed due to injury) in the league before he sat out the 2005√ø06 season and earned a contract with the Dallas Mavericks on April 2, 2007.[5] He then played 5 games for the Mavericks at the age of 44.[4] The third-oldest player is Hall of Famer Robert Parish. Parish, who starred with the Boston Celtics in the 1980s, played his last season with the Chicago Bulls at the age of 43.[6] He played in 1,611 regular season games during his 21-year career, more than any other player in NBA history.[4] When the Bulls won the 1997 Finals, Parish became the oldest player ever to win the NBA championship. There are currently 27 players who played in the NBA after they turned 40.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest active player is Vince Carter, who is now 41 years old. Carter played his first game in 1999 and is about to play his 21th season. Carter, along with Manu Gin‹ábili, Jason Terry, Dirk Nowitzki, and Metta World Peace are the only players who were born in 1979 or earlier and are still active and under contract with an NBA team. Ten players total, however, were born in 1980 or earlier and still play in the NBA.\\r\\n\\r\\nNBA players usually come from U.S. college basketball. In the past, a college player had to complete his four-year college eligibility before he could enter the league through the NBA Draft or as a free agent. In the 1970s, the league began to allow college underclassmen and high school players to enter the league. However, the trend of drafting high school players only began in the mid 1990s. This has led to more younger players entering the league directly after high school graduation. In 2005, the league and the players' union agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement that includes a minimum age limit which requires that players who wish to enter the league must be at least 19 years old on December 31 of the year of the draft, and at least one year removed from high school. International players who did not play college basketball also have to be at least 19 years old on the same date to be able to play in the NBA.[43] Despite a trend toward drafting younger players, the NBA has a higher average age than it had in the 1980s.[44] However, since the NBA introduced the minimum age limit in 2005, the league's average age has decreased in the past few seasons.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youngest player to ever play in the NBA was Andrew Bynum who played his first game at the age of 18 years and 6 days old.[46] Bynum, who was also the youngest player ever selected in the NBA Draft, went into the NBA straight out of high school.[47] Jermaine O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, both drafted in 1996, were the second- and third-youngest players. Serbian Darko Mili?i? was the youngest player ever to play in an NBA Finals game.[48] He played for the Detroit Pistons in Game 3 of the 2004 Finals at the age of 18 years and 356 days old. The Pistons won the 2004 Finals and Mili?i? became the youngest player ever to win the NBA championship, being only five days away from his 19th birthday at the time. There are currently 27 players who played in the NBA before they turned 19. Nineteen of them came to the league straight out of high school, while 6 of them are international players who never played basketball in the U.S. high schools or colleges before they entered the NBA, and two more players ended up playing only a year of college before entering the NBA.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youngest active player in the NBA is Ike Anigbogu. As a result of the NBA's latest updates on their scheduling policy, he became the second college player to play in the NBA at 18 years old on October 20 against the Portland Trail Blazers. He now joins Devin Booker as the only other player to go from a year of college to the NBA while remaining 18 years old throughout the process. Coincidentally, both of them played their first NBA games at the exact same age of 18 years, 363 days old in order to start their official NBA careers as players of the league, and their first games played would be the only time they'd play in the NBA as 18-year-olds.","input":"Who is the oldest nba player to play?"},{"output":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","context":"Harry Potter is a British-American film series based on the Harry Potter novels by author J. K. Rowling. The series is distributed by Warner Bros. and consists of eight fantasy films, beginning with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) and culminating with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows √ø Part 2 (2011).[2][3] A spin-off prequel series will consist of five films, starting with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016), marking the beginning of the Wizarding World shared media franchise.[4]\\r\\nThe series was mainly produced by David Heyman, and stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson as the three leading characters: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. Four directors worked on the series: Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuar‹án, Mike Newell, and David Yates.[5] Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplay for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007), while the remaining films had their screenplays written by Steve Kloves. Production took place over ten years, with the main story arc following Harry Potter's quest to overcome his arch-enemy Lord Voldemort.[6]\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final novel in the series, was adapted into two feature-length parts.[7] Part 1 was released in November 2010, and Part 2 was released in July 2011.[8][9]\\r\\nSix of the series' eight films are among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time, with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows √ø Part 2, the highest-grossing film in the series and one of 31 films to gross over $1 billion, ranking at number eight.[10] Without inflation adjustment, it is the second highest-grossing film series with $7.7 billion in worldwide receipts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in 1997, film producer David Heyman's London offices received a copy of the first book in what would become Rowling's series of seven Harry Potter novels. The book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was relegated to a low-priority bookshelf, where it was discovered by a secretary who read it and gave it to Heyman with a positive review. Consequently, Heyman, who had originally disliked \\"the rubbish title\\", read the book himself. Highly impressed by Rowling's work, he began the process that led to one of the most successful cinematic franchises of all time.[11]\\r\\nHeyman's enthusiasm led to Rowling's 1999 sale of the film rights for the first four Harry Potter books to Warner Bros. for a reported S1 million (US$2,000,000).[12] A demand Rowling made was that the principal cast be kept strictly British, allowing nevertheless for the inclusion of many Irish actors, such as Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where characters from the book are specified as such.[13] Rowling was hesitant to sell the rights because she \\"didn't want to give them control over the rest of the story\\" by selling the rights to the characters, which would have enabled Warner Bros. to make non-author-written sequels.[14]\\r\\nAlthough Steven Spielberg initially negotiated to direct the first film, he declined the offer.[15] Spielberg wanted the adaptation to be an animated film, with American actor Haley Joel Osment providing Harry Potter's voice.[16][not in citation given] Spielberg contended that, in his opinion, there was every expectation of profit in making the film. He claims that making money would have been like \\"shooting ducks in a barrel. It's just a slam dunk. It's just like withdrawing a billion dollars and putting it into your personal bank accounts. There's no challenge\\".[17] In the \\"Rubbish\\" Bin section of her website, Rowling maintains that she had no role in choosing directors for the films, writing \\"Anyone who thinks I could (or would) have 'veto-ed' him [Spielberg] needs their Quick-Quotes Quill serviced.\\"[18]\\r\\nAfter Spielberg left, conversations began with other directors, including Chris Columbus, Jonathan Demme, Terry Gilliam, Mike Newell, Alan Parker, Wolfgang Petersen, Rob Reiner, Tim Robbins, Brad Silberling, and Peter Weir.[19] Petersen and Reiner both pulled out of the running in March 2000.[20] It was then narrowed down to Columbus, Gilliam, Parker, and Silberling.[21] Rowling's first choice was Terry Gilliam.[22] However, on 28 March 2000 Columbus was appointed as director of the film, with Warner Bros. citing his work on other family films such as Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire as influences for their decision.[23]\\r\\nHarry Potter is the kind of timeless literary achievement that comes around once in a lifetime. Since the books have generated such a passionate following across the world, it was important to us to find a director that has an affinity for both children and magic. I can't think of anyone more ideally suited for this job than Chris [Columbus].\\r\\nSteve Kloves was selected to write the screenplay for the first film. He described adapting the book as \\"tough\\" since it did not \\"lend itself to adaptation as well as the next two books\\". Kloves was sent a \\"raft\\" of synopses of books proposed as film adaptations, with Harry Potter being the only one that jumped out at him. He went out and bought the book, becoming an instant fan. When speaking to Warner Bros. he stated that the film had to be British and true to the characters.[24] David Heyman was confirmed to produce the film.[23] Rowling received a large amount of creative control for the film, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.[25]\\r\\nWarner Bros. had initially planned to release the first film over the 4 July 2001 weekend, making for such a short production window that several of the originally proposed directors had withdrawn themselves from contention. Eventually, due to time constraints, the date was put back to 16 November 2001.[26]\\r\\nIn 2000, after a seven-month search, lead actor Daniel Radcliffe was discovered by producer David Heyman and writer Steve Kloves seated just behind them in a theatre. In Heyman's own words, \\"There sitting behind me was this boy with these big blue eyes. It was Dan Radcliffe. I remember my first impressions: He was curious and funny and so energetic. There was real generosity too, and sweetness. But at the same time he was really voracious and with hunger for knowledge of whatever kind.\\"[11]\\r\\nRadcliffe had already established himself as an actor in the 1999 BBC television production of David Copperfield in which he played the title role's childhood years. Heyman persuaded Radcliffe's parents to allow him to audition for the part of Harry Potter, which involved Radcliffe being filmed.[11] (This screen test footage was released via the first set of Ultimate Editions in 2009.)[27] Rowling was enthusiastic after viewing Radcliffe's filmed test, saying she didn't think there was a better choice for the part of Harry Potter.[11][28]\\r\\nAlso in 2000, the then unknown British actors Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were selected from thousands of auditioning children to play the roles of Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, respectively. Their only previous acting experience was in school plays. Grint was eleven years old and Watson ten at the time they were cast.[29]\\r\\nLos Angeles Times writer Geoff Boucher, who conducted the above-mentioned interview with Heyman, added that the casting of the three major roles \\"is especially impressive in hindsight. The trio's selection was arguably one of the best show-business decisions over the past decade... they have shown admirable grace and steadiness in the face of teen superstardom.\\"[11][28]\\r\\nFilming of the series began at Leavesden Studios, Hertfordshire, England, in September 2000 and ended in December 2010, with post-production on the final film lasting until summer 2011.[6] Leavesden Studios was the main base for filming Harry Potter, and it opened to the public as a studio tour in 2012 (renamed as Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden).[30]\\r\\nDavid Heyman produced all the films in the series with his production company Heyday Films, while David Barron joined the series as an executive producer on Chamber of Secrets and Goblet of Fire. Barron was later appointed producer on the last four films. Chris Columbus was an executive producer on the first two films alongside Mark Radcliffe and Michael Barnathan, but he became a producer on the third film alongside Heyman and Radcliffe. Other executive producers include Tanya Seghatchian and Lionel Wigram. J. K. Rowling, author of the series, was asked to become a producer on Goblet of Fire but declined. She subsequently accepted the role on the two-part Deathly Hallows.[31]\\r\\nHeyday Films and Columbus' company 1492 Pictures collaborated with Duncan Henderson Productions in 2001, Miracle Productions in 2002, and P of A Productions in 2004. Even though Prisoner of Azkaban was the final film produced by 1492 Pictures, Heyday Films continued with the franchise and collaborated with Patalex IV Productions in 2005. The sixth film in the series, Half-Blood Prince, was the most expensive film to produce as of 2009[update].\\r\\nWarner Bros. split the seventh and final novel in the series, Deathly Hallows, into two cinematic parts. The two parts were filmed back-to-back from early 2009 to summer 2010, with the completion of reshoots taking place on 21 December 2010; this marked the end of filming Harry Potter. Heyman stated that Deathly Hallows was \\"shot as one film\\" but released in two feature-length parts.[32]\\r\\nTim Burke, the visual effects supervisor of the series, said of the production on Harry Potter, \\"It was this huge family; I think there were over 700 people working at Leavesden, an industry in itself.\\" David Heyman said, \\"When the first film opened, no way did I think we'd make eight films. That didn't seem feasible until after we'd done the fourth.\\" Nisha Parti, the production consultant on the first film, said that Heyman \\"made the first film very much the way he felt the studio Warner Bros. wanted to make it.\\" After the film's success, Heyman was given \\"more freedom\\".[33]\\r\\nOne of the aims of the filmmakers from the beginning of production was to develop the maturity of the films. Chris Columbus stated, \\"We realised that these movies would get progressively darker. Again, we didn't know how dark but we realised that as the kids get older, the movies get a little edgier and darker.\\"[34] This transpired with the succeeding three directors who would work on the series in the following years, with the films beginning to deal with issues such as death, betrayal, prejudice, and political corruption as the series developed narratively and thematically.[5][35]\\r\\nAfter Chris Columbus had finished working on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, he was hired to direct the second film, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. The production started within a week after the release of the first film. Columbus was set to direct all entries in the series,[36] but he did not want to return for the third film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, claiming he was \\"burned out\\".[37] He moved to the position of producer, while Alfonso Cuar‹án was approached for the role of director. He was initially nervous about directing the instalment since he had not read any of the books or seen the films. After reading the series, he changed his mind and signed on to direct since he had immediately connected to the story.[38]\\r\\nBecause Cuar‹án decided not to direct the fourth instalment, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a new director had to be selected.[39] Mike Newell was chosen to direct the film, but he declined to direct the next film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which was given to David Yates, who also directed Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, becoming the only director to helm more than one film since Chris Columbus.\\r\\nChris Columbus said his vision of the first two films was of a \\"golden storybook, an old-fashioned look\\", while Alfonso Cuar‹án changed the visual tone of the series, desaturated the colour palette, and expanded the landscape around Hogwarts.[34][39] Mike Newell decided to direct the fourth film as a \\"paranoid thriller\\", while David Yates wanted to \\"bring a sense of jeopardy and character to the world\\".[40][41] Cuar‹án, Newell, and Yates have said that their challenge was striking a balance between making the films according to their individual vision, while working within a cinematic world already established by Columbus.[39][40][41]\\r\\nDavid Heyman commented on the \\"generosity of the directors\\" by revealing that \\"Chris spent time with Alfonso, Alfonso spent time with Mike and Mike spent time with David, showing him an early cut of the film, talking through what it means to be a director and how they went about [making the films].\\"[42]\\r\\nDavid Heyman also said, \\"I suppose Chris Columbus was the most conservative choice from the studio's point of view. But he expressed real passion.\\"[33] Producer Tanya Seghatchian said they were \\"more adventurous\\" in choosing a director for the third film and went straight to Alfonso Cuar‹án.[33] Mike Newell became the first British director of the series when he was chosen for the fourth film; Newell was considered to direct the first film before he dropped out.[33] David Yates directed the final films after David Heyman thought him capable of handling the edgy, emotional, and political material of the later novels.[43]\\r\\nAll the directors have been supportive of each other. Chris Columbus praised the character development in the films, while Alfonso Cuar‹án admired the \\"quiet poetry\\" of David Yates' films.[34][39] Mike Newell noted that each director had a different heroism, and David Yates views the first four films \\"respectfully and enjoy[s] them.\\"[40][41] Daniel Radcliffe said Yates \\"took the charm of the films that Chris made and the visual flair of everything that Alfonso did and the thoroughly British, bombastic nature of the film directed by Mike Newell\\" and added \\"his own sense\\" of realism.[44]\\r\\nSteve Kloves wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film, which was penned by Michael Goldenberg. Kloves had direct assistance from J.K. Rowling, though she allowed him what he described as \\"tremendous elbow room\\". Rowling asked Kloves to remain faithful to the spirit of the books; thus, the plot and tone of each film and its corresponding book are virtually the same, albeit with some changes and omissions for purposes of cinematic style, time, and budget constraints. Michael Goldenberg also received input from Rowling during his adaptation of the fifth novel; Goldenberg was originally considered to adapt the first novel before the studio chose Kloves.[45]\\r\\nIn a 2010 interview, David Heyman briefly explained the book-to-film transition. He commented on Rowling's involvement in the series, stating that she understood that \\"books and films are different\\" and was \\"the best support\\" a producer could have. Rowling had overall approval on the scripts, which were viewed and discussed by the director and the producers. Heyman also said that Kloves was the \\"key voice\\" in the process of adapting the novels and that certain aspects from the books needed to have been excluded from the scripts due to the filmmakers' decision to keep the main focus on Harry's journey as a character, which would ultimately give the films a defined structure. Heyman mentioned that some fans \\"don't necessarily understand the adaptation process\\" and that the filmmakers would have loved to \\"have everything\\" from the books in the films but noted that it was not possible since they had \\"neither time nor cinematic structure\\" to do so. He finished by saying that adapting a novel to the screen is \\"a really considered process.\\"[46]\\r\\nBecause the films were being made as the novels were being published, the filmmakers had no idea of the story's outcome until the release of the final novel in 2007. Kloves spoke of his relationship with Rowling when adapting the novels by saying, \\"The thing is about Jo, which is remarkable for someone who had no experience with the filmmaking process, was her intuition. We had a conversation the very first day I met her where she said, 'I know the movies can't be the books... because I know what's coming and it's impossible to fully dramatise on screen what I'm going to write. But I just ask you to be true to the characters; that's all I care about.'\\"[47] Kloves also said, \\"I don't know what compelled me to say this [to Rowling], but I said, 'I've just got to warn you my favourite character is not Harry. My favourite character is Hermione.' And I think for some weird reason, from that moment on, she sort of trusted me.\\"[47]\\r\\nAside from the three lead actors, other notable cast members include Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, and Dame Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall. Richard Harris, who played the role of Professor Albus Dumbledore, died on 25 October 2002 causing the role to be re-cast for the third instalment, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. David Heyman and director Alfonso Cuar‹án chose Michael Gambon to portray the character of Dumbledore, which he did for all succeeding films. Notable recurring cast members include Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, Warwick Davis as Filius Flitwick, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody, Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley, Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley, Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew, David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Emma Thompson as Sybill Trelawney, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, and Julie Walters as Molly Weasley.\\r\\nThe series has seen many returning crew members from various departments, including Tim Burke, visual effects supervisor; Peter Doyle, digital film colourist; Nick Dudman, make-up and creature effects designer; David Holmes, stunt double; Amanda Knight, make-up artist; Stephenie McMillan, set designer; Greg Powell, stunt coordinator; Jany Temime, costume designer; and Fiona Weir, casting director.\\r\\nThe production designer for all eight films is Stuart Craig. Assisted by Stephenie McMillan, Craig has created iconic sets pieces including the Ministry of Magic, the Chamber of Secrets, Malfoy Manor, and the layout for the CGI Horcrux Cave. Because the novels were being published as the films were being made, Craig was required to rebuild some sets for future films and alter the design of Hogwarts.[50]\\r\\nHe said, \\"In the early days, every time you saw the exterior of Hogwarts, it was a physical miniature,\\" which was made by craftsmen and occupied a large sound stage.[52][53] \\"We ended up with a profile of how Hogwarts looked, a skyline that actually I didn't design, and it wasn't always satisfactory, and as all the novels got written and movies got made there were new requirements [for buildings]. The [Astronomy Tower] definitely wasn't there originally, and so we were able to add that substantial piece. And in the last film, we needed an arena for the battle for Hogwarts √ø the big courtyard outside doubled in size, and if you look at the first movie it wasn't there at all. There were quite some liberties taken with the continuity of Hogwarts.\\"[54] In the last film, Craig used a digital model instead of a miniature to \\"embrace the latest technology\\".[53]\\r\\nOn the method of creating the sets, Craig said he often started by sketching ideas onto a blank sheet of paper.[55] Stephanie McMillan also said that \\"each film always had plenty of new challenges,\\" citing the changes in visual style between directors and cinematographers as an example, along with the developing story in the novels. Due to J.K. Rowling's descriptions of various settings in the novels, Craig noted his \\"responsibility was to place it together\\".[56]\\r\\nCraig commented on his experience working in the studio environment: \\"I'm the production designer, but on a big movie like Harry Potter I may be responsible for 30 to 35 people; from the supervising art director, and a team of art directors and assistants, to draughtsmen and junior draughtsmen, and then on to model makers, sculptors and scenic artists.\\" He said, \\"Ten years ago, all the Harry Potter drawings were done in pencil. I would take my roughs and plans and sections and give them to a professional architectural illustrator, who would create concept art using pencil and colour wash on watercolour paper.\\" He said the process changed slightly throughout the years due to, what he called, the \\"digital revolution\\" of making films.[53]\\r\\nWhen filming of the series was completed, some of Craig's sets had to be rebuilt or transported for them to be displayed at the Warner Bros. studio tour.[52]\\r\\nSix directors of photography worked on the series: John Seale on the first film, Roger Pratt on the second and fourth, Michael Seresin on the third, S?awomir Idziak on the fifth, Bruno Delbonnel on the sixth, and Eduardo Serra on the seventh and eighth. Delbonnel was considered to return for both parts of Deathly Hallows, but he declined, stating that he was \\"scared of repeating\\" himself.[57] Delbonnel's cinematography in Half-Blood Prince gained the series its only Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography. As the series progressed, each cinematographer faced the challenge of shooting and lighting older sets (which had been around since the first few films) in unique and different ways.[58] Chris Columbus said the series' vivid colouring decreased as each film was made.[34][59]\\r\\nMichael Seresin commented on the change of visual style from the first two films to Prisoner of Azkaban: \\"The lighting is moodier, with more shadowing and cross-lighting.\\" Seresin and Alfonso Cuar‹án moved away from the strongly coloured and brightly lit cinematography of the first two films, with dimmer lighting and a more muted colour palette being utilised for the succeeding five films.[60] After comparing a range of digital cameras with 35?mm film, Bruno Delbonnel decided to shoot the sixth movie, Half-Blood Prince, on film rather than the increasingly popular digital format. This decision was kept for the two-part Deathly Hallows with Eduardo Serra, who said that he preferred to work with film because it was \\"more technically accurate and dependable\\".[61]\\r\\nBecause the majority of Deathly Hallows takes place in various settings away from Hogwarts, David Yates wanted to \\"shake things up\\" by using different photographic techniques such as using hand-held cameras and very wide camera lenses.[62] Eduardo Serra said, \\"Sometimes we are combining elements shot by the main unit, a second unit, and the visual effects unit. You have to know what is being captured √ø colours, contrast, et cetera √ø with mathematical precision.\\" He noted that with Stuart Craig's \\"amazing sets and the story\\", the filmmakers could not \\"stray too far from the look of the previous Harry Potter films.\\"[61][63]\\r\\nAlong with continuous changes in cinematographers, there have been five film editors to work in post-production on the series: Richard Francis-Bruce edited the first instalment, Peter Honess the second, Steven Weisberg the third, Mick Audsley the fourth, and Mark Day films five through eight.\\r\\nThe Harry Potter series has had four composers. John Williams scored the first three films: Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, and Prisoner of Azkaban. However, the second entry was adapted and conducted by William Ross due to Williams's conflicting commitments. Williams also created Hedwig's Theme, which is used in every film in the series.\\r\\nAfter Williams left the series to pursue other projects, Patrick Doyle scored the fourth entry, Goblet of Fire, which was directed by Mike Newell, with whom Doyle had worked previously. In 2006, Nicholas Hooper started work on the score to Order of the Phoenix by reuniting with director David Yates. Hooper also composed the soundtrack to Half-Blood Prince but decided not to return for the final films.\\r\\nIn January 2010, Alexandre Desplat was confirmed to compose the score for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows √ø Part 1.[64] The film's orchestration started in the summer with Conrad Pope, the orchestrator on the first three Harry Potter films, collaborating with Desplat. Pope commented that the music \\"reminds one of the old days.\\"[65] Desplat returned to score Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows √ø Part 2 in 2011.[66]\\r\\nDirector David Yates stated that he wanted John Williams to return to the series for the final installment, but their schedules did not align due to the urgent demand for a rough cut of the film.[67] The final recording sessions of Harry Potter took place on 27 May 2011 at Abbey Road Studios with the London Symphony Orchestra, orchestrator Conrad Pope, and composer Alexandre Desplat.[68]\\r\\nDoyle, Hooper, and Desplat introduced their own personal themes to their respective soundtracks, while keeping a few of John Williams's themes.\\r\\nThere have been many visual effects companies to work on the Harry Potter series. Some of these include Rising Sun Pictures, Double Negative, Cinesite, Framestore, and Industrial Light & Magic. The latter three have worked on all the films in the series, while Double Negative and Rising Sun Pictures began their commitments with Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire, respectively. Framestore contributed by developing many memorable creatures and sequences to the series.[69] Cinesite was involved in producing both miniature and digital effects for the films.[70] Producer David Barron said that \\"Harry Potter created the UK effects industry as we know it. On the first film, all the complicated visual effects were done on the [US] west coast. But on the second, we took a leap of faith and gave much of what would normally be given to Californian vendors to UK ones. They came up trumps.\\" Tim Burke, the visual effects supervisor, said many studios \\"are bringing their work to UK effects companies. Every facility is fully booked, and that wasn't the case before Harry Potter. That's really significant.\\"[33]\\r\\nOn 12 June 2010, filming of the Deathly Hallows √ø Part 1 and Deathly Hallows √ø Part 2 was completed with actor Warwick Davis stating on his Twitter account, \\"The end of an Era √ø today is officially the last day of principal photography on 'Harry Potter' √ø ever. I feel honoured to be here as the director shouts cut for the very last time. Farewell Harry & Hogwarts, it's been magic!\\".[71] However, reshoots of the epilogue scene were confirmed to begin in the winter of 2010. The filming was completed on 21 December 2010, marking the official closure of filming the Harry Potter franchise.[72] Exactly four years earlier on that day, author J. K. Rowling's official website revealed the title of the final novel in the series √ø Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[73]\\r\\nHarry Potter is an orphaned boy brought up by his unkind Muggle (non-magical) aunt and uncle. At the age of eleven, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid informs him that he is actually a wizard and that his parents were murdered by an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Voldemort also attempted to kill one-year-old Harry on the same night, but his killing curse mysteriously rebounded and reduced him to a weak and helpless form. Harry became extremely famous in the Wizarding World as a result. Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and learns about magic. During the year, Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger become entangled in the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone which is being kept within the school.\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione return to Hogwarts for their second year, which proves to be more challenging than the last. The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, leaving students and ghosts petrified by an unleashed monster. Harry must face up to claims that he is the heir of Salazar Slytherin (founder of the Chamber), learn that he can speak Parseltongue, and also discover the properties of a mysterious diary, only to find himself trapped within the Chamber of Secrets itself.\\r\\nHarry Potter's third year sees the boy wizard, along with his friends, attending Hogwarts School once again. Professor R. J. Lupin joins the staff as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, while convicted murderer Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban Prison. The Ministry of Magic entrusts the Dementors of Azkaban to guard Hogwarts from Black. Harry learns more about his past and his connection with the escaped prisoner.\\r\\nDuring Harry's fourth year, Hogwarts plays host to a legendary event: the Triwizard Tournament. Three European schools participate in the tournament, with three 'champions' representing each school in the deadly tasks. The Goblet of Fire chooses Fleur Delacour, Viktor Krum, and Cedric Diggory to compete against each other. However, curiously, Harry's name is also produced from the Goblet thus making him a fourth champion, which results in a terrifying encounter with a reborn Lord Voldemort.\\r\\nHarry's fifth year begins with him being attacked by Dementors in Little Whinging. Later, he finds out that the Ministry of Magic is in denial of Lord Voldemort's return. Harry is also beset by disturbing and realistic nightmares, while Professor Umbridge, a representative of Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Harry becomes aware that Voldemort is after a prophecy which reveals: \\"neither can live while the other survives\\". The rebellion involving the students of Hogwarts, secret organisation Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry of Magic, and the Death Eaters begins.\\r\\nIn Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters are increasing their terror upon the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore persuades his old friend Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as a professor as there is a vacancy to fill. There is a more important reason, however, for Slughorn's return. While in a Potions lesson, Harry takes possession of a strangely annotated school textbook, inscribed 'This is the property of the Half-Blood Prince'. Draco Malfoy struggles to carry out a deed presented to him by Voldemort. Meanwhile, Dumbledore and Harry secretly work together to discover the method on how to destroy the Dark Lord once and for all.\\r\\nAfter unexpected events at the end of the previous year, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are entrusted with a quest to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's secret to immortality √ø the Horcruxes. It is supposed to be their final year at Hogwarts, but the collapse of the Ministry of Magic and Voldemort's rise to power prevents them from attending. The trio undergo a long journey with many obstacles in their path including Death Eaters, Snatchers, the mysterious Deathly Hallows, and Harry's connection with the Dark Lord's mind becoming ever stronger.\\r\\nAfter destroying one Horcrux and discovering the significance of the three Deathly Hallows, Harry, Ron and Hermione continue to seek the other Horcruxes in an attempt to destroy Voldemort, who has now obtained the powerful Elder Wand. The Dark Lord discovers Harry's hunt for Horcruxes and launches an attack on Hogwarts School, where the trio return for one last stand against the dark forces that threaten the Wizarding and Muggle worlds.\\r\\nThe rights for the first four novels in the series were sold to Warner Bros. for S1,000,000 by J.K. Rowling. After the release of the fourth book in July 2000, the first film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was released on 16 November 2001. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $90 million in the United States alone, which set a record opening worldwide. The succeeding three motion picture adaptations followed suit in financial success, while garnering positive reviews from fans and critics. The fifth film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, was released by Warner Bros. on 11 July 2007 in English-speaking countries, except for the UK and Ireland, which released the movie on 12 July.[74] The sixth, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was released on 15 July 2009 to critical acclaim and finished its theatrical run ranked as the number two grossing film of 2009 on the worldwide charts.\\r\\nThe final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was split into two cinematic parts: Part 1 was released on 19 November 2010, and Part 2, the conclusion to both the final film and the series, was released on 15 July 2011.[75] Part 1 was originally scheduled to be released in 3D and 2D,[76] but due to a delay in the 3D conversion process, Warner Bros. released the film only in 2D and IMAX cinemas. However, Part 2 was released in 2D and 3D cinemas as originally planned.[77]\\r\\nThe television broadcast rights for the series in the United States are currently held by Disney√øABC Domestic Television, which typically airs the films on the Freeform network. Disney's contract is expected to end in June 2018, after which, NBCUniversal will take control of the rights, after their deal with Warner Bros. was made in August 2016.[78] The film series has accrued nearly 1.3 billion viewings since their television debutthe highest-watched franchise in television broadcast history.[79]\\r\\nAll the films have been a success financially and critically, making the franchise one of the major Hollywood \\"tent-poles\\" akin to James Bond, Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean. The series is noted by audiences for growing visually darker and more mature as each film was released.[34][80][81][82][83] However, opinions of the films generally divide book fans, with some preferring the more faithful approach of the first two films and others preferring the more stylised character-driven approach of the later films.\\r\\nSome also feel the series has a \\"disjointed\\" feel due to the changes in directors, as well as Michael Gambon's interpretation of Albus Dumbledore differing from that of Richard Harris. Author J. K. Rowling has been constantly supportive of the films,[84][85][86] and evaluated Deathly Hallows as her favourite one in the series. She wrote on her website of the changes in the book-to-film transition, \\"It is simply impossible to incorporate every one of my storylines into a film that has to be kept under four hours long. Obviously films have restrictions √ø novels do not have constraints of time and budget; I can create dazzling effects relying on nothing but the interaction of my own and my readers' imaginations\\".[87]\\r\\nAt the 64th British Academy Film Awards in February 2011, J. K. Rowling, David Heyman, David Barron, David Yates, Alfonso Cuar‹án, Mike Newell, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson collected the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema for the series.[105][106]\\r\\nIn addition, the American Film Institute recognised the entire series with a Special Award at the American Film Institute Awards in 2011. Special awards \\"are given to outstanding achievements in the moving image that do not fit into AFI's criteria for the other honorees.\\" [107] In its press release, the Institute referred to the films as \\"a landmark series; eight films that earned the trust of a generation who wished for the beloved books of J.K. Rowling to come to life on the silver screen. The collective wizardry of an epic ensemble gave us the gift of growing older with Harry, Ron and Hermione as the magic of Hogwarts sprung from the films and into the hearts and minds of Muggles around the world.\\" [107]\\r\\nHarry Potter was also recognised by the BAFTA Los Angeles Britannia Awards, with David Yates winning the Britannia Award for Artistic Excellence in Directing for his four Harry Potter films.[108][109]\\r\\nSix of the eight films were nominated for a total of 12 Academy Awards.\\r\\nSome critics, fans, and general audiences have expressed disappointment that the Harry Potter series did not win any Oscars for its achievements. However, others have pointed out that certain films in the series had uneven reviews, in contrast to the three films of The Lord of the Rings, for example, which were all critically acclaimed. This has been partially attributed to the Harry Potter franchise going through several directors with their own styles in contrast to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which was filmed in one massive undertaking by the same director, writer, and producer.[110][111]\\r\\nAlthough not successful at the Oscars, the Harry Potter series has gained success in many other award ceremonies, including the annual Saturn Awards and Art Directors Guild Awards. The series has also gained a total of 24 nominations at the British Academy Film Awards presented at the annual BAFTAs, winning several, and 5 nominations at the Grammy Awards.\\r\\nPhilosopher's Stone achieved seven BAFTA Award nominations, including Best British Film and Best Supporting Actor for Robbie Coltrane.[112] The film was also nominated for eight Saturn Awards and won for its costumes design.[113] It was also nominated at the Art Directors Guild Awards for its production design[114] and received the Broadcast Film Critics Award for Best Live Action Family Film along with gaining two other nominations.[115]\\r\\nChamber of Secrets won the award for Best Live Action Family Film in the Phoenix Film Critics Society. It was nominated for seven Saturn Awards, including Best Director and Best Fantasy Film. The film was nominated for four BAFTA Awards and a Grammy Award for John Williams's score. Prisoner of Azkaban won an Audience Award, as well as Best Feature Film, at the BAFTA Awards. The film also won a BMI Film Music award along with being nominated at the Grammy Awards, Visual Effect Society Awards, and the Amanda Awards. Goblet of Fire won a BAFTA award for Best Production Design as well as being nominated at the Saturn Awards, Critic's Choice Awards, and the Visual Effects Society Awards.\\r\\nOrder of the Phoenix picked up three awards at the inaugural ITV National Movie Awards.[116] At the Empire Awards, David Yates won Best Director.[117] Composer Nicholas Hooper received a nomination for a World Soundtrack Discovery Award.[118] The film was nominated at the BAFTA Awards, but did not win for Best Production Design or Best Special Visual Effects.[119] Half-Blood Prince was nominated for BAFTA Awards in Production Design and Visual Effects,[120] and it was in the longlists for several other categories, including Best Supporting Actor for Alan Rickman.[121] Amongst other nominations and wins, the film also achieved Best Family Movie at the National Movie Awards as well as Best Live Action Family Film at the Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards, along with being nominated for Best Motion Picture at the Satellite Awards.\\r\\nDeathly Hallows √ø Part 1 gained two nominations at the BAFTA Awards for Best Make-Up and Hair and Best Visual Effects, along with receiving nominations for the same categories at the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards. Eduardo Serra's cinematography and Stuart Craig's production design were also nominated in various award ceremonies, and David Yates attained his second win at the Empire Awards, this time for Best Fantasy Film. He also obtained another Best Director nomination at the annual Saturn Awards, which also saw the film gain a Best Fantasy Film nomination.[122][123] Deathly Hallows √ø Part 2 was released to critical acclaim, gaining a mix of audience awards. Part 2 of Deathly Hallows was also recognised at the Saturn Awards as well as the BAFTA Awards, where the film achieved a win for Best Special Visual Effects.[124]\\r\\nAs of 2017[update], the Harry Potter film series is the 2nd highest-grossing film franchise of all time, with the eight films released grossing over $7.7?billion worldwide. Without adjusting for inflation, this is higher than the first 22 James Bond films and the six films in the Star Wars franchise.[125] Chris Columbus's Philosopher's Stone became the highest-grossing Harry Potter film worldwide upon completing its theatrical run in 2002, but it was eventually topped by David Yates's Deathly Hallows √ø Part 2, while Alfonso Cuar‹án's Prisoner of Azkaban grossed the least.[126][127][128][129]\\r\\nSix films in the Harry Potter franchise  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Parts 1 & 2  have to date grossed around $216 million in IMAX theaters worldwide.[130]\\r\\nThe Economist[150]\\r\\nThe Harry Potter films and their success have been retrospectively considered to have had a significant impact on the film industry. They are cited as having helped redefine the Hollywood blockbuster in the 21st century by initiating a shift toward established media franchises forming the basis of successful films. In the wake of the final film's release, Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote that the films \\"inspired every major studio to try to capture [its] alchemic formula, spawning a range of copycats and wannabes\\" and \\"also have shown Hollywood how to make a glossy blockbuster with an eye toward keeping costs down.\\"[151] A 2009 article from The Economist argued that the films were \\"in the vanguard\\" of adaptations of established properties being the modern film franchise model, citing The Lord of the Rings, Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Trilogy as examples of successful film series that followed Harry Potter's suit.[150] Furthermore, the practice of splitting the finale of a film series into two back-to-back films began with the success of Deathly Hallows, and it would soon be replicated by The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and The Battle of the Five Armies, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn √ø Parts 1 and 2, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay √ø Parts 1 and 2, and Avengers: Infinity War and its untitled sequel.[152]\\r\\nThe films are also widely credited with singlehandedly signalling the popularity of films based on children's and young adult literature in the 2000s and 2010s, correlating with the book series' own literary influence. Costance Grady and Aja Romano, commenting on the whole Harry Potter franchise's legacy for Vox in light of its 20th anniversary, wrote that youth-targeted literature has since become \\"a go-to well of ideas for Hollywood,\\" pointing to the successes of The Twilight Saga, The Hunger Games and The Divergent Series.[153]\\r\\nThe series has spawned a vast volume of fan fiction, with nearly 600 thousand inspired stories catalogued.[154] Youtube hosts many fan films, ranging from amateur productions to full length films.","input":"What is the second harry potter movie called?"},{"output":"chronically underfunded and understaffed","context":"In South Africa, private and public health systems exist in parallel. The public system serves the vast majority of the population, but is chronically underfunded and understaffed. The wealthiest 20% of the population use the private system and are far better served. In 2005, South Africa spent 8.7% of GDP on health care, or US$437 per capita. Of that, approximately 42% was government expenditure.[1] About 79% of doctors work in the private sector.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first hospital in South Africa, a temporary tent to care for sick sailors of the Dutch East India Company (the Company) afflicted by diseases such as typhoid and scurvy, was started at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652.[3]\\r\\nA permanent hospital was completed in 1656. Initially, convalescent soldiers provided to others whatever care they could, but around 1700 the first Binnenmoeder (Dutch for matron) and Siekenvader (male nurse/supervisor) were appointed in order to ensure cleanliness in the hospital, and to supervise bedside attendants.[3]\\r\\nThe Company subsequently employed Sworn Midwives from Holland, who practiced midwifery and also trained and examined local women who wished to become midwives. Some of the early trainees at the Cape were freed Malay and coloured slaves.[3]\\r\\nFrom 1807, other hospitals were built in order to meet the increasing demand for healthcare. The first hospitals in the Eastern Cape were founded in Port Elizabeth, King Williamstown, Grahamstown and Queenstown.[3]\\r\\nRoman Catholic Nuns of the Assumption Order were the first members of a religious order to arrive in South Africa. In 1874, two Nightingale nurses, Anglican Sisterhoods, the Community of St Michael and All Angels arrived from England.[3]\\r\\nThe discovery of diamonds in Kimberley led to an explosion of immigrants, which, coupled with the \\"generally squalid conditions\\" around mines, encouraged the spread of diseases dysentery, typhoid, and malaria.[3]\\r\\nFollowing negotiations with the Anglican Order of St Michael, Sister Henrietta Stockdale and other members were assigned to the Carnarvon hospital in 1877. Sister Stockdale had studied nursing and taught the nurses at Carnavorn what she knew; these nurses would move to other hospitals in Barbeton, Pretoria, Queenstown, and Cape Town, where they in turn trained others in nursing. This laid the foundation of professional nursing in South Africa.[3]\\r\\nSister Stockdale was also responsible for the nursing clauses in Act 34 of 1981, the first legal rules in the world requiring state registration of nurses.[3]\\r\\nMost mission hospitals have become public hospitals in contemporary South Africa.[3]\\r\\nThe Anglo-Boer war and World War 1 severely strained healthcare provision in South Africa.[3]\\r\\nFormal training for black nurses began at Lovedale in 1902. In the first half of the 20th century, nursing was not considered appropriate for Indian women but some males did become registered nurses or orderlies.[3]\\r\\nIn 1912, the South African military recognised the importance of military nursing in the Defence Act. In 1913, the first nursing journal, The South African Nursing Record, was published. In 1914, The South African Trained Nurses' Association, the first organisation for nurses, formed. In 1944, the first Nursing Act was promulgated.[3]\\r\\nIn 1935, the first diploma courses to enable nurses to train as tutors were introduced at the University of Witwatersrand and the University of Cape Town.[3]\\r\\nThe establishment of independent states and homelands in South Africa also created independent Nursing Councils, and Nursing Associations for the Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei. Under the post-Apartheid dispensation, these were all merged to form one organisation, the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (DENOSA).[3]\\r\\nIn 2013, it was estimated that vacancy rates for doctors were 56% and for nurses 46%. Half the population lives in rural areas, but only 3% of newly qualified doctors take jobs there. All medical training takes place in the public sector but 70% of doctors go into the private sector. 10% of medical staff is qualified in other countries. Medical student numbers increased by 34% between 2000 and 2012. [4]\\r\\nThere are more than 400 public hospitals and more than 200 private hospitals. The provincial health departments manage the larger regional hospitals directly. Smaller hospitals and primary care clinics are managed at district level. The national Department of Health manages the 10 major teaching hospitals directly.[6]\\r\\nThe Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital is the third largest hospital in the world and it is located in Johannesburg.\\r\\nThe public sector uses a Uniform Patient Fee Schedule as a guide to billing for services. This is being used in all the provinces of South Africa, although in Western Cape, Kwa-Zulu Natal, and Eastern Cape, it is being implemented on a phased schedule. Implemented in November 2000, the UPFS categorises the different fees for every type of patient and situation.[7]\\r\\nIt groups patients into three categories defined in general terms, and includes a classification system for placing all patients into either one of these categories depending on the situation and any other relevant variables. The three categories include full paying patientspatients who are either being treated by a private practitioner, who are externally funded, or who are some types of non-South African citizens, fully subsidised patientspatients who are referred to a hospital by Primary Healthcare Services, and partially subsidised patientspatients whose costs are partially covered based on their income. There are also specified occasions in which services are free of cost.[7]\\r\\nBecause of its abundant cases of HIV/AIDS among citizens (about 5.6?million in 2009) South Africa has been working to create a program to distribute anti-retroviral therapy treatment, which has generally been limited in low economic countries, including neighboring country Lesotho. An anti-retroviral drug aims to control the amount of virus in the patients body. In November 2003 the Operational Plan for Comprehensive HIV and AIDS Care, Management and Treatment for South Africa was approved, which was soon accompanied by a National Strategic Plan for 2007√ø2011. When South Africa freed itself of apartheid, the new health care policy has emphasised public health care, which is founded with primary health care. The National Strategic Plan therefore promotes distribution of anti-retroviral therapy through the public sector, and more specifically, primary health care.[8]\\r\\nAccording to the World Health Organization, about 37% of infected individuals were receiving treatment at the end of 2009. It wasnt until 2009 that the South African National AIDS Council urged the government to raise the treatment threshold to be within the World Health Organization guidelines. Although this is the case, the latest anti-retroviral treatment guideline, released in February 2010, continue to fall short of these recommendations. In the beginning of 2010, the government promised to treat all HIV-positive children with anti-retroviral therapy, though throughout the year, there have been studies that show the lack of treatment for children among many hospitals. In 2009, a bit over 50% of children in need of anti-retroviral therapy were receiving it. Because the World Health Organizations 2010 guidelines suggest that HIV-positive patients need to start receiving treatment earlier than they have been, only 37% of those considered in need of anti-retroviral therapy are receiving it.\\r\\nA controversy within the distribution of anti-retroviral treatment is the use of generic drugs. When an effective anti-retroviral drug became in available in 1996, only economically rich countries could afford it at a price of $10,000 to $15,000 per person per year. For economically disadvantaged countries, such as South Africa, to begin using and distributing the drug, the price had to be lowered substantially. In 2000, generic anti-retroviral treatments started being produced and sold at a much cheaper cost. Needing to compete with these prices, the big-brand pharmaceutical companies were forced to lower their prices. This competition has greatly benefited low economic countries and the prices have continued decline since the generic drug was introduced. The anti-retroviral treatment can now be purchased at as low as eighty-eight dollars per person per year. While the production of generic drugs has allowed the treatment of many more people in need, pharmaceutical companies feel that the combination of a decrease in price and a decrease in customers reduces the money they can spend on researching and developing new medications and treatments for HIV/AIDS.[9]\\r\\nFollowing the end of the Second World War, South Africa saw a rapid growth in the coverage of private medical provision, with this development mainly benefiting the predominantly middle class white population. From 1945 to 1960, the percentage of whites covered by health insurance grew from 48% to 80% of the population. Virtually the entire white population had shifted away from the free health services provided by the government by 1960, with 95% of non-whites remaining reliant upon the public sector for treatment.[10]\\r\\nMembership of health insurance schemes became effectively compulsory for white South Africans due to membership of such schemes being a condition of employment, together with the fact that virtually all whites were formally employed. Pensioner members of many health insurance schemes received the same medical benefits as other members of these schemes, but free of costs.[11]\\r\\nSince coming to power in 1994, the African National Congress (ANC) has implemented a number of measures to combat health inequalities in South Africa. These have included the introduction of free health care in 1994 for all children under the age of six together with pregnant and breastfeeding women making use of public sector health facilities (extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996) and the extension of free hospital care (in 2003) to children older than six with moderate and severe disabilities.[12]\\r\\nThe current government is working to establish a national health insurance (NHI) system out of concerns for discrepancies within the national health care system, such as unequal access to healthcare amongst different socio-economic groups. Although the details and outline of the proposal have yet to be released, it seeks to find ways to make health care more available to those who currently cant afford it or whose situation prevents them from attaining the services they need. There is a discrepancy between money spent in the private sector which serves the wealthy (about US$1500 per head per year) and that spent in the public sector (about US$150 per head per year) which serves about 84% of the population. About 16% of the population have private health insurance. The total public funding for healthcare in 2012/3 was R21 billion. The NHI scheme is expected to require expenditure of about R336 billion.[13]\\r\\nThe NHI is speculated to propose that there be a single National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) for health insurance. This fund is expected to draw its revenue from general taxes and some sort of health insurance contribution. The proposed fund is supposed to work as a way to purchase and provide health care to all South African residents without detracting from other social services. Those receiving health care from both the public and private sectors will be mandated to contribute through taxes to the NHIF. The ANC hopes that the NHI plan will work to pay for health care costs for those who cannot pay for it themselves.\\r\\nThere are those who doubt the NHI and oppose its fundamental techniques. For example, many believe that the NHI will put a burden on the upper class to pay for all lower class health care. Currently, the vast majority of health care funds comes from individual contributions coming from upper class patients paying directly for health care in the private sector. The NHI proposes that health care fund revenues be shifted from these individual contributions to a general tax revenue.[2] Because the NHI aims to provide free health care to all South Africans, the new system is expected to bring an end to the financial burden facing public sector patients.[14]","input":"What is the state of the south african health care system?"},{"output":"every four years","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Fdration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The current champion is France, which won its second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the World Cup Finals. After this, 32 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight national teams. Brazil have won five times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, France and inaugural winner Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and Spain with one title each.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games; the cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was estimated to be 26.29?billion with an estimated 715.1?million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet.[1][2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n17 countries have hosted the World Cup. Brazil, France, Italy, Germany and Mexico have each hosted twice, while Uruguay, Switzerland, Sweden, Chile, England, Argentina, Spain, the United States, Japan and South Korea (jointly), South Africa and Russia have each hosted once. Qatar are planned as hosts of the 2022 finals, and 2026 will be a joint hosted finals between Canada, the United States and Mexico, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to have hosted games in three different finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world's first international football match was a challenge match played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and England,[5] which ended in a 0√ø0 draw. The first international tournament, the inaugural British Home Championship, took place in 1884.[6] As football grew in popularity in other parts of the world at the start of the 20th century, it was held as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics (however, the IOC has retroactively upgraded their status to official events), and at the 1906 Intercalated Games.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter FIFA was founded in 1904, it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been a failure.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, football became an official competition. Planned by The Football Association (FA), England's football governing body, the event was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain (represented by the England national amateur football team) won the gold medals. They repeated the feat at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams, Sir Thomas Lipton organised the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy tournament in Turin in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each one of which represented an entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as The First World Cup,[9] and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from Italy, Germany and Switzerland, but the FA of England refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team. Lipton invited West Auckland, an amateur side from County Durham, to represent England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the Olympic tournament as a \\"world football championship for amateurs\\", and took responsibility for managing the event.[10] This paved the way for the world's first intercontinental football competition, at the 1920 Summer Olympics, contested by Egypt and 13 European teams, and won by Belgium.[11] Uruguay won the next two Olympic football tournaments in 1924 and 1928. Those were also the first two open world championships, as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the success of the Olympic football tournaments, FIFA, with President Jules Rimet as the driving force, again started looking at staging its own international tournament outside of the Olympics. On 28 May 1928, the FIFA Congress in Amsterdam decided to stage a world championship itself.[12] With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions and to celebrate their centenary of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country of the inaugural World Cup tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition. Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make the trip. In total, 13 nations took part: seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously on 13 July 1930, and were won by France and the USA, who defeated Mexico 4√ø1 and Belgium 3√ø0 respectively. The first goal in World Cup history was scored by Lucien Laurent of France.[13] In the final, Uruguay defeated Argentina 4√ø2 in front of 93,000 people in Montevideo, and became the first nation to win the World Cup.[14] After the creation of the World Cup, FIFA and the IOC disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the 1932 Summer Olympics.[15] Olympic football returned at the 1936 Summer Olympics, but was now overshadowed by the more prestigious World Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel, and war. Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the 1934 World Cup and all North and South American nations except Brazil and Cuba boycotted the 1938 tournament. Brazil was the only South American team to compete in both. The 1942 and 1946 competitions, which Germany and Brazil sought to host,[16] were cancelled due to World War II and its aftermath.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1950 World Cup, held in Brazil, was the first to include British participants. British teams withdrew from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against foreign influence on football,[17] but rejoined in 1946 following FIFA's invitation.[18] The tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions Uruguay, who had boycotted the previous two World Cups. Uruguay won the tournament again after defeating the host nation Brazil, in the match called \\"Maracanazo\\" (Portuguese: Maracana?o).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the tournaments between 1934 and 1978, 16 teams competed in each tournament, except in 1938, when Austria was absorbed into Germany after qualifying, leaving the tournament with 15 teams, and in 1950, when India, Scotland, and Turkey withdrew, leaving the tournament with 13 teams.[19] Most of the participating nations were from Europe and South America, with a small minority from North America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams. Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance out of the first round were: USA, semi-finalists in 1930; Cuba, quarter-finalists in 1938; North Korea, quarter-finalists in 1966; and Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1970.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tournament was expanded to 24 teams in 1982,[20] and then to 32 in 1998,[21] also allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part. Since then, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, with several having reached the quarter-finals: Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1986; Cameroon, quarter-finalists in 1990; South Korea, finishing in fourth place in 2002; Senegal, along with USA, both quarter-finalists in 2002; Ghana, quarter-finalists in 2010; and Costa Rica, quarter-finalists in 2014. Nevertheless, European and South American teams continue to dominate, e.g., the quarter-finalists in 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2018 were all from Europe or South America and so were the finalists of all tournaments so far.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo hundred teams entered the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification rounds; 198 nations attempted to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, while a record 204 countries entered qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2013, Sepp Blatter spoke of guaranteeing the Caribbean Football Union's region a position in the World Cup.[23] In the edition of 25 October 2013 of the FIFA Weekly Blatter wrote that: \\"From a purely sporting perspective, I would like to see globalisation finally taken seriously, and the African and Asian national associations accorded the status they deserve at the FIFA World Cup. It cannot be that the European and South American confederations lay claim to the majority of the berths at the World Cup.\\"[24] Those two remarks suggested to commentators that Blatter could be putting himself forward for re-election to the FIFA Presidency.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the magazine's publication, Blatter's would-be opponent for the FIFA Presidency, UEFA President Michel Platini, responded that he intended to extend the World Cup to 40 national associations, increasing the number of participants by eight. Platini said that he would allocate an additional berth to UEFA, two to the Asian Football Confederation and the Confederation of African Football, two shared between CONCACAF and CONMEBOL, and a guaranteed place for the Oceania Football Confederation.[26] Platini was clear about why he wanted to expand the World Cup. He said: \\"[The World Cup is] not based on the quality of the teams because you don't have the best 32 at the World Cup?... but it's a good compromise.?... It's a political matter so why not have more Africans? The competition is to bring all the people of all the world. If you don't give the possibility to participate, they don't improve.\\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2016 FIFA president Gianni Infantino stated his support for a 48-team World Cup in 2026.[27] On 10 January 2017, FIFA confirmed the 2026 World Cup will have 48 finalist teams.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy May 2015, the games were under a particularly dark cloud because of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, allegations and criminal charges of bribery, fraud and money laundering to corrupt the issuing of media and marketing rights (rigged bids) for FIFA games,[29] with FIFA officials accused of taking bribes totaling more than $150?million over 24 years. In late May, the U.S. Justice Department announced a 47-count indictment with charges of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy against 14 people. Arrests of over a dozen FIFA officials were made since that time, particularly on 29 May and 3 December.[30] By the end of May 2015, a total of nine FIFA officials and five executives of sports and broadcasting markets had already been charged on corruption. At the time, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced he would relinquish his position in February 2016.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 4 June 2015 Chuck Blazer while co-operating with the FBI and the Swiss authorities admitted that he and the other members of FIFA's then-executive committee were bribed in order to promote the 1998 and 2010 World Cups.[32] On 10 June 2015 Swiss authorities seized computer data from the offices of Sepp Blatter.[33] The same day, FIFA postponed the bidding process for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in light of the allegations surrounding bribery in the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. Then-secretary general Jr?me Valcke stated, \\"Due to the situation, I think it's nonsense to start any bidding process for the time being.\\"[34] On 28 October 2015, Blatter and FIFA VP Michel Platini, a potential candidate for presidency, were suspended for 90 days; both maintained their innocence in statements made to the news media.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 December 2015 two FIFA vice-presidents were arrested on suspicion of bribery in the same Zurich hotel where seven FIFA officials had been arrested in May.[36] An additional 16 indictments by the U.S. Department of Justice were announced on the same day.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn equivalent tournament for women's football, the FIFA Women's World Cup, was first held in 1991 in China.[38] The women's tournament is smaller in scale and profile than the men's, but is growing; the number of entrants for the 2007 tournament was 120, more than double that of 1991.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nMen's football has been included in every Summer Olympic Games except 1896 and 1932. Unlike many other sports, the men's football tournament at the Olympics is not a top-level tournament, and since 1992, an under-23 tournament with each team allowed three over-age players.[40] Women's football made its Olympic debut in 1996.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FIFA Confederations Cup is a tournament held one year before the World Cup at the World Cup host nation(s) as a dress rehearsal for the upcoming World Cup. It is contested by the winners of each of the six FIFA confederation championships, along with the FIFA World Cup champion and the host country.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nFIFA also organises international tournaments for youth football (FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup), club football (FIFA Club World Cup), and football variants such as futsal (FIFA Futsal World Cup) and beach soccer (FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup). The latter three do not have a women's version, although a FIFA Women's Club World Cup has been proposed.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup is held the year before each Women's World Cup and both tournaments are awarded in a single bidding process. The U-20 tournament serves as a dress rehearsal for the larger competition.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy was awarded to the World Cup winning team. It was originally simply known as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet who set up the first tournament. In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 1970, a new trophy, known as the FIFA World Cup Trophy, was designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven countries, evaluated the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work of the Italian designer Silvio Gazzaniga. The new trophy is 36?cm (14.2?in) high, made of solid 18 carat (75%) gold and weighs 6.175?kg (13.6?lb).[45] The base contains two layers of semi-precious malachite while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since 1974.[45] The description of the trophy by Gazzaniga was: \\"The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory.\\"[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently. World Cup winners retain the trophy only until the post-match celebration is finished. They are awarded a gold-plated replica rather than the solid gold original immediately afterwards.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, all members (players, coaches, and managers) of the top three teams receive medals with an insignia of the World Cup Trophy; winners' (gold), runners-up' (silver), and third-place (bronze). In the 2002 edition, fourth-place medals were awarded to hosts South Korea. Before the 1978 tournament, medals were only awarded to the eleven players on the pitch at the end of the final and the third-place match. In November 2007, FIFA announced that all members of World Cup-winning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners' medals.[48][49][50]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the second World Cup in 1934, qualifying tournaments have been held to thin the field for the final tournament.[51] They are held within the six FIFA continental zones (Africa, Asia, North and Central America and Caribbean, South America, Oceania, and Europe), overseen by their respective confederations. For each tournament, FIFA decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand, generally based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a two-year period. The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental play-offs. For example, the winner of the Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the Asian zone entered a play-off for a spot in the 2010 World Cup.[52] From the 1938 World Cup onwards, host nations receive automatic qualification to the final tournament. This right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the 2006 FIFA World Cup onward, requiring the champions to qualify. Brazil, winners in 2002, were the first defending champions to play qualifying matches.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current final tournament has been used since 1998 and features 32 national teams competing over the course of a month in the host nation(s). There are two stages: the group stage followed by the knockout stage.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the group stage, teams compete within eight groups of four teams each. Eight teams are seeded, including the hosts, with the other seeded teams selected using a formula based on the FIFA World Rankings and/or performances in recent World Cups, and drawn to separate groups.[55] The other teams are assigned to different \\"pots\\", usually based on geographical criteria, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups. Since 1998, constraints have been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two European teams or more than one team from any other confederation.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach group plays a round-robin tournament, in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. This means that a total of six matches are played within a group. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among all four teams.[57] The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since 1994, three points have been awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss (before, winners received two points).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf one considers all possible outcomes (win, draw, loss) for all six matches in a group, there are 729 (= 36) outcome combinations possible. However, 207 of these combinations lead to ties between the second and third places. In such case, the ranking among these teams is determined as follows:[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe knockout stage is a single-elimination tournament in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with extra time and penalty shootouts used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the round of 16 (or the second round) in which the winner of each group plays against the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the third-place match (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 January 2017, FIFA approved a new format, the 48-team World Cup (to accommodate more teams), which consists of 16 groups of three teams each, with two teams qualifying from each group, to form a round of 32 knockout stage, to be implemented by 2026.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly World Cups were given to countries at meetings of FIFA's congress. The locations were controversial because South America and Europe were by far the two centres of strength in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat. The decision to hold the first World Cup in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing.[60] The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these in France was disputed, as the South American countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the 1938 FIFA World Cup.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1958 FIFA World Cup, to avoid future boycotts or controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternating the hosts between the Americas and Europe, which continued until the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The 2002 FIFA World Cup, hosted jointly by South Korea and Japan, was the first one held in Asia, and the first tournament with multiple hosts.[62] South Africa became the first African nation to host the World Cup in 2010. The 2014 FIFA World Cup was hosted by Brazil, the first held in South America since Argentina 1978,[63] and was the first occasion where consecutive World Cups were held outside Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's Council. This is done under an exhaustive ballot system. The national football association of a country desiring to host the event receives a \\"Hosting Agreement\\" from FIFA, which explains the steps and requirements that are expected from a strong bid. The bidding association also receives a form, the submission of which represents the official confirmation of the candidacy. After this, a FIFA designated group of inspectors visit the country to identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the event and a report on the country is produced. The decision on who will host the World Cup is usually made six or seven years in advance of the tournament. However, there have been occasions where the hosts of multiple future tournaments were announced at the same time, as was the case for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were awarded to Russia and Qatar, with Qatar becoming the first Middle Eastern country to host the tournament.[64][65]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the final tournament is rotated between confederations, allowing only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid to host the tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the controversy surrounding Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the 2006 tournament. However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018.[66] This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2026 FIFA World Cup was chosen to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico, marking the first time a World Cup has been shared by three host nations.[68] The 2026 tournament will be the biggest World Cup ever held, with 48 teams playing 80 matches. Sixty matches will take place in the US, including all matches from the quarter-finals onward, while Canada and Mexico will host 10 games each.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nSix of the eight champions have won one of their titles while playing in their own homeland, the exceptions being Brazil, who finished as runners-up after losing the deciding match on home soil in 1950 and lost their semi-final against Germany in 2014, and Spain, which reached the second round on home soil in 1982. England (1966) won its only title while playing as a host nation. Uruguay (1930), Italy (1934), Argentina (1978) and \\r\\nFrance (1998) won their first titles as host nations but have gone on to win again, while Germany (1974) won their second title on home soil.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther nations have also been successful when hosting the tournament. Switzerland (quarter-finals 1954), Sweden (runners-up in 1958), Chile (third place in 1962), South Korea (fourth place in 2002), and Mexico (quarter-finals in 1970 and 1986) all have their best results when serving as hosts. So far, South Africa (2010) has been the only host nation to fail to advance beyond the first round.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\n The best-attended single match, shown in the last three columns, has been the final in half of the 20 World Cups as of 2014. Another match or matches drew more attendance than the final in 1930, 1938, 1958, 1962, 1970√ø1982, 1990 and 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Cup was first televised in 1954 and is now the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world. The cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 World Cup is estimated to be 26.29?billion.[1] 715.1?million individuals watched the final match of this tournament (a ninth of the entire population of the planet). The 2006 World Cup draw, which decided the distribution of teams into groups, was watched by 300 million viewers.[73] The World Cup attracts many sponsors such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Adidas. For these companies and many more, being a sponsor strongly impacts their global brands. Host countries typically experience a multimillion-dollar revenue increase from the month-long event.\\r\\nThe governing body of the sport, FIFA, generated $4.8?billion in revenue from the 2014 tournament.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach FIFA World Cup since 1966 has its own mascot or logo. World Cup Willie, the mascot for the 1966 competition, was the first World Cup mascot.[75] World Cups have also featured official match balls specially designed for each tournament.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Cup even has a statistically significant effect on birth rates, the male/female sex ratio of newborns, and heart attacks in nations whose national teams are competing.[77][78][79]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all, 79 nations have played in at least one World Cup.[83] Of these, eight national teams have won the World Cup, and they have added stars to their badges, with each star representing a World Cup victory. (Uruguay, however, choose to display four stars on their badge, representing their two gold medals at the 1924 and 1928 Summer Olympics and their two World Cup titles in 1930 and 1950).\\r\\n\\r\\nWith five titles, Brazil are the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation to have played in every World Cup (21) to date.[84] Brazil were also the first team to win the World Cup for the third (1970), fourth (1994) and fifth (2002) time. Italy (1934 and 1938) and Brazil (1958 and 1962) are the only nations to have won consecutive titles. West Germany (1982√ø1990) and Brazil (1994√ø2002) are the only nations to appear in three consecutive World Cup finals. Germany has made the most top-four finishes (13), medals (12), as well as the most finals (8).\\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, the final of the World Cup has only been contested by teams from the UEFA (Europe) and CONMEBOL (South America) confederations. European nations have won twelve titles, while South American have won nine. Only two teams from outside these two continents have ever reached the semi-finals of the competition: United States (North, Central America and Caribbean) in 1930 and South Korea (Asia) in 2002. The best result of an African team is reaching the quarter-finals: Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002 and Ghana in 2010. Only one Oceanian qualifier, Australia in 2006, has advanced to the second round.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrazil, Argentina, Spain and Germany are the only teams to win a World Cup outside their continental confederation; Brazil came out victorious in Europe (1958), North America (1970 and 1994) and Asia (2002). Argentina won a World Cup in North America in 1986, while Spain won in Africa in 2010. In 2014, Germany became the first European team to win in the Americas. Only on five occasions have consecutive World Cups been won by teams from the same continent, and currently it is the first time with four champions in a row from the same continental confederation. Italy and Brazil successfully defended their titles in 1938 and 1962 respectively, while Italy's triumph in 2006 has been followed by wins for Spain in 2010, Germany in 2014 and France in 2018. Currently, it is also the first time that one of the currently winning continents (Europe) is ahead of the other (South America) by more than one championship.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of each World Cup, awards are presented to the players and teams for accomplishments other than their final team positions in the tournament. There are currently six awards:[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn All-Star Team consisting of the best players of the tournament has also been announced for each tournament since 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree players share the record for playing in the most World Cups; Mexico's Antonio Carbajal (1950√ø1966) and Rafael Mrquez (2002-2018); and Germany's Lothar Matth?us (1982√ø1998) all played in five tournaments.[91] Matth?us has played the most World Cup matches overall, with 25 appearances.[92] Brazil's Djalma Santos (1954√ø1962), West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer (1966√ø1974) and Germany's Philipp Lahm (2006√ø2014) are the only players to be named to three Finals All-Star Teams.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nMiroslav Klose of Germany (2002√ø2014) is the all-time top scorer at the finals, with 16 goals. He broke Ronaldo of Brazil's record of 15 goals (1998√ø2006) during the 2014 semi-final match against Brazil. West Germany's Gerd Mller (1970√ø1974) is third, with 14 goals.[94] The fourth placed goalscorer, France's Just Fontaine, holds the record for the most goals scored in a single World Cup; all his 13 goals were scored in the 1958 tournament.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2007, FIFA announced that all members of World Cup-winning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners' medals.[48] This made Brazil's Pel the only player to have won three World Cup winners' medals (1958, 1962, and 1970, although he did not play in the 1962 final due to injury),[96] with 20 other players who have won two winners' medals. Seven players have collected all three types of World Cup medals (winners', runner- ups', and third-place); five players were from West Germany's squad of 1966√ø1974 including Franz Beckenbauer, Jrgen Grabowski, Horst-Dieter H?ttges, Sepp Maier and Wolfgang Overath (1966√ø1974), Italy's Franco Baresi (1982, 1990, 1994) and the most recent has been Miroslav Klose of Germany (2002√ø2014) with four consecutive medals.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrazil's Mrio Zagallo, West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer and France's Didier Deschamps are the only people to date to win the World Cup as both player and head coach. Zagallo won in 1958 and 1962 as a player and in 1970 as head coach.[98] Beckenbauer won in 1974 as captain and in 1990 as head coach,[99] and Deschamps repeated the feat in 2018, after having won in 1998 as captain.[100] Italy's Vittorio Pozzo is the only head coach to ever win two World Cups (1934 and 1938).[101] All World Cup-winning head coaches were natives of the country they coached to victory.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the national teams, Germany and Brazil have played the most World Cup matches (109), Germany appeared in the most finals (8), semi-finals (13), quarter-finals (16), while Brazil has appeared in the most World Cups (21), has the most wins (73) and has scored the most goals (229).[103][104] The two teams have played each other twice in the World Cup, in the 2002 final and in the 2014 semi-final.[105]","input":"How often do they play for the world cup?"},{"output":"Hill of Tepeyac, which would become part of Villa de Guadalupe, a suburb of Mexico City","context":"Our Lady of Guadalupe (Spanish: Nuestra Se?ora de Guadalupe), also known as the Virgin of Guadalupe (Spanish: Virgen de Guadalupe), is a Roman Catholic title of the Blessed Virgin Mary associated with a venerated image enshrined within the Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City. The basilica is the most visited Catholic pilgrimage site in the world, and the world's third most-visited sacred site.[1][2] Pope Leo XIII granted the venerated image a Canonical Coronation on 12 October 1895.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficial Catholic accounts state that the Virgin Mary appeared four times before Juan Diego and one more before Juan Diego's uncle. According to these accounts the first apparition occurred on the morning of December 9, 1531, when a native Mexican peasant named Juan Diego saw a vision of a maiden at a place called the Hill of Tepeyac, which would become part of Villa de Guadalupe, a suburb of Mexico City. Speaking to Juan Diego in his native Nahuatl language (the language of the Aztec empire), the maiden identified herself as the Virgin Mary, \\"mother of the very true deity\\"[3] and asked for a church to be built at that site in her honor.\\r\\nBased on her words, Juan Diego then sought out the archbishop of Mexico City, Fray Juan de Zumrraga, to tell him what had happened. As the bishop did not believe Diego, on the same day, Juan Diego saw the Virgin Mary for a second time (the second apparition); she asked him to keep insisting.\\r\\nOn Sunday, December 10, Juan Diego talked to the archbishop for a second time. The latter instructed him to return to Tepeyac Hill, and ask the lady for a miraculous sign to prove her identity. That same day, the third apparition occurred when Diego returned to Tepeyac and encountering the Virgin Mary, reported the bishop's request for a sign; she consented to provide one on the following day (December 11).[4]\\r\\nBy Monday, December 11, however, Juan Diego's uncle Juan Bernardino had fallen sick and Juan Diego was obliged to attend to him. In the very early hours of Tuesday, December 12, Juan Bernardino's condition having deteriorated overnight, Juan Diego set out to Tlatelolco to fetch a priest to hear Juan Bernardino's confession and minister to him on his death-bed.\\r\\nIn order to avoid being delayed by the Virgin and ashamed at having failed to meet her on the Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around the hill, but the Virgin intercepted him and asked where he was going (fourth apparition); Juan Diego explained what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having had recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe event and are inscribed over the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked, ?No estoy yo aqu que soy tu madre? (Am I not here, I who am your mother?). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered and she told him to gather flowers from the top of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in December. Juan followed her instructions and he found Castilian roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there. The Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan's tilma, or cloak, and when Juan Diego opened his cloak before archbishop Zumrraga on December 12, the flowers fell to the floor, and on the fabric was the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe.[5]\\r\\nThe next day, on December 13, Juan Diego found his uncle fully recovered, as the Virgin had assured him, and Juan Bernardino recounted that he too had seen her, at his bed-side (fifth apparition); that she had instructed him to inform the bishop of this apparition and of his miraculous cure; and that she had told him she desired to be known under the title of Guadalupe.\\r\\nThe bishop kept Juan Diego's mantle first in his private chapel and then in the church on public display where it attracted great attention. On December 26, 1531 a procession formed for taking the miraculous image back to Tepeyac where it was installed in a small hastily erected chapel.[6] In course of this procession, the first miracle was allegedly performed when an Indian was mortally wounded in the neck by an arrow shot by accident during some stylized martial displays executed in honour of the Virgin. In great distress, the Indians carried him before the Virgin's image and pleaded for his life. Upon the arrow being withdrawn, the victim made a full and immediate recovery.[7]\\r\\nJuan Diego's tilma has become Mexico's most popular religious and cultural symbol, and has received widespread ecclesiastical and popular support. In the 19th century it became the rallying call of American-born Spaniards in New Spain, who saw the story of the apparition as legitimizing their own Mexican origin and infusing it with an almost messianic sense of mission and identity √ø thus also legitimizing their armed rebellion against Spain.[8][9]\\r\\nHistorically the devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe did not lack clerical opponents within Mexico, especially in the early years, and in more recent times some Catholic scholars, and even a former abbot of the basilica, Monsignor Guillermo Schulenburg, have openly doubted the historical existence of Juan Diego, referring to the devotion as merely symbolic, propagated by a sensational cult. Nonetheless, Juan Diego was canonized in 2002, under the name Saint Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin.\\r\\nWhile the image garners much religious devotion and Mexican patriotism, scholarly criticism on the image is also notable, considering the artistic disproportion of the image, the similarity of the image to Spanish pre-colonial artwork closely related to the Aztec colony at the time, the alleged relationship of Marcos Cipac de Aquino in either inventing or amending the tilma cloak, and the public declaration of the abbot of the Guadalupe shrine pertaining to the false existence of the Marian apparitions.\\r\\nFollowing the Conquest in 1519√ø21, the Spanish destroyed a temple of the mother goddess Tonantzin at Tepeyac outside Mexico City, and built a chapel dedicated to the Virgin on the site. Newly converted natives continued to come from afar to worship there, often addressing the Virgin Mary as Tonantzin.[10]\\r\\nWhat is purported by some to be the earliest mention of the miraculous apparition of the Virgin is a page of parchment (the Codex Escalada) which was discovered in 1995 and, according to investigative analysis, dates from the sixteenth century.[11] This document bears two pictorial representations of Juan Diego and the apparition, several inscriptions in Nahuatl referring to Juan Diego by his Aztec name, and the date of his death: 1548, as well as the year that the Virgin Mary appeared: 1531. It also contains the glyph of Antonio Valeriano; and finally, the signature of Fray Bernardino de Sahagun that was authenticated by experts from the Banco de Mexico and Charles E. Dibble.[12]\\r\\nScholarly doubts have been cast on the authenticity of the document, however.[13]\\r\\nA more complete early description of the apparition occurs in a 16-page manuscript called the Nican mopohua, which was acquired by the New York Public Library in 1880, and has been reliably dated in 1556. This document, written in Nahuatl, but in Latin script, tells the story of the apparitions and the supernatural origin of the image. It was probably composed by a native Aztec man, called Antonio Valeriano, who had been educated by Franciscans. The text of this document was later incorporated into a printed pamphlet which was widely circulated in 1649.[14][15][16][17]\\r\\nIn spite of these documents, there are no written accounts of the Guadalupe vision by Catholic clergymen of the 16th century, as there ought to have been if the event had the importance it is claimed to have had.[18] In particular, the canonical account of the vision features archbishop Juan de Zumrraga as a major player in the story, but, although Zumrraga was a prolific writer, there is nothing in his extant writings that can confirm the story.\\r\\nThe written record that does exist suggests the Catholic clergy in 16th century Mexico were deeply divided as to the orthodoxy of the cult springing up around the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, with the Franciscan order (who had custody of the chapel at Tepeyac) being strongly opposed to the cult, while the Dominicans supported it.[19]\\r\\nThe main promoter of the cult was the Dominican Alonso de Mont~far, who succeeded the Franciscan Juan de Zumrraga as archbishop of Mexico. In a 1556 sermon Mont~far commended popular devotion to \\"Our Lady of Guadalupe,\\" referring to a painting on cloth (a tilma) in the chapel of the Virgin Mary at Tepeyac, where certain miracles had occurred. Days later, Fray Francisco de Bustamante, local head of the Franciscan order, delivered a sermon denouncing the cult. He expressed concern that the Archbishop was promoting a superstitious regard for an image:\\r\\n\\"The devotion at the chapel...to which they have given the name Guadalupe was prejudicial to the Indians because they believed that the image itself worked miracles, contrary to what the missionary friars had been teaching them, and because many were disappointed when it did not.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe next day Archbishop Mont~far opened an inquiry into the matter. At the inquiry, the Franciscans repeated their position that the image encouraged idolatry and superstition, and four witnesses testified to Bustamante's claim that the image was painted by an Indian, with one witness naming him \\"the Indian painter Marcos\\".[21] This could refer to the Aztec painter Marcos Cipac de Aquino, who was active at that time.[22][23] But \\"if he did, he did so without making a preliminary sketch √ø in itself a near-miraculous procedure.[...] Cipac may well have had a hand in painting the Image, but only in painting the additions, such as the angel and moon at the Virgin's feet\\",[24] claims Prof. Jody Brant Smith (referring to Philip Serna Callahan's examination of the tilma using infrared photography in 1979).\\r\\nUltimately Archbishop Mont~far (himself a Dominican) decided to end Franciscan custody of the shrine.[25] From then on the shrine was served by diocesan priests under the authority of the archbishop.[26] Moreover, Archbishop Mont~far authorized the construction of a much larger church at Tepeyac, in which the tilma was mounted and displayed.\\r\\nThe report of this 1556 inquiry is the most extensive documentation concerning the Virgin of Guadalupe from the 16th century, and significantly, it makes no mention of Juan Diego, the miraculous apparition, or any other element from the legend.\\r\\nIn the late 1570s, the Franciscan historian Bernardino de Sahag~n denounced the cult at Tepeyac and the use of the name \\"Tonantzin\\" to call Our Lady in a personal digression in his General History of the Things of New Spain, in the version known as the Florentine Codex.\\r\\nAt this place [Tepeyac], [the Indians] had a temple dedicated to the mother of the gods, whom they called Tonantzin, which means Our Mother. There they performed many sacrifices in honor of this goddess...And now that a church of Our Lady of Guadalupe is built there, they also call her Tonantzin, being motivated by the preachers who called Our Lady, the Mother of God, Tonantzin. It is not known for certain where the beginning of this Tonantzin may have originated, but this we know for certain, that, from its first usage, the word means that ancient Tonantzin. And it is something that should be remedied, for the correct [native] name of the Mother of God, Holy Mary, is not Tonantzin, but Dios inantzin. It appears to be a Satanic invention to cloak idolatry under the confusion of this name, Tonantzin.[27]\\r\\nSahag~n's criticism of the cult seems to have stemmed primarily from his concern about a syncretistic application of the native name Tonantzin to the Virgin Mary. However, Sahag~n often used the same name in his sermons as late as the 1560s.[28]\\r\\nIn the 16th century and probably continuing into the early 17th century, the image was modified by adding the mandorla-shaped sunburst around the Virgin, the stars on her cloak, the moon under her feet, and the angel with folded cloth supporting heras was determined by an infrared and ocular study of the tilma in 1979.[29]\\r\\nThe first printed account of the history of the apparitions and image occurs in Imagen de la Virgen Maria, Madre de Dios de Guadalupe, published in 1648 by Miguel Snchez, a diocesan priest of Mexico City.[30]\\r\\nThe next printed account was a 36-page tract in the Nahuatl language, Huei tlamahui?oltica (\\"The Great Event\\"), which was published in 1649. This tract contains a section called the Nican mopohua (\\"Here it is recounted\\"), which we have already touched on above. The composition and authorship of the Huei tlamahui?oltica is assigned by a majority of scholars to Luis Laso de la Vega, vicar of the sanctuary of Tepeyac from 1647√ø1657.[31][32] Nevertheless, the most important section of the tract, the Nican Mopohua, appears to be much older. It has been attributed since the late 1600s to Antonio Valeriano (ca. 1531√ø1605), a native Aztec man who had been educated by the Franciscans and who collaborated extensively with Bernardino de Sahag~n.[14] A manuscript version of the Nican Mopohua, now held by the New York Public Library,[33] appears to be datable to the mid-1500s, and may have been the original work by Valeriano that was used by Laso in composing the Huei tlamahui?oltica. Most authorities agree on the dating and on Valeriano's authorship.[15][16][17]\\r\\nOn the other hand, in 1666, the scholar Luis Becerra Tanco published in Mexico a book about the history of the apparitions under the name \\"Origen milagroso del santuario de Nuestra Se?ora de Guadalupe,\\" which was republished in Spain in 1675 as \\"Felicidad de Mexico en la admirable aparici‹án de la virgen Mara de Guadalupe y origen de su milagrosa Imagen, que se venera extramuros de aquella ciudad.\\"[34] In the same way, in 1688, Jesuit Father Francisco de Florencia published \\"La Estrella del Norte de Mxico\\" with the history of the same apparitions.[35]\\r\\nTwo separate accounts, one in Nahuatl from Juan Bautista del Barrio de San Juan from the 16th century,[36] and the other in Spanish by Servando Teresa de Mier[37] date the original apparition and native celebration on September 8 of the Julian calendar, but also note that the Spaniards celebrate it on December 12 instead.\\r\\nWith the help of the Informaciones Jurdicas de 1666, a feast day in name of Our Lady of Guadalupe was requested and approved, as well as the transfer of the date of the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe from September 8 to December 12, the latest date on which the Virgin supposedly appeared to Juan Diego. The initiative to perform them was made by Francisco de Siles who proposed to ask the Church of Rome a Mass itself with allusive text to the apparitions and stamping of the image, along with the divine office itself, and the precept of hearing Mass on December 12, the last date of the apparitions of the Virgin to Juan Diego as the new date to commemorate the apparitions (which until then was on September 8, the birth of the Virgin).[38][clarification needed]\\r\\nIn 1666, the Church in Mxico began gathering information from people who reported having known Juan Diego, and in 1723 a formal investigation into his life was ordered, where more data was gathered to support veneration. Because of the Informaciones Jurdicas de 1666 in the year 1754, the Sacred Congregation of Rites confirmed the true value of the apparitions and granted celebrating Mass and Office for the feast of Guadalupe on December 12.[39][40]\\r\\nThese published accounts of the origin of the image venerated in Tepeyac increased interest in the identity of Juan Diego, the original recipient of the vision. A new Basilica church was built to house the image. Completed in 1709, it is now known as the Old Basilica.\\r\\nThe image had originally featured a 12-point crown on the Virgin's head, but this disappeared in 1887√ø88. The change was first noticed on 23 February 1888, when the image was removed to a nearby church.[41] Eventually a painter confessed on his deathbed that he had been instructed by a clergyman to remove the crown. This may have been motivated by the fact that the gold paint was flaking off of the crown, leaving it looking dilapidated. But according to the historian David Brading, the decision to remove rather than replace the crown was no doubt inspired by a desire to 'modernize' the image and reinforce its similarity to the nineteenth-century images of the Immaculate Conception which were exhibited at Lourdes and elsewhere What is rarely mentioned is that the frame which surrounded the canvas was adjusted to leave almost no space above the Virgin's head, thereby obscuring the effects of the erasure.\\"[42] it is unclear why the frame was lowered, which makes the covering of the crown not easily noticeable.\\r\\nA different crown was installed to the image. On 8 February 1887, a Papal bull from Pope Leo XIII granted permission a Canonical Coronation of the image, which occurred on 12 October 1895.[43] Since then the Virgin of Guadalupe has been proclaimed \\"Queen of Mexico\\", \\"Patroness of the Americas\\", \\"Empress of Latin America\\", and \\"Protectress of Unborn Children\\" (the latter two titles given by Pope John Paul II in 1999).[44][45] Under this title, she was also proclaimed \\"Heavenly Patroness of the Philippines\\" on 16 July 1935 by Pope Pius XI both witnessed and signed by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, a designation he later rescinded on 12 September 1942 upon becoming Pope Pius XII.\\r\\nOn 25 March 1966, Pope Paul VI presented a Golden Rose to the sacred image. Finally, under Pope John Paul II the move to beatify Juan Diego intensified. John Paul II took a special interest in non-European Catholics and saints. During his leadership, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared Juan Diego \\"venerable\\" (in 1987), and the pope himself announced his beatification on 6 May 1990, during a Mass at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, declaring him protector and advocate of the indigenous peoples,\\" with December 9 established as his feast day.\\r\\nAt that time historians revived doubts as to the quality of the evidence regarding Juan Diego. The writings of bishop Zumrraga, into whose hands Juan purportedly delivered the miraculous image, did not refer to him or the event. The record of the 1556 ecclesiastical inquiry omitted him, and he was not mentioned in documentation before the mid-17th century. In 1996 the 83-year-old abbot of the Basilica of Guadalupe, Guillermo Schulenburg, was forced to resign following an interview published in the Catholic magazine Ixthus, in which he was quoted as saying that Juan Diego was \\"a symbol, not a reality\\", and that his canonization would be the recognition of a cult. It is not recognition of the physical, real existence of a person.[46] In 1883 Joaqun Garca Icazbalceta, historian and biographer of Zumrraga, in a confidential report on the Lady of Guadalupe for Bishop Labastida, had been hesitant to support the story of the vision. He concluded that Juan Diego had not existed.[47]\\r\\nIn 1995, Father Xavier Escalada, a Jesuit whose four volume Guadalupe encyclopedia had just been published, announced the existence of a sheet of parchment (known as Codex Escalada), which bore an illustrated account of the vision and some notations in Nahuatl concerning the life and death of Juan Diego. Previously unknown, the document was dated 1548. It bore the signatures of Antonio Valeriano and Bernardino de Sahag~n, which are considered to verify its contents. The codex was the subject of an appendix to the Guadalupe enciclopedia, published in 1997.[13] Some scholars remained unconvinced, one describing the discovery of the Codex as \\"rather like finding a picture of St. Paul's vision of Christ on the road to Damascus, drawn by St. Luke and signed by St. Peter.\\"[48]\\r\\nIn the earliest account of the apparition, the Nican Mopohua, the Virgin Mary tells Juan Bernardino, the uncle of Juan Diego, that the image left on the tilma is to be known by the name \\"the Perfect Virgin, Holy Mary of Guadalupe.\\"[49]\\r\\nScholars do not agree as to how the name \\"Guadalupe\\" was ascribed to the image.[50] Some believe that the Spanish transcribed or transliterated a Nahuatl name, as the site had long been an important sacred spot. Others hold that the Spanish name Guadalupe is the original name, and refers to the Spanish Our Lady of Guadalupe, Extremadura, whose cult had been important in Spain in the 16th century and had been brought to the New World with the Spanish conquest.\\r\\nThe first theory to promote a Nahuatl origin was that of Luis Becerra Tanco.[50] In his 1675 work Felicidad de Mexico, Becerra Tanco claimed that Juan Bernardino and Juan Diego would not have been able to understand the name Guadalupe because the \\"d\\" and \\"g\\" sounds do not exist in Nahuatl.\\r\\nHe proposed two Nahuatl alternative names that sound similar to \\"Guadalupe\\", Tecuatlanopeuh [tek?at??a?nope?], which he translates as \\"she whose origins were in the rocky summit\\", and Tecuantlaxopeuh [tek?ant??a??ope?], \\"she who banishes those who devoured us.\\"[50]\\r\\nOndina and Justo Gonzalez suggest that the name is a Spanish version of the Nahuatl term, Cotlaxopeuh [koa?t??a??ope?], which they interpret as meaning the one who crushes the serpent, and that it may be referring to the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl. In addition, Mary was portrayed in European art as crushing the serpent of the Garden of Eden.[51]\\r\\nAccording to another theory the juxtaposition of Guadalupe and a snake may indicate a nexus with the Aztec goddess of love and fertility, Tonantzin (in Nahuatl, \\"Our Revered Mother\\"), who was also known by the name Coatlcue (\\"The Serpent Skirt\\"). This appears to be borne out by the fact that this goddess had had a temple dedicated to her on the very Tepeyac Hill where Juan Diego had his vision, temple which had recently been destroyed at the behest of the new Catholic authorities. In the 16th century the Franciscans were suspicious that the cult of Guadalupe showed, or was susceptible to, elements of syncretism, i.e. the importation of an object of reverence in one belief system into another (see above).\\r\\nThe theory promoting the Spanish language origin of the name claims that:\\r\\nThe portrait was executed on a fabric support of natural material constituted by two pieces (originally three) joined together. The join is clearly visible as a seam passing from top to bottom, with the Virgin's face and hands and the head of the angel on the left piece. It passes through the left wrist of the Virgin. The fabric is mounted on a large metal sheet to which it has been glued for some time.[53] The image, currently set in a massive frame protected behind bullet-proof glass, hangs inclined at a slight angle on the wall of the basilica behind the altar. At this point, there is a wide gap between the wall and the sanctuary facilitating closer viewing from moving walkways set on the floor beneath the main level of the basilica, carrying people a short distance in either direction. Viewed from the main body of the basilica, the image is located above and to the right of the altar and is retracted at night into a small vault (accessible by steps) set into the wall.[54] An intricate metal crown designed by the painter Salom Pina according to plans devised by R‹ámulo Escudero and Prez Gallardo, and executed by the Parisian goldsmith, Edgar Morgan, is fixed above the image by a rod, and a massive Mexican flag is draped around and below the frame.[55]\\r\\nThe nature of the fabric is discussed below. Its measurements were taken by Jos Ignacio Bartolache on December 29, 1786 in the presence of Joseph Bernardo de Nava, a public notary: height 170?cm (67?in), width 105?cm (41?in).[56] The original height (before it was first shielded behind glass in the late 18th century, at which time the unpainted portion beyond the Virgin's head must have been cut down) was 229?cm (90?in).[57]\\r\\nNeither the fabric (\\"the support\\") nor the image (together, \\"the tilma\\") has been analyzed using the full range of resources now available to museum conservationists. Four technical studies have been conducted so far. Of these, the findings of at least three have been published. Each study required the permission of the custodians of the tilma in the Basilica. However, Callahan's study was taken at the initiative of a third party: the custodians did not know in advance what his research would reveal.\\r\\nSummary conclusions (\\"contra\\" indicates a contrary finding)\\r\\nThe iconography of the Virgin is fully Catholic:[65] Miguel Sanchez, the author of the 1648 tract Imagen de la Virgen Mara, described her as the Woman of the Apocalypse from the New Testament's Revelation 12:1, \\"clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars. She is described as a representation of the Immaculate Conception.[48]\\r\\nVirgil Elizondo says the image also had layers of meaning for the indigenous people of Mexico who associated her image with their polytheistic deities, which further contributed to her popularity.[66] Her blue-green mantle was the color reserved for the divine couple Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl;[67] her belt is interpreted as a sign of pregnancy; and a cross-shaped image, symbolizing the cosmos and called nahui-ollin, is inscribed beneath the image's sash.[68] She was called \\"mother of maguey,\\"[69] the source of the sacred beverage pulque.[70] Pulque was also known as \\"the milk of the Virgin.\\"[71] The rays of light surrounding her are seen to also represent maguey spines.[69]\\r\\nNuestra Se?ora de Guadalupe became the recognized symbol of Catholic Mexicans. Miguel Snchez, the author in 1648 of the first published account of the vision, identified Guadalupe as Revelation's Woman of the Apocalypse, and said:\\r\\n\\"...this New World has been won and conquered by the hand of the Virgin Mary?... [who had] prepared, disposed, and contrived her exquisite likeness in this her Mexican land, which was conquered for such a glorious purpose, won that there should appear so Mexican an image.\\"[48]\\r\\nThroughout the Mexican national history of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Guadalupan name and image have been unifying national symbols; the first President of Mexico (1824√ø29) changed his name from Jos Miguel Ram‹án Adaucto Fernndez y Flix to Guadalupe Victoria in honor of the Virgin of Guadalupe.[72] Father Miguel Hidalgo, in the Mexican War of Independence (1810), and Emiliano Zapata, in the Mexican Revolution (1910), led their respective armed forces with Guadalupan flags emblazoned with an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. In 1999, the Church officially proclaimed her the Patroness of the Americas, the Empress of Latin America, and the Protectress of Unborn Children.\\r\\nIn 1810 Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla initiated the bid for Mexican independence with his Grito de Dolores, with the cry \\"Death to the Spaniards and long live the Virgin of Guadalupe!\\" When Hidalgo's mestizo-indigenous army attacked Guanajuato and Valladolid, they placed \\"the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which was the insignia of their enterprise, on sticks or on reeds painted different colors\\" and \\"they all wore a print of the Virgin on their hats.\\"[72] After Hidalgo's death leadership of the revolution fell to a zambo/mestizo priest named Jos Mara Morelos, who led insurgent troops in the Mexican south. Morelos adopted the Virgin as the seal of his Congress of Chilpancingo, inscribing her feast day into the Chilpancingo constitution and declaring that Guadalupe was the power behind his victories:\\r\\nNew Spain puts less faith in its own efforts than in the power of God and the intercession of its Blessed Mother, who appeared within the precincts of Tepeyac as the miraculous image of Guadalupe that had come to comfort us, defend us, visibly be our protection.[72]\\r\\nSim‹án Bolvar noticed the Guadalupan theme in these uprisings, and shortly before Morelos's execution in 1815 wrote: \\"the leaders of the independence struggle have put fanaticism to use by proclaiming the famous Virgin of Guadalupe as the queen of the patriots, praying to her in times of hardship and displaying her on their flags?... the veneration for this image in Mexico far exceeds the greatest reverence that the shrewdest prophet might inspire.\\"[48]\\r\\nIn 1912, Emiliano Zapata's peasant army rose out of the south against the government of Francisco Madero. Though Zapata's rebel forces were primarily interested in land reform?√ø \\"tierra y libertad\\" ('land and liberty') was the slogan of the uprising?√ø when his peasant troops penetrated Mexico City they carried Guadalupan banners.[73] More recently, the contemporary Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) named their \\"mobile city\\" in honor of the Virgin: it is called Guadalupe Tepeyac. EZLN spokesperson Subcomandante Marcos wrote a humorous letter in 1995 describing the EZLN bickering over what to do with a Guadalupe statue they had received as a gift.[74]\\r\\nHarringon argues that:\\r\\nHernn Corts, the Conquistador who overthrew the Aztec empire in 1521, was a native of Extremadura, home to Our Lady of Guadalupe. By the 16th century the Extremadura Guadalupe, a statue of the Virgin said to be carved by Saint Luke the Evangelist, was already a national icon. It was found at the beginning of the 14th century when the Virgin appeared to a humble shepherd and ordered him to dig at the site of the apparition. The recovered Virgin then miraculously helped to expel the Moors from Spain, and her small shrine evolved into the great Guadalupe monastery.\\r\\nAccording to the traditional account, the name of Guadalupe was chosen by the Virgin herself when she appeared on the hill outside Mexico City in 1531, ten years after the Conquest.[76]\\r\\nGuadalupe continues to be a mixture of the cultures which blended to form Mexico, both racially and religiously,[77] \\"the first mestiza\\",[78] or \\"the first Mexican\\".[79] \\"bringing together people of distinct cultural heritages, while at the same time affirming their distinctness.\\"[80] As Jacques Lafaye wrote in Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe, \\"as the Christians built their first churches with the rubble and the columns of the ancient pagan temples, so they often borrowed pagan customs for their own cult purposes.\\"[81] The author Judy King asserts that Guadalupe is a \\"common denominator\\" uniting Mexicans. Writing that Mexico is composed of a vast patchwork of differences?√ø linguistic, ethnic, and class-based?√ø King says \\"The Virgin of Guadalupe is the rubber band that binds this disparate nation into a whole.\\"[79] The Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes once said that \\"you cannot truly be considered a Mexican unless you believe in the Virgin of Guadalupe.\\"[82] Nobel Literature laureate Octavio Paz wrote in 1974 that \\"the Mexican people, after more than two centuries of experiments, have faith only in the Virgin of Guadalupe and the National Lottery\\".[83]\\r\\nOne notable reference in literature to La Virgen of Guadalupe and her predecessor, the Aztec Earth goddess Tonantzn, is in Sandra Cisneros' short story \\"Little Miracles, Kept Promises,\\" from her collection Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories (1991). Cisneros' story is constructed out of brief notes that people give Our Lady of Guadalupe in thanks for favors received, which in Cisneros' hands becomes a portrait of an extended Chicano community living throughout Texas. \\"Little Miracles\\" ends with an extended narrative (pp. 124-29) of a feminist artist, Rosario \\"Chayo\\" De Leon, who at first didn't allow images of La Virgen de Guadalupe in her home because she associated her with subservience and suffering, particularly by Mexican women. But when she learns that Guadalupe's shrine is built on the same hill in Mexico City that had a shrine to Tonantzn, the Aztec Earth goddess and serpent destroyer, Chayo comes to understand that there's a deep, syncretic connection between the Aztec goddess and the Mexican saint; together they inspire Chayo's new artistic creativity, inner strength, and independence. In Chayo's words, \\"I finally understood who you are. No longer Mary the mild, but our mother Tonantzn. Your church at Tepeyac built on the site of her temple\\" (128).[84]\\r\\nOur Lady of Guadalupe, Juan Diego, and the tilma have been investigated through film several times in recent history. One of the most notable and thorough filmic investigations was done by director Tim Watkins in the 2013 film The Blood & The Rose.[85] Documentarians have been portraying the message of Our Lady of Guadalupe since the 1990s in an attempt to bring the message of the apparition to the North American audience.\\r\\nSeveral Pontiffs have granted recognitions to the venerated image, namely the following:\\r\\nRoman Catholic sources claim many miraculous and supernatural properties for the image such as that the tilma has maintained its structural integrity over nearly 500 years against soot, candle wax, incense, constant manual veneration by devotees and the historical fact that the image was displayed without any protective glass for the first 115 years when replicas normally last only about 15 years before suffering degradation,[92] and that it repaired itself with no external help after a 1791 accident in which nitric acid was spilled on the top right of the image, causing considerable damage but leaving the aureola of the Virgin intact.\\r\\nFurthermore, on 14 November 1921 a bomb hidden within a basket of flowers brought by anti-Catholic secularist damaged the altar, but left the tilma unharmed. A brass standing Crucifix, bent in the explosion, is now preserved at the shrine museum and is believed to be miraculous among devotees.[93]\\r\\nIn 1929 and 1951 photographers claimed to have found a figure reflected in the Virgin's eyes; upon inspection they said that the reflection was tripled in what is called the Purkinje effect, commonly found in human eyes.[94] An ophthalmologist, Dr. Jose Aste Tonsmann, later enlarged an image of the Virgin's eyes by 2500x and claimed to have found not only the aforementioned single figure, but images of all the witnesses present when the tilma was first revealed before Zumrraga in 1531, plus a small family group of mother, father, and a group of children, in the center of the Virgin's eyes, fourteen people in all.[95]\\r\\nNumerous Catholic websites repeat an unsourced claim[96] that in 1936 biochemist Richard Kuhn analyzed a sample of the fabric and announced that the pigments used were from no known source, whether animal, mineral or vegetable.[95] Dr. Philip Serna Callahan, who photographed the icon under infrared light, declared from his photographs that portions of the face, hands, robe, and mantle had been painted in one step, with no sketches or corrections and no visible brush strokes.[97]\\r\\nThe shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe is the most visited Catholic pilgrimage destination in the world. Over the Friday and Saturday of December 11 to 12, 2009, a record number of 6.1 million pilgrims visited the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City to commemorate the anniversary of the apparition.[98]\\r\\nThe Virgin of Guadalupe is considered the Patroness of Mexico and the Continental Americas; she is also venerated by Native Americans, on the account of the devotion calling for the conversion of the Americas. Replicas of the tilma can be found in thousands of churches throughout the world, and numerous parishes bear her name.\\r\\nDue to a claim that her black girdle indicates pregnancy on the image, the Blessed Virgin Mary, under this title is popularly invoked as Patroness of the Unborn and a common image for the Pro-Life movement.\\r\\nCoordinates: 192904N 990702W? / ?19.48444N 99.11722W? / 19.48444; -99.11722","input":"Where did the virgin of guadalupe first appear?"},{"output":"James Gosling","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nJava is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[15] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers \\"write once, run anywhere\\" (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,[18][19][20][21] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[22] Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latest version is Java 11, released on September 25, 2018, which follows Java 10 after only six months[23] in line with the new release schedule. Java 8 is still supported but there will be no more security updates for Java 9.[24] Versions earlier than Java 8 are supported by companies on a commercial basis; e.g. by Oracle back to Java 6 as of October 2017 (while they still \\"highly recommend that you uninstall\\"[25] pre-Java 8 from at least Windows computers).\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.[26] Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.[27] The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee.[28] Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nSun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.[30] It promised \\"Write Once, Run Anywhere\\" (WORA), providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.[31] With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 √ø 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.[32][33][34] Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process.[35] At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) as free and open-source software, (FOSS), under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM's core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nSun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal role with regard to Java was as an \\"evangelist\\".[37] Following Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009√ø10, Oracle has described itself as the \\"steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency\\".[38] This did not prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for using Java inside the Android SDK (see Google section below). Java software runs on everything from laptops to data centers, game consoles to scientific supercomputers.[39] On April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned from Oracle.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2016, Oracle announced that Java runtime environments based on JDK 9 will discontinue the browser plugin.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  20?March?2018[update], both Java 8 and 11 are officially supported.

Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. End users commonly use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their own machine for standalone Java applications, or in a web browser for Java applets.\\r\\n\\r\\nStandard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics, threading, and networking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. However, the overhead of interpreting bytecode into machine instructions made interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than native executables. Just-in-time (JIT) compilers that compile bytecodes to machine code during runtime were introduced from an early stage. Java itself is platform-independent and is adapted to the particular platform it is to run on by a Java virtual machine for it, which translates the Java bytecode into the platform's machine language.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrograms written in Java have a reputation for being slower and requiring more memory than those written in C++.[49][50] However, Java programs' execution speed improved significantly with the introduction of just-in-time compilation in 1997/1998 for Java 1.1,[51] the addition of language features supporting better code analysis (such as inner classes, the StringBuilder class, optional assertions, etc.), and optimizations in the Java virtual machine, such as HotSpot becoming the default for Sun's JVM in 2000. With Java 1.5, the performance was improved with the addition of the java.util.concurrent package, including lock free implementations of the ConcurrentMaps and other multi-core collections, and it was improved further with Java 1.6.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome platforms offer direct hardware support for Java; there are microcontrollers that can run Java bytecode in hardware instead of a software Java virtual machine,[52] and some ARM based processors could have hardware support for executing Java bytecode through their Jazelle option, though support has mostly been dropped in current implementations of ARM.\\r\\n\\r\\nJava uses an automatic garbage collector to manage memory in the object lifecycle. The programmer determines when objects are created, and the Java runtime is responsible for recovering the memory once objects are no longer in use. Once no references to an object remain, the unreachable memory becomes eligible to be freed automatically by the garbage collector. Something similar to a memory leak may still occur if a programmer's code holds a reference to an object that is no longer needed, typically when objects that are no longer needed are stored in containers that are still in use. If methods for a nonexistent object are called, a \\"null pointer exception\\" is thrown.[53][54]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the ideas behind Java's automatic memory management model is that programmers can be spared the burden of having to perform manual memory management. In some languages, memory for the creation of objects is implicitly allocated on the stack or explicitly allocated and deallocated from the heap. In the latter case, the responsibility of managing memory resides with the programmer. If the program does not deallocate an object, a memory leak occurs. If the program attempts to access or deallocate memory that has already been deallocated, the result is undefined and difficult to predict, and the program is likely to become unstable or crash. This can be partially remedied by the use of smart pointers, but these add overhead and complexity. Note that garbage collection does not prevent \\"logical\\" memory leaks, i.e., those where the memory is still referenced but never used.\\r\\n\\r\\nGarbage collection may happen at any time. Ideally, it will occur when a program is idle. It is guaranteed to be triggered if there is insufficient free memory on the heap to allocate a new object; this can cause a program to stall momentarily. Explicit memory management is not possible in Java.\\r\\n\\r\\nJava does not support C/C++ style pointer arithmetic, where object addresses and unsigned integers (usually long integers) can be used interchangeably. This allows the garbage collector to relocate referenced objects and ensures type safety and security.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in C++ and some other object-oriented languages, variables of Java's primitive data types are either stored directly in fields (for objects) or on the stack (for methods) rather than on the heap, as is commonly true for non-primitive data types (but see escape analysis). This was a conscious decision by Java's designers for performance reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nJava contains multiple types of garbage collectors. By default, HotSpot uses the parallel scavenge garbage collector.[55] However, there are also several other garbage collectors that can be used to manage the heap. For 90% of applications in Java, the Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) garbage collector is sufficient.[56] Oracle aims to replace CMS with the Garbage-First collector (G1).[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe syntax of Java is largely influenced by C++. Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for structured, generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language.[17] All code is written inside classes, and every data item is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types, (i.e. integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, and characters), which are not objects for performance reasons. Java reuses some popular aspects of C++ (such as the printf method).\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike C++, Java does not support operator overloading[58] or multiple inheritance for classes, though multiple inheritance is supported for interfaces.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nJava uses comments similar to those of C++. There are three different styles of comments: a single line style marked with two slashes (//), a multiple line style opened with /* and closed with */, and the Javadoc commenting style opened with /** and closed with */. The Javadoc style of commenting allows the user to run the Javadoc executable to create documentation for the program and can be read by some integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse to allow developers to access documentation within the IDE.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe traditional \\"Hello, world!\\" program can be written in Java as:[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nSource files must be named after the public class they contain, appending the suffix .java, for example, HelloWorldApp.java. It must first be compiled into bytecode, using a Java compiler, producing a file named HelloWorldApp.class. Only then can it be executed, or \\"launched\\". The Java source file may only contain one public class, but it can contain multiple classes with other than public access modifier and any number of public inner classes. When the source file contains multiple classes, make one class \\"public\\" and name the source file with that public class name.\\r\\n\\r\\nA class that is not declared public may be stored in any .java file. The compiler will generate a class file for each class defined in the source file. The name of the class file is the name of the class, with .class appended. For class file generation, anonymous classes are treated as if their name were the concatenation of the name of their enclosing class, a $, and an integer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe keyword public denotes that a method can be called from code in other classes, or that a class may be used by classes outside the class hierarchy. The class hierarchy is related to the name of the directory in which the .java file is located. This is called an access level modifier. Other access level modifiers include the keywords private and protected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe keyword static in front of a method indicates a static method, which is associated only with the class and not with any specific instance of that class. Only static methods can be invoked without a reference to an object. Static methods cannot access any class members that are not also static. Methods that are not designated static are instance methods and require a specific instance of a class to operate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe keyword void indicates that the main method does not return any value to the caller. If a Java program is to exit with an error code, it must call System.exit() explicitly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe method name \\"main\\" is not a keyword in the Java language. It is simply the name of the method the Java launcher calls to pass control to the program. Java classes that run in managed environments such as applets and Enterprise JavaBeans do not use or need a main() method. A Java program may contain multiple classes that have main methods, which means that the VM needs to be explicitly told which class to launch from.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main method must accept an array of String objects. By convention, it is referenced as args although any other legal identifier name can be used. Since Java 5, the main method can also use variable arguments, in the form of public static void main(String... args), allowing the main method to be invoked with an arbitrary number of String arguments. The effect of this alternate declaration is semantically identical (to the args parameter which is still an array of String objects), but it allows an alternative syntax for creating and passing the array.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Java launcher launches Java by loading a given class (specified on the command line or as an attribute in a JAR) and starting its public static void main(String[]) method. Stand-alone programs must declare this method explicitly. The String[] args parameter is an array of String objects containing any arguments passed to the class. The parameters to main are often passed by means of a command line.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrinting is part of a Java standard library: The System class defines a public static field called out. The out object is an instance of the PrintStream class and provides many methods for printing data to standard out, including println(String) which also appends a new line to the passed string.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe string \\"Hello World!\\" is automatically converted to a String object by the compiler.\\r\\n\\r\\nJava applets were programs that were embedded in other applications, typically in a Web page displayed in a web browser.  The Java applet API is now deprecated since Java 9 in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nJava servlet technology provides Web developers with a simple, consistent mechanism for extending the functionality of a Web server and for accessing existing business systems. Servlets are server-side Java EE components that generate responses (typically HTML pages) to requests (typically HTTP requests) from clients.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Java servlet API has to some extent been superseded by two standard Java technologies for web services:\\r\\n\\r\\nJavaServer Pages (JSP) are server-side Java EE components that generate responses, typically HTML pages, to HTTP requests from clients. JSPs embed Java code in an HTML page by using the special delimiters <% and %>. A JSP is compiled to a Java servlet, a Java application in its own right, the first time it is accessed. After that, the generated servlet creates the response.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwing is a graphical user interface library for the Java SE platform. It is possible to specify a different look and feel through the pluggable look and feel system of Swing. Clones of Windows, GTK+, and Motif are supplied by Sun. Apple also provides an Aqua look and feel for macOS. Where prior implementations of these looks and feels may have been considered lacking, Swing in Java SE 6 addresses this problem by using more native GUI widget drawing routines of the underlying platforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, generics were added to the Java language, as part of J2SE 5.0. Prior to the introduction of generics, each variable declaration had to be of a specific type. For container classes, for example, this is a problem because there is no easy way to create a container that accepts only specific types of objects. Either the container operates on all subtypes of a class or interface, usually Object, or a different container class has to be created for each contained class. Generics allow compile-time type checking without having to create many container classes, each containing almost identical code. In addition to enabling more efficient code, certain runtime exceptions are prevented from occurring, by issuing compile-time errors. If Java prevented all runtime type errors (ClassCastException's) from occurring, it would be type safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, the type system of Java was proven unsound.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nCriticisms directed at Java include the implementation of generics,[62] speed,[63] the handling of unsigned numbers,[64] the implementation of floating-point arithmetic,[65] and a history of security vulnerabilities in the primary Java VM implementation HotSpot.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Java Class Library is the standard library, developed to support application development in Java. It is controlled by Sun Microsystems in cooperation with others through the Java Community Process program. Companies or individuals participating in this process can influence the design and development of the APIs. This process has been a subject of controversy.[when?] The class library contains features such as:\\r\\n\\r\\nJavadoc is a comprehensive documentation system, created by Sun Microsystems, used by many Java developers[by whom?]. It provides developers with an organized system for documenting their code. Javadoc comments have an extra asterisk at the beginning, i.e. the delimiters are /** and */, whereas the normal multi-line comments in Java are set off with the delimiters /* and */.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle Corporation is the current owner of the official implementation of the Java SE platform, following their acquisition of Sun Microsystems on January 27, 2010. This implementation is based on the original implementation of Java by Sun. The Oracle implementation is available for Microsoft Windows (still works for XP, while only later versions are currently officially supported), macOS, Linux, and Solaris. Because Java lacks any formal standardization recognized by Ecma International, ISO/IEC, ANSI, or other third-party standards organization, the Oracle implementation is the de facto standard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oracle implementation is packaged into two different distributions: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which contains the parts of the Java SE platform required to run Java programs and is intended for end users, and the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is intended for software developers and includes development tools such as the Java compiler, Javadoc, Jar, and a debugger.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpenJDK is another notable Java SE implementation that is licensed under the GNU GPL. The implementation started when Sun began releasing the Java source code under the GPL. As of Java SE 7, OpenJDK is the official Java reference implementation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal of Java is to make all implementations of Java compatible. Historically, Sun's trademark license for usage of the Java brand insists that all implementations be \\"compatible\\". This resulted in a legal dispute with Microsoft after Sun claimed that the Microsoft implementation did not support RMI or JNI and had added platform-specific features of their own. Sun sued in 1997, and, in 2001, won a settlement of US$20?million, as well as a court order enforcing the terms of the license from Sun.[71] As a result, Microsoft no longer ships Java with Windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlatform-independent Java is essential to Java EE, and an even more rigorous validation is required to certify an implementation. This environment enables portable server-side applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Java programming language requires the presence of a software platform in order for compiled programs to be executed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle supplies the Java platform for use with Java. The Android SDK is an alternative software platform, used primarily for developing Android applications with its own GUI system. The Eclipse IDE platform supports Java, but provides its own GUI system SWT.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Java language is a key pillar in Android, an open source mobile operating system. Although Android, built on the Linux kernel, is written largely in C, the Android SDK uses the Java language as the basis for Android applications. The bytecode language supported by the Android SDK is incompatible with Java bytecode and runs on its own virtual machine, optimized for low-memory devices such as smartphones and tablet computers.\\r\\nDepending on the Android version, the bytecode is either interpreted by the Dalvik virtual machine or compiled into native code by the Android Runtime.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndroid does not provide the full Java SE standard library, although the Android SDK does include an independent implementation of a large subset of it. It supports Java 6 and some Java 7 features, offering an implementation compatible with the standard library (Apache Harmony).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of Java-related technology in Android led to a legal dispute between Oracle and Google. On May 7, 2012, a San Francisco jury found that if APIs could be copyrighted, then Google had infringed Oracle's copyrights by the use of Java in Android devices.[72] District Judge William Haskell Alsup ruled on May 31, 2012, that APIs cannot be copyrighted,[73] but this was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in May 2014.[74] On May 26, 2016, the district court decided in favor of Google, ruling the copyright infringement of the Java API in Android constitutes fair use.[75]","input":"Who is the inventor of java programming language?"},{"output":"10-year-old","context":"Abigail \\"Abby\\" Sciuto /??u?to?/ is a fictional character from the NCIS television series on CBS Television, and is portrayed by Pauley Perrette. In a season 10 episode entitled \\"Hit and Run\\", a young Abby was played by Brighton Sharbino in flashbacks. Like Jethro Gibbs, Anthony DiNozzo, and Dr. Donald Mallard, Abby was first introduced in the episodes \\"Ice Queen\\" and \\"Meltdown\\" of the television show JAG (which together served as the backdoor pilot for NCIS), and has appeared in every episode of NCIS, in addition to being featured on the show's spin-offs, NCIS: Los Angeles (two episodes) and NCIS: New Orleans (two episodes). The role has made Perrette one of the most popular actresses on U.S. primetime television in 2011,[3] according to Q Score.\\r\\nAbby Sciuto is a forensic scientist at the Naval Criminal Investigative Service headquarters at the Washington Navy Yard, with expertise in ballistics, digital forensics, and DNA analysis. In the first episode of the seventh season, \\"Truth or Consequences\\", DiNozzo, while under the influence of a truth serum, describes her as \\"a paradox wrapped in an oxymoron smothered in contradictions in terms. Sleeps in a coffin. Really, the happiest Goth you'll ever meet.\\"[4] Her gothic style of dress and her interest in death and the supernatural enigmatically contrast with her generally hyperactive demeanor and enthusiasm about her work.[5][unreliable source?]\\r\\nOn October 4, 2017, Perrette announced that she would be departing the show at the conclusion of season 15.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to taking up a career in acting, Pauley Perrette had studied at John Jay School of Criminal Science in New York, having previously aspired \\"to work with animals, be in a rock 'n' roll band, or be an FBI agent.\\"[6] She eventually began acting, later saying, \\"Theres no drug that I ever did that worked as well as being an actor. What youre looking for with substance abuse is escape. But with acting, you can escape into 1,000 different things without almost killing yourself doing it. Acting is a total drug!\\"[6]\\r\\nPerrette was cast for the role of Abby Sciuto in 2003. On the subject of her character's creation and its purpose, she said \\"[NCIS creator] Don Bellisario told me that when he created Magnum, P.I. he wanted to introduce a Vietnam vet who defied the negative stereotype. So with Abby, he wanted to take an alternative-style person with tattoos and make her someone who is happy, totally put together and successful. All the script said about her was: black hair, caffeinated and smart...She's completely unaware that anybody thinks she looks weird. She thinks she looks pretty and never calls herself anything other than happy. And I fight for that.\\"[7]\\r\\nChild actress Brighton Sharbino was cast to portray 10-year-old Abby for the season 10 episode \\"Hit and Run\\", which featured several flashbacks to a young Abby. Sharbino, who strongly resembled Perrette, reportedly spent time with the latter \\"in part to pick up on the NCIS vets mannerisms and such.\\"[1]\\r\\nAbby has a gothic style of dress,[1] including black dresses and T-shirts, miniskirts, and goth jewelry, including anklets and toe rings. She wears pigtailed dyed hair (due to Perrette's hair being dyed as she is a natural blonde[7]) and has at least nine tattoos on her neck, arms, back, ankle, and other places.[7] Her neck choker appears to be one of her favorite pieces of jewelry. While some of the tattoos are Perrette's and real, others are makeup, such as the large cross on her back applied on occasions when Perrette shows her bare back on camera.[8] The spider web on her neck is not real, either, as producer Bellisario wanted the character to have a tattoo that would be visible (almost) all the time. However, Perrette has expressed dislike for the spider tattoo, saying, \\"It only takes a few minutes to do, but it feels like old chewing gum,\\"[7] and wishes for an episode where Abby gets it removed.[8] Abby also has a stuffed hippo named \\"Bert\\" that makes flatulence noises when squeezed, which has been used for comic effect when Abby is upset.[5] She decorates some of the areas in her lab with toys such as 'Bleeding Edge Goth' dolls and 'Teddy Scares'. The Teddy Scare 'Rita Mortis' can be seen sitting next to her computer monitor. Abby's biggest pet peeve, as revealed in season five's \\"Lost and Found\\" by Timothy McGee, is people who claim to be vegetarians, but still eat chicken; her second-biggest pet peeve is people who mishandle evidence.[9]\\r\\nPauley Perrette commented, \\"Don (Bellisario) wanted to do Abby as an alternative-lifestyle person, but not as a junkie or a thief. She might be the smartest person on television.\\"[10] When asked about her depiction of a goth character, she responded that Abby \\"wouldn't call herself anything but Abby...What she represents is a smart, capable chick that cannot be reduced to a stereotype.\\"[11]\\r\\nAbby drives a candy-apple red 1930/31 Ford Model A coupe bearing a Washington, DC, personalized vanity plate \\"4NS CHIK\\" which is prominently featured in season five's \\"Dog Tags\\".[12] She previously drove a hearse (mentioned in \\"Hiatus, Part I\\"), which ran poorly and had bald tires.\\r\\nLike Gibbs, Abby enjoys caffeine,[7] primarily in the form of large cups of a fictional drink called \\"Caf-Pow\\". At times, when she is worried about the caffeine interfering with her sleep, she drinks \\"No-Caf-Pow\\" instead. (According to Perrette, the cups were originally filled with Hawaiian Punch, but when she stopped eating and drinking refined sugar, unsweetened cranberry juice was used in its place.)[13] When changing the artwork in her lab during \\"Hung Out to Dry\\", she states that she has a \\"Chagall feeling\\", a reference to Marc Chagall, a Jewish Belarusian artist whose main works came from fantasy and dreams. Her favorite term for something out of the ordinary is \\"hinky\\". It is also shown that she enjoys attending concerts, but her failure to wear earplugs at one of them left her with temporary hearing loss the next day, forcing her to ask DiNozzo for help analyzing some audio evidence.[14]\\r\\nAbby has shown a tendency to become very agitated, to the point of near-panic, if any of the team is seriously hurt. When Gibbs was admitted to hospital, Abby ended up on the verge of a nervous breakdown, pacing back and forth while delivering a rambling, disjointed stream-of-consciousness plea that explained (among other things) how close Gibbs and she were, the reason she was arriving after visiting hours, how she felt about Gibbs being injured, and how important it was to her that Gibbs not die from his injuries.\\r\\nAbby developed a fondness for Butch, a Navy sniffer dog, in the season five episode \\"Dog Tags\\". She renamed it \\"Jethro\\" in honour of Gibbs, because it was \\"handsome and quiet\\" like him. The dog was framed for the murder of a petty officer, as the dog was found at the murder victim's house, but Abby proved Jethro's innocence. Afterwards, Abby forced McGee to adopt the dog, much to his dismay (as Jethro had attacked him earlier in the episode). Abby would have preferred to adopt Jethro herself, but her landlord did not allow tenants to have pets.\\r\\nSciuto is portrayed as having a happy, normal childhood. Her younger brother, Luca, was first mentioned by name in the season-nine episode \\"Enemy on the Hill\\".[15] He appears in season 10 in a flashback.[16] She also mentioned that she has a niece[17] and that her grandmother was an Olympic swimmer who won a silver medal.[18] She has mentioned several uncles, including one named Teddy who owned a bar,[19] one named Horace whom she referred to as Horace \\"the Haggler\\" during an episode, and one named Larry who apparently wore knee-high socks and fanny packs.\\r\\nAbby is a hearing child adopted by deaf parents[20] and likes her music loud. In the episode \\"Seadog\\", Gibbs tells Tony that Abby knows how to use sign language because both of her parents were deaf. Abby has stated that she dreams of visiting the Galpagos Islands, Dollywood, and Israel before she dies.[21] Abby graduated with full honors from Louisiana State University with a triple major in sociology, criminology, and psychology. She earned her master's degree from Georgia State University in criminology and forensic science. Sciuto's interest in forensics came from living near a wrecking yard and being intrigued by the cause and effect of the wrecks.[21][22] The season nine episode \\"Enemy on the Hill\\" revealed that Abby has another brother, Kyle (played by Daniel Louis Rivas), who is her biological brother, as it is revealed that Abby is in fact adopted.[23]\\r\\nShe appears well-versed in her field of study;[5] she is rarely stumped by the puzzles that Gibbs' team presents to her. Abby has been shown to have skills in traditional forensics, computer forensics, and hacking. She has implied that she has a PhD in chemistry.[24] It has been shown that she does all the work on the evidence herself. In season three, when she was given an assistant, Charles \\"Chip\\" Sterling, she revolted, but eventually learned to put up with him. However, their working partnership did not last long, as Abby later discovered Sterling had framed DiNozzo for murder. Exposed, Chip threatened her with a knife; she promptly subdued him, hog-tied him with duct tape, and insisted on being allowed to work alone from then on, something to which then-Director Jenny Shepard agreed.\\r\\nIt has also been mentioned numerous times that she is a devout Roman Catholic and is on a bowling team with several nuns.\\r\\nIn the 2009 NCIS: Los Angeles episode \\"Random On Purpose\\", Abby is described as being in her late 20s, suggesting she was born in the early 1980s. (Actress Perrette was born in 1969, and was 40 when this episode first aired.) However, in a flashback in the 2013 NCIS episode \\"Hit and Run\\", Abby is shown to be 10 years old in the early 1980s, implying that she was born in the early 1970s.\\r\\nAbby gets along well with all the rest of the team.[5] She is very fond of Ducky, who uses her full name, Abigail. She is called Abby or Abbs by almost everyone else, except Director Leon Vance, who calls her Ms. Sciuto. Abby is fiercely loyal to the team, and considers them family, which is shown by her distress when one or more of them is in serious danger. Likewise, the team are generally fond of her and describe her as \\"the favorite\\".\\r\\nBefore her death in the line of duty, Special Agent Caitlin Todd was a close friend of Abby's. They often hung out after work, and Abby is one of the few to know what Kate's tattoo actually is.\\r\\nShe is friendly with Medical Assistant Jimmy Palmer. She has helped him with an autopsy and Rolfed him when he injured himself in the morgue in \\"Life Before His Eyes\\". In \\"Newborn King\\", Palmer brings his future father-in-law, Ed Slater, to NCIS. Later in the episode, McGee visits Abby to see she has locked the two in the back room. Jimmy states if Slater had not made a comment about Abby's tattoo, then they would not be in time out, implying he took Abby's side. Jimmy also chose Abby to be his \\"best woman\\" at his wedding in \\"The Missionary Position\\".[25]\\r\\nIn the episode \\"Crescent City\\", she is shown to have a relationship with Senior Special Agent Dwayne Cassius Pride, who runs the New Orleans NCIS office.\\r\\nGibbs is depicted as having a close (father/daughter-like) relationship with Abby, who is initially one of only two characters (the other one being Ducky) to have no fear of him. Gibbs is often seen giving Abby kisses on the cheek, and hugging her, especially when she does good work on her cases. He often brings her a fresh Caf-Pow when he arrives at the lab for information on a case, whether or not she has called him down to tell him about it. Gibbs generally tolerates Abby's goth dress style, knowing that she does a great job in her work, but often has to ask her to get to the point when she starts rambling. Abby sometimes turns to Gibbs when she needs to talk about something personal that is bothering her and he helps by listening to her. Both Gibbs and Abby are proficient with American Sign Language, as Abby grew up with deaf parents. On several occasions, Abby has been described as \\"the favorite\\", a fact that does not escape the rest of the team, but they do not begrudge her for it.\\r\\nGibbs is also very protective of Abby, especially when she is in very serious danger. For example, in the episode \\"Bloodbath\\", she was threatened by a hit man hired by a defendant in a case in which she was testifying, which was also complicated by an ex-boyfriend, Mikel Mawher[26] (guest star, Vincent Young), against whom she had a restraining order, but who then called her in violation of the order. When Gibbs found out about this, he pointedly told Mikel, \\"The only reason you're still able to walk is because I never heard about you until today!\\"[27]\\r\\nSometimes, that protectiveness extends from the rest of the team, as well. For example, in the episode \\"Spider and the Fly\\", Alejandro Rivera came to NCIS and began to threaten Abby for not sending in a report about the murder of Pedro Hernandez, Rivera's father, whom Gibbs had killed 20 years previously in revenge for Hernandez killing Gibbs' first wife, Shannon, and young daughter, Kelly. The entire team, including Ducky and Vance, ordered him to leave her alone and to not harass her, or to be escorted forcibly from NCIS Headquarters. Rivera eventually left of his own accord, but was later arrested for attempting to kill Gibbs and his father at a safehouse, and accidentally killing his sister, Paloma.\\r\\nGibbs' concern for Abby's safety is such that he will even drop his trademark cup of coffee if she is in serious danger. Twice this occurred: in the episode \\"Kill Ari\\" when Ari shot at her while she was in her lab, the other time was in the episode \\"Driven\\" when she was trapped inside an experimental Humvee, which had been rigged to fill with exhaust fumes and suffocate its occupants.\\r\\nAbby was at first cold to Ziva David when the latter first arrived at NCIS as she, like the rest of the team, was still grieving over Kate Todd's death and the fact that Ziva was Ari Haswari's half-sister. Abby would scribble over pictures of Ziva and frequently mispronounce her surname to annoy her. Later, upset by Ziva's calm response to Gibbs being injured in a bombing, Abby slapped her.\\r\\nAbby eventually came around, and Ziva and she became good friends. This was solidified in the episode \\"Capitol Offense\\" when Ziva, in gratitude for Abby allowing her to stay at her place (Ziva's home was being fumigated for termites), bought her a \\"chocoholic's choice\\" cupcake. The cupcake soon vanished, and Abby brought out all her forensic know-how to find it. Ultimately, McGee was found to have taken the cupcake, angering Abby and the others. At first, Ziva flinched whenever Abby would hug her given that she did not know why Abby did so, but eventually she came to accept Abby's hugs without any trouble.\\r\\nIn the season-seven finale, Abby was shown to be present at Ziva's citizenship ceremony, along with Ducky, McGee, and Jimmy Palmer.\\r\\nLater in the episode \\"Gone\\", the two bonded more when Ziva took in a teenaged girl who witnessed her father's murder and best friend's kidnapping as they both tried to help the girl feel at ease throughout the ongoing investigation.\\r\\nAfter Ziva's father was gunned down in \\"Shabbat Shalom\\", Abby was shown baking cookies in an attempt to help her feel better.\\r\\nAbby's relationship with Tony is a friendly one, with the two making friendly, nonhostile jibes at each other, and squabbling about various topics, such as movies and personal possessions. Abby is perhaps the only member of the NCIS cast who displays a love and knowledge of movies that even comes close to matching Tony's. In \\"Twilight\\", after Tony narrowly avoids being part of an explosion on his first day back from sick leave after getting pneumonic plague, she runs at him and hugs him so hard he nearly falls over. In the episode, \\"Frame-Up\\", she almost single-handedly unravels the forensic evidence used to frame Tony of murder to clear his name, then subdues the killer?√ø her assistant Chip Sterling?√ø when he threatens her with a knife.[5] The explosion of Tony's car in \\"Bury Your Dead\\" causes her to become increasingly obsessed with her work, to prevent thoughts of his possible death. In \\"Reunion\\", after Tony, McGee, and Gibbs rescue Ziva from Somalia, Abby starts with a rant criticizing Ziva for her continuing mistrust of Tony, which, in trademarked Abby fashion, ends with her saying how worried she was about Ziva, and hugging her. This then sparks a confrontation between Tony and Ziva that causes their relationship to be restored to normal. Tony would sometimes join Abby in her lab and act like Gibbs when he was absent.\\r\\nShe had a relationship with McGee which she stated that she would like to keep casual during season one. Although the relationship ended late in the same season, they both have exhibited jealousy when someone of the opposite sex pays attention to the other.[5] Some erotic teasing and tension continues between the two for the next several seasons, implied through such facts as McGee's apparent ability to describe the inside of Abby's bedroom in his novel. After finding out Abby sleeps in a coffin, he said, \\"You told me it was a box sofa,\\" indicating he has at least stayed over. The implications went farther when he added, \\"I can't believe I slept in a coffin,\\" and she impishly replied, \\"Not just slept.\\" In the episode \\"Bloodbath\\" when Abby's life is threatened and the team sends her home with McGee, Abby is revealed at one point to have kept a toothbrush at McGee's apartment.\\r\\nTheir flirtation became less prominent in later seasons, and TV Guide Senior Critic Matt Roush suggested this was due to the producers' apprehension about using romance within the series to an excess.[28] He reasoned, \\"pairing up all four members of Gibbs' team romantically might seem like overkill, and the Tony-Ziva dynamic (even if not exactly acted upon) is so integral to the show's core that I'm not surprised they've kept McGee and Abby on more of a loving-sibling level.\\"[28] He further opined that he \\"wouldn't expect it to change\\".[28]\\r\\nAbby is called Abigail by Ducky, who addresses her by her full first name often. Though in the episode \\"Faking It\\", he thanked her and called her by using the name \\"Abby\\" instead of \\"Abigail\\". Abby used to have a fear of autopsy tables, which she shares with Ducky in episode 16 of season one, \\"Bte Noire\\" when Ducky and Kate are held hostage.\\r\\nIn the NCIS: Los Angeles episode \\"Random on Purpose\\", Abby, having been previously seen on video conference or talking to someone from her lab in Washington, DC, arrived in Los Angeles to meet the Office of Special Projects (OSP) team as she informed them she was investigating a serial killer called the Phantom who had murdered 15 people all over the country and had also left no DNA or even physical evidence at the scenes.\\r\\nHaving already formed a strong friendship with Eric Beale, Abby developed friendships with the OSP team, including G. Callen (Chris O'Donnell), Sam Hanna (LL Cool J), and most notably the operations manager Hetty Lange (Linda Hunt), who commented that Abby is \\"the first NCIS employee [she] has ever met with a sense of style\\".[29] Kensi Blye, another NCIS Special Agent, who is an expert in forensics, praised Abby for her high levels of thinking, stating that she lived up to the hype.\\r\\nAbby was later kidnapped by the Phantom, later revealed to be a law firm receptionist named Tom Smith, who sought to kill her to keep his identity a secret, as he hoped to go around killing more people, having developed something of a taste for it. Although Vance mentioned that Gibbs and the NCIS Major Case Response Team were en route to Los Angeles to rescue her, Abby was saved due to the efforts of the OSP team and was later seen telling Gibbs and McGee on a video-conferencing link that she was okay.\\r\\nTo date, Abby has not returned to Los Angeles nor has she reappeared in any video-conference calls which strongly suggests that her appearances in season one were just one-offs.\\r\\nDuring the first season of NCIS, Ross Warneke from The Age wrote of the character, \\"Her role is pivotal in the show because, as with so many crime series these days, the forensics laboratory is the scene of much of the action. Perrette's only shortcoming is her diction. Am I the only one who has difficulty understanding her?\\"[30] In January 2005, Bill Keveney from USA Today compared the characters on NCIS to those on Magnum, P.I. and commented, \\"the tattooed Abby, the presumed slacker who is anything but, is Bellisario's not-what-she-appears-to-be tribute to Magnum, a functioning, well-balanced Vietnam vet who contrasted many depictions of the era.\\"[10] New York Times writer Bill Carter described Abby as \\"television's only regular goth personality\\" in October of the same year.[31]\\r\\nLater in the show's run, reception continued to be mostly positive, with some critics regarding her as \\"easily the most outgoing and affectionate member of the group\\".[32] In 2009, David Martingale of Star-Telegram wrote, \\"Abby Sciuto, a forensics scientist who, with her caffeine-fueled high energy and kooky Goth/cheerleader wardrobe, is one of a kind\\".[33] June Thomas from Slate Magazine noted in November 2011 that, \\"Abby may look like a freak, but she's a church-going patriot.\\"[34] She has been described as \\"spacy\\"[35] and \\"a witty, lovable personality with forensic skills that are even greater than her charm.\\"[5]\\r\\nC. Coville from Cracked criticized the choice to describe Abby's age as \\"late twenties\\" in her 2009 guest appearance on NCIS: Los Angeles, finding it unbelievable for someone who \\"has still somehow picked up a PhD in chemistry, bachelor's degrees in sociology, criminology, and psychology, and good knowledge of hacking and computer forensic science\\".[36]\\r\\nIn March 2011, AOL named Abby as number 95 on a list of the 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters.[37] In April 2013, a study by E-Poll Market Research listed Pauley Perrette and Cote de Pablo, who portrays Ziva David, among the top 10 most appealing celebrities in America.[38] Perrette and de Pablo were ranked as numbers 5 and 3 respectively.[39]\\r\\nSciuto is an Italian surname, suggesting that the character is meant to be Italian-American.[40]","input":"How old is the character abby on ncis?"},{"output":"a modification of the constitution of a nation or state","context":"A constitutional amendment is a modification of the constitution of a nation or state. In many jurisdictions the text of the constitution itself is altered; in others the text is not changed, but the amendments change its effect. The method of modification is typically written into the constitution itself.\\r\\nMost constitutions require that amendments cannot be enacted unless they have passed a special procedure that is more stringent than that required of ordinary legislation. Examples of such special procedures include supermajorities in the legislature, or direct approval by the electorate in a referendum, or even a combination of two or more different special procedures. A referendum to amend the constitution may also be triggered in some jurisdictions by popular initiative.\\r\\nAustralia and Ireland provide examples of constitutions requiring that all amendments are first passed by the legislature before being submitted to the people; in the case of Ireland, a simple majority of those voting at the electorate is all that is required, whereas a more complex set of criteria must be met in Australia (a majority of voters in a majority of states is also necessary). Switzerland has procedure similar to that of Australia.\\r\\nThe special procedures for the amendment of some constitutions have proven to be so exacting that of proposed amendments either few (8 Amendments out of 44 proposed), as in Australia, or none, as in Japan, have been passed over a period of several decades. In contrast, the constitution of the U.S. state of Alabama has been amended over 800 times since 1901.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a number of formal differences, from one jurisdiction to another, in the manner in which constitutional amendments are both originally drafted and written down once they become law. In some jurisdictions, such as Ireland, Estonia, and Australia, constitutional amendments originate as bills and become laws in the form of acts of parliament. This may be the case notwithstanding the fact that a special procedure is required to bring an amendment into force. Thus, for example, in Ireland and Australia although amendments are drafted in the form of Acts of Parliament they cannot become law until they have been approved in a referendum. By contrast, in the United States a proposed amendment originates as a special joint resolution of Congress that does not require the President to sign and that the President can not veto.\\r\\nThe manner in which constitutional amendments are finally recorded takes two main forms. In most jurisdictions, amendments to a constitution take the form of revisions to the previous text.[citation needed] Thus, once an amendment has become law, portions of the original text may be deleted or new articles may be inserted among existing ones. The second, less common method, is for amendments to be appended to the end of the main text in the form of special articles of amendment, leaving the body of the original text intact. Although the wording of the original text is not altered, the doctrine of implied repeal applies. In other words, in the event of conflict, an article of amendment will usually take precedence over the provisions of the original text, or of an earlier amendment. Nonetheless, there may still be ambiguity whether an amendment is intended to supersede or to supplement an existing article in the text.\\r\\nAn article of amendment may, however, explicitly express itself as having the effect of repealing a specific existing article.[1] The use of appended articles of amendment is most famous as a feature of the United States Constitution, but it is also the method of amendment in a number of other jurisdictions, such as Venezuela.\\r\\nUnder the 1919 German Weimar Constitution, the prevailing legal theory was that any law reaching the necessary supermajorities in both chambers of parliament was free to deviate from the terms of the constitution, without itself becoming part of the constitution. This very wide conception of \\"amendment\\" eased the rise of Adolf Hitler to power; it was consequently explicitly ruled out in the postwar 1949 constitution, which allows amendments only by explicitly changing the constitution's text.\\r\\nThe Treaties of the European Union are a set of international treaties between member states that describe the constitutional basis of the European Union. Prior to the Treaty of Lisbons entry into force in 2009, there was only one procedure for the revision of the treaties on which the EU is based: the convening of an intergovernmental conference. Since 2009, Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union has laid down two procedures for the revision of the treaties.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution of Austria is unusually liberal in terms of constitutional amendments. Any piece of parliamentary legislation can be designated as \\"constitutional law\\", i.e., as a part of the constitution if the required supermajority and other formalities for an amendment are met. An amendment may take the form of a change of the Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz, the centerpiece of the constitution, a change to another constitutional act, a new constitutional act, or of a section of constitutional law in a non-constitutional act. Furthermore, international treaties can be enacted as constitutional law, as happened in the case of the European Convention of Human Rights. Over the decades, frequent amendments and, in some cases, the intention to immunize pieces of legislation from judicial review, have led to much \\"constitutional garbage\\" consisting of hundreds of constitutional provisions spread all over the legal system. This has led to calls for reform.[citation needed]\\r\\nA majority of two-thirds in the National Council (parliament). Only in the case of a fundamental change (Gesamt?nderung) of the constitution a confirmation by referendum is required. Since 1945, this has only happened once when Austria's accession to the European Union was approved by popular vote.\\r\\nIf a constitutional amendment limits the powers of the states, a two-thirds majority in the Federal Council of Austria is required as well. Depending on the matter on hand, two-thirds of the Federal Councilors present (attendance of one-half of all Councilors is required), or two-thirds of all Federal Councilors must approve. If the amendment would change articles 34 or 35, the majority of councilors of at least four of the nine states is an additional requirement.\\r\\nThe Constitution of Belgium can be amended by the federal legislative power, which consists of the King (in practice, the Federal Government) and the Federal Parliament. In order to amend the Constitution, the federal legislative power must declare the reasons to revise the Constitution in accordance with Article 195. This is done by means of two so-called Declarations of Revision of the Constitution, one adopted by the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate, and one signed by the King and the Federal Government.\\r\\nFollowing this declaration, the Federal Parliament is automatically dissolved and a new federal election must take place. This makes it impossible to amend the Constitution unless an election has intervened. Following the election, the new Federal Parliament can amend those articles that have been declared revisable. Neither Chamber can consider amendments to the Constitution unless at least two-thirds of its members are present and the Constitution can only be amended if at least two-thirds of the votes cast are in favour of the amendment.\\r\\nUnder the current Constitution of Bulgaria (1991), there are two procedures for amendment, depending on the part of the constitution to be amended:[3]\\r\\nThis procedure is viewed by some critics as too slow and ineffective.[4] There are voices in Bulgaria to remove the institution of Great National Assembly, which they view as an anachronism and to adopt a new procedure of constitutional amendment through popular vote.\\r\\nPassage of a constitutional act in the Czech Republic can only be accomplished through the agreement of three-fifths of all Deputies and Senators present at the time the proposed act is laid before each house of Parliament.[5] It is the only type of legislation that does not require the signature of the President to become law.[6] Furthermore, it is the only type of legislation the President cannot veto.[7]\\r\\nThe Constitution of Denmark provides an example of multiple special procedures that must be followed. After an amendment has been approved by parliament, a general election must be held; the new parliament must then approve the amendment again before it is finally submitted to a referendum. There is also a requirement that at least 40% of eligible voters must vote at the referendum in order for an amendment to be validly passed.\\r\\nThe Constitution of Estonia can only be modified by three-fifths majority in two successive complements of Parliament, and a referendum for certain chapters.[8]\\r\\nAmendments to the Constitution of France must first be passed by both houses with identical terms, and then need approval either by a simple majority in a referendum or by a three-fifths majority of the two houses of the French parliament jointly convened in Congress.\\r\\nThe Constitution of Ireland, can only be modified by referendum, following proposal approved by the lower and upper houses of the Oireachtas, amongst citizens entitled to vote for the President. The amendment succeeds by simple majority, and no quorum is required.\\r\\nArticle 138 of the Constitution provides for the special procedure through which the Parliament can adopt constitutional laws (including laws to amend the Constitution of Italy).[9] Constitutional laws start by following the ordinary legislative procedure, which requires both houses of parliament to approve the law in the same text, with a simple majority (i.e. the majority of votes cast). However, after having been approved for the first time, they need to be voted for by both houses a second time, which can happen no sooner than three months after the first. In this second reading, no new amendments to the bill may be proposed: the bill must be either approved or rejected in its entirety.\\r\\nThe constitutional law needs to be approved by at least a majority of MPs in each house (absolute majority) in its second reading. Depending on the results of this second vote, the constitutional law may then follow two different paths.\\r\\nOnly three constitutional referendums have ever been held in Italy: in 2001 (in which the constitutional law was approved), in 2006, and in 2016 (in which they were rejected).\\r\\nArticle Five of the United States Constitution describes the process whereby the federal Constitution may be altered. Twenty-seven amendments have been added (appended as codicils) to the Constitution.\\r\\nAmendment proposals may be adopted and sent to the states for ratification by either:\\r\\nAll thirty-three amendment proposals that have been sent to the states for ratification since the establishment of the Constitution have come into being via the Congress. State legislatures have however, at various times, used their power to apply for a national convention in order to pressure Congress into proposing a desired amendment. For example, the movement to amend the Constitution to provide for the direct election of senators began to see such proposals regularly pass the House of Representatives only to die in the Senate from the early 1890s onward. As time went by, more and more state legislatures adopted resolutions demanding that a convention be called, thus pressuring the Senate to finally relent and approve what later became the Seventeenth Amendment for fear that such a conventionif permitted to assemblemight stray to include issues above and beyond just the direct election of senators.\\r\\nTo become an operative part of the Constitution, an amendment, whether proposed by Congress or a national constitutional convention, must be ratified by either:\\r\\nCongress has specified the state legislature ratification method for all but one amendment. The ratifying convention method was used for the Twenty-first Amendment, which became part of the Constitution in 1933.\\r\\nSince the turn of the 20th century, amendment proposals sent to the states for ratification have generally contained a seven-year ratification deadline, either in the body of the amendment or in the resolving clause of the joint resolution proposing it. The Constitution does not expressly provide for a deadline on the state legislatures' or state ratifying conventions' consideration of proposed amendments. In Dillon v. Gloss (1921), the Supreme Court affirmed that Congressif it so desirescould provide a deadline for ratification. An amendment with an attached deadline that is not ratified by the required number of states within the set time period is considered inoperative and rendered moot.\\r\\nAn amendment becomes operative as soon as it reaches the three-fourths of the states threshold. Then, once certified by the Archivist of the United States, it officially takes its place as an article of the Constitution.\\r\\nState constitutions in the U.S. are amended on a regular basis.[10] In 19 states, the state constitutions have been amended at least 100 times.[10]\\r\\nAmendments are often necessary because of the length of state constitutions, which are, on average, three times longer than the federal constitution, and because state constitutions typically contain extensive detail.[10] In addition, state constitutions are often easier to amend than the federal constitution.[10]\\r\\nIndividual states differ in the difficulty of constitutional amendments.[11] Some states allow for initiating the amendment process through action of the state legislature or by popular initiative.[11]\\r\\nThere are three methods for proposing an amendment to the California State Constitution: by the legislature, by constitutional convention, or by voter initiative. A proposed amendment must be approved by a majority of voters.\\r\\nWith the legislative method, a proposed amendment must be approved by an absolute supermajority of two-thirds of the membership of each house.\\r\\nWith the convention method, the legislature may, by a two-thirds absolute supermajority, submit to the voters at a general election the question whether to call a convention to revise the Constitution. If the majority of the voters vote yes on that question, within six months the Legislature shall provide for the convention. Delegates to a constitutional convention shall be voters elected from districts as nearly equal in population as may be practicable. The constitution does not provide many rules for the operation of the constitutional convention.\\r\\nWith the initiative method, an amendment is proposed by a petition signed by voters equal in number to 8% of the votes for all candidates for governor at the last gubernatorial election. The proposed amendment is then submitted to the voters at a general or special election.\\r\\nThere are two methods of proposing amendments to the New York Constitution. All proposed amendments must be approved by a majority of voters in a referendum.\\r\\nWith the legislative method, an amendment proposal must published for three months, then approved by an absolute majority of the members of each of the two houses, and approved again in a succeeding term of the houses, with an election intervening. Finally, the amendment proposal must be submitted to the people, and for ratification must be approved by a simple majority.\\r\\nWith the convention method, a constitutional convention must be convened by a majority vote of voters in a general election (referendum) on the question.\\r\\nThere are two methods for proposing amendments to the Tennessee State Constitution: through the legislature and by constitutional convention. Proposed amendments must be approved by a majority of voters in a referendum.\\r\\nWith the legislative method, the Tennessee General Assembly passes a resolution calling for an amendment and stating its wording. This must pass in three separate readings on three separate days, with an absolute majority on all readings. It does not require the governor's approval. It must then be published at least six months before the next legislative election in newspapers of wide and general circulation. (This is done by precedent but is not required by law.) After the election, the proposed amendment must go through the same procedure (absolute majority on three separate readings). Then it is put on the ballot as a referendum in the next gubernatorial election. To be ratified it must again achieve an absolute majority of those voting in the gubernatorial election.\\r\\nWith the convention method, the legislature can put on any ballot the question of whether to call a constitutional convention. It must be stated whether the convention is limited or unlimitedthat is, whether it can only amend the current constitution or totally abolish it and write a new one. If limited, the call must state which provisions of the current constitution are to be subject to amendment, and the subsequent convention, if approved, is limited to considering only amendments to the provisions specified in the call. The proposed amendments must then be submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority of those voting in the election. A constitutional convention cannot be held more frequently than once every six years.\\r\\nThe only method for proposing an amendment to the Texas State Constitution is through the legislature, either in regular or special session. The governor may call a special session, and specify the agenda for the session. To become part of the constitution, proposed amendments must be approved by a majority of voters in a referendum. Texas has had six different constitutions and the current constitution, adopted in 1876, has been amended 474 times.\\r\\nA proposed amendment must be approved by an absolute supermajority of two-thirds of the elected membership of each house of the legislature. It is submitted to the voters in an election specified by the legislature. The wording of an explanatory statement that will appear on the ballot must be approved by the Texas Attorney General and printed in newspapers. The full text of the amendment must be posted by all county clerks for 30 days before the election.\\r\\nThe only method for proposing an amendment to the Washington State Constitution is through the legislature and can originate in either branch. The proposal must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the legislature. The proposed amendment is placed on the ballot at the next general election, and must be approved by a majority of the electors.\\r\\nThe procedure for amending the Constitution of Australia is detailed in Section 128 of the Constitution.\\r\\nIt firstly requires that the proposal pass by absolute majority in the House of Representatives. This means that out of the 150 members of the House, at least 76 of them must agree to the proposal.\\r\\nIf this succeeds then the proposal is moved to the Senate where it again must achieve an absolute majority, This means that of the 76 members of the Senate, at least 39 of them must agree to the proposal.\\r\\nFollowing this, Australians then vote on the proposal. For a referendum to succeed both of the following must be achieved\\r\\nThe double majority is a major factor in why since 1906 out of 44 referendums only 8 have been successful.\\r\\nThe Constitution of South Africa can be amended by an Act of Parliament, but special procedures and requirements apply to the passage of constitutional amendments. A bill amending the Constitution must be introduced in the National Assembly, and cannot contain any provisions other than constitutional amendments and directly related matters.[12]\\r\\nAt least 30 days before a constitutional amendment bill is introduced in the National Assembly, the person or committee introducing the amendment must publish it for public comment, submit it to the provincial legislatures, and, if it does not have to be passed by the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), submit it to the NCOP for debate. When the bill is introduced, the comments received must be tabled in the National Assembly, and in the NCOP when appropriate.[12]\\r\\nAll amendments must be passed by an absolute two-thirds supermajority in the National Assembly (the lower house); as the Assembly has 400 members this requires 267 members to vote for the amendment. Most amendments do not have to be considered by the NCOP (the upper house). Amendments of the Bill of Rights, and amendments affecting the role of the NCOP, the \\"boundaries, powers, functions or institutions\\" of the provinces or provisions \\"dealing specifically with provincial matters\\" must also be passed by the NCOP with a supermajority of at least six of the nine provinces. If an amendment affects a specific province, it must also be approved by the legislature of the province concerned. Section 1, which defines South Africa as \\"one, sovereign, democratic state\\" and lists its founding values, is a specially entrenched clause and can only be amended by a three-quarters supermajority in the National Assembly and six of the provinces in the NCOP.[12]\\r\\nOnce an Act is passed by the National Assembly, and by the NCOP if necessary, it must be signed and assented to by the President. As with any other Act of Parliament, by default an amendment comes into effect when it is published in the Government Gazette, but the text of the amendment may specify some other date of commencement, or allow the President to specify one by notice in the Gazette.[13]\\r\\nSome constitutions use entrenched clauses to restrict the kind of amendment to which they may be subject. This is usually to protect characteristics of the state considered sacrosanct, such as the democratic form of government or the protection of human rights. Amendments are often totally forbidden during a state of emergency or martial law.","input":"What does an amendment to the constitution mean?"},{"output":"W. W. Norton & Company","context":"W. W.

It fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC, and after his death, it became part of the Greek Seleucid Empire.\\r\\nAround 150 BC, Mesopotamia was under the control of the Parthian Empire. Mesopotamia became a battleground between the Romans and Parthians, with western parts of Mesopotamia coming under ephemeral Roman control. In AD 226, eastern part of it fell to the Sassanid Persians. Division of Mesopotamia between Roman (Byzantine from AD 395) and Sassanid Empires lasted until the 7th century Muslim conquest of Persia of the Sasanian Empire and Muslim conquest of the Levant from Byzantines. A number of primarily neo-Assyrian and Christian native Mesopotamian states existed between the 1st century BC and 3rd century AD, including Adiabene, Osroene, and Hatra.\\r\\nMesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BC. It has been identified as having \\"inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops and the development of cursive script, mathematics, astronomy and agriculture.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe regional toponym Mesopotamia (/?m?s?p??te?mi?/, Ancient Greek: ’öœ´?œ´ \\"[land] between rivers\\"; Arabic: ???? ????????? ??? ???????? bild ar-rfidayn; Kurdish: ????????????; Persian: ??????????? miyn rudn; Syriac: ??? ?????? Beth Nahrain \\"land of rivers\\") comes from the ancient Greek root words ?? (meso) \\"middle\\" and œ´?? (potamos) \\"river\\" and literally means \\"(Land) between two/the rivers\\". It is used throughout the Greek Septuagint (ca. 250 BC) to translate the Hebrew equivalent Naharaim. An even earlier Greek usage of the name Mesopotamia is evident from The Anabasis of Alexander, which was written in the late 2nd century AD, but specifically refers to sources from the time of Alexander the Great. In the Anabasis, Mesopotamia was used to designate the land east of the Euphrates in north Syria.\\r\\nThe Aramaic term biritum/birit narim corresponded to a similar geographical concept.[3] Later, the term Mesopotamia was more generally applied to all the lands between the Euphrates and the Tigris, thereby incorporating not only parts of Syria but also almost all of Iraq and southeastern Turkey.[4] The neighbouring steppes to the west of the Euphrates and the western part of the Zagros Mountains are also often included under the wider term Mesopotamia.[5][6][7]\\r\\nA further distinction is usually made between Northern or Upper Mesopotamia and Southern or Lower Mesopotamia.[8] Upper Mesopotamia, also known as the Jazira, is the area between the Euphrates and the Tigris from their sources down to Baghdad.[5] Lower Mesopotamia is the area from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf and includes Kuwait and parts of western Iran.[8]\\r\\nIn modern academic usage, the term Mesopotamia often also has a chronological connotation. It is usually used to designate the area until the Muslim conquests, with names like Syria, Jazirah, and Iraq being used to describe the region after that date.[4][9] It has been argued that these later euphemisms are Eurocentric terms attributed to the region in the midst of various 19th-century Western encroachments.[9][10]\\r\\nMesopotamia encompasses the land between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, both of which have their headwaters in the Armenian Highlands. Both rivers are fed by numerous tributaries, and the entire river system drains a vast mountainous region. Overland routes in Mesopotamia usually follow the Euphrates because the banks of the Tigris are frequently steep and difficult. The climate of the region is semi-arid with a vast desert expanse in the north which gives way to a 15,000 square kilometres (5,800?sq?mi) region of marshes, lagoons, mud flats, and reed banks in the south. In the extreme south, the Euphrates and the Tigris unite and empty into the Persian Gulf.\\r\\nThe arid environment which ranges from the northern areas of rain-fed agriculture to the south where irrigation of agriculture is essential if a surplus energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) is to be obtained. This irrigation is aided by a high water table and by melting snows from the high peaks of the northern Zagros Mountains and from the Armenian Highlands, the source of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers that give the region its name. The usefulness of irrigation depends upon the ability to mobilize sufficient labor for the construction and maintenance of canals, and this, from the earliest period, has assisted the development of urban settlements and centralized systems of political authority.\\r\\nAgriculture throughout the region has been supplemented by nomadic pastoralism, where tent-dwelling nomads herded sheep and goats (and later camels) from the river pastures in the dry summer months, out into seasonal grazing lands on the desert fringe in the wet winter season. The area is generally lacking in building stone, precious metals and timber, and so historically has relied upon long-distance trade of agricultural products to secure these items from outlying areas. In the marshlands to the south of the area, a complex water-borne fishing culture has existed since prehistoric times, and has added to the cultural mix.\\r\\nPeriodic breakdowns in the cultural system have occurred for a number of reasons. The demands for labor has from time to time led to population increases that push the limits of the ecological carrying capacity, and should a period of climatic instability ensue, collapsing central government and declining populations can occur. Alternatively, military vulnerability to invasion from marginal hill tribes or nomadic pastoralists has led to periods of trade collapse and neglect of irrigation systems. Equally, centripetal tendencies amongst city states has meant that central authority over the whole region, when imposed, has tended to be ephemeral, and localism has fragmented power into tribal or smaller regional units.[11] These trends have continued to the present day in Iraq.\\r\\nThe pre-history of the Ancient Near East begins in the Lower Paleolithic period, but writing began with a pictographic script in the Uruk IV period (ca. 4th millennium BC), and the documented record of actual historical events  and the ancient history of lower Mesopotamia  commence in the mid-third millennium BC with cuneiform records of early dynastic kings, and ends with either the arrival of the Achaemenid Empire in the late 6th century BC, or with the Muslim conquest and the establishment of the Caliphate in the late 7th century AD, from which point the region came to be known as Iraq. During this period Mesopotamia housed some of the world's most ancient highly developed and socially complex states.\\r\\nThe region was one of the four riverine civilizations where writing was invented, along with the Nile valley in Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization in the Indian subcontinent, and the Yellow River in China. Mesopotamia housed historically important cities such as Uruk, Nippur, Nineveh, Assur and Babylon, as well as major territorial states such as the city of Eridu, the Akkadian kingdoms, the Third Dynasty of Ur, and the various Assyrian empires. Some of the important historical Mesopotamian leaders were Ur-Nammu (king of Ur), Sargon of Akkad (who established the Akkadian Empire), Hammurabi (who established the Old Babylonian state), Ashur-uballit II and Tiglath-Pileser I (who established the Assyrian Empire).\\r\\nStudies have reported that most Irish and Britons are descendants of farmers who left modern day Iraq and Syria 10,000 years ago.[12] Genetic researchers say they have found compelling evidence that four out of five (80%) of white Europeans can trace their roots to the Near East.[12] In another study, scientists analysed DNA from the 8,000-year-old remains of early farmers found at an ancient graveyard in Germany. They compared the genetic signatures to those of modern populations and found similarities with the DNA of people living in today's Turkey and Iraq.[13]\\r\\nThe earliest language written in Mesopotamia was Sumerian, an agglutinative language isolate. Along with Sumerian, Semitic languages were also spoken in early Mesopotamia.[15] Subartuan[16] a language of the Zagros, perhaps related to the Hurro-Urartuan language family is attested in personal names, rivers and mountains and in various crafts. Akkadian came to be the dominant language during the Akkadian Empire and the Assyrian empires, but Sumerian was retained for administrative, religious, literary and scientific purposes. Different varieties of Akkadian were used until the end of the Neo-Babylonian period. Old Aramaic, which had already become common in Mesopotamia, then became the official provincial administration language of first the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and then the Achaemenid Empire: the official lect is called Imperial Aramaic. Akkadian fell into disuse, but both it and Sumerian were still used in temples for some centuries. The last Akkadian texts date from the late 1st century AD.\\r\\nEarly in Mesopotamia's history (around the mid-4th millennium BC) cuneiform was invented for the Sumerian language. Cuneiform literally means \\"wedge-shaped\\", due to the triangular tip of the stylus used for impressing signs on wet clay. The standardized form of each cuneiform sign appears to have been developed from pictograms. The earliest texts (7 archaic tablets) come from the , a temple dedicated to the goddess Inanna at Uruk, from a building labeled as Temple C by its excavators.\\r\\nThe early logographic system of cuneiform script took many years to master. Thus, only a limited number of individuals were hired as scribes to be trained in its use. It was not until the widespread use of a syllabic script was adopted under Sargon's rule[citation needed] that significant portions of Mesopotamian population became literate. Massive archives of texts were recovered from the archaeological contexts of Old Babylonian scribal schools, through which literacy was disseminated.\\r\\nDuring the third millennium BC, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerian and the Akkadian language users, which included widespread bilingualism.[17] The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.[17] This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a sprachbund.[17] Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),[18] but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary, and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.\\r\\nLibraries were extant in towns and temples during the Babylonian Empire. An old Sumerian proverb averred that \\"he who would excel in the school of the scribes must rise with the dawn.\\" Women as well as men learned to read and write,[19] and for the Semitic Babylonians, this involved knowledge of the extinct Sumerian language, and a complicated and extensive syllabary.\\r\\nA considerable amount of Babylonian literature was translated from Sumerian originals, and the language of religion and law long continued to be the old agglutinative language of Sumer. Vocabularies, grammars, and interlinear translations were compiled for the use of students, as well as commentaries on the older texts and explanations of obscure words and phrases. The characters of the syllabary were all arranged and named, and elaborate lists were drawn up.\\r\\nMany Babylonian literary works are still studied today. One of the most famous of these was the Epic of Gilgamesh, in twelve books, translated from the original Sumerian by a certain S?n-lqi-unninni, and arranged upon an astronomical principle. Each division contains the story of a single adventure in the career of Gilgamesh. The whole story is a composite product, although it is probable that some of the stories are artificially attached to the central figure.\\r\\nMesopotamian mathematics and science was based on a sexagesimal (base 60) numeral system. This is the source of the 60-minute hour, the 24-hour day, and the 360-degree circle. The Sumerian calendar was based on the seven-day week. This form of mathematics was instrumental in early map-making. The Babylonians also had theorems on how to measure the area of several shapes and solids. They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one-twelfth the square of the circumference, which would be correct if p were fixed at 3. The volume of a cylinder was taken as the product of the area of the base and the height; however, the volume of the frustum of a cone or a square pyramid was incorrectly taken as the product of the height and half the sum of the bases. Also, there was a recent discovery in which a tablet used p as 25/8 (3.125 instead of 3.14159~). The Babylonians are also known for the Babylonian mile, which was a measure of distance equal to about seven modern miles (11?km). This measurement for distances eventually was converted to a time-mile used for measuring the travel of the Sun, therefore, representing time.[20]\\r\\nFrom Sumerian times, temple priesthoods had attempted to associate current events with certain positions of the planets and stars. This continued to Assyrian times, when Limmu lists were created as a year by year association of events with planetary positions, which, when they have survived to the present day, allow accurate associations of relative with absolute dating for establishing the history of Mesopotamia.\\r\\nThe Babylonian astronomers were very adept at mathematics and could predict eclipses and solstices. Scholars thought that everything had some purpose in astronomy. Most of these related to religion and omens. Mesopotamian astronomers worked out a 12-month calendar based on the cycles of the moon. They divided the year into two seasons: summer and winter. The origins of astronomy as well as astrology date from this time.\\r\\nDuring the 8th and 7th centuries BC, Babylonian astronomers developed a new approach to astronomy. They began studying philosophy dealing with the ideal nature of the early universe and began employing an internal logic within their predictive planetary systems. This was an important contribution to astronomy and the philosophy of science and some scholars have thus referred to this new approach as the first scientific revolution.[21] This new approach to astronomy was adopted and further developed in Greek and Hellenistic astronomy.\\r\\nIn Seleucid and Parthian times, the astronomical reports were thoroughly scientific; how much earlier their advanced knowledge and methods were developed is uncertain. The Babylonian development of methods for predicting the motions of the planets is considered to be a major episode in the history of astronomy.\\r\\nThe only Greek-Babylonian astronomer known to have supported a heliocentric model of planetary motion was Seleucus of Seleucia (b. 190 BC).[22][23][24] Seleucus is known from the writings of Plutarch. He supported Aristarchus of Samos' heliocentric theory where the Earth rotated around its own axis which in turn revolved around the Sun. According to Plutarch, Seleucus even proved the heliocentric system, but it is not known what arguments he used (except that he correctly theorized on tides as a result of Moon's attraction).\\r\\nBabylonian astronomy served as the basis for much of Greek, classical Indian, Sassanian, Byzantine, Syrian, medieval Islamic, Central Asian, and Western European astronomy.[25]\\r\\nThe oldest Babylonian texts on medicine date back to the Old Babylonian period in the first half of the 2nd millennium BC. The most extensive Babylonian medical text, however, is the Diagnostic Handbook written by the umman, or chief scholar, Esagil-kin-apli of Borsippa,[26] during the reign of the Babylonian king Adad-apla-iddina (1069-1046 BC).[27]\\r\\nAlong with contemporary Egyptian medicine, the Babylonians introduced the concepts of diagnosis, prognosis, physical examination, and prescriptions. In addition, the Diagnostic Handbook introduced the methods of therapy and aetiology and the use of empiricism, logic, and rationality in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. The text contains a list of medical symptoms and often detailed empirical observations along with logical rules used in combining observed symptoms on the body of a patient with its diagnosis and prognosis.[28]\\r\\nThe symptoms and diseases of a patient were treated through therapeutic means such as bandages, creams and pills. If a patient could not be cured physically, the Babylonian physicians often relied on exorcism to cleanse the patient from any curses. Esagil-kin-apli's Diagnostic Handbook was based on a logical set of axioms and assumptions, including the modern view that through the examination and inspection of the symptoms of a patient, it is possible to determine the patient's disease, its aetiology, its future development, and the chances of the patient's recovery.[26]\\r\\nEsagil-kin-apli discovered a variety of illnesses and diseases and described their symptoms in his Diagnostic Handbook. These include the symptoms for many varieties of epilepsy and related ailments along with their diagnosis and prognosis.[29]\\r\\nMesopotamian people invented many technologies including metal and copper-working, glass and lamp making, textile weaving, flood control, water storage, and irrigation. They were also one of the first Bronze Age societies in the world. They developed from copper, bronze, and gold on to iron. Palaces were decorated with hundreds of kilograms of these very expensive metals. Also, copper, bronze, and iron were used for armor as well as for different weapons such as swords, daggers, spears, and maces.\\r\\nAccording to a recent hypothesis, the Archimedes' screw may have been used by Sennacherib, King of Assyria, for the water systems at the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and Nineveh in the 7th century BC, although mainstream scholarship holds it to be a Greek invention of later times.[30] Later, during the Parthian or Sasanian periods, the Baghdad Battery, which may have been the world's first battery, was created in Mesopotamia.[31]\\r\\nAncient Mesopotamian religion was the first recorded. Mesopotamians believed that the world was a flat disc,[citation needed] surrounded by a huge, holed space, and above that, heaven. They also believed that water was everywhere, the top, bottom and sides, and that the universe was born from this enormous sea. In addition, Mesopotamian religion was polytheistic. Although the beliefs described above were held in common among Mesopotamians, there were also regional variations. The Sumerian word for universe is an-ki, which refers to the god An and the goddess Ki.[citation needed] Their son was Enlil, the air god. They believed that Enlil was the most powerful god. He was the chief god of the pantheon. The Sumerians also posed philosophical questions, such as: Who are we?, Where are we?, How did we get here?.[citation needed] They attributed answers to these questions to explanations provided by their gods.\\r\\nThe numerous civilizations of the area influenced the Abrahamic religions, especially the Hebrew Bible; its cultural values and literary influence are especially evident in the Book of Genesis.[32]\\r\\nGiorgio Buccellati believes that the origins of philosophy can be traced back to early Mesopotamian wisdom, which embodied certain philosophies of life, particularly ethics, in the forms of dialectic, dialogues, epic poetry, folklore, hymns, lyrics, prose works, and proverbs. Babylonian reason and rationality developed beyond empirical observation.[33]\\r\\nThe earliest form of logic was developed by the Babylonians, notably in the rigorous nonergodic nature of their social systems. Babylonian thought was axiomatic and is comparable to the \\"ordinary logic\\" described by John Maynard Keynes. Babylonian thought was also based on an open-systems ontology which is compatible with ergodic axioms.[34] Logic was employed to some extent in Babylonian astronomy and medicine.\\r\\nBabylonian thought had a considerable influence on early Ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophy. In particular, the Babylonian text Dialogue of Pessimism contains similarities to the agonistic thought of the sophists, the Heraclitean doctrine of contrasts, and the dialectic and dialogs of Plato, as well as a precursor to the maieutic method of Socrates.[35] The Ionian philosopher Thales was influenced by Babylonian cosmological ideas.\\r\\nAncient Mesopotamians had ceremonies each month. The theme of the rituals and festivals for each month was determined by at least six important factors:\\r\\nSome songs were written for the gods but many were written to describe important events. Although music and songs amused kings, they were also enjoyed by ordinary people who liked to sing and dance in their homes or in the marketplaces. Songs were sung to children who passed them on to their children. Thus songs were passed on through many generations as an oral tradition until writing was more universal. These songs provided a means of passing on through the centuries highly important information about historical events.\\r\\nThe Oud (Arabic:?????) is a small, stringed musical instrument used by the Mesopotamians. The oldest pictorial record of the Oud dates back to the Uruk period in Southern Mesopotamia over 5000 years ago. It is on a cylinder seal currently housed at the British Museum and acquired by Dr. Dominique Collon. The image depicts a female crouching with her instruments upon a boat, playing right-handed. This instrument appears hundreds of times throughout Mesopotamian history and again in ancient Egypt from the 18th dynasty onwards in long- and short-neck varieties. The oud is regarded as a precursor to the European lute. Its name is derived from the Arabic word ????? al-d 'the wood', which is probably the name of the tree from which the oud was made. (The Arabic name, with the definite article, is the source of the word 'lute'.)\\r\\nHunting was popular among Assyrian kings. Boxing and wrestling feature frequently in art, and some form of polo was probably popular, with men sitting on the shoulders of other men rather than on horses.[36] They also played majore, a game similar to the sport rugby, but played with a ball made of wood. They also played a board game similar to senet and backgammon, now known as the \\"Royal Game of Ur.\\"\\r\\nMesopotamia, as shown by successive law codes, those of Urukagina, Lipit Ishtar and Hammurabi, across its history became more and more a patriarchal society, one in which the men were far more powerful than the women. For example, during the earliest Sumerian period, the \\"en\\", or high priest of male gods was originally a woman, that of female goddesses, a man. Thorkild Jacobsen, as well as many others, has suggested that early Mesopotamian society was ruled by a \\"council of elders\\" in which men and women were equally represented, but that over time, as the status of women fell, that of men increased. As for schooling, only royal offspring and sons of the rich and professionals, such as scribes, physicians, temple administrators, went to school. Most boys were taught their father's trade or were apprenticed out to learn a trade.[37] Girls had to stay home with their mothers to learn housekeeping and cooking, and to look after the younger children. Some children would help with crushing grain or cleaning birds. Unusual for that time in history, women in Mesopotamia had rights. They could own property and, if they had good reason, get a divorce.[38]:78√ø79\\r\\nHundreds of graves have been excavated in parts of Mesopotamia, revealing information about Mesopotamian burial habits. In the city of Ur, most people were buried in family graves under their houses, along with some possessions. A few have been found wrapped in mats and carpets. Deceased children were put in big \\"jars\\" which were placed in the family chapel. Other remains have been found buried in common city graveyards. 17 graves have been found with very precious objects in them. It is assumed that these were royal graves. Rich of various periods, have been discovered to have sought burial in Bahrein, identified with Sumerian Dilmun.[39]\\r\\nIrrigated agriculture spread southwards from the Zagros foothills with the Samara and Hadji Muhammed culture, from about 5,000 BC.[40] Sumerian temples functioned as banks and developed the first large-scale system of loans and credit, but the Babylonians developed the earliest system of commercial banking. It was comparable in some ways to modern post-Keynesian economics, but with a more \\"anything goes\\" approach.[34]\\r\\nIn the early period down to Ur III temples owned up to one third of the available land, declining over time as royal and other private holdings increased in frequency. The word Ensi was used to describe the official who organized the work of all facets of temple agriculture. Villeins are known to have worked most frequently within agriculture, especially in the grounds of temples or palaces.[41]\\r\\nThe geography of southern Mesopotamia is such that agriculture is possible only with irrigation and good drainage, a fact which has had a profound effect on the evolution of early Mesopotamian civilization. The need for irrigation led the Sumerians, and later the Akkadians, to build their cities along the Tigris and Euphrates and the branches of these rivers. Major cities, such as Ur and Uruk, took root on tributaries of the Euphrates, while others, notably Lagash, were built on branches of the Tigris. The rivers provided the further benefits of fish (used both for food and fertilizer), reeds, and clay (for building materials). With irrigation, the food supply in Mesopotamia was compabale to the Canadian prairies.[42] The Tigris and Euphrates River valleys form the northeastern portion of the Fertile Crescent, which also included the Jordan River valley and that of the Nile. Although land nearer to the rivers was fertile and good for crops, portions of land farther from the water were dry and largely uninhabitable. This is why the development of irrigation was very important for settlers of Mesopotamia. Other Mesopotamian innovations include the control of water by dams and the use of aqueducts. Early settlers of fertile land in Mesopotamia used wooden plows to soften the soil before planting crops such as barley, onions, grapes, turnips, and apples. Mesopotamian settlers were some of the first people to make beer and wine. As a result of the skill involved in farming in the Mesopotamian, farmers did not depend on slaves to complete farm work for them, but there were some exceptions. There were too many risks involved to make slavery practical (i.e. the escape/mutiny of the slave). Although the rivers sustained life, they also destroyed it by frequent floods that ravaged entire cities. The unpredictable Mesopotamian weather was often hard on farmers; crops were often ruined so backup sources of food such as cows and lambs were also kept. Over time the southernmost parts of Sumerian Mesopotamia suffered from increased salinity of the soils, leading to a slow urban decline and a centring of power in Akkad, further north.\\r\\nThe geography of Mesopotamia had a profound impact on the political development of the region. Among the rivers and streams, the Sumerian people built the first cities along with irrigation canals which were separated by vast stretches of open desert or swamp where nomadic tribes roamed. Communication among the isolated cities was difficult and, at times, dangerous. Thus, each Sumerian city became a city-state, independent of the others and protective of its independence. At times one city would try to conquer and unify the region, but such efforts were resisted and failed for centuries. As a result, the political history of Sumer is one of almost constant warfare. Eventually Sumer was unified by Eannatum, but the unification was tenuous and failed to last as the Akkadians conquered Sumeria in 2331 BC only a generation later. The Akkadian Empire was the first successful empire to last beyond a generation and see the peaceful succession of kings. The empire was relatively short-lived, as the Babylonians conquered them within only a few generations.\\r\\nThe Mesopotamians believed their kings and queens were descended from the City of Gods, but, unlike the ancient Egyptians, they never believed their kings were real gods.[43] Most kings named themselves king of the universe or great king. Another common name was shepherd, as kings had to look after their people.\\r\\nWhen Assyria grew into an empire, it was divided into smaller parts, called provinces. Each of these were named after their main cities, like Nineveh, Samaria, Damascus, and Arpad. They all had their own governor who had to make sure everyone paid their taxes. Governors also had to call up soldiers to war and supply workers when a temple was built. He was also responsible for enforcing the laws. In this way, it was easier to keep control of a large empire. Although Babylon was quite a small state in the Sumerian, it grew tremendously throughout the time of Hammurabi's rule. He was known as the law maker, and soon Babylon became one of the main cities in Mesopotamia. It was later called Babylonia, which meant \\"the gateway of the gods.\\" It also became one of history's greatest centers of learning.\\r\\nWith the end of the Uruk phase, walled cities grew and many isolated Ubaid villages were abandoned indicating a rise in communal violence. An early king Lugalbanda was supposed to have built the white walls around the city. As city-states began to grow, their spheres of influence overlapped, creating arguments between other city-states, especially over land and canals. These arguments were recorded in tablets several hundreds of years before any major warthe first recording of a war occurred around 3200 BC but was not common until about 2500 BC. An Early Dynastic II king (Ensi) of Uruk in Sumer, Gilgamesh (c. 2600 BC), was commended for military exploits against Humbaba guardian of the Cedar Mountain, and was later celebrated in many later poems and songs in which he was claimed to be two-thirds god and only one-third human. The later Stele of the Vultures at the end of the Early Dynastic III period (2600√ø2350 BC), commemorating the victory of Eannatum of Lagash over the neighbouring rival city of Umma is the oldest monument in the world that celebrates a massacre.[44] From this point forwards, warfare was incorporated into the Mesopotamian political system. At times a neutral city may act as an arbitrator for the two rival cities. This helped to form unions between cities, leading to regional states.[43] When empires were created, they went to war more with foreign countries. King Sargon, for example, conquered all the cities of Sumer, some cities in Mari, and then went to war with northern Syria. Many Assyrian and Babylonian palace walls were decorated with the pictures of the successful fights and the enemy either desperately escaping or hiding amongst reeds.\\r\\nCity-states of Mesopotamia created the first law codes, drawn from legal precedence and decisions made by kings. The codes of Urukagina and Lipit Ishtar have been found. The most renowned of these was that of Hammurabi, as mentioned above, who was posthumously famous for his set of laws, the Code of Hammurabi (created c. 1780 BC), which is one of the earliest sets of laws found and one of the best preserved examples of this type of document from ancient Mesopotamia. He codified over 200 laws for Mesopotamia. Examination of the laws show a progressive weakening of the rights of women, and increasing severity in the treatment of slaves[45]\\r\\nThe art of Mesopotamia rivalled that of Ancient Egypt as the most grand, sophisticated and elaborate in western Eurasia from the 4th millennium BC until the Persian Achaemenid Empire conquered the region in the 6th century BC. The main emphasis was on various, fortunately very durable, forms of sculpture in stone and clay; little painting has survived, but what has suggests that painting was mainly used for geometrical and plant-based decorative schemes, though most sculpture was also painted.\\r\\nThe Protoliterate period, dominated by Uruk, saw the production of sophisticated works like the Warka Vase and cylinder seals. The Guennol Lioness is an outstanding small limestone figure from Elam of about 3000√ø2800 BC, part man and part lion.[46] A little later there are a number of figures of large-eyed priests and worshippers, mostly in alabaster and up to a foot high, who attended temple cult images of the deity, but very few of these have survived.[47] Sculptures from the Sumerian and Akkadian period generally had large, staring eyes, and long beards on the men. Many masterpieces have also been found at the Royal Cemetery at Ur (c. 2650 BC), including the two figures of a Ram in a Thicket, the Copper Bull and a bull's head on one of the Lyres of Ur.[48]\\r\\nFrom the many subsequent periods before the ascendency of the Neo-Assyrian Empire Mesopotamian art survives in a number of forms: cylinder seals, relatively small figures in the round, and reliefs of various sizes, including cheap plaques of moulded pottery for the home, some religious and some apparently not.[49] The Burney Relief is an unusual elaborate and relatively large (20 x 15?inches) terracotta plaque of a naked winged goddess with the feet of a bird of prey, and attendant owls and lions. It comes from the 18th or 19th centuries BC, and may also be moulded.[50] Stone stelae, votive offerings, or ones probably commemorating victories and showing feasts, are also found from temples, which unlike more official ones lack inscriptions that would explain them;[51] the fragmentary Stele of the Vultures is an early example of the inscribed type,[52] and the Assyrian Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III a large and solid late one.[53]\\r\\nThe conquest of the whole of Mesopotamia and much surrounding territory by the Assyrians created a larger and wealthier state than the region had known before, and very grandiose art in palaces and public places, no doubt partly intended to match the splendour of the art of the neighbouring Egyptian empire. The Assyrians developed a style of extremely large schemes of very finely detailed narrative low reliefs in stone for palaces, with scenes of war or hunting; the British Museum has an outstanding collection. They produced very little sculpture in the round, except for colossal guardian figures, often the human-headed lamassu, which are sculpted in high relief on two sides of a rectangular block, with the heads effectively in the round (and also five legs, so that both views seem complete). Even before dominating the region they had continued the cylinder seal tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined.[54]\\r\\nThe study of ancient Mesopotamian architecture is based on available archaeological evidence, pictorial representation of buildings, and texts on building practices. Scholarly literature usually concentrates on temples, palaces, city walls and gates, and other monumental buildings, but occasionally one finds works on residential architecture as well.[55] Archaeological surface surveys also allowed for the study of urban form in early Mesopotamian cities.\\r\\nBrick is the dominant material, as the material was freely available locally, whereas building stone had to be brought a considerable distance to most cities.[56] The ziggurat is the most distinctive form, and cities often had large gateways, of which the Ishtar Gate from Neo-Babylonian Babylon, decorated with beasts in polychrome brick, is the most famous, now largely in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.\\r\\nThe most notable architectural remains from early Mesopotamia are the temple complexes at Uruk from the 4th millennium BC, temples and palaces from the Early Dynastic period sites in the Diyala River valley such as Khafajah and Tell Asmar, the Third Dynasty of Ur remains at Nippur (Sanctuary of Enlil) and Ur (Sanctuary of Nanna), Middle Bronze Age remains at Syrian-Turkish sites of Ebla, Mari, Alalakh, Aleppo and Kultepe, Late Bronze Age palaces at Bogazkoy (Hattusha), Ugarit, Ashur and Nuzi, Iron Age palaces and temples at Assyrian (Kalhu/Nimrud, Khorsabad, Nineveh), Babylonian (Babylon), Urartian (Tushpa/Van, Kalesi, Cavustepe, Ayanis, Armavir, Erebuni, Bastam) and Neo-Hittite sites (Karkamis, Tell Halaf, Karatepe). Houses are mostly known from Old Babylonian remains at Nippur and Ur. Among the textual sources on building construction and associated rituals are Gudea's cylinders from the late 3rd millennium are notable, as well as the Assyrian and Babylonian royal inscriptions from the Iron Age.","input":"What are the two main rivers in mesopotamia?"},{"output":"28 July 1914","context":"","input":"When was the first world war broke out?"},{"output":"her senior year of high school","context":"Oprah Winfrey (born Orpah Gail Winfrey;[1] January 29, 1954) is an American media proprietor, talk show host, actress, producer, and philanthropist. She is best known for her talk show The Oprah Winfrey Show, which was the highest-rated television program of its kind in history and was nationally syndicated from 1986 to 2011 in Chicago, Illinois.[6] Dubbed the \\"Queen of All Media\\",[7] she is the richest African-American[8] and North America's first multi-billionaire black person[9] and has been ranked the greatest black philanthropist in American history.[10][11] Several assessments rank her as the most influential woman in the world.[12][13]\\r\\nWinfrey was born into poverty in rural Mississippi to a teenage single mother and later raised in an inner-city Milwaukee neighborhood. She has stated that she was molested during her childhood and early teens and became pregnant at 14; her son died in infancy.[14] Sent to live with the man she calls her father, Vernon Winfrey, a barber in Tennessee, she landed a job in radio while still in high school and began co-anchoring the local evening news at the age of 19. Her emotional ad-lib delivery eventually got her transferred to the daytime talk show arena, and after boosting a third-rated local Chicago talk show to first place,[15] she launched her own production company and became internationally syndicated.\\r\\nCredited with creating a more intimate confessional form of media communication,[16] she is thought to have popularized and revolutionized[16][17] the tabloid talk show genre pioneered by Phil Donahue,[16] through which, according to a Yale study, she broke 20th-century taboos and allowed LGBT people to enter the mainstream.[18][19]\\r\\nBy the mid-1990s, she had reinvented her show with a focus on literature, self-improvement, and spirituality. Though criticized for unleashing a confession culture, promoting controversial self-help ideas,[20] and having an overly emotion-centered approach,[21] she is often praised for overcoming adversity to become a benefactor to others.[22] From 2006 to 2008, her endorsement of Obama, by one estimate, delivered over a million votes in the close 2008 Democratic primary race.[23] In 2013, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama[24] and honorary doctorate degrees from Duke and Harvard.[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWinfrey's first name was spelled \\"Orpah\\" on her birth certificate after the biblical figure in the Book of Ruth, but people mispronounced it regularly and \\"Oprah\\" stuck.[1] She was born in Kosciusko, Mississippi, to an unmarried teenage mother. She later said that her conception was due to a single sexual encounter and the couple broke up not long after.[27] Her mother, Vernita Lee (born c. 1935), was a housemaid. Winfrey's biological father is usually noted as Vernon Winfrey (born c. 1933), a coal miner turned barber turned city councilman who had been in the Armed Forces when she was born. However, Mississippi farmer and World War II veteran Noah Robinson Sr., (born c. 1925) has claimed to be her biological father.[28]\\r\\nA genetic test in 2006 determined that her matrilineal line originated among the Kpelle ethnic group, in the area that today is Liberia. Her genetic makeup was determined to be 89% Sub-Saharan African, 8% Native American, and 3% East Asian. However, the East Asian markers may, given the imprecision of genetic testing, actually be Native American.[29]\\r\\nAfter Winfrey's birth, her mother traveled north and Winfrey spent her first six years living in rural poverty with her maternal grandmother, Hattie Mae (Presley) Lee (April 15, 1900 √ø February 27, 1963), who was so poor that Winfrey often wore dresses made of potato sacks, for which the local children made fun of her.[30][31] Her grandmother taught her to read before the age of three and took her to the local church, where she was nicknamed \\"The Preacher\\" for her ability to recite Bible verses. When Winfrey was a child, her grandmother would hit her with a stick when she did not do chores or if she misbehaved in any way.[32]\\r\\nAt age six, Winfrey moved to an inner-city neighborhood in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with her mother, who was less supportive and encouraging than her grandmother had been, largely as a result of the long hours she worked as a maid.[33] Around this time, Lee had given birth to another daughter, Winfrey's younger half-sister, Patricia[34] who later (in February 2003, at age 43) died of causes related to cocaine addiction.[35]\\r\\nBy 1962, Lee was having difficulty raising both daughters so Winfrey was temporarily sent to live with Vernon in Nashville, Tennessee.[36] While Winfrey was in Nashville, Lee gave birth to a third daughter[37] who was put up for adoption (in the hope of easing the financial straits that had led to Lee's being on welfare) and later also named Patricia.[38] Winfrey did not learn she had a second half-sister until 2010.[38] By the time Winfrey moved back with her mother, Lee had also given birth to a boy named Jeffrey, Winfrey's half-brother, who died of AIDS-related causes in 1989.[35]\\r\\nWinfrey has stated she was molested by her cousin, uncle, and a family friend, starting when she was nine years old, something she first announced to her viewers on a 1986 episode of her TV show regarding sexual abuse.[39][40] When Winfrey discussed the alleged abuse with family members at age 24, they reportedly refused to believe her account.[41]\\r\\nWinfrey once commented that she had chosen not to be a mother because she had not been mothered well.[42] At 13, after suffering what she described as years of abuse, Winfrey ran away from home.[1] When she was 14, she became pregnant but her son was born prematurely and he died shortly after birth.[43] Winfrey later stated she felt betrayed by the family member who had sold the story of her son to the National Enquirer in 1990.[44]\\r\\nShe began attending Lincoln High School, Milwaukee; but after early success in the Upward Bound program, was transferred to the affluent suburban Nicolet High School, where she says her poverty was constantly rubbed in her face as she rode the bus to school with fellow African-Americans, some of whom were servants of her classmates' families. She began to steal money from her mother in an effort to keep up with her free-spending peers, to lie to and argue with her mother, and to go out with older boys.[45]\\r\\nHer frustrated mother once again sent her to live with Vernon in Nashville, Tennessee, although this time she did not take her back. Vernon was strict but encouraging, and made her education a priority. Winfrey became an honors student, was voted Most Popular Girl, and joined her high school speech team at East Nashville High School, placing second in the nation in dramatic interpretation.[46]\\r\\nShe won an oratory contest, which secured her a full scholarship to Tennessee State University, a historically black institution, where she studied communication. Her first job as a teenager was working at a local grocery store.[47] At the age of 17, Winfrey won the Miss Black Tennessee beauty pageant.[48] She also attracted the attention of the local black radio station, WVOL, which hired her to do the news part-time.[39] She worked there during her senior year of high school, and again while in her first two years of college.\\r\\nWinfrey's career choice in media would not have surprised her grandmother, who once said that ever since Winfrey could talk, she was on stage. As a child, she played games interviewing her corncob doll and the crows on the fence of her family's property. Winfrey later acknowledged her grandmother's influence, saying it was Hattie Mae who had encouraged her to speak in public and \\"gave me a positive sense of myself\\".[49]\\r\\nWorking in local media, she was both the youngest news anchor and the first black female news anchor at Nashville's WLAC-TV. She moved to Baltimore's WJZ-TV in 1976 to co-anchor the six o'clock news. In 1977, she was removed as co-anchor and worked lower profile positions at the station. She was then recruited to join Richard Sher as co-host of WJZ's local talk show People Are Talking, which premiered on August 14, 1978. She also hosted the local version of Dialing for Dollars.[50]\\r\\nIn 1983, Winfrey relocated to Chicago to host WLS-TV's low-rated half-hour morning talk show, AM Chicago. The first episode aired on January 2, 1984. Within months after Winfrey took over, the show went from last place in the ratings to overtaking Donahue as the highest-rated talk show in Chicago. The movie critic Roger Ebert persuaded her to sign a syndication deal with King World. Ebert predicted that she would generate 40 times as much revenue as his television show, At the Movies.[51] It was renamed The Oprah Winfrey Show, expanded to a full hour and broadcast nationally beginning September 8, 1986.[52] Winfrey's syndicated show brought in double Donahue's national audience, displacing Donahue as the number-one daytime talk show in America. Their much-publicized contest was the subject of enormous scrutiny. TIME magazine wrote:\\r\\nTV columnist Howard Rosenberg said, \\"She's a roundhouse, a full course meal, big, brassy, loud, aggressive, hyper, laughable, lovable, soulful, tender, low-down, earthy, and hungry. And she may know the way to Phil Donahue's jugular.\\"[54] Newsday's Les Payne observed, \\"Oprah Winfrey is sharper than Donahue, wittier, more genuine, and far better attuned to her audience, if not the world\\"[54] and Martha Bayles of The Wall Street Journal wrote, \\"It's a relief to see a gab-monger with a fond but realistic assessment of her own cultural and religious roots.\\"[54]\\r\\nIn the early years of The Oprah Winfrey Show, the program was classified as a tabloid talk show. In the mid-1990s, Winfrey adopted a less tabloid-oriented format, hosting shows on broader topics such as heart disease, geopolitics, spirituality, and meditation, interviewing celebrities on social issues they were directly involved with, such as cancer, charity work, or substance abuse, and hosting televised giveaways including shows where every audience member received a new car (donated by General Motors) or a trip to Australia (donated by Australian tourism bodies).[citation needed]\\r\\nIn addition to her talk show, Winfrey also produced and co-starred in the 1989 drama miniseries The Women of Brewster Place, as well as a short-lived spin-off, Brewster Place. As well as hosting and appearing on television shows, Winfrey co-founded the women's cable television network Oxygen. She is also the president of Harpo Productions (Oprah spelled backwards).\\r\\nOn January 15, 2008, Winfrey and Discovery Communications announced plans to change Discovery Health Channel into a new channel called OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network. It was scheduled to launch in 2009 but was delayed, and actually launched on January 1, 2011.[55]\\r\\nThe series finale of The Oprah Winfrey Show aired on May 25, 2011.[56]\\r\\nIn January 2017, CBS announced that Winfrey would join 60 Minutes as a special contributor on the Sunday evening news magazine program starting in September 2017.[57]\\r\\nIn 1993, Winfrey hosted a rare prime-time interview with Michael Jackson, which became the fourth most-watched event in American television history as well as the most watched interview ever, with an audience of 36.5?million.[58] On December 1, 2005, Winfrey appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote the new Broadway musical The Color Purple,[59] of which she was a producer, joining the host for the first time in 16 years. The episode was hailed by some as the \\"television event of the decade\\" and helped Letterman attract his largest audience in more than 11 years: 13.45?million viewers.[60] Although a much-rumored feud was said to have been the cause of the rift,[59] both Winfrey and Letterman balked at such talk. \\"I want you to know, it's really over, whatever you thought was happening\\", said Winfrey. On September 10, 2007, Letterman made his first appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, as its season premiere was filmed in New York City.[61]\\r\\nIn 2006, rappers Ludacris, 50 Cent and Ice Cube criticized Winfrey for what they perceived as an anti-hip hop bias. In an interview with GQ magazine, Ludacris said that Winfrey gave him a \\"hard time\\" about his lyrics, and edited comments he made during an appearance on her show with the cast of the film Crash. He also said that he wasn't initially invited on the show with the rest of the cast.[62] Winfrey responded by saying that she is opposed to rap lyrics that \\"marginalize women\\", but enjoys some artists, including Kanye West, who appeared on her show. She said she spoke with Ludacris backstage after his appearance to explain her position and said she understood that his music was for entertainment purposes, but that some of his listeners might take it literally. In September 2008, Winfrey received criticism after Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report[63] reported that Winfrey refused to have Sarah Palin on her show, allegedly because of Winfrey's support for Barack Obama.[64] Winfrey denied the report, maintaining that there never was a discussion regarding Palin's appearing on her show. She said that after she made public her support for Obama, she decided that she would not let her show be used as a platform for any of the candidates.[64] Although Obama appeared twice on her show, those appearances were prior to his declaring himself a candidate. Winfrey added that Palin would make a fantastic guest and that she would love to have her on the show after the election, which she did on November 18, 2009.[64]\\r\\nIn 2009, Winfrey was criticized for allowing actress Suzanne Somers to appear on her show to discuss hormone treatments that are not accepted by mainstream medicine.[65] Critics have also suggested that Winfrey is not tough enough when questioning celebrity guests or politicians whom she appears to like.[66] Lisa de Moraes, a media columnist for The Washington Post, stated: \\"Oprah doesn't do follow-up questions unless you're an author who's embarrassed her by fabricating portions of a supposed memoir she's plugged for her book club.\\"[67]\\r\\nIn 1985, Winfrey co-starred in Steven Spielberg's The Color Purple as distraught housewife Sofia. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. The Alice Walker novel went on to become a Broadway musical which opened in late 2005, with Winfrey credited as a producer. In October 1998, Winfrey produced and starred in the film Beloved, based on Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name. To prepare for her role as Sethe, the protagonist and former slave, Winfrey experienced a 24-hour simulation of the experience of slavery, which included being tied up and blindfolded and left alone in the woods. Despite major advertising, including two episodes of her talk show dedicated solely to the film, and moderate to good critical reviews, Beloved opened to poor box-office results, losing approximately $30?million. While promoting the movie, co-star Thandie Newton described Winfrey as \\"a very strong technical actress and it's because she's so smart. She's acute. She's got a mind like a razor blade.\\"[68] In 2005, Harpo Productions released a film adaptation of Zora Neale Hurston's 1937 novel Their Eyes Were Watching God. The made-for-television film was based upon a teleplay by Suzan-Lori Parks and starred Halle Berry in the lead female role.\\r\\nIn late 2008, Winfrey's company Harpo Films signed an exclusive output pact to develop and produce scripted series, documentaries, and movies for HBO.[69]\\r\\nOprah voiced Gussie the goose in Charlotte's Web (2006) and voiced Judge Bumbleton in Bee Movie (2007), co-starring the voices of Jerry Seinfeld and Rene Zellweger. In 2009, Winfrey provided the voice for the character of Eudora, the mother of Princess Tiana, in Disney's The Princess and the Frog and in 2010, narrated the US version of the BBC nature program Life for Discovery.\\r\\nIn 2018, Winfrey starred as Mrs. Which in the film adaptation of Madeleine L'Engle's novel A Wrinkle in Time.[70]\\r\\nWinfrey has co-authored five books. At the announcement of a weight-loss book in 2005, co-authored with her personal trainer Bob Greene, it was said that her undisclosed advance fee had broken the record for the world's highest book advance fee, previously held by the autobiography of former U.S. President Bill Clinton.[71]\\r\\nHer memoir, The Life You Want, was scheduled for publication in 2017.[72] It did not appear in that year.\\r\\nWinfrey publishes the magazine: O, The Oprah Magazine and from 2004 to 2008 she also published a magazine called O At Home.[73] In 2002, Fortune called O, the Oprah Magazine the most successful start-up ever in the industry.[74] Although its circulation had declined by more than 10 percent (to 2.4?million) from 2005 to 2008,[75] the January 2009 issue was the best selling issue since 2006.[76] The audience for her magazine is considerably more upscale than for her TV show, the average reader earning is well above the median for U.S. women.[74]\\r\\nWinfrey's company created the Oprah.com website to provide resources and interactive content relating to her shows, magazines, book club, and public charity. Oprah.com averages more than 70 million page views and more than six million users per month, and receives approximately 20,000 e-mails each week.[77] Winfrey initiated \\"Oprah's Child Predator Watch List\\", through her show and website, to help track down accused child molesters. Within the first 48 hours, two of the featured men were captured.[78]\\r\\nOn February 9, 2006, it was announced that Winfrey had signed a three-year, $55-million contract with XM Satellite Radio to establish a new radio channel. The channel, Oprah Radio, features popular contributors to The Oprah Winfrey Show and O, The Oprah Magazine including Nate Berkus, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Bob Greene, Dr. Robin Smith, and Marianne Williamson. Oprah & Friends began broadcasting at 11:00?am ET, September 25, 2006, from a new studio at Winfrey's Chicago headquarters. The channel broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week on XM Radio Channel 156. Winfrey's contract requires her to be on the air 30 minutes a week, 39 weeks a year.\\r\\nWinfrey currently lives on \\"The Promised Land\\", her 42-acre (17-ha) estate with ocean and mountain views in Montecito, California. Winfrey also owns a house in Lavallette, New Jersey; an apartment in Chicago; an estate on Fisher Island, Florida; a ski house in Telluride, Colorado; and properties on Maui, Hawaii and Antigua.\\r\\nWinfrey's high school sweetheart Anthony Otey recalled an innocent courtship that began in Winfrey's senior year of high school, from which he saved hundreds of love notes; Winfrey conducted herself with dignity and as a model student.[79] The two spoke of getting married, but Otey claimed to have always secretly known that Winfrey was destined for a far greater life than he could ever provide.[80] She broke up with him on Valentine's Day of her senior year.[80][81]\\r\\nIn 1971, several months after breaking up with Otey, Winfrey met William \\"Bubba\\" Taylor at Tennessee State University. According to CBS journalist George Mair, Taylor was Winfrey's \\"first intense, to die for love affair\\". Winfrey helped get Taylor a job at WVOL, and according to Mair, \\"did everything to keep him, including literally begging him on her knees to stay with her.\\"[82] Taylor, however, was unwilling to leave Nashville with Winfrey when she moved to Baltimore to work at WJZ-TV in June 1976. \\"We really did care for each other\\", Winfrey would later recall. \\"We shared a deep love. A love I will never forget.\\"[83]\\r\\nIn the 1970s, Winfrey had a romantic relationship with John Tesh. Biographer Kitty Kelley claims that Tesh split with Winfrey over the pressure of having an interracial relationship.[84]\\r\\nWhen WJZ-TV management criticized Winfrey for crying on the air while reporting tragedies and were unhappy with her physical appearance (especially when her hair fell out as the result of a bad perm), Winfrey turned to reporter Lloyd Kramer for comfort. \\"Lloyd was just the best\\", Winfrey would later recall. \\"That man loved me even when I was bald! He was wonderful. He stuck with me through the whole demoralizing experience. That man was the most fun romance I ever had.\\"[85]\\r\\nAccording to Mair, when Kramer moved to NBC in New York, Winfrey had a love affair with a married man who had no intention of leaving his wife.[86] Winfrey would later recall: \\"I'd had a relationship with a man for four years. I wasn't living with him. I'd never lived with anyoneand I thought I was worthless without him. The more he rejected me, the more I wanted him. I felt depleted, powerless. At the end, I was down on the floor on my knees groveling and pleading with him\\".[87] Winfrey became so depressed that on September 8, 1981, she wrote a suicide note to best friend Gayle King instructing King to water her plants.[87] \\"That suicide note had been much overplayed\\" Winfrey told Ms. magazine. \\"I couldn't kill myself. I would be afraid the minute I did it; something really good would happen and I'd miss it.\\"[88]\\r\\nAccording to Winfrey, her emotional turmoil gradually led to a weight problem: \\"The reason I gained so much weight in the first place and the reason I had such a sorry history of abusive relationships with men was I just needed approval so much. I needed everyone to like me, because I didn't like myself much. So I'd end up with these cruel self-absorbed guys who'd tell me how selfish I was, and I'd say 'Oh thank you, you're so right' and be grateful to them. Because I had no sense that I deserved anything else. Which is also why I gained so much weight later on. It was the perfect way of cushioning myself against the world's disapproval.\\"[88]\\r\\nWinfrey later confessed to smoking crack cocaine with a man she was romantically involved with during the same era. She explained on her show: \\"I always felt that the drug itself is not the problem but that I was addicted to the man.\\" She added: \\"I can't think of anything I wouldn't have done for that man.\\"[89]\\r\\nWinfrey was allegedly involved in a second drug-related love affair. Self-proclaimed former boyfriend Randolph Cook said they lived together for several months in 1985 and did drugs. In 1997, Cook tried to sue Winfrey for $20?million for allegedly blocking a tell-all book about their alleged relationship.[90][91]\\r\\nAlso, in the mid-1980s, Winfrey briefly dated movie critic Roger Ebert, whom she credits with advising her to take her show into syndication.[51]\\r\\nIn 1985, before Winfrey's Chicago talk show had gone national, Haitian filmmaker Reginald Chevalier claims he appeared as a guest on a look-alike segment and began a relationship with Winfrey involving romantic evenings at home, candlelit baths, and dinners with Michael Jordan and Danny Glover. Chevalier says Winfrey ended the relationship when she met Stedman Graham.[92]\\r\\nWinfrey and her boyfriend Stedman Graham have been together since 1986. They were engaged to be married in November 1992, but the ceremony never took place.[93]\\r\\nWinfrey's best friend since their early twenties is Gayle King. King was formerly the host of The Gayle King Show and is currently an editor of O, the Oprah Magazine. Since 1997, when Winfrey played the therapist on an episode of the sitcom Ellen in which Ellen DeGeneres came out of the closet, Winfrey and King have been the target of persistent rumors that they were gay. \\"I understand why people think we're gay\\", Winfrey says in the August 2006 issue of O magazine. \\"There isn't a definition in our culture for this kind of bond between women. So I get why people have to label ithow can you be this close without it being sexual?\\"[94] \\"I've told nearly everything there is to tell. All my stuff is out there. People think I'd be so ashamed of being gay that I wouldn't admit it? Oh, please.\\"[94]\\r\\nWinfrey has also had a long friendship with Maria Shriver, after they met in Baltimore.[95][96] Winfrey considered Maya Angelou, author of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, her mentor and close friend; she called Angelou her \\"mother-sister-friend.\\"[97] Winfrey hosted a week-long Caribbean cruise for Angelou and 150 guests for Angelou's 70th birthday in 1998, and in 2008, threw her \\"an extravagant 80th birthday celebration\\" at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.[98]\\r\\nBorn in rural poverty, and raised by a mother dependent on government welfare payments in a poor urban neighborhood, Winfrey became a millionaire at the age of 32 when her talk show received national syndication. Winfrey negotiated ownership rights to the television program and started her own production company. At the age of 41, Winfrey had a net worth of $340?million and replaced Bill Cosby as the only African American on the Forbes 400.[99] With a 2000 net worth of $800?million, Winfrey is believed to be the richest African American of the 20th century. There has been a course taught at the University of Illinois focusing on Winfrey's business acumen, namely: \\"History 298: Oprah Winfrey, the Tycoon\\".[100] Winfrey was the highest paid television entertainer in the United States in 2006, earning an estimated $260?million during the year, five times the sum earned by second-place music executive Simon Cowell.[101] By 2008, her yearly income had increased to $275?million.[102]\\r\\nForbes' list of The World's Billionaires has listed Winfrey as the world's only black billionaire from 2004 to 2006 and as the first black woman billionaire in the world that was achieved in 2003.[99] As of 2014, Winfrey has a net worth in excess of 2.9 billion dollars[103] and has overtaken former eBay CEO Meg Whitman as the richest self-made woman in America.[104]\\r\\nOprah was raised a Baptist. In her early life, she would speak at local, mostly African American congregations of the Southern Baptist Convention that were often deeply religious and familiar with such themes as evangelical Protestantism, the Black church and being born-again.[105][106][107]\\r\\nShe was quoted as saying: \\"I have church with myself: I have church walking down the street. I believe in the God force that lives inside all of us, and once you tap into that, you can do anything.\\"[108]\\r\\nWinfrey was called \\"arguably the world's most powerful woman\\" by CNN and Time.com,[109] \\"arguably the most influential woman in the world\\" by The American Spectator,[110] \\"one of the 100 people who most influenced the 20th Century\\" and \\"one of the most influential people\\" from 2004 to 2011 by TIME. Winfrey is the only person in the world to have appeared in the latter list on ten occasions.[111]\\r\\nAt the end of the 20th century, Life listed Winfrey as both the most influential woman and the most influential black person of her generation, and in a cover story profile the magazine called her \\"America's most powerful woman\\".[112] In 2007, USA Today ranked Winfrey as the most influential woman and most influential black person of the previous quarter-century.[113] Ladies Home Journal also ranked Winfrey number one in their list of the most powerful women in America and Senator Barack Obama has said she \\"may be the most influential woman in the country\\".[114] In 1998, Winfrey became the first woman and first African American to top Entertainment Weekly's list of the 101 most powerful people in the entertainment industry.[115] Forbes named her the world's most powerful celebrity in 2005,[116] 2007,[117] 2008,[102] 2010,[118] and 2013.[119]\\r\\nAs chairman of Harpo Inc., she was named the most powerful woman in entertainment by The Hollywood Reporter in 2008.[120] She has been listed as one of the most powerful 100 women in the world by Forbes, ranking fourteenth in 2014.[121] In 2010, Life magazine named Winfrey one of the 100 people who changed the world, alongside such luminaries as Jesus Christ, Elvis Presley and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Winfrey was the only living woman to make the list.[122]\\r\\nColumnist Maureen Dowd seems to agree with such assessments: \\"She is the top alpha female in this country. She has more credibility than the president. Other successful women, such as Hillary Clinton and Martha Stewart, had to be publicly slapped down before they could move forward. Even Condi has had to play the proteg with Bush. None of this happened to Oprah √ø she is a straight ahead success story.[123] Vanity Fair wrote: \\"Oprah Winfrey arguably has more influence on the culture than any university president, politician, or religious leader, except perhaps the Pope.[124] Bill O'Reilly said: \\"this is a woman that came from nothing to rise up to be the most powerful woman, I think, in the world. I think Oprah Winfrey is the most powerful woman in the world, not just in America. That's √ø anybody who goes on her program immediately benefits through the roof. I mean, she has a loyal following; she has credibility; she has talent; and she's done it on her own to become fabulously wealthy and fabulously powerful.\\"[125]\\r\\nIn 2005, Winfrey was named the greatest woman in American history as part of a public poll as part of The Greatest American. She was ranked No. 9 overall on the list of greatest Americans. However, polls estimating Winfrey's personal popularity have been inconsistent. A November 2003 Gallup poll estimated that 73% of American adults had a favorable view of Winfrey. Another Gallup poll in January 2007 estimated the figure at 74%, although it dropped to 66% when Gallup conducted the same poll in October 2007. A December 2007 Fox News poll put the figure at 55%.[126] According to Gallup's annual most admired poll, Americans consistently rank Winfrey as one of the most admired women in the world. Her highest rating came in 2007[127] when she was statistically tied with Hillary Clinton for first place.[128] In a list compiled by the British magazine New Statesman in September 2010, she was voted 38th in the list of \\"The World's 50 Most Influential Figures 2010\\".[129]\\r\\nIn 1989, she was accepted into the NAACP Image Award Hall of Fame.[130]\\r\\nThe Wall Street Journal coined the term \\"Oprahfication\\", meaning public confession as a form of therapy.[131] By confessing intimate details about her weight problems, tumultuous love life, and sexual abuse, and crying alongside her guests, Time magazine credits Winfrey with creating a new form of media communication known as \\"rapport talk\\" as distinguished from the \\"report talk\\" of Phil Donahue: \\"Winfrey saw television's power to blend public and private; while it links strangers and conveys information over public airwaves, TV is most often viewed in the privacy of our homes. Like a family member, it sits down to meals with us and talks to us in the lonely afternoons. Grasping this paradox, ...?She makes people care because she cares. That is Winfrey's genius, and will be her legacy, as the changes she has wrought in the talk show continue to permeate our culture and shape our lives.\\"[132]\\r\\nObservers have also noted the \\"Oprahfication\\" of politics such as \\"Oprah-style debates\\" and Bill Clinton being described as \\"the man who brought Oprah-style psychobabble and misty confessions to politics.\\"[133] Newsweek stated: \\"Every time a politician lets his lip quiver or a cable anchor 'emotes' on TV, they nod to the cult of confession that Oprah helped create.[134]\\r\\nThe November 1988 Ms. observed that \\"in a society where fat is taboo, she made it in a medium that worships thin and celebrates a bland, white-bread prettiness of body and personality [...] But Winfrey made fat sexy, elegant?√ø damned near gorgeous?√ø with her drop-dead wardrobe, easy body language, and cheerful sensuality.\\"[135]\\r\\nWhile Phil Donahue has been credited with pioneering the tabloid talk show genre, Winfrey's warmth, intimacy, and personal confession popularized and changed it.[16][17] Her success at popularizing the tabloid talk show genre opened up a thriving industry that has included Ricki Lake, The Jenny Jones Show, and The Jerry Springer Show. Sociologists such as Vicki Abt criticized tabloid talk shows for redefining social norms. In her book Coming After Oprah: Cultural Fallout in the Age of the TV talk show, Abt warned that the media revolution that followed Winfrey's success was blurring the lines between \\"normal\\" and \\"deviant\\" behavior. In the book Freaks Talk Back,[18]\\r\\nYale sociology professor Joshua Gamson credits the tabloid talk show genre with providing much needed high impact media visibility for gay, bisexual, transsexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and doing more to make them mainstream and socially acceptable than any other development of the 20th century. In the book's editorial review, Michael Bronski wrote, \\"In the recent past, lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgendered people had almost no presence on television. With the invention and propagation of tabloid talk shows such as Jerry Springer, Jenny Jones, Oprah, and Geraldo, people outside the sexual mainstream now appear in living rooms across America almost every day of the week.\\"[136] Gamson credits the tabloid talk show with making alternative sexual orientations and identities more acceptable in mainstream society. Examples include a Time magazine article[page?needed] on early 21st-century gays coming out of the closet at an increasingly younger age and on plummeting gay suicide rates. Gamson also believes that tabloid talk shows caused gays to be accepted on more traditional forms of media.\\r\\nIn April 1997, Winfrey played the therapist in \\"The Puppy Episode\\" on the sitcom Ellen to whom the character (and the real-life Ellen DeGeneres) said she was a lesbian.\\r\\nThe power of Winfrey's opinions and endorsement to influence public opinion, especially consumer purchasing choices, has been dubbed \\"The Oprah Effect\\".[137] The effect has been documented or alleged in domains as diverse as book sales, beef markets, and election voting. Late in 1996,[138] Winfrey introduced the Oprah's Book Club segment to her television show. The segment focused on new books and classics and often brought obscure novels to popular attention. The book club became such a powerful force that whenever Winfrey introduced a new book as her book-club selection, it instantly became a best-seller; for example, when she selected the classic John Steinbeck novel East of Eden, it soared to the top of the book charts. Being recognized by Winfrey often means a million additional book sales for an author.[139] In Reading with Oprah: The Book Club that Changed America (2005), Kathleen Rooney describes Winfrey as \\"a serious American intellectual who pioneered the use of electronic media, specifically television and the Internet, to take reading √ø a decidedly non-technological and highly individual act √ø and highlight its social elements and uses in such a way to motivate millions of erstwhile non-readers to pick up books.\\"\\r\\nWhen author Jonathan Franzen's book was selected for the Book Club, he reportedly \\"cringed\\" and said selected books tend to be \\"schmaltzy\\".[140] After James Frey's A Million Little Pieces was found to contain fabrications in 2006, Winfrey confronted him on her show over the breach of trust. In 2009, Winfrey apologized to Frey for the public confrontation.[141] During a show about mad cow disease with Howard Lyman (aired on April 16, 1996), Winfrey said she was stopped cold from eating another burger. Texas cattlemen sued her and Lyman in early 1998 for \\"false defamation of perishable food\\" and \\"business disparagement\\", claiming that Winfrey's remarks sent cattle prices tumbling, costing beef producers $11?million. Winfrey was represented by attorney Chip Babcock and, on February 26, after a two-month trial in an Amarillo, Texas, court, a jury found Winfrey and Lyman were not liable for damages.[142][143] During the lawsuit, Winfrey hired Phil McGraw's company Courtroom Sciences, Inc. to help her analyze and read the jury.[144] Winfrey's ability to launch other successful talk shows such as Dr. Phil, Dr. Oz, and Rachael Ray has also been cited as examples of \\"The Oprah Effect\\".[145]\\r\\nWinfrey endorsed presidential candidate Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election,[146][147][148] the first time she endorsed a political candidate running for office.[149] Winfrey held a fundraiser for Obama on September 8, 2007, at her Santa Barbara estate. In December 2007, Winfrey joined Obama for a series of rallies in the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. The Columbia, South Carolina, event on December 9, 2007, drew a crowd of nearly 30,000, the largest for any political event of 2007.[150] An analysis by two economists at the University of Maryland, College Park estimated that Winfrey's endorsement was responsible for between 420,000 and 1,600,000 votes for Obama in the Democratic primary alone, based on a sample of states that did not include Texas, Michigan, North Dakota, Kansas, or Alaska. The results suggest that in the sampled states, Winfrey's endorsement was responsible for the difference in the popular vote between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.[151] The governor of Illinois, Rod Blagojevich, reported being so impressed by Winfrey's endorsement that he considered offering Winfrey Obama's vacant senate seat,describing Winfrey as \\"the most instrumental person in electing Barack Obama president\\", with \\"a voice larger than all 100 senators combined\\".[152] Winfrey responded by stating that although she was absolutely not interested, she did feel she could be a senator.[153]\\r\\nIn April 2014, Winfrey spoke for more than 20 minutes at a fundraiser in Arlington, Virginia, for Lavern Chatman, a candidate in a primary to nominate a Democratic Party candidate for election to the U.S. House of Representatives. Winfrey participated in the event even after reports had revealed that Chatman had been found liable in 2001 for her role in a scheme to defraud hundreds of District of Columbia nursing-home employees of at least $1.4 million in owed wages.[154]\\r\\nIn 2018, Winfrey donated $500,000 to the March for Our Lives student demonstration in favor of gun control in the United States.[155]\\r\\nIn 2000, she was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP.[156] In 2002, Christianity Today published an article called \\"The Church of O\\" in which they concluded that Winfrey had emerged as an influential spiritual leader. \\"Since 1994, when she abandoned traditional talk-show fare for more edifying content, and 1998, when she began 'Change Your Life TV', Oprah's most significant role has become that of a spiritual leader. To her audience of more than 22 million mostly female viewers, she has become a postmodern priestessan icon of church-free spirituality.\\"[131] The sentiment was echoed by Marcia Z. Nelson in her book The Gospel According to Oprah.[157] Since the mid-1990s, Winfrey's show has emphasized uplifting and inspirational topics and themes and some viewers say the show has motivated them to perform acts of altruism such as helping Congolese women and building an orphanage.[158] A scientific study by psychological scientists at the University of Cambridge, University of Plymouth, and University of California used an uplifting clip from The Oprah Winfrey Show in an experiment that discovered that watching the 'uplifting' clip caused subjects to become twice as helpful as subjects assigned to watch a British comedy or nature documentary.[159][160]\\r\\nIn 1998, Winfrey began an ongoing conversation with Gary Zukav, an American spiritual teacher, who appeared on her television show 35 times.[161] Winfrey has said she keeps a copy of Zukav's The Seat of the Soul at her bedside, a book that she says is one of her all-time favorites.[162]\\r\\nOn the season premier of Winfrey's 13th season, Roseanne Barr told Winfrey \\"you're the African Mother Goddess of us all\\" inspiring much enthusiasm from the studio audience. The animated series Futurama alluded to her spiritual influence by suggesting that \\"Oprahism\\" is a mainstream religion in 3000?AD.[163] Twelve days after the September 11 attacks, New York mayor Rudy Giuliani asked Winfrey to serve as host of a Prayer for America service at New York city's Yankee Stadium which was attended by former president Bill Clinton and New York senator Hillary Clinton.[164] Leading up to the U.S.-led 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, less than a month after the September 11 attacks, Winfrey aired a controversial show called \\"Islam 101\\" in which she portrayed Islam as a religion of peace, calling it \\"the most misunderstood of the three major religions\\".[165] In 2002, George W. Bush invited Winfrey to join a US delegation that included adviser Karen Hughes and Condoleezza Rice, planning to go to Afghanistan to celebrate the return of Afghan girls to school. The \\"Oprah strategy\\" was designed to portray the War on Terror in a positive light; however, when Winfrey refused to participate, the trip was postponed.[166]\\r\\nLeading up to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, Winfrey's show received criticism for allegedly having an anti-war bias. Ben Shapiro of Townhall.com wrote: \\"Oprah Winfrey is the most powerful woman in America. She decides what makes The New York Times Best Seller lists. Her touchy-feely style sucks in audiences at the rate of 14 million viewers per day. But Oprah is far more than a cultural force, she's a dangerous political force as well, a woman with unpredictable and mercurial attitudes toward the major issues of the day.\\"[167] In 2006, Winfrey recalled such controversies: \\"I once did a show titled Is War the Only Answer? In the history of my career, I've never received more hate mail √ø like 'Go back to Africa' hate mail. I was accused of being un-American for even raising the question.\\"[168] Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore came to Winfrey's defence, praising her for showing antiwar footage no other media would show[169] and begging her to run for president.[170]\\r\\nA February 2003 series, in which Winfrey showed clips from people all over the world asking America not to go to war, was interrupted in several east coast markets by network broadcasts of a press conference in which President George W. Bush and Colin Powell summarized the case for war.[171][172]\\r\\nIn 2007, Winfrey began to endorse the self-help program The Secret. The Secret claims that people can change their lives through positive thoughts or 'vibrations', which will then cause them to attract more positive vibrations that result in good things happening to them. Peter Birkenhead of Salon magazine argued that this idea is pseudoscience and psychologically damaging, as it trivializes important decisions and promotes a quick-fix material culture, and suggests Winfrey's promotion of it is irresponsible given her influence.[173] In 2007, skeptic and magician James Randi accused Winfrey of being deliberately deceptive and uncritical in how she handles paranormal claims on her show.[174] In 2008, Winfrey endorsed author and spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle and his book, A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose, which sold several million extra copies after being selected for her book club. During a Webinar class, in which she promoted the book, Winfrey stated \\"God is a feeling experience and not a believing experience. If your religion is a believing experience [...] then that's not truly God.\\"[175] Frank Pastore, a Christian radio talk show host on KKLA, was among the many Christian leaders who criticized Winfrey's views, saying \\"if she's a Christian, she's an ignorant one because Christianity is incompatible with New Age thought.\\"[175]\\r\\nWinfrey was named as the 2008 Person of the Year by animal-rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) for using her fame and listening audience to help the less fortunate, including animals. PETA praised Winfrey for using her talk show to uncover horrific cases of cruelty to animals in puppy mills and on factory farms, and Winfrey even used the show to highlight the cruelty-free vegan diet that she tried.[176] Winfrey also refuses to wear fur or feature it in her magazine.[177]\\r\\nIn 2009, Winfrey filmed a series of interviews in Denmark highlighting its citizens as the happiest people in the world. In 2010, Bill O'Reilly of Fox News criticized these shows for promoting a left-wing society.[178]\\r\\nOn using the N-word, Winfrey said, \\"You cannot be my friend and use that word around me. ... I always think of the...people who heard that as their last word as they were hanging from a tree.\\"[179]\\r\\nThe viewership for The Oprah Winfrey Show was highest during the 1991√ø92 season, when about 13.1 million U.S. viewers were watching each day. By 2003, ratings declined to 7.4 million daily viewers.[180] Ratings briefly rebounded to approximately 9 million in 2005 and then declined again to around 7.3?million viewers in 2008, though it remained the highest rated talk show.[181]\\r\\nIn 2008, Winfrey's show was airing in 140 countries internationally and seen by an estimated 46?million people in the US weekly.[182][183] According to the Harris poll, Winfrey was America's favorite television personality in 1998, 2000, 2002√ø06, and 2009. Winfrey was especially popular among women, Democrats, political moderates, Baby Boomers, Generation X, Southern Americans, and East Coast Americans.[184]\\r\\nOutside the U.S., Winfrey has become increasingly popular in the Arab world. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2007 that MBC 4, an Arab satellite channel, centered its entire programming around reruns of her show because it was drawing record numbers of female viewers in Saudi Arabia.[185] In 2008, The New York Times reported that The Oprah Winfrey Show, with Arabic subtitles, was broadcast twice each weekday on MBC 4. Winfrey's modest dress, combined with her attitude of triumph over adversity and abuse has caused some women in Saudi Arabia to idealize her.[186]\\r\\nIn 2004, Winfrey became the first black person to rank among the 50 most generous Americans[187] and she remained among the top 50 until 2010.[188] By 2012, she had given away about $400 million to educational causes.[189]\\r\\nAs of 2012, Winfrey had also given over 400 scholarships to Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia.[103] Winfrey was the recipient of the first Bob Hope Humanitarian Award at 2002 Emmy Awards for services to television and film. To celebrate two decades on national TV, and to thank her employees for their hard work, Winfrey took her staff and their families (1065 people in total) on vacation to Hawaii in the summer of 2006.[190]\\r\\nIn 2013, Winfrey donated $12 million to the Smithsonians National Museum of African American History and Culture.[191] President Barack Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom later that same year.[192]\\r\\nIn 1998, Winfrey created the Oprah's Angel Network, a charity that supported charitable projects and provided grants to nonprofit organizations around the world. Oprah's Angel Network raised more than $80,000,000 ($1?million of which was donated by Jon Bon Jovi). Winfrey personally covered all administrative costs associated with the charity, so 100% of all funds raised went to charity programs. In May 2010, with Oprah's show ending, the charity stopped accepting donations and was shut down.[193] [194]\\r\\nIn the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Oprah created the Oprah Angel Network Katrina registry which raised more than $11?million for relief efforts. Winfrey personally gave $10?million to the cause.[195] Homes were built in Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama before the one-year anniversary of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.[196]\\r\\nIn 2004, Winfrey and her team filmed an episode of her show, Oprah's Christmas Kindness, in which Winfrey travelled to South Africa to bring attention to the plight of young children affected by poverty and AIDS. During the 21-day trip, Winfrey and her crew visited schools and orphanages in poverty-stricken areas, and distributed Christmas presents to 50,000 children,[197] with dolls for the girls and soccer balls for the boys, and school supplies. Throughout the show, Winfrey appealed to viewers to donate money to Oprah's Angel Network for poor and AIDS-affected children in Africa. From that show alone, viewers around the world donated over $7,000,000. Winfrey invested $40?million and some of her time establishing the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in Henley on Klip south of Johannesburg, South Africa. The school set over 22 acres, opened in January 2007 with an enrollment of 150 pupils (increasing to 450) and features state-of-the-art classrooms, computer and science laboratories, a library, theatre, and beauty salon. Nelson Mandela praised Winfrey for overcoming her own disadvantaged youth to become a benefactor for others. Critics considered the school elitist and unnecessarily luxurious.[198] Winfrey rejected the claims, saying: \\"If you are surrounded by beautiful things and wonderful teachers who inspire you, that beauty brings out the beauty in you.\\"[198] Winfrey, who has no surviving biological children, described maternal feelings towards the girls at Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls.[199][200] Winfrey teaches a class at the school via satellite.[199]","input":"When did oprah begin her career in broadcasting?"},{"output":"S21,000 before tax","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of global poverty criteria, the United Kingdom is a wealthy country, with virtually no people living on less than S4 a day. In 2012√ø13, median personal income was approximately S21,000 a year but varies considerably by age, location, data source and occupation.[2] There is both significant income redistribution and income inequality; for instance, in 2013/14 income in the top and bottom fifth of households was S80,800 and S5,500, respectively, before taxes and benefits (15:1).

B. m. indica, found in the Indian Ocean, may be another subspecies. As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost exclusively of small crustaceans known as krill.[8]\\r\\nBlue whales were abundant in nearly all the oceans on Earth until the beginning of the twentieth century. For over a century, they were hunted almost to extinction by whalers until protected by the international community in 1966. A 2002 report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 blue whales worldwide,[4] in at least five groups. The IUCN estimates that there are probably between 10,000 and 25,000 blue whales worldwide today.[9] Before whaling, the largest population was in the Antarctic, numbering approximately 239,000 (range 202,000 to 311,000).[10] There remain only much smaller (around 2,000) concentrations in each of the eastern North Pacific, Antarctic, and Indian Ocean groups. There are two more groups in the North Atlantic, and at least two in the Southern Hemisphere. As of 2014, the Eastern North Pacific blue whale population had rebounded to nearly its pre-hunting population.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBlue whales are rorquals (family Balaenopteridae), a family that includes the humpback whale, the fin whale, Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the minke whale.[3] The family Balaenopteridae is believed to have diverged from the other families of the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Oligocene (28 Ma ago). It is not known when the members of those families diverged from each other.\\r\\nThe blue whale is usually classified as one of eight species in the genus Balaenoptera; one authority places it in a separate monotypic genus, Sibbaldus,[12] but this is not accepted elsewhere.[1] DNA sequencing analysis indicates that the blue whale is phylogenetically closer to the sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) and Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera brydei) than to other Balaenoptera species, and closer to the humpback whale (Megaptera) and the gray whale (Eschrichtius) than to the minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata and Balaenoptera bonaerensis).[13][14] If further research confirms these relationships, it will be necessary to reclassify the rorquals.\\r\\nThere have been at least 11 documented cases of blue whale-fin whale hybrid adults in the wild. Arnason and Gullberg describe the genetic distance between a blue and a fin as about the same as that between a human and a gorilla.[15] Researchers working off Fiji believe they photographed a hybrid humpback-blue whale[16] including the discovery through DNA analysis from a meat sample found in a Japanese market.[17][18]\\r\\nThe first published description of the blue whale comes from Robert Sibbald's Phalainologia Nova (1694). In September 1692, Sibbald found a blue whale that had stranded in the Firth of Forth √ø a male 24?m (78?ft) long √ø that had \\"black, horny plates\\" and \\"two large apertures approaching a pyramid in shape\\".[6]\\r\\nThe specific name musculus is Latin and could mean \\"muscle\\", but it can also be interpreted as \\"little mouse\\".[19] Carl Linnaeus, who named the species in his seminal Systema Naturae of 1758,[20] would have known this and may have intended the ironic double meaning.[21] Herman Melville called this species \\"sulphur-bottom\\" in his novel Moby-Dick (1851) due to an orange-brown or yellow tinge on the underparts from diatom films on the skin. Other common names for the blue whale have included \\"Sibbald's rorqual\\" (after Sibbald, who first described the species), the \\"great blue whale\\" and the \\"great northern rorqual\\". These names have now fallen into disuse. The first known usage of the term \\"blue whale\\" was in Melville's Moby-Dick, which only mentions it in passing and does not specifically attribute it to the species in question. The name was really derived from the Norwegian bl?hval, coined by Svend Foyn shortly after he had perfected the harpoon gun; the Norwegian scientist G. O. Sars adopted it as the Norwegian common name in 1874.[6]\\r\\nAuthorities classify the species into three or four subspecies: B. m. musculus, the northern blue whale consisting of the North Atlantic and North Pacific populations, B. m. intermedia, the southern blue whale of the Southern Ocean, B. m. brevicauda, the pygmy blue whale found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific,[22] and the more problematic B. m. indica, the great Indian rorqual, which is also found in the Indian Ocean and, although described earlier, may be the same subspecies as B. m. brevicauda.[1]\\r\\nThe pygmy blue whale formed from a founder group of Antarctic blue whales about 20,000 years ago, around the Last Glacial Maximum. This is likely because blue whales were driven north by expanding ice, and some have stayed there ever since. The pygmy blue whale's evolutionarily recent origins cause it to have a relatively low genetic diversity.[23]\\r\\nThe blue whale has a long tapering body that appears stretched in comparison with the stockier build of other whales.[24] The head is flat, U-shaped and has a prominent ridge running from the blowhole to the top of the upper lip.[24] The front part of the mouth is thick with baleen plates; around 300 plates, each around one metre (3.3 feet) long,[24] hang from the upper jaw, running 0.5?m (20?in) back into the mouth. Between 70 and 118 grooves (called ventral pleats) run along the throat parallel to the body length. These pleats assist with evacuating water from the mouth after lunge feeding (see feeding below).\\r\\nThe dorsal fin is small;[24] its height averages about 28 centimetres (11?in), and usually ranges between 20 and 40?cm (7.9 and 15.7?in), though it can be as small as 8?cm (3.1?in) or as large as 70?cm (28?in).[25] It is visible only briefly during the dive sequence. Located around three-quarters of the way along the length of the body, it varies in shape from one individual to another; some only have a barely perceptible lump, but others may have prominent and falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsals. When surfacing to breathe, the blue whale raises its shoulder and blowhole out of the water to a greater extent than other large whales, such as the fin or sei whales. Observers can use this trait to differentiate between species at sea. Some blue whales in the North Atlantic and North Pacific raise their tail fluke when diving. When breathing, the whale emits a vertical single-column spout, typically 9 metres (30?ft) high, but reaching up to 12 metres (39?ft). Its lung capacity is 5,000 litres (1,300?US?gal). Blue whales have twin blowholes shielded by a large splashguard.[24]\\r\\nThe flippers are 3√ø4 metres (9.8√ø13.1?ft) long. The upper sides are grey with a thin white border; the lower sides are white. The head and tail fluke are generally uniformly grey. The whale's upper parts, and sometimes the flippers, are usually mottled. The degree of mottling varies substantially from individual to individual. Some may have a uniform slate-grey color, but others demonstrate a considerable variation of dark blues, greys and blacks, all tightly mottled.[3]\\r\\nBlue whales can reach speeds of 50 kilometres per hour (31?mph) over short bursts, usually when interacting with other whales, but 20 kilometres per hour (12?mph) is a more typical traveling speed.[3] Satellite telemetry of Australian pygmy blue whales migrating to Indonesia has shown that they cover between 0.09 and 455.8 kilometers (0.056 and 283.221 miles) per day.[26] When feeding, they slow down to 5 kilometres per hour (3.1?mph).\\r\\nBlue whales typically swim at a depth of about 13 meters (43 feet) when migrating in order to eliminate drag from surface waves. The deepest confirmed dive is 506 meters (1,660 feet).[27]\\r\\nBlue whales most commonly live alone or with one other individual. It is not known how long traveling pairs stay together. In locations where there is a high concentration of food, as many as 50 blue whales have been seen scattered over a small area. They do not form the large, close-knit groups seen in other baleen species.\\r\\nThe blue whale is the largest animal known to have ever lived.[5][6]\\r\\nBlue whales are difficult to weigh because of their size. They were never weighed whole, but cut into blocks 0.5√ø0.6 meters (1.6√ø2.0?ft) across and weighed by parts.[28] This caused a considerable loss of blood and body fluids, estimated to be about 6% of the total weight.[29] As a whole, blue whales from the Northern Atlantic and Pacific are smaller on average than those from Antarctic waters. Adult weights typically range from 45√ø136 tonnes (50√ø150 short tons).[30] There is some uncertainty about the biggest blue whale ever found, as most data came from blue whales killed in Antarctic waters during the first half of the twentieth century, which were collected by whalers not well-versed in standard zoological measurement techniques. The standard measuring technique is to measure in a straight line from the upper jaw to the notch in the tail flukes. This came about because the edges of the tail flukes were typically cut off, and the lower jaw often falls open upon death. Many of the larger whales in the whaling records (especially those over 100?ft (30.5?m)) were probably measured incorrectly or even deliberately exaggerated.[6] The heaviest weight ever reported was 173 metric tons (190 short tons);[4][31] for a southern hemisphere female in 1947,[4] it is likely that the largest blue whales would have weighed over 200 short tons (181?t).[6] The longest whales ever recorded were two females measuring 33.6 and 33.3 metres (110 and 109?ft), but in neither of these cases was the piecemeal weight gathered.[32] Possibly the largest recorded male was killed near the South Shetland Islands in 1926 and was measured at 31.7?m (104?ft).[33]\\r\\nFemales are generally a few feet longer than males. However, males may be slightly heavier on average than females of the same length, owing to heavier muscles and bones.[28] Verified measurements rarely exceed 28 metres (92?ft). The longest measured by Macintosh and Wheeler (1929) was a female 28.5 metres (94?ft), while the largest male was 26.45 metres (86.8?ft);[25] one of the same authors later found a male of 26.65 metres (87.4?ft) and stated that those lengths may be exceeded.[34] The longest whale measured by scientists was 29.9 metres (98?ft) long.[4] Lieut. Quentin R. Walsh, USCG, while acting as whaling inspector of the factory ship Ulysses, verified the measurement of a 29.9?m (98?ft) pregnant blue whale caught in the Antarctic in the 1937√ø38 season.[35] A 26.8 metres (88?ft) male was verified by Japanese scientists in the 1947√ø48 whaling season.[36] The longest reported in the North Pacific was a 27.1 metres (89?ft) female taken by Japanese whalers in 1959, and the longest reported in the North Atlantic was a 28 metres (92?ft) female caught in the Davis Strait.[6] The average weight of the longest scientifically verified specimens (29.9 metres (98?ft)) would be calculated to be 176.5 tonnes (194.6 tons), varying from 141 tonnes (155.4 tons) to 211.5 tonnes (233.1 tons) depending on fat condition.[29][37] One study found that a hypothetical 33 metres (108?ft) blue whale would be too large to exist in real life, due to metabolic and energy constraints.[38]\\r\\nDue to its large size, several organs of the blue whale are the largest in the animal kingdom. A blue whale's tongue weighs around 2.7 tonnes (3.0 short tons)[39] and, when fully expanded, its mouth is large enough to hold up to 90 tonnes (99 short tons) of food and water.[8] Despite the size of its mouth, the dimensions of its throat are such that a blue whale cannot swallow an object wider than a beach ball.[40] The heart of an average sized blue whale weighs 400 pounds (180?kg) and is the largest known in any animal.[41] During the first seven months of its life, a blue whale calf drinks approximately 380 litres (100?US?gal) of milk every day. Blue whale calves gain weight quickly, as much as 90 kilograms (200?lb) every 24?hours. Even at birth, they weigh up to 2,700 kilograms (5,950?lb)the same as a fully grown hippopotamus.[3] Blue whales have proportionally small brains, only about 6.92 kilograms (15.26?lb), about 0.007% of its body weight,[42] although with a highly convoluted cerebral cortex.[33] The blue whale penis is the largest penis of any living organism[43] and also set the Guinness World Record as the longest of any animal's.[44] The reported average length varies but is usually mentioned to have an average length of 2.4 to 3.0?m (8 to 10?ft).[45]\\r\\nBlue whales feed almost exclusively on krill, though they also take small numbers of copepods.[46] The species of this zooplankton eaten by blue whales varies from ocean to ocean. In the North Atlantic, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, Thysanoessa raschii, Thysanoessa inermis and Thysanoessa longicaudata are the usual food;[47][48][49] in the North Pacific, Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa inermis, Thysanoessa longipes, Thysanoessa spinifera, Nyctiphanes symplex and Nematoscelis megalops;[50][51][52] and in the Southern Hemisphere, Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias, Euphausia valentini, and Nyctiphanes australis.\\r\\nAn adult blue whale can eat up to 40?million krill in a day.[53] The whales always feed in the areas with the highest concentration of krill, sometimes eating up to 3,600 kilograms (7,900?lb) of krill in a single day.[46] The daily energy requirement of an adult blue whale is in the region of 1.5?million kilocalories (6.3?GJ).[54] Their feeding habits are seasonal. Blue whales gorge on krill in the rich waters of the Antarctic before migrating to their breeding grounds in the warmer, less-rich waters nearer the equator. The blue whale can take in up to 90 times as much energy as it expends, allowing it to build up considerable energy reserves.[55][56][57]\\r\\nBecause krill move, blue whales typically feed at depths of more than 100 metres (330?ft) during the day and only surface-feed at night. Dive times are typically 10?minutes when feeding, though dives of up to 21?minutes are possible. The whale feeds by lunging forward at groups of krill, taking the animals and a large quantity of water into its mouth. The water is then squeezed out through the baleen plates by pressure from the ventral pouch and tongue. Once the mouth is clear of water, the remaining krill, unable to pass through the plates, are swallowed. The blue whale also incidentally consumes small fish, crustaceans and squid caught up with krill.[58][59]\\r\\nMating starts in late autumn and continues to the end of winter.[60] Little is known about mating behaviour or breeding grounds. In the fall, males will follow females for prolonged periods of time. Occasionally, a second male will attempt to displace the first, and the whales will race each other at high speed, ranging from 17 miles per hour (27?km/h) to 20 miles per hour (32?km/h) in New Zealand. This often causes the racing whales to breach, which is rare in blue whales. This racing behavior may even escalate to physical violence between the males. Scientists have observed this behavior in multiple parts of the world, including the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada and the South Taranaki Bight in New Zealand.[6][61]\\r\\nFemales typically give birth once every two to three years at the start of the winter after a gestation period of 10 to 12?months.[60] The calf weighs about 2.5 tonnes (2.8 short tons) and is around 7 metres (23?ft) in length. Blue whale calves drink 380√ø570?litres (100√ø150 U.S. gallons) of milk a day. Blue whale milk has an energy content of about 18,300 kJ/kg (4,370 kcal/kg).[62] The calf is weaned after six months, by which time it has doubled in length. The first video of a calf thought to be nursing was filmed on 5 February 2016.[63]\\r\\nSexual maturity is typically reached at five to ten years of age. In the Northern Hemisphere, whaling records show that males averaged 20√ø21?m (66√ø69?ft) and females 21√ø23?m (69√ø75?ft) at sexual maturity,[64] while in the Southern Hemisphere it was 22.6 and 24?m (74 and 79?ft), respectively.[65] In the Northern Hemisphere, as adults, males averaged 24?m (79?ft) and females 25?m (82?ft) with average calculated weights of 90.5 and 101.5 tonnes (100 and 112 tons), respectively.[29] Blue whales in the eastern North Pacific population were found to be on average 0.91 meters (3.0 feet) shorter,[66] therefore with males averaging 23.3 meters (76 feet) and 80.5 tonnes (88.5 tons) and females 24 meters (79 feet) and 90.5 tonnes (100 tons).[29] Antarctic males averaged 25?m (82?ft) and females 26.2?m (86?ft),[37][64][65] averaging 101.5 and 118 tonnes (112 and 130 tons).[29] Pygmy blue whales average 19.2 meters (63 feet) at sexual maturity, with males averaging 21 meters and females 22 meters (69 and 72 feet) when fully grown,[67] averaging 76 and 90 tonnes (83.5 and 99 tons).[29]\\r\\nIn the eastern North Pacific, photogrammetric studies have shown sexually mature (but not necessarily fully grown) blue whales today average 21.7?m (71?ft), and about 65.5 tonnes (72 tons)[29] with the largest found being about 24.5?m (80?ft).[68] A 26.5?m (87?ft) female washed ashore near Pescadero, California in 1979.[69]\\r\\nThe weight of individual blue whales varies significantly according to fat condition. Antarctic blue whales gain 50% of their lean body weight in the summer feeding season, i.e. a blue whale entering the Antarctic weighing 100 tons would leave weighing 150 tons. Pregnant females probably gain 60√ø65%. The fattened weight is 120% the average weight and the lean weight is 80%.[37]\\r\\nScientists estimate that blue whales can live for at least 80?years,[32][60][70] but since individual records do not date back into the whaling era, this will not be known with certainty for many years. The longest recorded study of a single individual is 34?years, in the eastern North Pacific.[71]\\r\\nThe whales' only natural predator is the orca.[72] Studies report that as many as 25% of mature blue whales have scars resulting from orca attacks.[32] The mortality rate of such attacks is unknown.\\r\\nBlue whale strandings are extremely uncommon, and, because of the species' social structure, mass strandings are unheard of.[73] When strandings do occur, they can become the focus of public interest. In 1920, a blue whale washed up near Bragar on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. It had been shot by whalers, but the harpoon had failed to explode. As with other mammals, the fundamental instinct of the whale was to try to carry on breathing at all costs, even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning. Two of the whale's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction.[74]\\r\\nIn June 2015, a female blue whale estimated at 12.2 meters (40 feet) and 20 tonnes (22 tons) was stranded on a beach in Maharashtra, India, the first live stranding in the region. Despite efforts by the Albaug forest department and local fishermen, the whale died 10 hours after being stranded.[75] In August 2009, a wounded blue whale was stranded in a bay in Steingrmsfj?rdur, Iceland. The first rescue attempt failed, as the whale (thought to be over 20 meters long) towed the >20 ton boat back to shore at speeds of up to 7 miles per hour (11?km/h). The whale was towed to sea after 7 hours by a stronger boat. It is unknown whether it survived.[76] In December 2015, a live blue whale thought to be over 20 metres (66 feet) long was rescued from a beach in Chile.[77] Another stranded blue whale, thought to be about 12.2 metres (40 feet) long, was rescued in India in February 2016.[78] Boats were used in all successful cases.\\r\\nEstimates made by Cummings and Thompson (1971) suggest the source level of sounds made by blue whales are between 155 and 188 decibels when measured relative to a reference pressure of one micropascal at one metre.[79][80] All blue whale groups make calls at a fundamental frequency between 10 and 40 Hz; the lowest frequency sound a human can typically perceive is 20?Hz. Blue whale calls last between ten and thirty seconds. Blue whales off the coast of Sri Lanka have been repeatedly recorded making \\"songs\\" of four notes, lasting about two minutes each, reminiscent of the well-known humpback whale songs. As this phenomenon has not been seen in any other populations, researchers believe it may be unique to the B. m. brevicauda (pygmy) subspecies. The loudest sustained noise from a blue whale was at 188?dB.[81]\\r\\nThe purpose of vocalization is unknown. Richardson et al. (1995) discuss six possible reasons:[82]\\r\\nBlue whales are not easy to catch or kill. Their speed and power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead targeted sperm and right whales.[83] In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with harpoons specifically designed for catching large whales.[3] The harpoon gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established on the coast of Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.\\r\\nSoon, blue whales were being hunted off Iceland (1883), the Faroe Islands (1894), Newfoundland (1898), and Spitsbergen (1903). In 1904√ø05 the first blue whales were taken off South Georgia. By 1925, with the advent of the stern slipway in factory ships and the use of steam-driven whale catchers, the catch of blue whales, and baleen whales as a whole, in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic began to increase dramatically. In the 1930√ø31 season, these ships caught 29,400 blue whales in the Antarctic alone.[84] By the end of World War II, populations had been significantly depleted, and, in 1946, the first quotas restricting international trade in whales were introduced, but they were ineffective because of the lack of differentiation between species. Rare species could be hunted on an equal footing with those found in relative abundance.\\r\\nArthur C. Clarke, in his 1962 book Profiles of the Future, was the first prominent intellectual to call attention to the plight of the blue whale. He mentioned its large brain and said, \\"we do not know the true nature of the entity we are destroying.\\"[85]\\r\\nAll of the historical coastal Asian groups were driven to near-extinction in short order by Japanese industrial hunts.[86] Those groups that once migrated along western Japan to the East China Sea were likely wiped out much earlier, as the last catches on Amami Oshima were between the 1910s and the 1930s,[87] and the last known stranding records on the Japanese archipelago, excluding the Ryukyu Islands, were over a half-century ago. Commercial catches were continued until 1965 and whaling stations targeting blues were mainly placed along the Hokkaido and Sanriku coasts.[86]\\r\\nBlue whale hunting was banned in 1966 by the International Whaling Commission,[88][89] and illegal whaling by the Soviet Union finally halted in the 1970s,[90] by which time 330,000 blue whales had been caught in the Antarctic, 33,000 in the rest of the Southern Hemisphere, 8,200 in the North Pacific, and 7,000 in the North Atlantic. The largest original population, in the Antarctic, had been reduced to a mere 360 individuals, about 0.15% of their initial numbers.[10]\\r\\nSince the introduction of the whaling ban, studies have examined whether the conservation reliant global blue whale population is increasing or remaining stable. In the Antarctic, best estimates show an increase of 7.3% per year since the end of illegal Soviet whaling, but numbers remain at under 1% of their original levels.[10] Recovery varies regionally, and the Eastern North Pacific blue whale population (historically a relatively small proportion of the global total) has rebounded to about 2,200 individuals, an estimated 97% of its pre-hunting population.[91]\\r\\nThe total world population was estimated to be between 5,000 and 12,000 in 2002; there are high levels of uncertainty in available estimates for many areas.[4] A more recent estimate by the IUCN puts the global population at 10,000√ø25,000.[9]\\r\\nThe IUCN Red List counts the blue whale as \\"endangered\\", as it has since the list's inception. In the United States, the National Marine Fisheries Service lists them as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.[92] The largest known concentration, consisting of about 2,800 individuals, is the northeast Pacific population of the northern blue whale (B. m. musculus) subspecies that ranges from Alaska to Costa Rica, but is most commonly seen from California in summer.[93] Infrequently, this population visits the northwest Pacific between Kamchatka and the northern tip of Japan.\\r\\nIn the North Atlantic, two stocks of B. m. musculus are recognised. The first is found off Greenland, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. This group is estimated to total about 500. The second, more easterly group is spotted from the Azores in spring to Iceland in July and August; it is presumed the whales follow the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the two volcanic islands. Beyond Iceland, blue whales have been spotted as far north as Spitsbergen and Jan Mayen, though such sightings are rare. Scientists do not know where these whales spend their winters. The total North Atlantic population is estimated to be between 600 and 1,500. Off Ireland, the first confirmed sightings were made in 2008,[94] since then Porcupine Seabight has been regarded as a prominent habitat for the species along with fin whales. One was sighted along Galicia, Spain, in 2017.[95]\\r\\nOccasionally blue whales get lost in the Baltic Sea. The remnants of two blue whales have been identified in Finland.[96] One 19-meter skeleton was found on the bottom of the Gulf of Finland during the construction of Nord Stream pipeline.[97] The vertebrae of a second individual were recovered from a field near Pori on the coast of the Bothnian Sea in 1942 and identified in the Copenhagen Zoological Museum by Magnus Degerb?l.[96] Radiocarbon dating revealed the former had wondered into the Littorina Sea over 7000 years ago and perished, while the latter bones were shown to be 800√ø900 years old.[98]\\r\\nFive or more subpopulations have been suggested, and several of these mainly in the western North Pacific have been considered either functionally or virtually extinct.[99] Of the populations that once existed off coastal Japan, the last recorded confirmed stranding was in the 1910s.[100] Today, call types suggest only two populations in the North Pacific.[6] Some scientists regard that historical populations off Japan were driven to extinction by whaling activities, mostly from the Kumanonada Sea off Wakayama, in the Gulf of Tosa, and in the Sea of Hyga. Nowadays, possible vagrants from either eastern or offshore populations are observed on very rare occasions off Kushiro.[101] There were also small, but constant catch records around the Korean Peninsula and in the coastal waters of the Sea of Japan; this species is normally considered not to frequent into marginal seas, such as the Sea of Okhotsk, on usual migrations. Whales were known to migrate further north to eastern Kamchatka, the Gulf of Anadyr, off Abashiri or the southern Sea of Okhotsk,[102] and the Commander Islands. Only three sightings were made between 1994 and 2004 in Russia[103] with one sighted off east coast of the peninsula in 2009,[104] and the last known occurrence in the eastern Sea of Okhotsk was in 1948.[105] In addition, whales have not been confirmed off the Commander Islands for over past 80 years.[106] In 2017, 13 or more whales were observed off Kamchatka and Commander Islands.[107][108][104] Historically, wintering grounds existed off the Hawaiian Archipelago, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Bonin Islands and Ryukyu Islands, the Philippines, Taiwan, the Zhoushan Archipelago, and the South China Sea[109] such as in Daya Bay, off the Leizhou Peninsula, and off Hainan Island, and further south to the Paracel Islands.[110] A stranding was recorded in Wanning in 2005.[111] One whale was sighted off Weizhou Island in 2017.[112] For further status in Chinese and Korean waters, see Wildlife of China.\\r\\nAs of 2014, the eastern North Pacific blue whale population had rebounded to an estimated 2,200 individuals, which is thought to be about 97% of its pre-whaling numbers.[11]\\r\\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, there appear to be two distinct subspecies, B. m. intermedia, the Antarctic blue whale, and the little-studied pygmy blue whale, B. m. brevicauda, found in Indian Ocean waters. The most recent surveys (midpoint 1998) provided an estimate of 2,280 blue whales in the Antarctic[113] (of which fewer than 1% are likely to be pygmy blue whales).[114] Estimates from a 1996 survey show that 424 pygmy blue whales were in a small area south of Madagascar (the Madagascar Plateau)[115] alone,[116] thus it is likely that numbers in the entire Indian Ocean are in the thousands. If this is true, the global numbers would be much higher than estimates predict.[117] However, slower reproduction rate of the species, along with the impacts of whaling, may affect population recoveries as the total population size is predicted to be at less than 50% of its pre-whaling state by 2100.[118]\\r\\nSeveral congregating grounds are recently confirmed in Oceania, such as Perth Canyon off Rottnest Island, the Great Australian Bight off Portland, and in South Taranaki Bight and off Kahurangi Point[119] which was discovered just in 2007 and was confirmed in 2014, representing possibly a unique population based on haplotypes.[120][121] Southern blue and pygmy blue females use waters off Western Australia, and coastal areas of eastern North Island of New Zealand, from Northland waters such as the Bay of Islands and Hauraki Gulf to the Bay of Plenty in the south, as breeding and calving grounds. Whales off southern and western Australia are known to migrate into tropical coastal waters in Indonesia,[122] Philippines,[123] and off East Timor.[124] (Animals in the Philippines may or may not originate from North Pacific populations or from a pygmy blue population in the northern Indian Ocean as whales regularly appear off Bohol,[125] north of the Equator.[126][127]) At least on occasions, whales also migrate through remote islands such as Cook Islands,[128][129][130] and Chilean pelagic waters adjacent to Easter Island and Isla Salas y G‹ámez, where possibilities of undiscovered wintering grounds have been considered.[131]\\r\\nBlue whales also migrate through western African waters such as off Angola[132][133] and Mauritania,[134] and at least whales around Iceland are known to migrate to Mauritania.[135]\\r\\nA fourth subspecies, B. m. indica, was identified by Blyth in 1859 in the northern Indian Ocean, but is now thought to be the same subspecies as B. m. brevicauda, the pygmy blue whale. Records for Soviet catches seem to indicate that the female adult size is closer to that of the pygmy blue than B. m. musculus; the populations of B. m. indica and B. m. brevicauda appear to be discrete, and the breeding seasons differ by almost six months.[136] Along mainland Indian coasts, appearances of whales had been scarce excluding unconfirmed record(s),[137] the first blue whale since after the last stranding record in Maharashtra in 1914, was sighted off Kunkeshwar along with several Bryde's whales in May 2015.[138][139][140]\\r\\nMigratory patterns of these subspecies are not well known. For example, pygmy blue whales have been recorded in the northern Indian Ocean (Oman, Maldives and Sri Lanka),[141] where they may form a distinct resident population.[136] Furthermore, sightings have been recorded from elsewhere in and adjacent to Arabian Sea, including from Gulf of Aden, Persian Gulf, coasts of Bay of Bengal including Bangladesh to Myanmar, and within the Strait of Malacca.[142][143] The first official confirmation within Thailand's EEZ occurred at Trang in 2013.[144]\\r\\nIn addition, the population of blue whales occurring off Chile and Peru may also be a distinct subspecies. Some Antarctic blue whales approach the eastern South Atlantic coast in winter, and occasionally, their vocalizations are heard off Peru, Western Australia, and in the northern Indian Ocean.[136] In Chile, the Cetacean Conservation Center, with support from the Chilean Navy, is undertaking extensive research and conservation work on a recently discovered feeding aggregation of the species off the coast of Chiloe Island in the Gulf of Corcovado (Chilo National Park), where 326 blue whales were spotted in 2007.[145] In this regions, it is normal for blue whales to enter Fiords. Whales also reach southern Los Lagos, such as off Caleta Zorra, live along with other rorquals.\\r\\nEfforts to calculate the blue whale population more accurately are supported by marine mammologists at Duke University, who maintain the Ocean Biogeographic Information SystemSpatial Ecological Analysis of Megavertebrate Populations (OBIS-SEAMAP), a collation of marine mammal sighting data from around 130 sources.[146]\\r\\nDue to their enormous size, power and speed, adult blue whales have virtually no natural predators. There is one documented case in National Geographic Magazine of a blue whale being attacked by orcas off the Baja California Peninsula; the orcas were unable to kill the animal outright during their attack, but the blue whale sustained serious wounds and probably died as a result of them shortly after the attack.[148] In March 2014, a pack of orcas harassed a blue whale off California, with one of them biting the tip of the blue whale's tail fluke. The blue whale attempted to tail slap the orca and fled at high speed.[149] A similar incident happened on May 18, 2017 in Monterey Bay, with the orcas swimming in a line up to the blue whale's side. The blue whale fled and escaped. Orcas have virtually no chance against an adult blue whale, but may attack them on occasion anyway for their own enjoyment.[150] Up to a quarter of the blue whales identified in Baja bear scars from orca attacks.[6]\\r\\nBlue whales may be wounded, sometimes fatally, after colliding with ocean vessels, as well as becoming trapped or entangled in fishing gear.[151] Ship strikes in particular have killed many blue whales in California.[152] In September 2007, three dead blue whales washed up in southern California after being killed by ship strikes.[6] A similar incident occurred in northern California in 2017, possibly also 2010.[153][154] Ship strikes are also a serious problem in Sri Lanka, and scientists believe this problem could be nearly eliminated by moving the shipping lanes 15 nautical miles to the south.[155] The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, which makes it harder for them to communicate.[147][151] Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1√ø8?kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25√ø100?Hz).[147] Research on blue whales in the Southern California Bight has shown that mid-frequency sonar use interferes with foraging behavior, sometimes causing the whales to abandon their feeding.[156] Human threats to the potential recovery of blue whale populations also include accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) chemicals within the whale's body.[8]\\r\\nWith global warming causing glaciers and permafrost to melt rapidly and allowing a large amount of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a disruption in the thermohaline circulation.[157] Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be likely to have an effect on their migration.[158] The whales summer in the cool, high latitudes, where they feed in krill-abundant waters; they winter in warmer, low latitudes, where they mate and give birth.[159]\\r\\nThe change in ocean temperature would also affect the blue whale's food supply. The warming trend and decreased salinity levels would cause a significant shift in krill location and abundance.[160]\\r\\nBefore modern whaling began in the late 19th century, blue whales were obscure and very poorly understood. They, along with other large whales were mythologized and indistinguishable from sea monsters. Even after the first specimens were described, the blue whale went by many names and scientists often described their specimens as new species. Descriptions and illustrations were inaccurate. The taxonomy was eventually resolved, but many mysteries remained.[6][33]\\r\\nThe blue whale rose from relative obscurity in the 1970s, after the release of the Songs of the Humpback Whale. The difference between the humpback and the blue whale was not well known to most people, who conflated the species in their minds. To many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a cry for help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.[6]\\r\\nToday, the blue whale is renowned for being the largest animal ever to have lived. In part because of its legendary status, many misconceptions still exist. For example, its size is often exaggerated. Many popular sources give the maximum length as 110 feet (34 meters) or more. While such lengths were reported in the whaling records, they were not scientifically verified and were probably exaggerated. Virtually all books and articles that mention the blue whale claim that it can reach 100 feet (30 meters). This is probably true (the largest verified specimen was 29.9 meters, 98 feet[4] but is highly misleading as the average size is much smaller.[6][161]\\r\\nThe global population was reduced by more than 99% during the 20th century.[162] Most of this was in the Antarctic, which had been reduced to 360 individuals or about 0.15% of their original numbers; other populations were not as badly depleted. The Antarctic blue whale population is growing at the relatively rapid rate of about 7.3% per year, but it was hunted to such a low level that it remains at a tiny fraction of pre-whaling numbers.[10] The global population still requires protection, but it is not in immediate danger of extinction.[6]\\r\\nOther myths and misconceptions include that the blue whale's arteries can be swum through, that the heartbeat can be heard from 19 miles away, and that the blue whale penis is 16 feet long.[6]\\r\\nThe Natural History Museum in London contains a famous mounted skeleton and life-size model of a blue whale, which were both the first of their kind in the world, but have since been replicated at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Similarly, the American Museum of Natural History in New York City has a full-size model in its Milstein Family Hall of Ocean Life. A juvenile blue whale skeleton named KOBO is installed at the New Bedford Whaling Museum in New Bedford, Massachusetts.\\r\\nThe Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California, features a life-size model of a mother blue whale with her calf suspended from the ceiling of its main hall.[163] The Beaty Biodiversity Museum at the University of British Columbia, Canada, houses a display of a blue whale skeleton (skull is cast replica) directly on the main campus boulevard.[164] A real skeleton of a blue whale at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa was also unveiled in May 2010.[165] The Royal Ontario Museum obtained a blue whale, which died in Newfoundland and Labrador in 2014, and began an exhibition in 2016 to display its skeleton in Toronto.[166]\\r\\nThe Museum of Natural History in Gothenburg, Sweden, contains the only stuffed blue whale in the world, with its skeleton mounted beside it. Two skeletons are held in Ukraine: in Odessa and Kherson.[167]\\r\\nThe Melbourne Museum and Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa[168] both feature a skeleton of the pygmy blue whale. The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh, North Carolina, has a mounted skeleton of a blue whale.\\r\\nThe South African Museum in Cape Town features a hall devoted to whales and natural history known as the Whale Well. The centrepiece of the exhibit is a suspended mounted blue whale skeleton, from the carcass of a partially mature specimen that washed ashore in the mid 1980s. The skeleton's jaw bones are mounted on the floor of Whale Well to permit visitors direct contact with them, and to walk between them so as to appreciate the size of the animal. Other mounted skeletons include that of a humpback whale and a right whale, together with in-scale composite models of other whales, dolphins and porpoises.\\r\\nThe Tokyo National Museum in Ueno Park displays a life-sized model of a blue whale in the front. Several other institutions such as Tokai University and Taiji Whale Museum hold skeletons or skeleton models of Pygmy blue whales, while several churches and buildings in western Japan including Nagasaki Prefecture display the jawbone of captured animals as a gate.\\r\\nBlue whales may be encountered (but rarely) on whale-watching cruises in the Gulf of Maine[169] and are the main attractions along the north shore of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and in the Saint Lawrence estuary.[151] Blue whales can also be seen off Southern California, starting as early as March and April, with the peak between July and September.[170] More whales have been observed close to shore along with fin whales.\\r\\nIn Chile, the Alfaguara project combines conservation measures for the population of blue whales feeding off Chilo Island with whale watching and other ecotourism activities that bring economic benefits to the local people.[171] Whale-watching, principally blue whales, is also carried out south of Sri Lanka.[172] Whales are widely seen along the coast of Chile and Peru near the coast, occasionally making mixed groups with fin, sei, and Bryde's whales.\\r\\nIn Australia, pygmy blue and Antarctic blue whales have been observed from various tours in almost all the coastlines of the continent. Among these, tours with sightings likely the highest rate are on west coast such as in Geographe Bay[173] and in southern bight off Portland. For later, special tours to observe pygmy blues by helicopters are organized.[174]\\r\\nIn New Zealand, whales have been seen in many areas close to shore, most notably around the Northland coast, in the Hauraki Gulf and the Bay of Plenty.[175]","input":"How big is the mouth of a blue whale?"},{"output":"stenotype","context":"A stenotype, stenotype machine, shorthand machine or steno writer is a specialized chorded keyboard or typewriter used by stenographers for shorthand use. In order to pass the United States Registered Professional Reporter test, a trained court reporter or closed captioner must write speeds of approximately 180, 200, and 225 words per minute (wpm) at very high accuracy in the categories of literary, jury charge, and testimony, respectively.[1] Some stenographers can reach 300 words per minute. The Web site of the California Official Court Reporters Association gives the official record for American English as 375 wpm.[2]\\r\\nThe stenotype keyboard has far fewer keys than a conventional alphanumeric keyboard. Multiple keys are pressed simultaneously (known as \\"chording\\" or \\"stroking\\") to spell out whole syllables, words, and phrases with a single hand motion. This system makes real-time transcription practical for court reporting and live closed captioning. Because the keyboard does not contain all the letters of the English alphabet, letter combinations are substituted for the missing letters. There are several schools of thought on how to record various sounds, such as the StenEd, Phoenix, and Magnum Steno theories.\\r\\nThe first shorthand machine (the word \\"stenotype\\" was not used for another 80 years or more) punched a paper strip and was built in 1830 by Karl Drais, a German inventor [3] The first machine was made in 1863 by the Italian Antonio Zucco and was in actual use since 1880 in the Italian Senate. An American shorthand machine was patented in 1879 by Miles M. Bartholomew. A French version was created by Marc Grandjean in 1909. The direct ancestor of today's stenotype was created by Ward Stone Ireland about 1913, and the word \\"stenotype\\" was applied to his machine and its descendants sometime thereafter.\\r\\nMost modern stenotype keyboards have more in common with computers than they do with typewriters or QWERTY computer keyboards. Most contain microprocessors, and many allow sensitivity adjustments for each individual key. They translate stenotype to English internally using user-specific dictionaries, and most have small display screens. They typically store a full day's work in non-volatile memory of some type, such as an SD Card. These factors influence the price, along with economies of scale, as there are only a few thousand stenotype keyboards sold each year. As of October 2013[update], student models, such as a Wave writer, sell for about US$1,500 and top-end models sell for approximately US$5,000. Machines that are 10 to 15 years old still resell for upwards of $350.\\r\\nThe Open Steno Project[4][5] has written free open-source software, such as Plover, and has developed cheap open-source hardware for stenography.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStenotype keys normally are made of a hard, high-luster acrylic material with no markings. The keyboard layout of the American stenotype machine is shown at the right.\\r\\nIn \\"home position,\\" the fingers of the left hand rest along the gap between the two main rows of keys to the left of the asterisk (little finger on the \\"S\\" to forefinger on the \\"H\\" and \\"R\\"). These fingers are used to generate initial consonants. The fingers of the right hand lie in the corresponding position to the right of the asterisk (forefinger on \\"FR\\" to little finger on \\"TS\\"), and are used for final consonants. The thumbs produce the vowels.\\r\\nThe system is roughly phonetic; for example the word \\"cat\\" would be written by a single stroke expressing the initial K, the vowel A, and the final T.\\r\\nTo enter a number, a user presses the number bar at the top of the keyboard at the same time as the other keys, much like the Shift key on a QWERTY-based keyboard. The illustration shows which lettered keys correspond to which digits. Numbers can be chorded just like letters can. They read from left to right across the keyboard. It's possible to write 137 in one stroke by pressing the number bar along with SP-P, but it takes three separate strokes to write 731. Many court reporters and stenocaptioners write out numbers phonetically instead of using the number bar.\\r\\nThere are various ways to combine letters to make different sounds; different court reporters use different theories in their work. Historically, reporters often created \\"briefs\\" (abbreviations) on-the-fly, and sometimes mixed theories, which could make it difficult for one reporter to read another reporter's notes; but current versions of theories are primarily designed for computerized translation using a standardized dictionary provided by the company that promulgates the theory, which forces reporters to stick with one theory and use only the specific combinations in that company's dictionary. However, it is not uncommon for students and reporters to add a significant number of entries to a stock dictionary (usually when creating briefs of their own).\\r\\nSome court reporters use scopists to translate and edit their work. A scopist is a person who is trained in the phonetic writing system, English punctuation, and usually in legal formatting. They are especially helpful when a court reporter is working so much that he or she does not have time to edit his/her own work. Both scopists and proofreaders work closely with the court reporter to ensure an accurate transcript. The widespread use of realtime translation of the strokes has increased the demand for scopists to work simultaneously with the court reporter. With transcripts produced on computer-aided transcription (CAT) software, a scopist no longer needs to have any knowledge of shorthand theories, because the software converts shorthand to text in real time via a dictionary. However, it may still be helpful in some situations while scoping, as misstroked words may not translate and would appear in steno. Depending on availability of scopists and proofreaders, court reporters may use a scopist only to clean up a rough draft of their transcript, then proofread and certify the transcript themselves, or they may use neither and produce a final transcript by themselves, though this is a very time-consuming practice.\\r\\nSteno paper has become almost obsolete with the advancement in paperless stenotype machines. When it is used, steno paper comes out of a stenotype machine at the rate of one row per chord, with the pressed letters printed out in 22 columns corresponding to the 22 keys, in the following order:\\r\\nThis is a basic chart of the letters of this machine. There are, however, different writing theories that represent some letters or sounds differently (e.g., the \\"*F\\" for \\"final V\\" in the chart below), and each court reporter develops personalized \\"briefs\\" and alternate ways of writing things.\\r\\nThe following example shows how steno paper coming out of the machine represents an English sentence. Notice that key combinations can have different meanings depending on context. In the first stroke of the word \\"example,\\" the \\"PL\\" combination refers to the letter M. In the second stroke of the word, that same key combination refers to the letters P and L.\\r\\nThe initial Z is also commonly chorded by the entire initial bank, STKPWHR, in order to avoid thousands of potential conflicts.\\r\\nStenograph is by far the largest manufacturer of American stenotype keyboards with an estimated marketshare in excess of 90%. Their top models are the Luminexprofessional writer and the Wave student writer. The Stentura paper-based writers and the paperless lan writers preceded the current models. There were two other large manufacturers in the 1980s (Xscribe, with the StenoRAM line and BaronData with the Transcriptor line).[6] Stenograph purchased both companies and discontinued their products. The current manufacturers in the U.S. include:\\r\\nThe Alfonse M. D'Amato United States Courthouse in Central Islip, New York, on the south shore of Long Island, has on public display in the building's lobby numerous stenotype machines from various periods and for use with several languages.","input":"What kind of machine does a court reporter use?"},{"output":"Silva","context":"Chael Patrick Sonnen[5] (/?t?e?l ?s?n?n/; born April 3, 1977)[6] is an American mixed martial artist currently competing in the Heavyweight division of Bellator MMA. A professional MMA competitor since 1997, Sonnen has also fought in the UFC, WEC and Pancrase.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSonnen was born in either Milwaukie, Oregon,[7] or West Linn, Oregon[6] (sources differ), and began wrestling from a young age. He attended West Linn High School, where he was a state runner-up. In 1996, Sonnen began training in boxing, with the hope of competing in the UFC upon graduating from high school.[8][9]\\r\\nAfter high school, Sonnen attended Brigham Young University before transferring to the University of Oregon when BYU began considering cutting their wrestling program. At Oregon, Sonnen earned All-American honors, was a two-time PAC-10 runner-up, was a silver medalist at the 2000 Greco-Roman World University Championships, and was a two-time Dave Schultz Memorial International Greco-Roman winner. He graduated from the University of Oregon with a Bachelor of Science degree in sociology.[10]\\r\\nSonnen started his mixed martial arts career in 1997 at the age of 19, by defeating Ben Hailey in Vancouver, Washington. He next defeated future ICON Sport Middleweight Champion and Strikeforce Middleweight contender Jason \\"Mayhem\\" Miller. He won his first six fights, before losing to Trevor Prangley. In late 2003, he was submitted by future Ultimate Fighter winner and UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Forrest Griffin with a triangle choke submission.\\r\\nSonnen made his UFC debut in a Light Heavyweight bout against former IFC Light Heavyweight Champion Renato Sobral at UFC 55, submitting to a second-round triangle choke. He then avenged his first loss, by winning a unanimous decision over Trevor Prangley at UFC Ultimate Fight Night 4. At UFC 60, he fought Jeremy Horn for the third time and submitted to an armbar. Shortly after, he was released from the UFC.\\r\\nIn May 2006, Sonnen debuted for Bodog Fight, defeating Tim Credeur via TKO. He went on to win a unanimous decision over Alexey Oleinik, defeat Tim McKenzie in 13 seconds with a D'arce choke, and finish UFC and PRIDE veteran Amar Suloev via TKO. After leaving Bodog, Sonnen defeated future Ultimate Fighter member Kyacey Uscola at SuperFight 20: Homecoming.\\r\\nIn December 2007, Sonnen fought Paulo Filho for the WEC Middleweight Championship. Sonnen lost via a controversial submission at 4:55 of the second round. Sonnen did not tap out but screamed in pain, which the referee interpreted as a verbal submission. In his post-fight interview, Sonnen said he told the referee not to stop the fight, and continually said \\"No\\" when the referee asked if he wanted to submit. Keith Kizer, executive director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, claimed Sonnen only yelled \\"No\\" after the referee stopped the fight. Kizer and Dana White (who was watching ringside) both agreed with the call.[11]\\r\\nA rematch was scheduled for March 26, 2008, but was cancelled after Filho entered a drug rehabilitation program.[12][13] Sonnen instead faced undefeated contender Bryan Baker and dominated him for three rounds to win a unanimous decision.[14] Sonnen and Filho eventually met again on November 5, 2008, and Sonnen won a unanimous decision. Prior to the fight, Filho weighed in almost seven pounds over the 185 pound limit, so the bout was ruled a non-title match. After Filho lost, he announced he would ship Sonnen the championship belt.[15]\\r\\nFollowing the dissolution of WEC's Middleweight division, Sonnen returned to the UFC.\\r\\nIn his first fight for the promotion since UFC 60, he was submiited by jiu-jitsu ace Demian Maia via triangle choke submission at UFC 95.\\r\\nAt UFC 98 in May 2009, Sonnen defeated Dan Miller via unanimous decision. He was a late replacement for Yushin Okami, who tore ligament while training.[16] He took the fight on 22 days notice, and lost 36 pounds in order to compete.[17]\\r\\nIn his next fight, at UFC 104, Sonnen outwrestled Okami for a unanimous decision victory.[18][19]\\r\\nSonnen was expected to face Nate Marquardt at UFC 110, but the fight was moved to UFC 109 on February 6. Sonnen won a unanimous decision, after escaping two deep guillotine chokes in the first and third rounds. With the victory, Sonnen became the number one contender for the UFC Middleweight Championship.\\r\\nAt UFC 117 on August 7, 2010, Sonnen challenged Anderson Silva for the UFC Middleweight Championship.[20] Sonnen had trash talked to hype the fight, stating he was going to retire Silva.[21][22][23] Heading into the fifth round, Sonnen led on the judges' scorecards (40√ø34, 40√ø36, and 40√ø35).[24][25] At 3:10 into the final round, Silva caught Sonnen in a triangle armbar and made him tap out. In a later interview, Sonnen stated it was the choke, not the armbar, that made him submit.[26] The fight earned both fighters Fight of the Night honors, and was considered to be the best fight of the year by many critics. The fight was later awarded 'Fight of the Year' by World MMA Awards.[27]\\r\\nUrinalysis conducted after his loss to Anderson Silva showed Sonnen had an unallowably high testosterone/epitestosterone (T/E) ratio of 16.9:1 at the time of the fight. An average man has a T/E ratio of 1:1, and testing bodies may allow a ratio as high as 4:1 for athletes undergoing TRT treatment. In other words, Sonnen's T/E ratio was nearly 17 times than a normal man's and over four times the allowed maximum for an athlete.[28] He was fined $2,500 and suspended for one year (until September 2, 2011) by the California State Athletic Commission (CSAC).[29] His scheduled rematch with Silva was subsequently cancelled.[30][31]\\r\\nSonnen appealed the CSAC's decision.[32] The hearing was held on December 2, 2010. The principal grounds of his appeal were that he had a medical justification for taking testosterone, and he believed he had taken the necessary steps to disclose the condition and its treatment to the CSAC. He testified he had been diagnosed with hypogonadism in 2008 and was undergoing Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), self-injecting synthetic testosterone two times a week.[33] Sonnen's physician, Dr. Mark Czarnecki, was present at the hearing and attested to these claims.\\r\\nIn his sworn testimony, Sonnen claimed to have been previously approved for TRT by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC), and to have spoken directly to NSAC's Executive Director, Keith Kizer, who informed him he was approved for TRT and should not again disclose the treatment on the pre-bout medical disclosure statements required by the NSAC.[34] He said he believed this advice about disclosure also applied to the forms of other state athletic commissions.[34] He said he had previously disclosed his condition to the CSAC before his UFC 104 bout with Yushin Okami, which took place in Los Angeles on October 24, 2009.[35] Based on his testimony, the CSAC voted to recharacterize Sonnen's transgression as a failure to properly disclose a medical treatment, and correspondingly reduced his suspension from twelve months to six, ending March 2, 2011.\\r\\nKeith Kizer publicly responded to Sonnen's testimony, claiming the NSAC had never approved Sonnen for TRT, Sonnen had never applied for the approval process, and he had \\"never talked to Chael Sonnen in [his] life.\\"[36][37][38] At a subsequent meeting between the UFC, Sonnen and the NSAC, Kizer asked Sonnen about his testimony at the December 2, 2010, CSAC hearing. According to Kizer, Sonnen initially deflected his questions but, when pressed further, admitted no conversation between Kizer and himself had occurred. Sonnen explained \\"My manager and you talked about therapeutic exemptions, and therefore, I just used the wrong word. I should have said 'my' instead of 'I.' As in 'my manager' instead of 'I'\\". Kizer called this a \\"strange story\\" and a \\"ridiculous explanation\\"[39] Kizer acknowledged speaking with Sonnen's manager (Matt Lindland) about TRT, but said the conversation concerned only the procedure itself, not the application of any particular fighter.[40]\\r\\nCSAC Executive Director George Dodd has also contradicted Sonnen's testimony, stating the CSAC has no documentary evidence of Sonnen ever being approved for TRT.[41]\\r\\nSonnen's abbreviated CSAC suspension expired on March 2, 2011. However, in the third week of April 2011, the CSAC announced it had reversed its decision to lower his sentence, and had placed him on indefinite administrative suspension due to his conviction for money laundering (see below) and his possibly false testimony during the hearing of December 2, 2010.[40] Sonnen appeared before the CSAC on May 18, 2011, requesting the suspension be lifted. After hearing testimony from Keith Kizer via streaming video, as well as from Sonnen and his supporters, the CSAC voted 4√ø1 to uphold the suspension. Two days later, the CSAC clarified that the applicable regulations only allowed Sonnen to be suspended until his existing license expired (on June 29, 2011).[42] If Sonnen applied for a new license after June 29, 2011, he would have to reappear before the CSAC, which could deny the application.[43]\\r\\nAfter his suspension, Sonnen returned to the UFC on October 8, 2011, defeating Brian Stann with a second round arm triangle choke at UFC 136.[44]\\r\\nSonnen was expected to face Mark Mu?oz on January at UFC on Fox 2,[45] but Mu?oz was injured and replaced by Michael Bisping.[46] Sonnen was awarded the unanimous decision victory after three rounds.[47]\\r\\nA rematch with Anderson Silva was scheduled UFC 147,[48] but the bout was moved to UFC 148 on July 7, 2012, after a scheduling conflict with the UN Conference on Sustainable Development forced UFC 147 into a smaller venue.[49] The fight was considered by many analysts and several major media outlets as the most highly anticipated bout in UFC history.[50][51]\\r\\nAs the fight finally took place, Sonnen quickly took the champion down in the first round and maintained a dominant position throughout, eventually gaining full mount while attacking with ground-and-pound.[52] One cageside judge scored it a 10-8 round as Silva was credited with zero strikes.[53] Sonnen connected with 76 strikes from the top position in the opening round, and held a 22-to-15 edge in significant strikes against Silva.[54] However, Sonnen was unable to inflict any damage to the champion, and Silva stopped Sonnen with a knee strike and punches for the TKO at 1:55 of the second round, after Sonnen failed to connect with a spinning elbow strike and tripped.[55]\\r\\nOn August 14, 2012, on UFC Tonight, Sonnen announced he would face Forrest Griffin in a Light Heavyweight rematch on December 29, 2012, at UFC 155.[56] But the rematch with Griffin was scrapped after Sonnen was tabbed as a coach for The Ultimate Fighter 17 against Light Heavyweight Champion Jon Jones.\\r\\nA bout between Sonnen and Jones for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship took place on April 27, 2013, at UFC 159.[57] Sonnen originally accepted a fight with Jon Jones for the title at UFC 151, after Jones' original challenger Dan Henderson was injured, but Jones declined.[58] Some fighters were upset with his title opportunity because Sonnen, \\"arguably the most legendary talker in UFC history\\",[59] has not fought any bout since returning to the light heavyweight division.[60][61][62] Dana White defended the matchup, saying \\"Sonnen was willing to fly over to Las Vegas to fight Jones on the same day\\", while other contenders like Maurcio Rua and Lyoto Machida turned the offer down.[63][64]\\r\\nJon Jones showed his lack of interest in the fight and downplayed the contest, making it clear that he does not believe Sonnen is a fit contender. In an interview, Sonnen did his best to hype up interest but Jones gave him \\"silent treatment\\", refusing to make eye contact.[65] Jones dispatched the challenger using Sonnen's own style to defeat him via TKO in the first round.[66] Despite the beatdown, Sonnen was likely only 27 seconds away from winning the title, as it was later discovered that, while defending a takedown, Jones suffered a serious toe injury that could have resulted in a doctor's stoppage TKO loss if the bout continued to the second round.[67][68][69]\\r\\nSonnen was expected to face Maurcio Rua on June 15, 2013, at UFC 161, replacing Ant?nio Rogrio Nogueira who pulled out of the bout citing a back injury.[70] Though an alleged visa issue created a problem for Sonnen to get into Canada, resulting in Rua being pulled from the event altogether.[71] The bout with Rua eventually took place on August 17, 2013, at UFC Fight Night 26.[72] Sonnen won via a guillotine choke submission in the first round.[73]\\r\\nSonnen faced Rashad Evans on November 16, 2013, at UFC 167.[74] He lost the fight via TKO in the first round.\\r\\nOn October 22, 2013, it was announced that Sonnen would be coaching The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil 3, against long-time rival Wanderlei Silva. A bout with Silva, briefly attached to UFC 173,[75] then at The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil 3 Finale,[76] was expected to take place on July 5, 2014, at UFC 175.[77] Dana White later stated the fight had to be rescheduled because Silva injured his hand from a brawl with Sonnen that took place during the filming of the show.[78] Silva was ultimately pulled from the fight entirely after he failed to submit an application to fight in the state of Nevada, as well as his refusal to undergo a random drug test and was replaced by Vitor Belfort.[79][80] However, Sonnen subsequently failed his random drug test and was removed from the bout.[81]\\r\\nFollowing the controversy of his second failed drug test, Sonnen announced on the June 11, 2014, episode of UFC Tonight his retirement from MMA competition.[82]\\r\\nSubsequent to his retirement, it was revealed on June 28, 2014, by the NSAC that Sonnen had failed a second random drug test √ø the third failed drug test throughout his MMA career √ø due to the presence of human growth hormone (HGH), recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO), anastrozole, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).[83]\\r\\nOn June 30, 2014, UFC and FOX Sports announced they had terminated Sonnen's contract as a UFC analyst due to his multiple failed drug tests.[84] On July 23, 2014, the NSAC ruled that Sonnen would be suspended for 2 years from martial arts competition worldwide due to his multiple failed drugs tests.[85]\\r\\nOn September 15, 2016, it was reported that Sonnen had signed a multi-fight contract with Bellator MMA.[86]\\r\\nSonnen made his promotional debut in a light heavyweight match against former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion and UFC Hall of Famer Tito Ortiz on January 21, 2017 in the main event at Bellator 170.[87] He lost the fight via submission in the first round.\\r\\nHis second promotional fight was a rescheduled match up against Wanderlei Silva on June 24, 2017 in the main event at Bellator NYC.[88] He won the fight via unanimous decision.[89]He got knocked down in the first round but dominated the rest of the fight to guarantee a win over his long-time rival. [90]In his post-fight speech, he called for a bout with heavyweight Fedor Emilianenko, who had lost earlier on the card.[91]\\r\\nSonnen faced Quinton Jackson for the Bellator Heavyweight World Grand Prix Tournament on January 20, 2018 at Bellator 192.[92] He won the fight via unanimous decision[93], securing a takedown in each round to establish the win.\\r\\nSonnen is to face Fedor Emelianenko next in the semifinals of the Bellator Heavyweight Grand Prix tournament at a yet-to-be-determined event.[94]\\r\\nSonnen ran as the Republican candidate for the 37th district of the Oregon House of Representatives in 2010. That June, he dropped out of the race, vaguely referring to a \\"2006 legal issue\\" involving real estate.[95]\\r\\nOn November 11, 2014, ESPN announced it had hired Sonnen as an MMA analyst. He debuted on November 14, previewing UFC 180.[96]\\r\\nOn May 6, 2015, professional wrestling promotion Global Force Wrestling (GFW) announced Sonnen as an \\"expert analyst\\" for its future events.[97] On July 24, Sonnen was revealed as part of the announce team for GFW's Amped program.[98]\\r\\nOn September 2, 2015, it was announced that Sonnen signed with the World Series of Fighting to become a member of their broadcast team beginning at WSOF 23.[99]\\r\\nSonnen is a licensed realtor in Oregon. In 2006, as the agent for a home sale, he told the title company to pay a plumbing company owned by Sonnen's mother[100] for repairs, even though he knew they would not be carried out. After the mortgage company agreed to the loan, the plumbing company was paid $69,000 and, at Sonnen's direction, paid the home buyer $65,000.[101] On January 3, 2011, Sonnen pleaded guilty to money laundering in connection with mortgage fraud. After agreeing to testify against others involved in the investigation,[102] he was fined $10,000 and sentenced to two years probation.[103]\\r\\nIn 2012, Chael Sonnen started Mean Streets Pizza with business partner Lee Gamble in West Linn, Oregon.[104] In February 2013 Chael Sonnen sued his business partner for embezzlement and unpaid rent.[105] Lee Gamble filed a counter lawsuit seeking $400,000 in damages from Sonnen for defamation, wage reimbursement, and his ownership interest in the business.[106] The case was settled and did not go to trial. Sonnen later sold Mean Streets Pizza and it is under new management.\\r\\nSonnen has appeared in the following films:\\r\\nIn 2017, he appeared on The New Celebrity Apprentice, the 8th season of reality game show The Celebrity Apprentice. He was fired by host Arnold Schwarzenegger in the show's 4th week after it emerged that he had deliberately cut his team's computer cord in order to gain them more time.[107]\\r\\nSonnen is a Catholic.[8]\\r\\nSonnen married his wife, a woman named Brittany, in July 2013.[108] The couple had their first child, a son named Thero, on June 4, 2015.[109] On the next episode of his podcast, he said that he had never understood parents who describe something as mundane as birth as a miracle, but that now he understood. He also said, \\"I love hearing him scream. People get upset when their baby cries, man, I've waited a long time to hear that cry, I've got no problem with it. In my house, we understand, if you want to be heard, you gotta make a little noise.\\"[110]\\r\\nOn May 5, 2013, Sonnen announced he would like to buy WWE (valued at roughly $700 million[111]) after he retires. Though his representative insisted he was not joking, a WWE representative said it was not for sale, and suggested Sonnen purchase stock in the company instead.[112]","input":"Who won anderson silva vs chael sonnen 1?"},{"output":"about 11 picas wide (or about 1.83 inches)","context":"A column inch was the standard measurement of the amount of content in published works that use multiple columns per page. A column inch is a unit of space one column wide by one inch high.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNewspaper pages are laid out on a grid that consists of a margin on 4 sides, a number of vertical columns and space in between columns, called gutters.[1] Broadsheet newspaper pages in the United States usually have 6-9 columns, while tabloid sized publications have 5 columns.\\r\\nIn the United States, a common newspaper column measurement is about 11 picas wide (or about 1.83 inches), though this measure varies from paper to paper and in other countries. The examples in this article follow this assumption for illustrative purposes only.\\r\\nNewspapers sell advertising space on a page to retail advertisers, advertising agencies and other media buyers. Newspapers publish a \\"per column inch\\" rate based on their circulation and demographic figures. Generally, the more readers the higher the column inch rate is. Newspapers with more affluent readers may be able to command an even higher column inch rate. For most newspapers, however, the published rate is just a starting point. Sales representatives generally negotiate lower rates for frequent advertisers.\\r\\nAdvertisements are measured using column inches. An advertisement that is 1 column inch square is 11 picas wide by 1?inch high. The column inch size for advertisements that spread over more than one column is determined by multiplying the number of inches high by number of columns. For example, an advertisement that is 3 columns wide by 6?inches high takes up 18 column inches (3 columns wide multiplied by 6?inches high).\\r\\nTo determine the cost of the advertisement, multiply the number of column inches by the newspaper's rate. So, if a newspaper charges $10 per column inch, the cost for the advertisement discussed above would be $180.00 (18 column inches multiplied by $10.00). Advertisements that span over more than one column also gain a small amount of extra space in between columns because they stretch across the gutters. Gutters are the empty space between columns. Gutters range from about 10 points to about 1 pica wide. In addition, most newspapers charge for an extra column if an advertisement is a double truck.\\r\\nIn the newspaper industry, ad and newsroom staffers will refer to an advertisement's size by saying \\"it's a (column width) by (inch height) ad,\\" replacing the words in parentheses () with a single figure. This can be confusing because it refers to two distinct measurements as if they were measured with the same unit. Normally one would think a 3 by 6 advertisement would be 3?inches wide by 6?inches high  but in reality it's actually about 5.5?inches wide by 6?inches high. In writing, an \\"G\\" is usually used to separate the two figures. Whether written or spoken, most, if not all, newspaper professionals understand the first figure is the column width and the second figure is the inch height.\\r\\nNowadays, most newspapers and magazines have converted to a \\"modular\\" system that simplifies ad size and eliminates the need to figure out column inches. In a modular system ad sizes are represented by the amount of the total page the ad takes up. For example, 1/2 page, 1/4 page, 1/8 page, etc. This has been a popular system among many newspapers because it simplifies the layout process (i.e. less ad sizes to fit in newspaper) and makes pricing much easier for an advertiser to understand.\\r\\nColumn inches are also used as an ad hoc estimate of the importance of a news story and are also used to tell how much copy a reporter should write. This harks back to the paste up days, when in fact newspaper stories used to be printed on long strips of paper that were 1 column wide. The length would vary based on how long the story was.\\r\\nThe software used in most present-day newsrooms still measures column inches to give reporters and editors an estimate on how much space a story will take up on a page. Reporters usually refer to story lengths in inches, which actually refers to how many column inches a story takes up. Although it varies, it is generally agreed upon that there are 25-35 words in a column inch.\\r\\nNewsroom staffers also measure items such as photographs and infographics using column inches.","input":"How wide is a column in a newspaper?"},{"output":"7 July","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2018 Tour de France was the 105th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's three Grand Tours. The 3,351?km (2,082?mi) race started from Noirmoutier-en-l'?le, in the Vende department, on 7 July and concluded with the Champs-lyses stage in Paris, on 29 July.[n 1] A total of 176 riders across 22 teams were participating in the 21-stage race. The Tour was the shortest of the millennium and was the fifth time a tour had set out from Vende. The race was won for the first time by Geraint Thomas of Team Sky. Tom Dumoulin (Team Sunweb) placed second, with Thomas' teammate and four-time Tour champion Chris Froome coming third.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opening stage was won by Fernando Gaviria of Quick-Step Floors, who became the Tour's first rider to wear the general classification leader's yellow jersey. Peter Sagan (Bora√øHansgrohe) then took the race lead the following stage. BMC Racing Team won stage three's team time trial, putting their rider Greg Van Avermaet in yellow. He held the jersey for eight days until the second high mountain stage, where stage winner Thomas took the lead. He held it for the rest of the race to become the first Welshman to win the overall race. As a result, Team Skyand additionally British riderswon six of the previous seven Tours dating back to 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nSagan won the points classification for the sixth time, Julian Alaphilippe (Quick-Step Floors) won the mountains classification, and Pierre Latour of AG2R La Mondiale won the young rider classification. Movistar Team won the team classification, and UAE Team Emirates rider Dan Martin was named the most combative for the entire race.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 18 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited to the race. On 6 January 2018, organisers of the Tour, the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), announced the four second-tier UCI Professional Continental teams that received a wildcard invitation to participate in the event. The four teams were Cofidis, Direct nergie, Fortuneo√øSamsic, from France and Belgium's Wanty√øGroupe Gobert, all of which have participated in the race before.[2] This meant that new French team Vital Concept, with their team leader, sprinter Bryan Coquard, missed out on the race. Christian Prudhomme wished the team the best in their inaugural season.[3] The presentation of the teamswhere the members of each team's roster are introduced in front of the media and local dignitariestook place on Place Napoleon?(fr) in the town of La Roche-sur-Yon on 5 July, two days before the opening stage.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew rules by the cycling's governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) reduced the number of riders per team for Grand Tours from 9 to 8, resulting in a start list total of 176, instead of the usual 198.[5][6] Of these, 35 competed in their first Tour de France.[7] The total number of riders that finished the race was 145.[8] The riders came from 30 countries. Seven countries had more than 10 riders in the race: France (35), Belgium (19), the Netherlands (13), Italy (13), Australia (11), Germany (11) and Spain (11).[6] The average age of riders in the race was 29.37 years,[9] ranging from the 21-year-old Egan Bernal (Team Sky) to the 40-year-old Franco Pellizotti (Bahrain√øMerida).[10][11] Groupama√øFDJ had the youngest average age while Bahrain√øMerida had the oldest.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe teams entering the race were:[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nUCI WorldTeams\\r\\n\\r\\nUCI Professional Continental teams\\r\\n\\r\\nDefending champion Chris Froome (Team Sky) had generally been considered the main favourite for the general classification.[13] He had won four out of the last five editions, and was also the current defending champion at both other Grand Tours, the Vuelta a Espa?a and the Giro d'Italia. However, Froome's participation was cast into doubt when he returned a urine sample at the 2017 Vuelta a Espa?a, which contained twice the allowed amount of the asthma drug salbutamol. This was considered not as a positive doping result, but as an \\"Adverse Analytical Finding\\" (AAF), meaning that he was allowed to continue racing until the case was resolved. He did however face the possibility of losing his Vuelta victory and all subsequent results.[14] The ASO were unhappy with the situation, which was very similar to that of Alberto Contador, who started the 2011 Tour with his case over a positive test for clenbuterol still unresolved.[15] The UCI conducted an investigation into the AAF, which was still unresolved at the time that Froome won the 2018 Giro d'Italia. With an outcome before the start of the Tour unlikely, the ASO attempted to bar Froome from starting the race, citing article 28 of the race's rules, saying that the organiser \\"expressly reserves the right to refuse participation inor to exclude fromthe event, a team or any of its members whose presence would be such as to damage the image or reputation of ASO or the event\\".[16] Froome was cleared by the UCI on 2 July 2018, with a press statement reading that the authorities had found sufficient evidence \\"that Mr Froomes sample results do not constitute an AAF\\".[17] He was thereafter cleared to start the Tour by the ASO as well.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe closest rivals of Froome were thought to be Richie Porte (BMC Racing Team), Nairo Quintana, Mikel Landa (both of Movistar Team), Tom Dumoulin (Team Sunweb), and Vincenzo Nibali (Bahrain√øMerida).[19] The other riders considered contenders for the general classification were Geraint Thomas (Team Sky), Romain Bardet (AG2R La Mondiale), Primo? Rogli? (LottoNL√øJumbo), Adam Yates (Mitchelton√øBikeExchange), Jakob Fuglsang (Astana), Alejandro Valverde (Movistar Team), Rigoberto Urn (EF Education First√øDrapac p/b Cannondale), Dan Martin (UAE Team Emirates), Bob Jungels (Quick-Step Floors) and Ilnur Zakarin (Team Katusha√øAlpecin).[13][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sprinters considered favourites for the points classification and wins on the flat or hilly bunch sprint finishes were Peter Sagan (Bora√øHansgrohe), Fernando Gaviria (Quick-Step Floors), Dylan Groenewegen (LottoNL√øJumbo), Arnaud Dmare (Groupama√øFDJ), Marcel Kittel (Team Katusha√øAlpecin), Michael Matthews (Team Sunweb), Mark Cavendish (Team Dimension Data), Andr Greipel (Lotto√øSoudal), Alexander Kristoff (UAE Team Emirates), Sonny Colbrelli (Bahrain√øMerida) and John Degenkolb (Trek√øSegafredo).[29][30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 February 2017 at a rugby union match between France and Scotland at the Stade de France, the Tour's race director Christian Prudhomme announced the start of the 2018 Tour (known as the Grand Dpart) would be in the Vende department, in the Pays de la Loire region. The departments in the Pays de la Loire region hosted the Tour de France in its first edition back in 1903. Since then, the cities and towns of the Pays de la Loire region have welcomed the Grand Dpart of the Tour de France nine times, five of which have set out from the Vende. The last time the region hosted the Tour was in 2011.[32] Two weeks after the announcement, the ASO revealed that the Grand Dpart would take place over three stages, with the third a team time trial.[33] In June 2017, the UCIs Professional Cycling Council (PCC) moved the start of the Tour a week later than usual and originally planned due to a clash with the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[1] The full route was announced on 17 October 2017; it was almost completely within France, with short deviations into Spain in the Pyrenees were the only exceptions. It would feature two of the Tour's most historic climbs, Alpe d'Huez and the Col de Tourmalet, which last featured in 2015 and 2016 respectively. For the first time in 60 to 70 years, it included a section of unpaved roads on the Glires Plateau.[34] Of the route, Mark Cavendish labelled it \\"absolutely brutal\\".[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were 21 stages in the race, covering a total distance of 3,351?km (2,082?mi), the shortest of the 21st century.[36][37] The race also included 21.7?km (13.5?mi) of cobblestones (or pavs) in stage 9, which were last featured in 2015. In the first week of the race, two laps of the short, but steep, M?r-de-Bretagne were included.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nStage one's bunch sprint was won by Tour debutant Fernando Gaviria, with Peter Sagan coming in second and Marcel Kittel in third. Gaviria took the yellow and green jerseys as the leader of the general and points classifications respectively. Kvin Ledanois (Fortuneo√øSamsic) took the first polka dot jersey as the leader of the mountains classification.[38] Sagan won stage two from a sprint to take the yellow and green jerseys, with Dion Smith of Wanty√øGroupe Gobert claiming the polka.[39] Stage three's team time trial was won by BMC Racing Team whose riders Tejay van Garderen and Greg Van Avermaet became tied for the overall lead,[40] with Van Avermaet moving into yellow for the second time in his career due to him crossing the finish line ahead of Van Garderen in the first two stages being as there was not yet an individual time trial to measure their times down to the 1000th of a second.[41] Stage four was won by Gaviria from a bunch sprint.[42][43] Sagan further extend his lead in the points competition by winning stage five. Also in stage five, Toms Skuji?? of Trek√øSegafredo won the mountains points which gave him the polka. Skujins became the first rider from Latvia to ever lead the mountains classification.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nStage six was a sprint that Sagan and John Degenkolb raced for, seeing as virtually all of the top sprinters finished close to fifteen minutes behind the general classification contenders. Team Sky, BMC Racing Team, and Movistar Team controlled the peloton, where Geraint Thomas reeled in the final breakaway rider and won the three second time bonus sprint that put him back only three seconds behind Van Avermaet in the general classification. With only about a kilometre to go Dan Martin attacked and was able to stay away and win the stage one second ahead of the bulk of the general classification contenders. Romain Bardet and Tom Dumoulin suffered mechanical issues late in the stage which made them lose time.[45][46] Stage seven was the longest stage. At the start of stage seven, Van Avermaet remained in the yellow jersey with Thomas in second at three seconds behind. The stage was won by Dylan Groenewegen. There were multiple crashes in the first week of the tour and after stage seven, six riders had abandoned the race for various reasons including the promising young Belgian Tiesj Benoot (Lotto√øSoudal), Luis Le‹án Snchez (Astana),[47] and the green jersey winner of the 2017 Tour Michael Matthews.[48] This marked the end of the first week of the tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nGroenewegen then won his second sprint stage in a row. Notably, Greipel and Gaviria were penalized for headbutting each other and lost their placing and green jersey points.[49] Martin lost more than a minute after being involved in a crash during the stage. Van Avermaet improved his lead in the general classification after earning a single second in the bonus sprint.[50] Stage nine was the cobblestone stage that was a bad day for numerous sprinters and general classification riders. Richie Porte abandoned after a crash for the second year in a row.[51] Egan Bernal, Jakob Fuglsang, Chris Froome, and Mikel Landa crashed as did many other riders; many riders had flat tires as well, including Bardet who got three of them.[52] Meanwhile, Yves Lampaert (Quick-Step Floors), Degenkolb, and Van Avermaet survived the carnage going on around them to escape the remaining peloton and cross the finish together with Degenkolb winning his first Tour stage, as Van Avermaet gained time as well as another time bonus to extend his lead in the yellow jersey.[53] The following day was the Tour's first rest day.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first stage at high altitude and first in the Alps, the tenth, was won by Quick-Step Floors rider Julian Alaphilippe from a large breakaway that included race leader Van Avermaet. Eventually, Alaphillipe attacked and won his first Tour stage while Van Avermaet retained his yellow jersey and extended his lead to nearly two and a half minutes,[54] when many people thought he would not be retaining it.[55] Alaphillipe also took the mountains classification.[54] Thomas achieved back-to-back summit finish wins both from the group of favourites on stages eleven and twelve by pushing the breakaway riders until the very end. In the steep finish of the eleventh, Thomas attacked in the final kilometre and passed lone breakaway rider Mikel Nieve (Mitchelton√øScott) to take the win.[56] He won stage twelve from a sprint on flat finish atop Alpe d'Huez. Dumoulin and Froome arose as the likely contenders in Paris.[57] Sagan won stage thirteen after coming out of nowhere while Kristoff and Arnaud Dmare (Groupama√øFDJ) dueled it out.[58] In stage fourteen, Omar Fraile of Astana came out of the breakaway and remarkably opened a twenty-minute gap to the main peloton with the yellow jersey contenders. After the Alps, it was basically down to three riders in contention, Thomas, Froome, and Dumoulin. There were many withdrawals after the Alps after names like Kittel, Mark Cavendish, Rigoberto Uran, Gaviria, Groenewegen, and Andre Griepel withdrew for various reasons. Vincenzo Nibali was forced to withdraw after fracturing a vertebrae in his back after being involved in an accident with a spectator near the summit of Alpe d'huez. Smoke from flares and animosity towards Froome were a factor and better security was called for by many people for the final week.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nStage fifteen, the start of the final week, was once again a breakaway victory. Magnus Cort took Astana's second win in two days as there were no major changes overall.[60] The next day was the second rest day of the race.[36] Stage sixteen had a further incident when the police used tear gas against a protest by local farmers who had placed hay bales on the road. As the riders passed that point, there was still gas in the air. The race was neutralized for about fifteen minutes because several riders had problems with their eyes and had to rinse them.[61] After the restart, a large breakaway escaped and Philippe Gilbert (Quick-Step Floors), while in the lead on a descent, lost control of his bike and smashed into and over the wall. Later, Adam Yates, having taken the lead, fell on the final descent and handed the position and win to Alaphilippe, giving him his second stage win of the tour.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the first of the three Pyrenan stages, seventeen, Froome's challenge faded on the approach to the summit of the Col de Portet and he dropped to third position in the general classification, 2:31 behind Thomas. Dumoulin moved into second place, 1:59 off the lead. Nairo Quintana won the stage after attacking at the bottom of the final climb, moving himself up to fifth overall, behind Primo? Rogli?.[63] The flat stage eighteen was won by Demare from a sprint finish; by now most of the top sprint had now left the race and Sagan was suffering with injury.[64] On the mountainous stage nineteen from Lourdes to Laruns, Rogli? attacked on the final climb, the Col d'Aubisque, and soloed to the finish nineteen seconds ahead of the chasing group of overall favourites. Thomas was able to consolidate his position in the yellow jersey by picking up six bonus seconds in the sprint thereby extending his lead over Dumoulin to 2 min 5 s.[65] The penultimate stage was a 31?km (19.3?mi) time trial, Dumoulin won the stage, one second ahead of Froome. Thomas survived a scare when his back wheel locked, but completed the time trial successfully, finishing fourteen seconds behind Dumoulin taking a lead of 1 min 51 s into the final stage.[66] The stage was won by Kristoff in a bunch sprint on the Champs-lyses in Paris.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour main individual classifications were contested in the 2018 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage.[68] Time bonuses were awarded at the end of every stage apart from the time trial stages. The first three riders would get 10, 6, and 4 seconds, respectively. Time bonuses of three, two and one seconds, would be given to the first three riders to cross a \\"bonus point\\" in each of the first nine mass-start stages of the race. It would affect the general classification, but not the points.[69] For crashes within the final 3?km (1.9?mi) of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, any rider involved would receive the same time as the group he was in when the crash occurred.[70] The rider with the lowest cumulative time would be the winner of the general classification and the overall winner of the Tour.[68] The rider leading the classification would wear a yellow jersey.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type.[72] The leader was identified by a green jersey.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorized, in order of increasing difficulty, as fourth-, third-, second-, and first-category and hors catgorie (read: \\"beyond category\\").[72] Double points were awarded at the top of the last mountains in the three mountain stages in the Pyrenees (16, 17 and 19).[73] The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but was restricted to riders born on or after 1 January 1993.[72] The leader wears a white jersey.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie.[72] The riders in the team that lead this classification are identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys and yellow helmets.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \\"made the greatest effort and who demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\\".[69] No combativity awards are given for the time trials and the final stage.[75] The winner wore a red number bib the following stage.[76] At the conclusion of the Tour, a rider would win the overall super-combativity award which was, again, awarded by a jury.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of ?2,287,750 was awarded in cash prizes in the race.[75] The overall winner of the general classification received ?500,000, with the second and third placed riders getting ?200,000 and ?100,000 respectively.[77] All finishers in the top 160 were awarded money.[77] The holders of the classifications would benefit on each stage they led; the final winners of the points and mountains would be given ?25,000, while the best young rider and most combative rider would get ?20,000.[78] The team classification winners was given ?50,000.[79] ?11,000 was given to the winners of each stage of the race, with smaller amounts given to places 2√ø20.[77] There were also two special awards each with a prize of ?5000.[75] The Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given to first rider to pass the summit of the highest climb in the Tour, the Col du Portet on stage seventeen,[80] and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given to the first rider to pass Goddet's memorial at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet in stage nineteen.[75] Nairo Quintana won the Henri Desgrange and Julian Alaphilippe won the Jacques Goddet.[81][82]","input":"When does the 2018 tour de france start?"},{"output":"1969 Dodge Charger","context":"The General Lee (sometimes referred to as simply \\"the General\\") is the name given to a 1969 Dodge Charger driven in the television series The Dukes of Hazzard by the Duke boys, Bo and Luke, along with cousins Coy and Vance (in season 5). It is known for its signature horn, its police chases, stuntsespecially its long jumpsand for having its doors welded shut, leaving the Dukes to climb in and out through the windows. The car appears in every episode but one (\\"Mary Kaye's Baby\\"). The car's name is a reference to American Civil War general Robert E. Lee. It bears a Confederate flag (a rectangular variant of the square battle flag of Lee's Army of Northern Virginia) on its roof, and also has a horn which plays the first twelve notes of the song \\"Dixie\\".[1]\\r\\nThe idea for the General Lee was developed from the bootlegger Jerry Rushing's car, which was named for Lee's favorite horse, Traveller. Traveller was also the name of the car in Moonrunners, the 1975 movie precursor to The Dukes of Hazzard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the estimated number of General Lees used varies from different sources, according to former cast member Ben Jones (\\"Cooter\\" in the show), as well as builders involved with the show, 325 General Lees were used to film the series. Others claim about 255 were used in the series. Approximately 17 still exist in various states of repair. On average, more than one General Lee was used up per show. When filming a jump, anywhere from 500 to 1,000 pounds (230 to 450?kg) of sand bags or concrete ballast was placed in the trunk to prevent the car from nosing over. Later in the series the mechanics would raise the front end of the car to keep it from scraping against the ramp causing it to lose speed, thereby providing a cushion for the driver upon landing. Stunt drivers report enjoying the flights but hating the landings. Despite the ballast, the landing attitude of the car was somewhat unpredictable, resulting in moderate to extremely violent forces, depending on how it landed. On many of the jumps the cars bent upon impact. All cars used in large jumps were immediately retired due to structural damage.\\r\\nChargers from model-years 1968 & 1969 (no 1970 Chargers were used until the 2005 movie) were sourced and converted to General Lee specifications (taillights, grills, etc.). Despite popular belief, according to all builders involved over the years, obtaining cars was not a problem until later years. By that time, the car was the star of the show and Warner Bros. (WB) moved building of the cars in-house to keep the cars consistent in appearance. Later in the show's run, when it got too hard and/or expensive to continue procuring more Chargers, the producers started using more \\"jump footage\\" from previous episodes. In the final season radio-controlled miniatures were occasionally used to the chagrin of several cast members.\\r\\nEpisodes 1 through 5 were filmed in the Georgia towns of Covington and Conyers in November and December 1978. Georgia episode cars consisted of six Dodge Chargers. The first General Lees were built by Warner Bros. and shipped to Georgia where John Marendi (picture car coordinator) labeled the first three cars \\"LEE 1\\", \\"LEE 2\\", and \\"LEE 3\\" in no particular order for film editing purposes.\\r\\nLEE 1 was a second unit car with a full roll cage. It is a 383 V8-powered 1969 Charger equipped with air-conditioning, an AM/FM stereo, power steering, and power drum brakes. It was originally painted in code T3 \\"Light Bronze Metallic\\" with a tan interior, a black vinyl top and chrome rocker trim. The rocker trim was left on due to previously poor body work on the left quarter panel, the gas cap trim, and wheel well trim were missing so the trim was removed on LEE 2 and 3 to match. It should also be noted that the chrome vinyl top trim was supposed to be removed but since the left quarter panel had been replaced and was very poorly installed the trim had to be left on to hide the body work and as a result most General Lees throughout the series had vinyl top trim. After the now-famous jump over Rosco P. Coltrane's police cruiser by stuntman Craig Baxley, it was stripped of its front seats and 1969-specific grill and taillight panel. LEE 1 was used once more as the \\"Richard Petty\\" tire test car in the fourth episode \\"Repo Men\\".\\r\\nLEE 2, like LEE 1, was a second unit car with a full roll cage, a 383 V-8, a floor shifted automatic transmission and A/C. Originally painted B5 Blue with a black interior, the interior was repainted tan to match LEE 1 and 3 though its steering wheel remained black. It was used for the opening scene in \\"One Armed Bandits\\". In this scene, Bo and Luke were chasing Rosco's police cruiser with the General after Cooter stole it.\\r\\nLEE 3 was the first unit 1 close-up car and the first General Lee built by Warner Brothers; it is seen in the first publicity photos. It was originally a F5 Medium Green Metallic R/T SE (Special Edition) model with a tan vinyl top. It was powered by a 440 Magnum engine with 375 HP, the car weighed 3,671-pound (1,665?kg). LEE 3 was equipped with A/C, power windows, a wood grain dash, and an AM radio. It also had a factory tachometer (which can be seen on \\"Repo Men\\"). This car had a tan leather interior and a removable roll bar that allowed installation of a camera for in-car shots. This car was painted 1975 Corvette Flame Red with a special base coat; the base coat was used after they found LEE 1's paint appeared to be blotchy due to the direct application over factory paint, they had first been painted Chrysler code EV2 or \\"Hemi Orange\\". Eventually, the first three General Lees started to show visible damage, so the crew had to start making more. The first General Lee built in Georgia was a 1968 Charger converted to look like a 1969; the tail light panel, front grill, and front seats taken from LEE 1 were used. Interiors not originally tan were sprayed with SEM brand \\"Saddle tan\\" vinyl dye. The first three Georgia Lees had a set of crossed flags (a Confederate flag and checkered flag) on the panel between the rear window and trunk lid. Although four sets were created, only three were used. They were discontinued due to the continuity of the General Lee graphics, making it one less thing to be used. The three surviving cars went back to California and had the crossed flags removed upon reconditioning. The wheels were generally 14-by-7-inch (36?cm G?18?cm) American Racing brand \\"Vectors\\" throughout the show (with Carroll Shelby center caps) and were mainly mounted on P235/70R14 B.?F. Goodrich Radial T/A tires with the blackwall side facing out.\\r\\nLEE 1 was sold to professional golfer Bubba Watson at the 2012 Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale auction for US$110,000 (US$121,000 after buyer premium).[2][3][4][5]\\r\\nAndre and Renaud Veluzat built General Lees for WB from the second season into the fourth season. Viewers can also see two \\"Georgia\\" cars used often up into the early second season. LEE 3 and a specially caged car never appearing (but built) in Georgia were used heavily in early California episodes. The Veluzats were somewhat inconsistent in how they built the cars, so this is when the most variations from specification are found. The paint was GM code 70, Flame Red (still orange, just the name of the color), but there does appear to be some variance here: interiors were mostly dyed brown and occasionally SEM Saddle Tan. According to some sources, the Veluzats charged WB $250 a week per car for rental and a lump sum of $2000 to $3000 upon destruction of the vehicles; this included police cars. WB mechanics had to maintain the cars at company expense.\\r\\nThe money generated by building General Lees financed the Veluzat family project of restoring Gene Autry's Melody Ranch; it had burned in the 1960s. This ranch is where many classic Western films were shot, as well as the television series Gunsmoke. Today, it is a fully functional movie ranch where shows such as HBO's Deadwood are filmed.\\r\\nBy 1983, Warner Brothers turned total control of building General Lees to a man named Ken Fritz. Fritz didn't have the job long before he too was fired and at this point Warner Brothers moved full production in-house. The General Lee was now the highlight of the series, and WB received enormous amounts of Lee-specific fan mail that nit-picked the inconsistencies of the cars. Because of the fame of General Lee, WB had their staff mechanics build the cars to a specific appearance, even underneath. All graphics had to meet specifications, all side markers and rocker panel chrome trim were removed; and roll bars and push bars had to meet an exact specification. However, some changes were made before the specifications were laid out: The push bar became wider, the interior became a light beige color, and the roll bars were covered in black foam padding. During this period, the only way to distinguish the 1968 conversions from the 1969 originals is by the shape of the dashboard padding.\\r\\nAs the WB era rolled on, finding the cars became difficult: Piper Cubs were hired to perform aerial searches for 1968, 1969, and 1970 Chargers amongst the populace; the jumped cars were now no longer scrapped after one jump if deemed salvageable, and were repaired and used until they could no longer function; and, as last resort, miniature radio-controlled models were also brought in toward the end of the series to replace most of the big jump stunts, thereby saving more carssomething that proved unpopular with many episode directors (including Tom Wopat) who felt that the models did not look realistic. By this time, there was also a rivalry for \\"TV's greatest car\\" with the Knight Rider series, leading to the models being used more and more for greater jumps to try to out-do that series. Taking full control also saved some money, as now WB had the ability to buy cars, recondition them, and use them without paying daily rental fees.\\r\\nAt the beginning of the movie, the General was a faded orange with a hand-painted \\"01\\" on the doors, black steel wheels, standard front bumper, and no Confederate Naval Flag. Midway through the film, Cooter repairs the General after it is vandalized by Boss Hogg's hirelings. He repaints it a bright Hemi orange and adds the well-known trademarks (American Racing \\"Vector\\" 10-spoke \\"turbine\\" wheels, octagonal \\"01\\", black grille guard, Confederate flag on the roof, \\"Dixie\\" horn, and \\"General Lee\\" above the door window openings).\\r\\nThe movie General not only flies and makes controlled landings, but also drifts with the aid of professional drifter Rhys Millen. During jump scenes, some stunt cars were propelled under their own power by stunt drivers; others had their engines and transmissions removed. The engineless Chargers were then launched without drivers by a gas-driven catapult similar in principle to those used on aircraft carriers. Approximately 24 1968 to 1970 Chargers were used in the film.\\r\\nUnlike the television show era Lees, the movie cars used aftermarket graphic kits. The movie gave them new credibility and is no longer considered to be an inaccurate choice. Otherwise, except for the white letters on the Goodrich \\"Radial T/A\\" tires, the exterior of the movie's \\"close-up\\" General Lees varied little from the television show cars. The paint was \\"Big Bad Orange\\" (an American Motors Corporation color) rather than Corvette \\"Flame Red\\"; the interior headliner was black instead of tan, an actual roll cage was used; a three-spoke Grant wood-trimmed steering wheel replaced the standard wheel, an AM/FM stereo radio with Compact Disc player was installed in the dashboard; and the interiors were a custom color vinyl fabric made to look like the dye/paint used in the later eras of the TV show. One still can differentiate the 1968 Chargers by looking at the dash pad, but now 1970 Chargers were thrown in the mix. The cars somewhat resembled a late 1990s to early 2000s (decade) General Lee clone, but the overall flavor of the General Lee is still obvious. On all of the cars, the back-up lights and side marker lenses were removed, the openings filled in.\\r\\nEleven of the cars used for the movie had been purchased from the Luedtke Auto Group. Many of the cars had been cut up to allow for inside camera views.\\r\\nGeneral Lee number 020 was the drift car used in the drifting scene around Lee Circle and was also the car racing the black Shelby at the end of the movie. It was the only 4-speed equipped cars and was the backup to car #005. The car contains a unique emergency brake handle near the shifter that allowed the stunt driver quick access to locking the rear brakes at will. Though it did sustain some damage during filming, it is fully road worthy and is privately owned by Troy Martinson in Minnesota.[citation needed]\\r\\nTwo of the General Lees (a 1969 R/T SE and a 1970 made to appear as a 1969) were temporarily sold to Warner Brothers by Everett \\"J.R.\\" Barton of Wichita, Kansas, for $1.00 each then sold back to him for $1.25. They were picked up from him in Wichita and were transported to Baton Rouge, both in driving condition. The 1970 (made to 1969) car then had the engine removed, got the General Lee treatment then weight added to balance the car for the main Freeway jump. One other car was used before this car. The first one landed hard on its nose, broke, and careened right into the guardrail. Given its problematic landing it was not used for that scene. Mr. Barton's car, number 127, was then used for that scene. It was launched from a catapult system, much like that used on aircraft carriers. It flew the farthest of all the jumps in the film and truly did survive. This is the car that made that jump in the film. After the filming the cars were returned to Everett. Everett then put a motor back in the car and even in its jumped condition had driven it in a couple of parades. After keeping the car for 8 years, he sold it to an individual that plans to have it restored to show quality. It will be restored from the men on the TV show Graveyard Cars.[citation needed]\\r\\nEarly in the fifth-season episode \\"Exposed\\" of the television series Smallville, former Dukes of Hazzard co-star Tom Wopat (Luke Duke), playing Kansas Senator Jack Jennings, old friend of Jonathan Kent, played by John Schneider (Bo Duke), fishtails his car into the Kent farmyard. The car is a 1968 Dodge Charger R/T, painted blue instead of orange, and lacking the General Lee's distinctive insignia.\\r\\nIn 2014 the General Lee was featured in a commercial spot for AutoTrader.[6] The commercial featured the General Lee with Dukes of Hazzard stars John Schneider and Tom Wopat. The Duke's theme song \\"Good Ole Boys\\" can be heard playing during the commercial. The video was released on June 6, 2014.\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina shooting deaths, there was a backlash against the Confederate battle flag, due to the flag's historical associations with treason, racism, slavery, and white supremacy.[7][8] In response, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. announced they would halt production of General Lee toy cars.[9] Ben Jones criticized the move, stating, \\"I think all of Hazzard Nation understands that the Confederate battle flag is the symbol that represents the indomitable spirit of independence which keeps us 'makin' our way the only way we know how.'\\"[10] John Schneider responded by stating, \\"I take exception to those who say that the flag on the General Lee should always be considered a symbol of racism. Is the flag used as such in other applications? Yes, but certainly not on the Dukes.\\"[11]\\r\\nOn July 2, 2015, golfer Bubba Watson, current owner of LEE 1, announced via Twitter that he would be painting over the Confederate flag on the car's roof.[12][13] Watson's announcement prompted Brian Grams, director of the Volo Auto Museum, to offer to purchase Watson's General Lee, citing how Watson's car was significant because it was used in the show's first season and would be worthy of inclusion in the museum's collection. His offer was turned down.[14]\\r\\nEngines in the TV show General Lees varied; they used 318, 383, and 440-cubic-inch engines. None of the TV series cars had the 426 Hemi, although in the 2005 The Dukes of Hazzard motion picture, Cooter replaced the \\"General's\\" original engine with a Chrysler 426 Hemi engine. However, the \\"close-up\\" Lees (except for the first one) were 383-powered. The special purpose built \\"Ski Car\\" (the car that was used for stunts involving driving on the left side or right side wheels with the opposite side wheels in the air) had a 318, as it was lighter weight. Most of the 'workhorse' stunt cars had 383s and 440s. The stunt drivers tended to prefer 440s (a higher performance engine) for jumps, so 440-powered stunt Lees were often saved for the higher bobby and longer jumps. Also, though early sound effects led many people to believe otherwise, only a handful of Chargers had manual transmissions; most had 727 TorqueFlite automatic transmissions.\\r\\nThe General Lee, except in the beginning of the movie, does not have opening doors. In the TV series, it is explained that racing cars have their doors welded shut, and this was often used for comedic effect when Uncle Jesse or Boss Hogg required help to squeeze through the window (WB stopped welding the doors for time crams). (In one episode, Sheriff Rosco hires a bounty hunter (Jason Steele in the show) to create a fake General Lee and trick the Dukes into driving it, at which point he promptly orders their arrest for auto theft. The fake car was easily identified because its doors opened.) This was not at first planned but while filming the first chase (where Bo and Luke are chasing Cooter in Rosco's car) the passenger's door handle was damaged (when it hit the mail boxes) and couldn't be opened from the outside, so Tom Wopat (Luke) climbed though the window and the director loved the move so much he had John Schneider (Bo) climb in too, this is why only LEE 1 and 2 had full roll cages and all other General Lees only had a roll bar (this made it easier for the actors to get in and out).[citation needed] In the movie, the car has been repaired after being trashed, but the doors could not be fixed fast enough. The driver and passenger must slide in the window (as in NASCAR). For a running entry, Bo and Luke also slide over the hood rather than walk around the front of the car. However, in the prequel The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning, the left door was welded shut while the right one was not.\\r\\nExhaust systems were basic: some had glasspack mufflers, but most had standard exhausts with the pipe cut just before the rear end. The exhaust sound that can be heard on most of the California-era episode General Lees is from a Thrush brand glasspack. The sounds came from the exhaust systems fitted to the \\"close-up\\" cars; the parts used were Blackjack brand headers, dual exhausts, and the aforementioned Thrush mufflers. However, the sounds were dubbed in after the scene was filmed.\\r\\n[15]Tires used on the General Lee varied, but the best known make and model was the B.F. Goodrich Radial T/A. The most common size was P235/70R14; P235/70R15 was also used. Winston Winners were also used.","input":"What kind of car was the dukes of hazzard car?"},{"output":"Ancient Egypt","context":"Bread was central to the formation of early human societies. From the western half of Asia, where wheat was domesticated, cultivation spread north and west, to Europe and North Africa. This in turn led to the formation of towns, as opposed to the nomadic lifestyle, and gave rise to more and more sophisticated forms of societal organization. Similar developments occurred in eastern Asia, centered on rice, and in the Americas with maize.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is extensive evidence of breadmaking in Ancient Egypt in the form of artistic depictions, remains of structures and items used in bread making, and remains of the dough and bread itself.[1][2][3][4][5][6]\\r\\nThe most common source of leavening in antiquity was to retain a piece of dough (with sugar and water in) from the previous day to utilize as a form of sourdough starter.[7] Pliny the Elder reported that the Gauls and Iberians used the foam skimmed from beer to produce \\"a lighter kind of bread than other peoples.\\" Parts of the ancient world that drank wine instead of beer used a paste composed of grape must and flour that was allowed to begin fermenting, or wheat bran steeped in wine, as a source for yeast.\\r\\nThe idea of a free-standing oven that could be pre-heated, with a door for access, appears to have been Greek.[8]\\r\\nEven in antiquity there were a wide variety of breads. In ancient times the Greek bread was barley bread: Solon declared that wheaten bread might only be baked for feast days. By the 5th century BC bread could be purchased in Athens from a baker's shop, and in Rome, Greek bakers appeared in the 2nd century BC, as Hellenized Asia Minor was added to Roman dominion as the province of Asia;[9] the foreign bakers of bread were permitted to form a collegium. In the Deipnosophistae, the author Athenaeus (c.A.D.170 √ø c. 230) describes some of the bread, cakes, and pastries available in the Classical world.[10] Among the breads mentioned are griddle cakes, honey-and-oil bread, mushroom-shaped loaves covered in poppy seeds, and the military specialty of rolls baked on a spit. The type and quality of flours used to produce bread could also vary, as noted by Diphilus when he declared \\"bread made of wheat, as compared with that made of barley, is more nourishing, more digestible, and in every way superior.\\" In order of merit, the bread made from refined [thoroughly sieved] flour comes first, after that bread from ordinary wheat, and then the unbolted, made of flour that has not been sifted.\\"[11] The essentiality of bread in the diet was reflected in the name for the rest of the meal: ‹ápson, \\"condiment\\", i.e. bread's accompaniment, whatever it might be.[12]\\r\\nIn medieval Europe, bread served not only as a staple food but also as part of the table service. In the standard table setting of the day the trencher, a piece of stale bread roughly 6?inches by 4?inches (15?cm by 10?cm), was served as an absorbent plate. At the completion of a meal the trencher could then be eaten, given to the poor, or fed to the dogs. It was not until the 15th century that trenchers made of wood started to replace the bread variety.[13]\\r\\nUp to the 19th century, bread in Europe was often adulterated with hazardous materials, including chalk, sawdust, alum, plaster, clay and ammonium carbonate. This gradually came to an end with government action, such as the 1860 and 1899 Food Adulteration Acts in Britain.[14] America had a more difficult time ending these processes of adulteration however, as various states had varying policies regarding bread making. [15]\\r\\nIn the late 19th century, the British empire encouraged a noticeable increase in import of bread from the colonies. This was regarded as British bread despite its origins, and institutes such as the Imperial Economic Committee encouraged the consumption and trade of foods such as bread from across the empire as they viewed it as cementing Britain's position in its colonies further. Advancements in refrigeration technology and techniques also encouraged an increase in the import of bread, as it could be preserved a lot longer than before and could be transported over longer distances. Bread was transported and stored using refrigeration more than most other foods, particularly in North America, as it was a staple food in most diets, more so than other staple foods like meat. [16]\\r\\nThe industrialization of bread-baking was a formative step in the creation of the modern world.[17] Otto Frederick Rohwedder is considered to be the father of sliced bread. In 1912 Rohwedder started work on inventing a machine that sliced bread, but bakeries were reluctant to use it since they were concerned the sliced bread would go stale. It was not until 1928, when Rohwedder invented a machine that both sliced and wrapped the bread, that sliced bread caught on. A bakery in Chillicothe, Missouri was the first to use this machine to produce sliced bread.\\r\\nFor generations, white bread was the preferred bread of the rich while the poor ate dark (whole grain) bread. However, in most western societies, the connotations reversed in the late 20th century, with whole grain bread becoming preferred as having superior nutritional value while white bread became associated with lower-class ignorance of nutrition.[18]\\r\\nA major change was the development in 1961 of the Chorleywood Bread Process. This used the intense mechanical working of dough, and control of gases touching dough, to dramatically reduce the fermentation period and the time taken to produce a loaf at the expense of taste and nutrition.[19] The process, whose high-energy mixing allows for the use of inferior grain, is now widely used around the world in large factories. In total contrast, traditional breadmaking is extremely time-consuming, as the dough is mixed with yeast and requires several cycles of kneading and resting in order to become ready for baking, and to produce the desired flavor and texture.\\r\\nMore recently, and especially in smaller retail bakeries, chemical additives are used that both speed up mixing time and reduce necessary fermentation time, so that a batch of bread may be mixed, made up, risen, and baked in fewer than three hours. Dough that does not require fermentation because of chemical additives is called \\"quick bread\\" by commercial bakers. Common additives include reducing agents such as L-cysteine or sodium metabisulfite, and oxidants such as potassium bromate or ascorbic acid.[20][21] Often these chemicals are added to dough in the form of a prepackaged base, which also contains most or all of the dough's non-flour ingredients. Using such bases and sophisticated chemistry, it has been possible for commercial bakers to make imitations of artisan and sourdough breads, traditionally made by semi-skilled laborers working in smaller shops. Since 1986,[22] domestic breadmakers that automate the process of making bread have become popular in the home.","input":"When was the first loaf of bread made?"},{"output":"November 10, 1969","context":"The preschool educational television program Sesame Street was first aired on public broadcasting television stations November 10, 1969, and will reach its 47th season in 2017. The history of Sesame Street has reflected changing attitudes to developmental psychology, early childhood education and cultural diversity. Featuring Jim Henson's Muppets, animation, live shorts, humor and celebrity appearances, it was the first television program of its kind to base its content and production values on laboratory and formative research, and the first to include a curriculum \\"detailed or stated in terms of measurable outcomes\\".[1] Initial responses to the show included adulatory reviews, some controversy and high ratings. By its 40th anniversary in 2009, Sesame Street was broadcast in over 120 countries, and 20 independent international versions had been produced.[2]\\r\\nThe show was conceived in 1966 during discussions between television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and Carnegie Corporation vice president Lloyd Morrisett. Their goal was to create a children's television show that would \\"master the addictive qualities of television and do something good with them\\",[3] such as helping young children prepare for school. After two years of research, the newly formed Children's Television Workshop (CTW) received a combined grant of $8 million from the Carnegie Corporation, the Ford Foundation and the U.S. federal government to create and produce a new children's television show.\\r\\nBy the show's tenth anniversary in 1979, nine million American children under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily, and several studies showed it was having a positive educational impact. The cast and crew expanded during this time, including the hiring of women in the crew and additional minorities in the cast. In 1981, the federal government withdrew its funding, so the CTW turned to other sources, such as its magazine division, book royalties, product licensing and foreign income. During the 1980s, Sesame Street's curriculum expanded to include topics such as relationships, ethics and emotions. Many of the show's storylines were taken from the experiences of its writing staff, cast and crew, most notably the death of Will Leewho played Mr. Hooperand the marriage of Luis and Maria.\\r\\nIn recent decades, Sesame Street has faced societal and economic challenges, including changes in the viewing habits of young children, more competition from other shows, the development of cable television and a drop in ratings. After the turn of the 21st century, the show made major structural adaptations, including changing its traditional magazine format to a narrative format. Because of the popularity of the Muppet Elmo, the show incorporated a popular segment known as \\"Elmo's World\\". Sesame Street has won eight Grammys and over a hundred Emmys in its historymore than any other children's show.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week;[4] programs created for them were widely criticized for being too violent and for reflecting commercial values.[5][6] Producer Joan Ganz Cooney called children's programming a \\"wasteland\\", and she was not alone in her criticism.[7][note 1] Many children's television programs were produced by local stations, with little regard for educational goals, or cultural diversity[9][note 2] and the use of children's programming as an educational tool was \\"unproven\\" and \\"a revolutionary concept\\".[5]\\r\\nAccording to children's media experts Edward Palmer and Shalom M. Fisch, children's television programs of the 1950s and 1960s duplicated \\"prior media forms\\".[10] For example, they tended to show simple shots of a camera's-eye view of a location filled with children, or they recreated storybooks with shots of book covers and motionless illustrated pages.[note 3] The hosts of these programs were \\"insufferably condescending\\",[10] though one exception was Captain Kangaroo, created and hosted by Bob Keeshan, which author Michael Davis described as having a \\"slower pace and idealism\\" that most other children's shows lacked.[12][note 4]\\r\\nEarly childhood educational research had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned higher grades and learned more effectively. Children from low-income families had fewer resources than children from higher-income families to prepare them for school. Research had shown that children from low-income, minority backgrounds tested \\"substantially lower\\"[16] than middle-class children in school-related skills, and that they continued to have educational deficits throughout school.[17] The field of developmental psychology had grown during this period, and scientists were beginning to understand that changes in early childhood education could increase children's cognitive growth. Because of these trends in education, along with the great societal changes occurring in the United States during this era, the time was ripe for the creation of a show like Sesame Street.[18]\\r\\nSince 1962, Cooney had been producing talk shows and documentaries at educational television station WNDT, and in 1966 had won an Emmy for a documentary about poverty in America.[19] In early 1966, Cooney and her husband Tim hosted a dinner party at their apartment in New York; experimental psychologist Lloyd Morrisett, who has been called Sesame Street's \\"financial godfather\\",[20] and his wife Mary were among the guests. Cooney's boss, Lewis Freedman, whom Cooney called \\"the grandfather of Sesame Street\\",[21] also attended the party, as did their colleague Anne Bower.[22] As a vice-president at the Carnegie Corporation, Morrisett had awarded several million dollars in grants to organizations that educated poor and minority preschool children. Morrisett and the other guests felt that even with limited resources, television could be an effective way to reach millions of children.[23]\\r\\nA few days after the dinner party, Cooney, Freedman and Morrisett met at the Carnegie Corporation's offices to make plans; they wanted to harness the addictive power of television for their own purposes, but did not yet know how.[3] The following summer, despite Cooney's lack of experience in the field of education,[24] Morrisett hired her to conduct research on childhood development, education and media, and she visited experts in these fields across the United States and Canada. She researched their ideas about the viewing habits of young children and wrote a report on her findings.[25]\\r\\nCooney's study, titled \\"Television for Preschool Education\\",[17] spelled out how television could be used to help young children, especially from low-income families, prepare for school.[26][27] The focus on the new show was on children from disadvantaged backgrounds, but Cooney and the show's creators recognized that in order to achieve the kind of success they wanted, it had to be equally accessible to children of all socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds.[16] At the same time, they wanted to make the show so appealing to inner-city children that it would help them learn as much as children with more educational opportunities. This was the show's primary criterion for success.[28][29]\\r\\nCooney proposed that public television, even though it had a poor track record in attracting inner-city audiences,[30] could be used to improve the quality of children's programming. She suggested using the television medium's \\"most engaging traits\\",[31] including high production values, sophisticated writing, and quality film and animation, to reach the largest audience possible. In the words of critic Peter Hellman, \\"If [children] could recite Budweiser jingles from TV, why not give them a program that would teach the ABCs and simple number concepts?\\"[4] Cooney wanted to create a program that would spread values favoring education to nonviewersincluding their parents and older siblings, who tended to control the television set.[32] To this end, she suggested that humor directed toward adults be included,[33] which, as Lesser reported, \\"may turn out to be a pretty good system in forcing the young child to stretch to understand programs designed for older audiences\\".[34] Cooney also believed cultural references and guest appearances by celebrities would encourage parents and older siblings to watch the show together.[24]\\r\\nAs a result of Cooney's proposal, the Carnegie Corporation awarded her a $1 million grant in 1968 to establish the Children's Television Workshop (CTW)[35] to provide support to the creative staff of the new show.[36] Morrisett, who was responsible for fundraising,[37] procured additional grants from the United States federal government, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the Ford Foundation for the CTW's initial budget, which totaled $8 million;[3][38] obtaining funding from this combination of government agencies and private foundations protected the CTW from economic pressures experienced by commercial networks.[39] Sesame Street was an expensive program to produce because the creators decided they needed to compete with other programs that invested in professional, high quality production.[40]\\r\\nThe producers spent eighteen months preparing the new show, something unprecedented in children's television.[42] The show had an \\"impressive\\" budget of $28,000 per episode.[43] After being named executive director of the CTW,[44][note 5] Cooney began to assemble a team of producers:[26] Jon Stone was responsible for writing, casting, and format; David Connell took over animation and volume; and Samuel Gibbon served as the show's chief liaison between the production staff and the research team.[46] Stone, Connell, and Gibbon had worked on Captain Kangaroo together, but were not involved in children's television when Cooney recruited them.[note 6] At first, Cooney planned to divide the show's production of five episodes a week among several teams, but she was advised by CBS vice-president Mike Dann to use only one. This production team was led by Connell, who had gained experience producing many episodes in a short period of time, a process called \\"volume production\\", during his eleven years working on Captain Kangaroo.[48][49]\\r\\nThe CTW hired Harvard University professor Gerald S. Lesser to design the show's educational objectives and establish and lead a National Board of Advisers.[50] Instead of providing what Lesser called \\"window dressing\\",[51] the Board actively participated in the construction of educational goals and creative methods.[52] At the Board's direction, Lesser conducted five three-day curriculum planning seminars in Boston and New York City in summer 1968.[51][53][note 7] The purpose of the seminars was to ascertain which school-preparation skills to emphasize in the new show. The producers gathered professionals with diverse backgrounds to obtain ideas for educational content. They reported that the seminars were \\"widely successful\\",[53] and resulted in long and detailed lists of possible topics for inclusion in the Sesame Street curriculum;[53] in fact, the seminars produced more suggested educational objectives than could ever be addressed by one television series.[54]\\r\\nInstead of focusing on the social and emotional aspects of development, the producers decided to follow the suggestions of the seminar participants and emphasize cognitive skills, a decision they felt was warranted by the demands of school and the wishes of parents.[54] The objectives developed during the seminars were condensed into key categories: symbolic representation, cognitive processes, and the physical and social environment.[55][note 8] The seminars set forth the new show's policy about race and social issues[56] and provided the show's production and creative team with \\"a crash course\\" in psychology, child development, and early childhood education.[57] They also marked the beginning of Jim Henson's involvement in Sesame Street. Cooney met Henson at one of the seminars; Stone, who was familiar with Henson's work, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should \\"make do without puppets\\".[26][note 9]\\r\\nThe producers and writers decided to build the new show around a brownstone or an inner-city street, a choice Davis called \\"unprecedented\\".[59] Stone was convinced that in order for inner-city children to relate to Sesame Street, it needed to be set in a familiar place.[48] Despite its urban setting, the producers decided to avoid depicting more negativity than what was already present in the child's environment. Lesser commented, \\"[despite] all its raucousness and slapstick humor, Sesame Street became a sweet show, and its staff maintains that there is nothing wrong in that\\".[60]\\r\\nThe new show was called the \\"Preschool Educational Television Show\\" in promotional materials; the producers were unable to agree on a name they liked and waited until the last minute to make a decision. In a short, irreverent promotional film shown to public television executives, the producers parodied their \\"naming dilemma\\".[61] The producers were reportedly \\"frantic for a title\\";[59] they finally settled on the name that they least disliked:[62] Sesame Street, inspired by Ali Baba's magical phrase,[61][note 10] although there were concerns that it would be too difficult for young children to pronounce. Stone was one of the producers who disliked the name, but, he said, \\"I was outvoted, for which I'm deeply grateful\\".[64][note 11]\\r\\nThe responsibility of casting for Sesame Street fell to Jon Stone, who set out to form a cast where white actors were in the minority.[48] He did not begin auditions until spring 1969, several weeks before five test shows were due to be produced. He filmed the auditions, and Palmer took them into the field to test children's reactions. The actors who received the \\"most enthusiastic thumbs up\\" were cast.[59] For example, Loretta Long was chosen to play Susan when the children who saw her audition stood up and sang along with her rendition of \\"I'm a Little Teapot\\".[65] Stone reported that casting was the only aspect that was \\"just completely haphazard\\".[66] Most of the cast and crew found jobs on Sesame Street through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers.[66] Stone hired Bob McGrath (an actor and singer best known at the time for his appearances on Mitch Miller's sing-along show on NBC) to play Bob, Will Lee to play Mr. Hooper, and Garrett Saunders to play Gordon.[67][note 12]\\r\\nSesame Street was the first children's television program that used a curriculum with clear and measurable outcomes,[1] and was the first to use research in the creation of the show's design and content.[68] Research in Sesame Street had three functions: to test if the show was appealing to children, to discover what could be done to make the show more appealing, and to report to the public and the investors what impact the show had on its young viewers. Ten to fifteen percent of the show's initial budget of $8 million was devoted to research,[69] and researchers were always present in the studio during the show's filming.[16] A \\"Writer's Notebook\\" was developed to assist writers and producers in translating the research and production goals into televised material;[68] this connected the show's curriculum goals and its script development.[70] The Muppet characters were created to fill specific curriculum needs: Oscar the Grouch, for example, was designed to teach children about their positive and negative emotions.[71] Lesser called the collaboration between researchers and producers, as well as the idea of using television as an educational tool, the \\"CTW model\\".[72] Cooney agreed, commenting, \\"From the beginning, wethe planners of the projectdesigned the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners\\".[5]\\r\\nThe producers of Sesame Street believed education through television was possible if they captured and sustained children's attention;[73][74] this meant the show needed a strong appeal.[75] Edward Palmer, the CTW's first Director of Research[76] and the man Cooney credited with building the CTW's foundation of research,[38] was one of the few academics in the late 1960s researching children's television.[77] He was recruited by the CTW to test if the curricula developed in the Boston seminars were reaching their audience effectively.[77] Palmer was also tasked with designing and executing the CTW's in-house research and with working with the Educational Testing Service (ETS).[76] His research was so crucial to Sesame Street that Gladwell asserted, \\"...?without Ed Palmer, the show would have never lasted through the first season\\".[77][note 13]\\r\\nPalmer and his team's approach to researching the show's effectiveness was innovative; it was the first time formative research was conducted in this way.[78] For example, Palmer developed \\"the distractor\\",[77] which he used to test if the material shown on Sesame Street captured young viewers' attention. Two children at a time were brought into the laboratory; they were shown an episode on a television monitor and a slide show next to it. The slides would change every seven seconds, and researchers recorded when the children's attention was diverted away from the episode.[79][80] They were able to record almost every second of Sesame Street this way; if the episode captured the children's interest 80√ø90% of the time, the producers would air it, but if it only tested 50%, they would reshoot. By the fourth season of the show, the episodes rarely tested below 85%.[81]\\r\\nDuring the production of Sesame Street's first season, producers created five one-hour episodes to test the show's appeal to children and examine their comprehension of the material. Not intended for broadcast, they were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in day care centers in New York City in July 1969.[82] The results were \\"generally very positive\\";[83] children learned from the shows, their appeal was high, and their attention was sustained over the full hour.[82] However, the researchers found that although children's attention was high during the Muppet segments, their interest wavered during the \\"Street\\" segments, when no Muppets were on screen. This was because the producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused if human actors and Muppets were shown together. As a result of this decision, the appeal of the test episodes was lower than the target.[83][84]\\r\\nThe Street scenes, as Palmer described them, were \\"the glue\\" that \\"pulled the show together\\",[85] so producers knew they needed to make significant changes. On the basis of their experience on Captain Kangaroo, Cannell, Stone, and Gibbon thought the experts' opinions were \\"nonsense\\";[86] Cooney agreed.[71] Lesser called their decision to defy the recommendations of their advisers \\"a turning point in the history of Sesame Street\\".[85] The producers reshot the Street segments; Henson and his coworkers created Muppets that could interact with the human actors,[85][87] specifically Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird, who became two of the show's most enduring characters.[78] In addition, the producers found Saunders' role as Gordon not to be as likable by children watching the show, resulting in the character being recast by Matt Robinson,[67] who was initially the show's filmed segments producer. These test episodes were directly responsible for what Gladwell called \\"the essence of Sesame Streetthe artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults\\".[85][note 14]\\r\\nTwo days before the show's premiere, a thirty-minute preview entitled This Way to Sesame Street aired on NBC. The show was financed by a $50,000 grant from Xerox. Written by Stone and produced by CTW publicist Bob Hatch, it was taped the day before it aired.[89] Newsday called the preview \\"a unique display of cooperation between commercial and noncommercial broadcasters\\".[89]\\r\\nSesame Street premiered November 10, 1969.[note 15] It was widely praised for its originality, and was well received by parents as well as children.[62][90] The show reached only 67.6% of the nation, but earned a 3.3 Nielsen rating, meaning 1.9 million households and 7 million children watched it each day. In Sesame Street's first season, the ETS reported that children who watched the show scored higher in tests than less-frequent viewers.[91]\\r\\nIn November 1970, the cover of Time magazine featured Big Bird, who had received more fan mail than any of the show's human hosts. The magazine declared, \\"...?It is not only the best children's show in TV history, it is one of the best parents' shows as well\\".[43] David Frost, speaking about the versions of Sesame Street that were being produced in other countries, declared it was \\"a hit everywhere it goes\\".[43] An executive at ABC, while recognizing that Sesame Street was not perfect, said the show \\"opened children's TV to taste and wit and substance\\" and \\"made the climate right for improvement\\".[43] Other reviewers predicted commercial television would be forced to improve its children's programming, something that did not substantially occur until the 1990s.[92][93] Sesame Street won a Peabody Award, three Emmys, and the Prix Jeunesse award in 1970. President Richard Nixon sent Cooney a congratulatory letter,[43] and Dr. Benjamin Spock predicted the program would result in \\"better-trained citizens, fewer unemployables in the next generation, fewer people on welfare, and smaller jail populations\\".[94]\\r\\nSesame Street was not without its detractors; there was little criticism of the show in the months following its premiere, but it increased at the end of its first season and beginning of the second season.[96][note 16] In May 1970, a state commission in Mississippi voted to not air the show on the state's newly launched public television network. A member of the commission leaked the vote to The New York Times, stating that \\"Mississippi was not yet ready\\" for the show's integrated cast.[97] Cooney called the ban \\"a tragedy for both the white and black children of Mississippi\\".[6] The state commission reversed its decision after the vote made national news.\\r\\nThe producers of Sesame Street made a few changes in its second season. Segments that featured children became more spontaneous and allowed more impromptu dialogue, even when it meant cutting other segments.[43] Since federal funds had been used to produce the show, more segments of the population insisted upon being represented on Sesame Street; for example, the show was criticized by Hispanic groups for the lack of Latino characters in the early years of production.[6] A committee of Hispanic activists, commissioned by the CTW in 1970, called Sesame Street \\"racist\\" and said the show's bilingual aspects were of \\"poor quality and patronizing\\".[98] The CTW responded to these critics by hiring Hispanic actors, production staff, and researchers. By the mid-70s, Morrow reported that \\"the show included Chicano and Puerto Rican cast members, films about Mexican holidays and foods, and cartoons that taught Spanish words\\".[99]\\r\\nWhile New York Magazine reported criticism of the presence of strong single women in the show, organizations like the National Organization for Women (NOW) expressed concerns that the show needed to be \\"less male-oriented\\".[43][48] For example, members of NOW took exception to the character Susan, who was originally a housewife.[100] They complained about the lack of, as Morrow put it, \\"credible female Muppets\\" on the show; Morrow reported that Henson's response was that \\"women might not be strong enough to hold the puppets over the long hours of taping\\".[101] The show's producers responded by making Susan a nurse and by hiring a female writer.[43]\\r\\nBy the mid-1970s, Sesame Street, according to Davis, had become \\"an American institution\\".[102] ETS conducted two \\"landmark\\"[103] studies of the show in 1970 and 1971 which demonstrated Sesame Street had a positive educational impact on its viewers.[103] The results of these studies led to the producers securing funding for the show over the next several years,[102] and provided the CTW with additional ways to promote it. By the second season, Sesame Street had become so popular that the design of ETS' experiments to track the show's educational outcomes had to be changed:[104] instead of comparing viewers with a control group of non-viewers, the researchers studied the differences among levels of viewing. They found that children who watched Sesame Street more frequently had a higher comprehension of the material presented.[105]\\r\\nProducer Jon Stone was instrumental in guiding the show during these years. According to Davis, Stone \\"gave Sesame Street its soul\\";[102] without him \\"there would not have been Sesame Street as we know it\\".[106] Frank Oz regarded Stone as \\"the father of Sesame Street\\",[107] and Cooney considered Stone \\"the key creative talent on Sesame Street[107] and \\"probably the most brilliant writer of children's material in America\\".[107] Stone was able to recognize and mentor talented people for his crew. He actively hired and promoted women during a time when few women earned top production jobs in television. His policies provided the show with a succession of female producers and writers, many of whom went on to lead the boom in children's programming at Nickelodeon, the Disney Channel, and PBS in the 1990s and 2000s. One of these women was Dulcy Singer, who later became the first female executive producer of Sesame Street.[108]\\r\\nAfter the show's initial success, its producers began to think about its survival beyond its development and first season and decided to explore other funding sources.[109] The CTW decided to depend upon government agencies and private foundations to develop the show. This would protect it from the financial pressures experienced by commercial networks, but created problems in finding continued support.[39] This era in the show's history was marked by conflicts between the CTW and the federal government; in 1978, the US Department of Education refused to deliver a $2 million check until the last day of the CTW's fiscal year. As a result, the CTW decided to depend upon licensing arrangements, publishing, and international sales for its funding.[110] Henson owned the trademarks to the Muppet characters: he was reluctant to market them at first, but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW. The producers demanded complete control over all products and product decisions; any product line associated with the show had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during its airings.[111] The CTW approached Random House to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division. Random House and the CTW named Christopher Cerf to assist the CTW in publishing books and other materials that emphasized the curriculum.[112] In 1980, the CTW began to produce a touring stage production based upon the show, written by Connell and performed by the Ice Follies.[113]\\r\\nShortly after the premiere of Sesame Street, the CTW was approached by producers, educators, and officials in other nations, requesting that a version of the show be aired in their countries. Former CBS executive Mike Dann left commercial television to become vice-president of the CTW and Cooney's assistant;[note 17] Dann began what Charlotte Cole, vice president for the CTW's International Research department, called the \\"globalization\\" of Sesame Street.[115] A flexible model was developed, based upon the experiences of the creators and producers of the original show. The shows came to be called \\"co-productions\\", and they contained original sets, characters, and curriculum goals. Depending upon each country's needs and resources, different versions were produced, including dubbed versions of the original show and independent programs. By 2009, Sesame Street had expanded into 140 countries;[116] The New York Times reported in 2005 that income from the CTW's international co-productions of the show was $96 million.[117]\\r\\nSesame Street's cast expanded in the 1970s, better fulfilling the show's original goal of greater diversity in both human and Muppet characters. The cast members who joined the show were Sonia Manzano (Maria), who also wrote for the show,[118] Northern Calloway (David), Alaina Reed (Olivia), Emilio Delgado (Luis), Linda Bove (Linda), and Buffy Sainte-Marie (Buffy).[119] In 1975, Roscoe Orman became the third actor to play Gordon, succeeding Hal Miller, who had briefly replaced Matt Robinson.[120]\\r\\nNew Muppet characters were introduced during the 1970s. Count von Count was created and performed by Jerry Nelson, who also voiced Mr. Snuffleupagus, a large Muppet that required two puppeteers to operate. Richard Hunt, who, in Jon Stone's words, joined the Muppets as a \\"wild-eyed 18-year-old and grew into a master puppeteer and inspired teacher\\", created Gladys the Cow, Forgetful Jones, Don Music, and the construction worker Sully.[121] Telly Monster was performed by Brian Muehl; Marty Robinson took over the role in 1984.[122] Frank Oz created Cookie Monster. Matt Robinson created the \\"controversial\\" (as Davis called him) character Roosevelt Franklin.[note 18] Fran Brill, the first female puppeteer for the Muppets, joined the Henson organization in 1970,[123] and originated the character Prairie Dawn. In 1975, Henson created The Muppet Show, which was filmed and produced in London; Henson brought many of the Muppet performers with him, so opportunities opened up for new performers and puppets to appear on Sesame Street.[124]\\r\\nThe CTW wanted to attract the best composers and lyricists for Sesame Street, so songwriters like Joe Raposo, the show's music director, and writer Jeff Moss were allowed to retain the rights to the songs they wrote. The writers earned lucrative profits, and the show was able to sustain public interest.[125] Raposo's \\"I Love Trash\\", written for Oscar the Grouch, was included on the first album of Sesame Street songs, The Sesame Street Book & Record, recorded in 1970.[126][127] Moss' \\"Rubber Duckie\\", sung by Henson for Ernie, remained on the Top-40 Billboard charts for seven weeks that same year.[128] Another Henson song, written by Raposo for Kermit the Frog in 1970, \\"Bein' Green\\", which Davis called \\"Raposo's best-regarded song for Sesame Street\\",[125] was later recorded by Frank Sinatra and Ray Charles. \\"Sing\\", which became a hit for The Carpenters in 1973, and \\"Somebody Come and Play\\", were also written by Raposo for Sesame Street.[129][130]\\r\\nIn 1978, Stone and Singer produced and wrote the show's first special, the \\"triumphant\\" Christmas Eve on Sesame Street,[131] which included an O Henry-inspired storyline in which Bert and Ernie gave up their prized possessionsErnie his rubber ducky and Bert his paper clip collectionto purchase each other Christmas gifts. Bert and Ernie were played by Frank Oz and Jim Henson, who in real life were, like the puppets they played, colleagues and friends. To Davis, this demonstrated the puppeteers' remarkable ability to play \\"puppetry's Odd Couple\\".[132] In Singer's opinion, the specialwhich Stone also wrote and directeddemonstrated Stone's \\"soul\\", and Sonia Manzano called it a good example of what Sesame Street was all about.[133] The special won Emmys for Stone and Singer in 1979, beating, among others, an independently-produced Sesame Street special for CBS.[133][134]\\r\\nBy the show's tenth anniversary in 1979, nine million American children under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily. Four out of five children had watched it over a six-week period, and 90% of children from low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show.[135]\\r\\nIn 1984, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) deregulated commercial restrictions on children's television. Advertising during network children's programs almost doubled, and deregulation resulted in an increase in commercially oriented programming. Sesame Street was successful during this era of deregulation despite the fact that the United States government terminated all federal funding of the CTW in 1981.[110] By 1987, the show was earning $42 million per year from its magazine division, book royalties, product licensing, and foreign incomeenough to cover two-thirds of its expenses. Its remaining budget, plus a $6 million surplus, was covered by revenue from its PBS broadcasts.[4]\\r\\nAccording to Davis, Sesame Street's second decade was spent \\"turning inward, expanding its young viewers' world\\".[135] The show's curriculum grew to include more \\"affective\\" teachingrelationships, ethics, and positive and negative emotions.[48] Many of the show's storylines were taken from the experiences of its writing staff, cast, and crew. In 1982, Will Lee, who had played Mr. Hooper since the show's premiere, died. For the 1983 season, the show's producers and research staff decided they would explain Mr. Hooper's death to their preschool audience, instead of recasting the role: the writer of that episode, Norman Stiles, said, \\"We felt we owed something to a man we respected and loved\\".[48] They convened a group of psychologists, religious leaders, and other experts in the field of grief, loss, and separation. The research team conducted a series of studies before the episode to ascertain if children were able to understand the messages they wanted to convey about Mr. Hooper's death; the research showed most children did understand. Parents' reactions to the episode were, according to the CTW's own reports, \\"overwhelmingly positive\\".[136] The episode, which won an Emmy,[137] aired on Thanksgiving Day in 1983 so parents could be home to discuss it with their children. Author David Borgenicht called the episode \\"poignant\\";[138] Davis called it \\"a landmark broadcast\\"[139] and \\"a truly memorable episode, one of the show's best\\".[140] Caroll Spinney, who played Big Bird and who drew the caricatures prominently used in the episode, reported the cast and crew were moved to tears during filming.[note 19]\\r\\nIn the mid-1980s, Americans were becoming more aware of the prevalence of child abuse, so Sesame Street's researchers and producers decided to \\"reveal\\" Mr. Snuffleupagus in 1985. \\"Snuffy\\" had never been seen by any of the adults on the show and was considered Big Bird's \\"imaginary friend\\".[141] The show's producers were concerned about the message being sent to children; \\"If children saw that the adults didn't believe what Big Bird said (even though it was true), they would be afraid to talk to adults about dramatic or disturbing things that happened to them\\".[142]\\r\\nFor the 1988 and 1989 seasons, the topics of love, marriage, and childbirth were addressed when the show presented a storyline in which the characters Luis and Maria fall in love, marry, and have a child named Gabi. Sonia Manzano, the actress who played Maria, had married and become pregnant; according to the book Sesame Street Unpaved, published after the show's thirtieth anniversary in 1999, Manzano's real-life experiences gave the show's writers and producers the idea.[143] Before writing began, research was done to gain an understanding of what previous studies had revealed about preschoolers' understanding of love, marriage, and family. The show's staff found that at the time that there was very little relevant research done about children's understanding of these topics, and no books for children had been written about them.[136] Studies done after the episodes about Maria's pregnancy aired showed that as a result of watching these episodes, children's understanding of pregnancy increased.[144][note 20]\\r\\nDavis called the 1990s a \\"time of transition on Sesame Street\\".[145] Several people involved in the show from its beginnings died during this period: Jim Henson in 1990 at the age of 53 \\"from a runaway strep infection gone stubbornly, foolishly untreated\\";[146][note 21] songwriter Joe Raposo from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma fifteen months earlier;[147] long-time cast member Northern Calloway of cardiac arrest in January 1990;[145][note 22] puppeteer Richard Hunt of AIDS in early 1992;[121] CTW founder and producer David Connell of bladder cancer in 1995;[149] director Jon Stone of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 1997;[150] and writer Jeff Moss of colon cancer in 1998.[151]\\r\\nBy the early 1990s, Sesame Street was, as Davis put it, \\"the undisputed heavyweight champion of preschool television\\".[21] Entertainment Weekly reported in 1991 that the show's music had been honored with eight Grammys.[152] The show's dominance, however, was soon challenged by another PBS television show for preschoolers, Barney & Friends, and Sesame Street's ratings declined. The producers of Sesame Street responded, at the show's twenty-fifth anniversary in 1993, by expanding and redesigning the show's set, calling it \\"Around the Corner\\".[153] New human and Muppet characters were introduced, including Zoe (performed by Fran Brill), baby Natasha and her parents Ingrid and Humphrey, and Ruthie (played by comedian Ruth Buzzi).[154] The \\"Around the Corner\\" set was dismantled in 1997.[155] Zoe, one of the few characters that survived, was created to include another female Muppet on the show: her spunky and fearless personality was intended to break female stereotypes.[156] According to Davis, she was the first character developed on the show by marketing and product development specialists, who worked with the researchers at the CTW.[157] (The quest for a \\"break-out\\" female Muppet character continued into 2006 with the creation of Abby Cadabby, who was created after nine months of research.)[158] In 1998, for the first time in the show's history, Sesame Street pursued funding by accepting corporate sponsorship. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who had been a guest on the show, urged parents to protest the move by boycotting the show.[159]\\r\\nFor Sesame Street's 30th anniversary in 1999, its producers researched the reasons for the show's lower ratings. For the first time since the show debuted, the producers and a team of researchers analyzed Sesame Street's content and structure during a series of two-week-long workshops. They also studied how children's viewing habits had changed in the past thirty years. They found that although the show was produced for those between the ages of three and five, children began watching it at a younger age. Preschool television had become more competitive, and the CTW's research showed the traditional magazine format was not the best way to attract young children's attention. The growth of home videos during the '80s and the increase of thirty-minute children's shows on cable had demonstrated that children's attention could be sustained for longer periods of time, but the CTW's researchers found that their viewers, especially the younger ones, lost attention in Sesame Street after 40 to 45 minutes.[160][161]\\r\\nBeginning in 1998, a new 15-minute segment shown at the end of each episode, \\"Elmo's World\\", used traditional elements (animation, Muppets, music, and live-action film), but had a more sustained narrative.[162] \\"Elmo's World\\" followed the same structure each episode, and depended heavily on repetition.[163][note 23] Unlike the realism of the rest of the show, the segment took place in a stylized crayon-drawing universe as conceived by its host.[164] Elmo, who represented the three- to four-year-old child, was chosen as host of the closing segment because he had always tested well with this segment of their audience.[163] He was created in 1980 and originally performed by Brian Muehl, and later Richard Hunt, but did not become what his eventual portrayer, Kevin Clash, called a \\"phenomenon\\"[5] until Clash took over the role in 1985.[165] Eventually, Elmo became, as Davis reported, \\"the embodiment\\" of Sesame Street, and \\"the marketing wonder of our age\\"[166] when five million \\"Tickle Me Elmo\\" dolls were sold in 1996. Clash believed the \\"Tickle Me Elmo\\" phenomenon made Elmo a household name and led to the \\"Elmo's World\\" segment.[167] Michael Jeter was a favorite with younger audiences in his role as Mr. Noodle's brother, Mister Noodle on Sesame Street from 1999 to 2003.\\r\\nIn 2002, Sesame Street's producers went further in changing the show to reflect its younger demographic, fundamentally changing the show's structure, which had relied on \\"Street scenes\\" interrupted by live-action videos and animation. The target age for Sesame Street shifted downward, from four years to three years, after the show's 33rd season. As co-executive producer Arlene Sherman stated, \\"We basically deconstructed the show\\".[168] The producers expanded upon the \\"Elmo's World\\" by changing from a magazine format to a narrative format, which made the show easier for young children to navigate. Sherman called the show's new look \\"startlingly different\\".[168] Following its tradition of addressing emotionally difficult topics, Sesame Street's producers chose to address the attacks of 9/11 during this season on its premiere episode, which aired February 4, 2002.[6] This episode, as well as a series of four episodes that aired after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, were used in Sesame Workshop's Community Outreach program.[169]\\r\\nIn 2006, the United States Department of State called Sesame Street \\"the most widely viewed children's television show in the world\\".[2] Over half of the show's international co-productions were made after 2001; according to the 2006 documentary The World According to Sesame Street, the events of 9/11 inspired the producers of these co-productions. In 2003, Takalani Sesame, a South African co-production, elicited criticism in the United States when its producers created Kami, the first HIV-positive Muppet, whose purpose was educating children in South Africa about the epidemic of AIDS. The controversy, which surprised the Sesame Workshop, was short-lived and died down after Kofi Annan and Jerry Falwell praised the Workshop's efforts.[114] By 2006, Sesame Street had won more Emmy Awards than any other children's show, including winning the outstanding children's series award for twelve consecutive yearsevery year the Emmys included the category.[170] By 2009, the show had won 118 Emmys throughout its history, and was awarded the Outstanding Achievement Emmy for its 40 years on the air.[171][note 24]\\r\\nBy Sesame Street's 40th anniversary, it was ranked the fifteenth most popular children's show on television. When the show premiered in 1969, 130 episodes a year were produced; in 2009, because of rising costs, twenty-six episodes were made.[6] In 2000, the Children's Television Workshop, which had changed its name to the Sesame Workshop (SW) in June 2000 to better reflect its entry into non-television and interactive media,[173] launched a website with a library of free video clips and free podcasts from throughout the show's history. The 2008√ø2009 recession, which led to budget cuts for many nonprofit arts organizations, severely affected Sesame Street; in spring 2009, the SW had to lay off 20% of its staff.[6]\\r\\nSesame Street's 40th anniversary was commemorated by the 2008 publication of Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street, by Michael Davis, which has been called \\"the definitive statement\\" about the history of the show.[174]\\r\\nStarting in 2009, the producers of Sesame Street took steps to bring back older viewers; it was also successful in increasing its audience viewership among 3-to-5 year-olds by the end of the 40th season. In 2012, the show's 43rd season, Elmo's World was replaced with Elmo the Musical, which was targeted at the program's older viewers.[175] Subsequently in September 2014, starting with the show's 45th season, Sesame Workshop began distributing a half-hour version of the program to PBS member stations. The new version, which complemented the existing hour-long broadcast and focuses more on interstitial segments (although certain segments such as Elmo the Musical or Abby's Flying Fairy School are omitted from that version), was added because of increasing mobile and online viewing among children as well as growing competition for preschoolers on linear and online television, an increase in use of PBS Kids' mobile video app during 2013 and decreasing broadcast viewership; the half-hour version airs weekday afternoons on PBS member television stations (with the hour-long version continuing to air in the morning) and was made available for streaming online and on mobile devices through PBS' website, mobile app and Roku channel.[176][177]\\r\\nOn August 13, 2015, as part of a five-year programming and development deal, Sesame Workshop announced that first-run episodes of Sesame Street would move to premium television service HBO (which had not aired any original children's programming since 2005) in late 2015. Sesame Workshop sought the deal because of declining revenue from viewer donations, and decreases in distribution fees paid by PBS member stations and licensing for merchandise sales (particularly through Sesame Workshop's dependence upon revenue from DVD sales), with the intent to having the show remain on PBS in some fashion (HBO already had involvement in public television at the time of the deal, providing funding for the talk show Charlie Rose); the deal also came in the wake of changing viewer habits of American children over the previous ten years. HBO will hold first-run rights to all newer episodes of the series starting with season 46, after which they will air on PBS member stations following a nine-month exclusivity window, with no charge to the stations for airing the content; however, HBO has not announced whether first-run episodes will air on the pay service's main channel or its multiplex channel HBO Family.[178] The agreement also gives HBO exclusive rights to stream past and future Sesame Street episodes on HBO Go and HBO Now √ø assuming those rights from Amazon Video and Netflix. On August 14, Sesame Workshop announced that it would phase out its in-house subscription streaming service, Sesame Go, as a standalone service; instead of shutting it down entirely, it intends to scale back its offerings to either provide access to a reduced slate of free content or act as a portal for Sesame Street's website.[179][180][181]\\r\\nIn April 2017, Sesame Street introduced a new Muppet called Julia with Autism to the show.[182]","input":"When did the first episode of sesame street air?"},{"output":"Germania","context":"","input":"What was germany before it was called germany?"},{"output":"coastal saline or brackish water","context":"A mangrove is a shrub or small tree that grows in coastal saline or brackish water. The term is also used for tropical coastal vegetation consisting of such species. Mangroves occur worldwide in the tropics and subtropics, mainly between latitudes 25?N and 25?S. The total mangrove forest area of the world in 2000 was 137,800 square kilometres (53,200?sq?mi), spanning 118 countries and territories.[1]\\r\\nMangroves are salt tolerant trees, also called halophytes, and are adapted to life in harsh coastal conditions. They contain a complex salt filtration system and complex root system to cope with salt water immersion and wave action. They are adapted to the low oxygen (anoxic) conditions of waterlogged mud.\\r\\nThe word is used in at least three senses: (1) most broadly to refer to the habitat and entire plant assemblage or mangal,[2][page?needed] for which the terms mangrove forest biome, and mangrove swamp are also used, (2) to refer to all trees and large shrubs in the mangrove swamp, and (3) narrowly to refer to the mangrove family of plants, the Rhizophoraceae, or even more specifically just to mangrove trees of the genus Rhizophora.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe mangrove biome, or mangal, is a distinct saline woodland or shrubland habitat characterized by depositional coastal environments, where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high-energy wave action. The saline conditions tolerated by various mangrove species range from brackish water, through pure seawater (3 to 4%), to water concentrated by evaporation to over twice the salinity of ocean seawater (up to 9%).[3][4]\\r\\nThe term \\"mangrove\\" comes to English from Spanish (perhaps by way of Portuguese), and is likely to originate from Guarani. It was earlier \\"mangrow\\" (from Portuguese mangue or Spanish mangle), but this word was corrupted via folk etymology influence of the word \\"grove\\".\\r\\nMangrove swamps are found in tropical and subtropical tidal areas. Areas where mangal occurs include estuaries and marine shorelines.[4]\\r\\nThe intertidal existence to which these trees are adapted represents the major limitation to the number of species able to thrive in their habitat. High tide brings in salt water, and when the tide recedes, solar evaporation of the seawater in the soil leads to further increases in salinity. The return of tide can flush out these soils, bringing them back to salinity levels comparable to that of seawater.\\r\\nAt low tide, organisms are also exposed to increases in temperature and desiccation, and are then cooled and flooded by the tide. Thus, for a plant to survive in this environment, it must tolerate broad ranges of salinity, temperature, and moisture, as well as a number of other key environmental factorsthus only a select few species make up the mangrove tree community.\\r\\nAbout 110 species are considered \\"mangroves\\", in the sense of being a tree that grows in such a saline swamp,[4] though only a few are from the mangrove plant genus, Rhizophora. However, a given mangrove swamp typically features only a small number of tree species. It is not uncommon for a mangrove forest in the Caribbean to feature only three or four tree species. For comparison, the tropical rainforest biome contains thousands of tree species, but this is not to say mangrove forests lack diversity. Though the trees themselves are few in species, the ecosystem that these trees create provides a home (habitat) for a great variety of other species.\\r\\nMangrove plants require a number of physiological adaptations to overcome the problems of anoxia, high salinity and frequent tidal inundation. Each species has its own solutions to these problems; this may be the primary reason why, on some shorelines, mangrove tree species show distinct zonation. Small environmental variations within a mangal may lead to greatly differing methods for coping with the environment. Therefore, the mix of species is partly determined by the tolerances of individual species to physical conditions, such as tidal inundation and salinity, but may also be influenced by other factors, such as predation of plant seedlings by crabs.\\r\\nOnce established, mangrove roots provide an oyster habitat and slow water flow, thereby enhancing sediment deposition in areas where it is already occurring. The fine, anoxic sediments under mangroves act as sinks for a variety of heavy (trace) metals which colloidal particles in the sediments have scavenged from the water. Mangrove removal disturbs these underlying sediments, often creating problems of trace metal contamination of seawater and biota.\\r\\nMangrove swamps protect coastal areas from erosion, storm surge (especially during hurricanes), and tsunamis.[5][6][7] The mangroves' massive root systems are efficient at dissipating wave energy.[8] Likewise, they slow down tidal water enough so its sediment is deposited as the tide comes in, leaving all except fine particles when the tide ebbs.[9] In this way, mangroves build their own environments.[5] Because of the uniqueness of mangrove ecosystems and the protection against erosion they provide, they are often the object of conservation programs, including national biodiversity action plans.[6]\\r\\nHowever, mangrove swamps' protective value is sometimes overstated. Wave energy is typically low in areas where mangroves grow,[10] so their effect on erosion can only be measured over long periods.[8] Their capacity to limit high-energy wave erosion is limited to events such as storm surges and tsunamis.[11] Erosion often occurs on the outer sides of bends in river channels that wind through mangroves, while new stands of mangroves are appearing on the inner sides where sediment is accruing.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe unique ecosystem found in the intricate mesh of mangrove roots offers a quiet marine region for young organisms.[12] In areas where roots are permanently submerged, the organisms they host include algae, barnacles, oysters, sponges, and bryozoans, which all require a hard surface for anchoring while they filter feed. Shrimps and mud lobsters use the muddy bottoms as their home.[13] Mangrove crabs munch on the mangrove leaves, adding nutrients to the mangal muds for other bottom feeders.[14] In at least some cases, export of carbon fixed in mangroves is important in coastal food webs.\\r\\nMangrove plantations in Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines and India host several commercially important species of fishes and crustaceans. Despite restoration efforts, developers and others have removed over half of the world's mangroves in recent times.\\r\\nMangrove forests can decay into peat deposits because of fungal and bacterial processes as well as by the action of termites. It becomes peat in good geochemical, sedimentary and tectonic conditions.[15] The nature of these deposits depends on the environment and the types of mangrove involved. In Puerto Rico the red (Rhizophora mangle), white (Laguncularia racemosa) and black (Avicennia germinans) mangroves occupy different ecological niches and have slightly different chemical compositions so the carbon content varies between the species as well between the different tissues of the plant e.g. leaf matter vs roots.[15]\\r\\nIn Puerto Rico there is a clear succession of these three trees from the lower elevations which are dominated by red mangroves to farther inland with a higher concentration of white mangroves.[15] Mangrove forests are an important part of the cycling and storage of carbon in tropical coastal ecosystems.[15] Using this it is possible to attempt to reconstruct the environment and investigate changes to the coastal ecosystem for thousands of years by using sediment cores.[16] However, an additional complication is the imported marine organic matter that also gets deposited in the sediment due to tidal flushing of mangrove forests.[15]\\r\\nIn order to understand peat formation by mangroves, it is important to understand the conditions they grew in, and how they decayed. Termites are an important part of this decay, and so an understanding of their action on the organic matter is crucial to the chemical stabilization of mangrove peats.[15]\\r\\nOf the recognized 110 mangrove species, only about 54 species in 20 genera from 16 families constitute the \\"true mangroves\\", species that occur almost exclusively in mangrove habitats.[2] Demonstrating convergent evolution, many of these species found similar solutions to the tropical conditions of variable salinity, tidal range (inundation), anaerobic soils and intense sunlight. Plant biodiversity is generally low in a given mangal.[4] The greatest biodiversity occurs in the mangal of New Guinea, Indonesia and Malaysia.[17]\\r\\nRed mangroves, which can survive in the most inundated areas, prop themselves above the water level with stilt roots and can then absorb air through pores in their bark (lenticels). Black mangroves live on higher ground and make many pneumatophores (specialised root-like structures which stick up out of the soil like straws for breathing) which are also covered in lenticels.\\r\\nThese \\"breathing tubes\\" typically reach heights of up to 30?cm, and in some species, over 3 m. The four types of pneumatophores are stilt or prop type, snorkel or peg type, knee type, and ribbon or plank type. Knee and ribbon types may be combined with buttress roots at the base of the tree. The roots also contain wide aerenchyma to facilitate transport within the plants.\\r\\nRed mangroves exclude salt by having significantly impermeable roots which are highly suberised (impregnated with suberin), acting as an ultra-filtration mechanism to exclude sodium salts from the rest of the plant. Analysis of water inside mangroves has shown 90% to 97% of salt has been excluded at the roots. In a frequently cited concept that has become known as the \\"sacrificial leaf\\", salt which does accumulate in the shoot (sprout) then concentrates in old leaves, which the plant then sheds. However, recent research suggests the older, yellowing leaves have no more measurable salt content than the other, greener leaves.[18] Red mangroves can also store salt in cell vacuoles. As seen in the photograph on the right, white or grey mangroves can secrete salts directly; they have two salt glands at each leaf base (correlating with their namethey are covered in white salt crystals).\\r\\nBecause of the limited fresh water available in salty intertidal soils, mangroves limit the amount of water they lose through their leaves. They can restrict the opening of their stomata (pores on the leaf surfaces, which exchange carbon dioxide gas and water vapour during photosynthesis). They also vary the orientation of their leaves to avoid the harsh midday sun and so reduce evaporation from the leaves. Anthony Calfo, a noted aquarium author, observed anecdotally a red mangrove in captivity only grows if its leaves are misted with fresh water several times a week, simulating frequent tropical rainstorms.[19]\\r\\nBecause the soil is perpetually waterlogged, little free oxygen is available. Anaerobic bacteria liberate nitrogen gas, soluble ferrum (iron), inorganic phosphates, sulfides and methane, which make the soil much less nutritious.[citation needed] Pneumatophores (aerial roots) allow mangroves to absorb gases directly from the atmosphere, and other nutrients such as iron, from the inhospitable soil. Mangroves store gases directly inside the roots, processing them even when the roots are submerged during high tide.\\r\\nIn this harsh environment, mangroves have evolved a special mechanism to help their offspring survive. Mangrove seeds are buoyant and are therefore suited to water dispersal. Unlike most plants, whose seeds germinate in soil, many mangroves (e.g. red mangrove) are viviparous, whose seeds germinate while still attached to the parent tree. Once germinated, the seedling grows either within the fruit (e.g. Aegialitis, Avicennia and Aegiceras), or out through the fruit (e.g. Rhizophora, Ceriops, Bruguiera and Nypa) to form a propagule (a ready-to-go seedling) which can produce its own food via photosynthesis.\\r\\nThe mature propagule then drops into the water, which can transport it great distances. Propagules can survive desiccation and remain dormant for over a year before arriving in a suitable environment. Once a propagule is ready to root, its density changes so the elongated shape now floats vertically rather than horizontally. In this position, it is more likely to lodge in the mud and root. If it does not root, it can alter its density and drift again in search of more favorable conditions.\\r\\nThe following listing (modified from Tomlinson, 1986) gives the number of species of mangroves in each listed plant genus and family. Mangrove environments in the Eastern Hemisphere harbor six times as many species of trees and shrubs as do mangroves in the New World. Genetic divergence of mangrove lineages from terrestrial relatives, in combination with fossil evidence, suggests mangrove diversity is limited by evolutionary transition into the stressful marine environment, and the number of mangrove lineages has increased steadily over the Tertiary with little global extinction.[20]\\r\\nMangroves can be found in over 118 countries and territories in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The largest percentage of mangroves is found between the 5 N and 5 S latitudes. Approximately 75% of worlds mangroves are found in just 15 countries. Asia has the largest amount (42%) of the worlds mangroves, followed by Africa (21%), North/Central America (15%), Oceania (12%) and South America (11%).[1]\\r\\nThere are important mangrove swamps in Kenya, Tanzania, Rpublique Dmocratique du Congo (RDC) and Madagascar, with the latter even admixing at the coastal verge with dry deciduous forests.\\r\\nNigeria has Africa's largest mangrove concentration, spanning 36,000?km2. Oil spills and leaks have destroyed many in the last 50 years, damaging the local fishing economy and water quality.[23]\\r\\nAlong the coast of the Red Sea, both on the Egyptian side and in the Gulf of Aqaba, mangroves composed primarily of Avicennia marina and Rhizophora mucronata[24] grow in about 28 stands that cover about 525 hectares.[citation needed] Almost all Egyptian mangrove stands are now protected.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere are mangroves off the east coast of South Africa extending as far south as the Tylomnqa River (3313'26.1\\"S 2734'50.2\\"E). Some mangrove stands exist in the St Lucia estuary within iSimangaliso Wetland Park.[citation needed]\\r\\nMangroves live in many parts of the tropical and subtropical coastal zones of North and South America.\\r\\nBecause of their sensitivity to subfreezing temperatures, mangroves in the continental United States are very limited to the Florida peninsula (see Florida mangroves) and some isolated growths[25] of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) at the southmost coast of Louisiana[26] and South Texas.[27]\\r\\nIn Mexico four species of mangrove predominate: Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa, Avicennia germinans and Conocarpus erectus.[28] During an inventory conducted by CONABIO between 2006 and 2008, 770,057 hectares of mangrove were counted.[29] Of this total, 55% are located in the Yucatn Peninsula.[29]\\r\\nSignificant mangals include the Marismas Nacionales-San Blas mangroves found in Sinaloa and Nayarit.\\r\\nMangroves occur on the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. Mangroves can also be found in many of the Antilles including Puerto Rico,[30] Cuba, and Hispaniola,[31] as well as other islands in the West Indies such as the Bahamas.\\r\\nThe nation of Belize has the highest overall percentage of forest cover of any of the Central American countries.[32] In terms of Belize's mangrove coverwhich assumes the form not only of mangrove 'forest', but also of scrubs and savannas, among others[33]a 2010 satellite-based study of Belize's mangroves by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Water Center for the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean found, in 2010, mangroves covered some 184,548 acres (74,684 hectares) or 3.4% of Belize's territory.[34]\\r\\nIn 1980, by contrast, mangrove cover stood at 188,417 acres (76,250 hectares)also 3.4% of Belize's territory, although based on the work of mangrove researcher Simon Zisman,[35] Belize's mangrove cover in 1980 was estimated to represent 98.7% of the precolonial extent of those ecosystems. Belize's mangrove cover in 2010 was thus estimated to represent 96.7% of the precolonial cover.[34] Assessing changes in Belize's mangrove cover over a 30-year period was possible because of Belize's participation in the Regional Visualization and Monitoring System, a regional observatory jointly implemented by CATHALAC, RCMRD, ICIMOD, NASA, USAID, and other partners.[36]\\r\\nBrazil contains approximately 26,000?km2 of mangals, 15% of the world's total.\\r\\nEcuador has substantial remaining mangrove forests in the provinces of El Oro, Guayas, Manabi and Esmeraldas with limited forest remaining in Santa Elena.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257138926_The_Impact_of_Shrimp_Farming_on_Mangrove_Ecosystems_and_Local_Livelihoods_along_the_Pacific_Coast_of_Ecuador[37] The northern portion of Esmeraldas province has a large pristine mangrove forest that is preserved as the Reserva Ecol‹ágica Cayapas-Mataje (REMACAN) and is an original Ramsar site.[38] This forest is the most preserved within Ecuador and likely the most pristine forest along the Pacific Coast of the Americas.[39]\\r\\nThe only other major mangrove holding in Esmeraldas is in-and-around the community of Muisne and the Rio Muisne Estuary Swampland Wildlife Refuges.[41] The mangroves in-and-around the estuaries of Muisne have decreased in area from 3222 ha in 1971 to 1065 ha as of 2005, during this time commercial shrimp aquaculture has become the dominant land-cover within this estuary environment.[42]\\r\\nOn the border of Esmeraldas province and Manab province is a formerly large area of mangrove within Cojimies Estuary. The mangroves in this estuary are some of the most degraded in Ecuador with only 19% of 1971 mangrove area remaining as of 1998, although mangrove has recovered since this date.[39] Within Manab the major mangrove holding estuary is the Chone estuary situated near the city of Baha de Carquez. Again, Chone has undergone substantial mangrove deforestation since the advent of commercial aquaculture in Ecuador.[42] Although mangrove loss appears to have halted in this estuary and mangrove regrowth driven by local fisherman is now occurring.[43]\\r\\nPeru has a very small region of mangrove located in the north-west of the country on the Ecuadorian Border.[44]\\r\\nVenezuela's northern Caribbean island, Margarita, possesses mangrove forests in the Parque nacional Laguna de La Restinga. Venezuela has 4% of the world's mangroves, with an extension of 6735?km2.[45]\\r\\nColombia possesses large mangrove forests on both its Caribbean and Pacific coasts.\\r\\nThe Mangrove forests of Suriname have a height of 20√ø25 m and are found mainly in the coastal area. There are six types of mangroves, namely two types of parwa or black mangroves, three types of red mangroves (mangro) and a small mangrove species (white mangrove, akira or tjila).[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Sundarbans, the largest mangroves region in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the largest single block of tidal halophytic mangrove forest in the world, covering parts of Bangladesh's Khulna Division and the Indian state of West Bengal.\\r\\nIn the Ganga-Brahmaputra delta, Sundari trees are found, which provide durable hard timber. Palm, Coconut, keora, agar, also grow in some parts of the delta. India's mangrove forests are known to serve as a habitat for turtles, crocodiles, gharials, and snakes. This region is part of the Great Sundarbans and covers a National Park, Tiger reserve and a Biosphere Reserve.[47][48]\\r\\nThe Sundarbans National Park is a National Park, Tiger Reserve, and a Biosphere Reserve. It is one of the largest reserves for the Bengal tiger.\\r\\nA third of this area is covered by water and marshes. Since 1966 it has been considered a sanctuary for wildlife with an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and more than 30,000 deer.\\r\\nThe forest lies at the foot of the Ganges The seasonally-flooded Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests lie inland from the mangrove forests. The forest covers 10,000 square kilometres (3,900?sq?mi) of which about 6,000 square kilometres (2,300?sq?mi) are in Bangladesh. It was inscribed as a UNESCO world heritage site in 1997, but while the Bangladeshi and Indian portions constitute the same continuous ecotope, they are separately listed in the UNESCO world heritage list as the Sundarbans and Sundarbans National Park, respectively. The Sundarbans is intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests. The area is known for the eponymous Royal Bengal Tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), as well as numerous fauna including species of birds, spotted deer, crocodiles and snakes. Sundarbans was designated a Ramsar site on May 21, 1992. The fertile soils of the delta have been subject to intensive human use for centuries, and the ecoregion has been mostly converted to intensive agriculture, with few enclaves of forest remaining. The remaining forests, together with the Sundarbans mangroves, are important habitat for the endangered tiger. Additionally, the Sundarbans serves a crucial function as a protective flood barrier for the millions of inhabitants in and around Kolkata (Calcutta) against the result of cyclone activity. Sundarbans is home to many different species of birds, mammals, insects, reptiles and fish. It is estimated that there may be found more than 120 species of fish and over 260 species of birds and more than fifty species of reptiles and eight amphibians. Many tourists go there to see the Bengal tigers, saltwater crocodiles, leopards and snakes cobra.

On 22 June 2013, Sindh Forest Department, Govt. of Sindh, Pakistan, with the help of 300 local coastal volunteer planters set the Guinness World Record by planting 847,250 mangrove saplings at Kharo Chan, Thatta, Sindh, Pakistan in a little over 12 hours. This is the highest number of saplings planted within a day under the Guinness World Record category of \\"Maximum Number of Trees Planted in a Day\\".\\r\\nSindh Forest Department, Government of Sindh Mangrove has played pioneer role for the conservation and protection of the mangroves in the Indus Delta since late 1950s when it was handed over the areas. A breakthrough success is the re-introduction of Rhizophora mucronata into the Indus Delta, which had become extinct there. More recently, a threatened mangrove shrub, Ceriops tagal, has also been successfully re-introduced. A third species, Aegiceras corniculatum, is under trials at the nursery stage.\\r\\nA gigantic initiative is under in the Sindh, Pakistan, to rehabilitate the degraded and blank mangrove mudflats. Since 2010 alone, around 55,000 Hectares of such area has been planted and rehabilitated. During this period, through concerted efforts and a rigorous conservation policy adopted by the Sindh Forest Department, Govt. of Sindh and the federal govt. a mangrove resource base of 150,000 plus Hectares has been created, with the support of local coastal communities. International organizations like IUCN and WWF are also playing critical role to support this initiative of the government. Other achievements include: (1) Declaring all the mangrove forests in the Indus Delta as Protected Forests in December 2010; Constitution of a Mangrove Conservation Committee at the provincial level which includes all stakeholders as members and overall awareness of the importance of mangroves and its ecosystem.[57]\\r\\nShah Bundar, Sujawal, Pakistan, new mangrove plantation\\r\\nA young mangrove plantation in the Indus Delta\\r\\nFlourishing mangroves along Karachi coast, Pakistan\\r\\nGlowing mangrove plantation at Keti Bundar, Thatta, Pakistan\\r\\nOman, near Muscat, supports large areas of mangroves, in particular at Shinas, Qurm Park and Mahout Island.

Mangals on Guam, Palau, Kosrae and Yap have been badly affected by development.[64]\\r\\nMangroves are not native to Hawaii, but the red mangrove, Rhizophora mangle, and Oriental mangrove, Bruguiera sexangula, have been introduced and are now naturalized.[65] Both species are considered invasive species and classified as pests by the University of Hawaii Botany Department.[66]\\r\\nAdequate data are only available for about half of the global area of mangroves. However, of those areas for which data has been collected, it appears that 35% of the mangroves have been destroyed.[67] The United Nations Environment Program & Hamilton (2013), estimate that shrimp farming causes approximately a quarter of the destruction of mangrove forests.[68][69] Likewise, the 2010 update of the World Mangrove Atlas indicated that approximately one fifth of the world's mangrove ecosystems have been lost since 1980,[70] although this rapid loss rate appears to have decreased since 2000 with global losses estimated at between 0.16% and 0.39% annually between 2000 and 2012.[21] Despite global loss rates decreasing since 2000, Southeast Asia remains an area of concern with loss rates between 3.58% and 8.08% between 2000 and 2012.[21]\\r\\nGrassroots efforts to save mangroves from development are becoming more popular as their benefits become more widely known. In the Bahamas, for example, active efforts to save mangroves are occurring on the islands of Bimini and Great Guana Cay. In Trinidad and Tobago as well, efforts are underway to protect a mangrove threatened by the construction of a steelmill and a port.[citation needed] In Thailand, community management has been effective in restoring damaged mangroves.[71] Within northern Ecuador mangrove regrowth is reported in almost all estuaries and stems primarily from local actors responding to earlier periods of deforestation in the Esmeraldas region.[43]\\r\\nMangroves have been reported to be able to help buffer against tsunami, cyclones, and other storms. One village in Tamil Nadu was protected from tsunami destructionthe villagers in Naluvedapathy planted 80,244 saplings to get into the Guinness Book of World Records. This created a kilometre-wide belt of trees of various varieties. When the tsunami struck, much of the land around the village was flooded, but the village itself suffered minimal damage.[72]\\r\\nIn some areas, mangrove reforestation and mangrove restoration is also underway. Red mangroves are the most common choice for cultivation, used particularly in marine aquariums in a sump to reduce nitrates and other nutrients in the water. Mangroves also appear in home aquariums, and as ornamental plants, such as in Japan.\\r\\nIn Senegal, Ha?dar El Ali has started the fr project, which (amongst others) focuses on reforesting several areas with mangroves.[73]\\r\\nThe Manzanar Mangrove Initiative is an ongoing experiment in Arkiko, Eritrea, part of the Manzanar Project founded by Gordon H. Sato, establishing new mangrove plantations on the coastal mudflats. Initial plantings failed, but observation of the areas where mangroves did survive by themselves led to the conclusion that nutrients in water flow from inland were important to the health of the mangroves. Trials with the Eritrean Ministry of Fisheries followed, and a planting system was designed to provide the nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron missing from seawater.[74][75]\\r\\nThe propagules are planted inside a reused galvanized steel can with the bottom knocked out; a small piece of iron and a pierced plastic bag with fertilizer containing nitrogen and phosphorus are buried with the propagule. As of 2007[update], after six years of planting, 700,000 mangroves are growing; providing stock feed for sheep and habitat for oysters, crabs, other bivalves, and fish.[74][75]\\r\\nIn terms of local and national studies of mangrove loss, the case of Belize's mangroves is illustrative in its contrast to the global picture. A recent, satellite-based study[34]funded by the World Wildlife Fund and conducted by the Water Center for the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC)indicates Belize's mangrove cover declined by a mere 2% over a 30-year period. The study was born out of the need to verify the popular conception that mangrove clearing in Belize was rampant.[76]\\r\\nInstead, the assessment showed, between 1980 and 2010, under 4,000 acres (16?km2) of mangroves had been cleared, although clearing of mangroves near Belize's main coastal settlements (e.g. Belize City and San Pedro) was relatively high. The rate of loss of Belize's mangrovesat 0.07% per year between 1980 and 2010was much lower than Belize's overall rate of forest clearing (0.6% per year in the same period).[77] These findings can also be interpreted to indicate Belize's mangrove regulations (under the nation's)[78] have largely been effective. Nevertheless, the need to protect Belize's mangroves is imperative, as a 2009 study by the World Resources Institute (WRI) indicates the ecosystems contribute US$174√ø249 million per year to Belize's national economy.[79]","input":"Where do famous and unique mangrove trees grow?"},{"output":"Frederick Muhlenberg","context":"The Speaker of the House is the presiding officer of the United States House of Representatives.

It was the smallest of the 4-door Jeep SUVs up until the car platform based 4-door Compass and Patriot arrived for 2007. The Liberty featured unibody-construction. It was assembled at the Toledo North Assembly Plant in the United States, as well as in other countries including Egypt and Venezuela.\\r\\n\\r\\nInspired by styling from the Dakar[2] and Jeepster[3] concept vehicles, the Liberty was intended as a replacement for the discontinued Jeep Cherokee. The Liberty also marked a few firsts for Jeep. It was the first Jeep vehicle to use rack and pinion steering.[4] It also the first Jeep to use the two then-new PowerTech engines; the 150 horsepower (110?kW) 2.4 L straight-4, which was discontinued in 2006, and the 210 horsepower (160?kW) 3.7 L V6. However, the Liberty was not the first Jeep vehicle to use an independent front suspension, as the Jeep Wagoneer first used it in the 1963 model. But, that independent front suspension was limited to four wheel drive versions and, even then, was a short lived option.[5] The Liberty was nominated for the North American Truck of the Year award for 2002.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree trim levels were initially offered; the top end Limited, a more rugged looking Renegade and the base Sport. All were made available with either 2WD or 4WD. In July 2004 for the 2005 model year,  the Liberty received a mid-cycle facelift. The 2005, 2006 Renegade and 2005 Rocky Mountain Edition Liberties received an exclusive flat hood and taller grille. In 2007, the Renegade trim level was replaced with the Latitude which appeared to focus more on an urban appearance and lost the Renegade trim's unique hood and grille.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2002-2007 Jeep Liberty KJ was offered in three basic trim levels, each offering their own level of standard and optional equipment:\\r\\n\\r\\nSport: The Sport served as the \\"base\\" model 2002-2007 Jeep Liberty. It offered the following standard equipment: a 2.4L \\"Power-Tech\\" Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, a five-speed manual transmission, sixteen-inch (16\\") steel wheels, an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette player (later, a single-disc CD player), a six-speaker audio system, cloth seating surfaces, dual manually-adjustable front bucket seats, a split-folding rear bench seat, full instrumentation, manual windows and door locks (power windows and door locks became standard equipment starting in 2005), gray front and rear bumpers and body side cladding panels, and a rear-mounted spare tire and wheel. Optional equipment included an A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD player (this later became standard equipment), power windows and door locks with keyless entry (also later became standard equipment), an Infinity premium amplified audio system, aluminum-alloy wheels, a full-size spare tire and wheel (this later became standard equipment), air conditioning (also later became standard equipment), a four-speed automatic transmission, a 3.7L \\"Power-Tech\\" V6 engine, a 2.8L Common-Rail Diesel (CRD) engine, a five-speed automatic transmission, and front-mounted fog lamps. \\"Special-Edition\\" models of the Liberty KJ, such as the 2003 Freedom Edition, the 2004 Columbia Edition, the 2005 and 2007 Rocky Mountain Edition, and the 2006 65th Anniversary Edition, were all based on the base Sport trim level.\\r\\n\\r\\nRenegade: The Renegade served as the \\"off-road-ready\\" model of the Jeep Liberty between midyear 2002 and 2007. Based on the base Sport' model, it added the following equipment: a 3.7L \\"Power-Tech\\" V6 engine, power windows and door locks with keyless entry, cloth-and-vinyl-trimmed seating surfaces, air conditioning, sixteen-inch (16\\") color-keyed aluminum-alloy wheels (in Cactus Green, Mineral Gray, or Light Khaki), gray front and rear decorative wheel flares, Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS), front-mounted fog lamps, and an A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD player. Optional equipment included seventeen-inch (17\\") chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels, roof-mounted \\"Off-Road\\" lamps, an Infinity premium audio system, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, low-back front bucket seats, a power tilt-and-sliding sunroof, and a four-speed automatic transmission. \\r\\n\\r\\nLimited Edition: The Limited Edition was the top-of-the-line 2002-2007 Jeep Liberty model. It added the following equipment to the Renegade trim level: a 3.7L \\"Power-Tech\\" V6 engine, a four-speed automatic transmission, sixteen-inch (16\\") aluminum-alloy wheels (later seventeen-inch (17\\")), color-keyed front and rear bumpers, chrome body side cladding panels, an A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD player, security system, power-adjustable front driver's bucket seat, air conditioning, front-mounted fog lamps, an overhead Electronic Vehicle Information Center (EVIC), and premium cloth seating surfaces with low-back front bucket seats. Optional equipment included an A/M-F/M stereo with Radio Data System (RDS) and cassette and single-disc CD players (later, a six-disc, in-dash CD changer), an Infinity premium amplified audio system, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual heated front bucket seats, a power-adjustable front passenger's bucket seat, seventeen-inch (17\\") chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels, Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS), a 2.8L Common-Rail Diesel (CRD) engine, a five-speed automatic transmission, and a power tilt-and-sliding sunroof. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, DaimlerChrysler began offering a diesel engine to the North American market to gauge the marketability of diesel engines in North America. The last North American market Jeep product that was offered with a diesel engine was the 1987 Jeep Cherokee and Comanche. Only available for 2005 and 2006 in Sport and Limited trims, the 2.8L VM Motori R 428 I4 common rail turbodiesel or CRD exceeded expectations by selling 10,000 examples in its first calendar year of production. The diesel utilized a variable geometry turbocharger and generated 160 horsepower (120?kW) and 295?lb?ft (400?N?m) of torque. Offering 60 more foot lbs of torque than the comparable V6 gasoline engine and offered higher fuel efficiency;[6] but it added nearly 200 pounds (91?kg) to the curb weight, a price increase, and offered less peak horsepower. The CRD was prohibited from being sold in Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, and California due to their higher emission standards and was discontinued for 2007 due to stricter federal emission standards in the United States. The next year Jeep offered the Jeep Grand Cherokee with a diesel engine option; which was 50-state emission legal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Liberty is available with either a part-time Command-Trac or full-time Selec-Trac transfer case.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Command-Trac transfer case has four positions: 2-HI, 4-HI, Neutral, and 4-LO. The lever is placed in 2WD HI for regular driving. This allows the two rear tires to receive power. The second position, 4WD HI, is used for driving on slippery or loose surfaces. This position locks both the front and rear drive shafts together allowing the vehicle to maintain drive as long as at least one axle has traction. The third position, Neutral, disengages both drive shafts from the transfer case allowing the car to roll freely; this is used for towing behind another vehicle, for example. The last position, 4WD LO is used for situations requiring higher torque or slow speed when traversing rough terrain. A common misconception is that 4WD LO provides more traction.  It only changes the gear ratio and does not add any more friction between the tires and the driving surface. This position, like 4WD HI locks both the front and rear drive shafts together, and by using a lower gear ratio, allows for 2.72 times more torque (however, the speed is limited to around 25 MPH max). It should be noted that turning while in 4WD HI or LO on dry pavement is hazardous to vehicle components, through driveline binding and wheel-hop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Selec-Trac transfer case has five positions: 2-HI, 4-HI Part-Time, 4-HI Full-Time, Neutral, and 4-LO. The transfer case is different from the Command-Trac transfer only in the extra 4WD HI Full-Time position. The 4WD HI Full-Time position adds the same traction benefits that the part-time 4WD setting offers, but features an open differential between the front and rear axles to allow the two axles to spin at independent speeds and eliminate drive line binding and wheel-hop. The down side of 4WD Hi Full-Time is that, due to the open differential between front and rear drive lines, at times the drive train will only deliver power to the front or the rear e.g. when the front of the vehicle has reached a high traction surface such as dry pavement and the rear is in sand, the rear tires will spin with 100% of engine power, the front receiving no traction. Under equal traction conditions (front-rear) this position gives the rear wheels 52% of the engine's power and the front wheels 48% of the engine's power. The division of power and open center differential allows the Selec-Trac transfer case to be operated at all times in an \\"All Wheel Drive\\" mode with no adverse effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though no special Jeep Liberty was introduced in 2002 for police use, police and rental agencies continue to purchase it for fleet use. Most are equipped with the 3.7L \\"Power-Tech\\" V6 Engine that produces 210 horsepower mated to a 4-Speed Automatic Transmission, however, some fleet Liberties used a 2.4L I4 Engine that produced about 150 horsepower with a 4-Speed Automatic Transmission. In 2008, when the Jeep Liberty was fully redesigned, the I4 engine was dropped, and the V6 engine was the only engine choice, as was the 4-Speed Automatic Transmission. Most fleet and government Liberties also use either the Selec-Trac or Selec-Trac II 4WD Systems, but some Liberties used 2WD.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince it was introduced in April 2001 as a 2002 Model Year vehicle to the time it was discontinued in 2007, the Liberty KJ also found its way into rental car fleets. Most rental Liberty KJ's were the V6-powered Sport models with automatic transmissions and 4WD.\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous versions were available in markets outside the U.S. and Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly-2002 through mid-2003 model year CRDs were equipped with a 2.5lt VM Motori Diesel producing 105?kW (143?PS; 141?hp) and 343?N?m (253?lb?ft). An external wastegated turbo was standard and the engine was available only with a manual transmission.\\r\\n\\r\\nA commercial Cherokee version with 2.5 CRD engine and five-speed transmission rated at 34.4 miles per imperial gallon (8.2?L/100?km; 28.6?mpg?US) has a completely flat cargo area (the rear seat area has a carpeted full-length galvanized metal floor) and the rear quarter glass and rear door glass is replaced with fixed body colored aluminum panels (the front doors have power windows). For additional cargo security a removable floor to ceiling metal and mesh bulkhead is optional. In European markets, VAT registered buyers can claim back the tax paid as this qualifies as a Commercial Vehicle.","input":"What transmission is in a 2003 jeep liberty?"},{"output":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire","context":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth novel in the Harry Potter series, written by British author J. K. Rowling. It follows Harry Potter, a wizard in his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the mystery surrounding the entry of Harry's name into the Triwizard Tournament, in which he is forced to compete.\\r\\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury and in the United States by Scholastic; in both countries the release date was 8 July 2000, the first time a book in the series was published in both countries at the same time. The novel won a Hugo Award, the only Harry Potter novel to do so, in 2001. The book was made into a film, which was released worldwide on 18 November 2005, and a video game by Electronic Arts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the three previous novels in the Harry Potter series, the main character, Harry Potter, has struggled with the difficulties of growing up, and the added challenge of being a famed wizard: when Harry was a baby, Lord Voldemort, the most powerful Dark wizard in history, killed Harry's parents but mysteriously vanished after unsuccessfully trying to kill Harry, which left a lightning-shaped scar on Harry's forehead. This results in Harry's immediate fame and his being placed in the care of his abusive muggle, or non-magical, aunt and uncle, Aunt Petunia Dursley and Uncle Vernon Dursley, who have a son named Dudley Dursley.\\r\\nHarry learns that he is a wizard when he is 11 years old, and enrolls in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He befriends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and is confronted by Lord Voldemort who is trying to regain power. In Harry's first year he has to protect the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort and one of his faithful followers at Hogwarts. After returning to the school after summer break, students at Hogwarts are attacked by the legendary monster of the \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" after the chamber is opened. Harry ends the attacks by killing a Basilisk and defeating another attempt by Lord Voldemort to return to full strength. The following year, Harry hears that he has been targeted by escaped mass murderer Sirius Black. Despite stringent security measures at Hogwarts, Harry is confronted by Black at the end of his third year of schooling, and Harry learns that Black was framed and is actually Harry's godfather. He also learned that it was his father's old school friend Peter Pettigrew who actually betrayed his parents.\\r\\nThe book opens with Harry seeing Frank Bryce being killed by Lord Voldemort in a vision, and is awoken by his scar hurting. The Weasleys then take Harry and Hermione Granger to the Quidditch World Cup, using a Portkey, to watch Ireland versus Bulgaria, with Ireland emerging victorious. There, Harry meets Cedric Diggory, who is attending the match with his father. After the match, Voldemort's followers attack the site, destroying spectators' tents and wreaking havoc. The Dark Mark gets fired into the sky, which leads to a panic since it is the first time the sign has been seen in 13 years. Winky, Barty Crouch Senior's house elf, is falsely accused of casting the Mark after she is found holding Harry's wand, which is revealed to have been used to cast the Mark, as Harry had lost it during the chaos of the Death Eaters' attack. Hermione, angry at this injustice, forms a society to promote the rights of house elves known as S.P.E.W. (Society for the Promotion of Elvish Welfare).\\r\\nAt Hogwarts, Professor Dumbledore announces that Alastor \\"Mad-Eye\\" Moody will be the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for the year, and also that Hogwarts will host the Triwizard Tournament, with a prize of one thousand gold Galleons. However, only those over 17the age of majority in the wizarding worldwill be allowed to enter. It is the first time in 202 years that the Triwizard Tournament will be held. Students from Beauxbatons Academy and the Durmstrang Institute, other wizarding academies, will travel to Hogwarts, where they will stay for the year, in hopes of competing. At Halloween, the Goblet of Fire picks Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons Academy; Viktor Krum (who is also the Seeker on Bulgaria's Quidditch team) from Durmstrang Institute; and Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts to compete in the tournament. However, it additionally gives a fourth nameHarry Potterleading to suspicion and indignation from everyone and magically binding Harry to compete. Ron is jealous that Harry is once again in the limelight and refuses to speak to Harry.\\r\\nHagrid reveals to Harry that the first task involves dragons, and since Fleur and Krum's headmasters are also aware of this, and will surely tell them in advance, Harry informs Cedric as well. At the task, Harry has to pass a Hungarian Horntail to retrieve a golden egg that contains a hint to the next task, which he does by summoning his Firebolt broomstick with the Accio spell, and finishes the task tied for first with Krum. Ron and Harry subsequently reconcile, Ron now understanding the full danger of the tournament. When Harry opens the egg, though, it merely shrieks loudly. Hermione then takes Harry and Ron to the school kitchens, where house elves work. There, they meet a distraught Winky, who is struggling to get over the loss of her sacking. They also meet Harry's old friend Dobby, who has been employed at Hogwarts to work in the kitchens; he is the only known house elf to appreciate his freedom, despite his hardworking nature.\\r\\nMeanwhile, gossipy reporter Rita Skeeter is writing scandalous articles of half-truths and outright fabrications in The Daily Prophet about those at Hogwarts, including Hermione, Harry, Hagrid, and Madame Maxime of Beauxbatons.\\r\\nWith the Yule Ball approaching, Harry must find a partner, but when he finally approaches his crush Cho Chang, Cedric has beaten him to her, so Harry and Ron ask Parvati and Padma Patil. Ron is shocked and jealous to see that Hermione is attending with Krum. Cedric gives Harry a tip on the egg, telling him to take it to the prefects' bathroom, but Harry refuses to listen, jealous over Cho.\\r\\nFinally acting on the tip, Harry takes the egg to the prefects' bathroom, where Moaning Myrtle tells him to listen to the egg underwater; there the words become understandable. Harry learns that the task is to recover something he will \\"sorely miss\\", and starts looking for spells to help him breathe where the objects will be taken: The Black Lake. By the morning of the task, Harry still hasn't found a solution, but Dobby gives him some Gillyweed to give Harry gills. Harry completes the task by rescuing Ron from under the lake. Harry then takes a risk by also rescuing Fleur's younger sister, Gabrielle, after Fleur was unable to. After the judges confer, he earns enough points to tie him with Cedric for the lead.\\r\\nOne month before the final task, Harry and Krum are talking when they encounter Crouch, who appears to have gone insane, but manages to tell Harry to get Dumbledore. Leaving Krum with Crouch, Harry fetches Dumbledore but returns to find Krum stunned and Crouch gone. Harry returns to preparing for the final task, a hedge maze. Inside the maze, Harry is forced to incapacitate Krum, who has been bewitched, to save Cedric. Working together, the two reach the cup. They agree to touch it at the same time, and doing so, discover that it is a Portkey that transports them to a graveyard. There, Peter Pettigrew kills Cedric and uses Harry's blood (along with his own hand and Tom Riddle Sr.'s bone) to resurrect Lord Voldemort.\\r\\nVoldemort summons his Death Eaters, berating them for thinking he was dead, before he reveals that he has a single \\"faithful servant\\" concealed at Hogwarts, who has been working to ensure that Harry would make it to the graveyard, and then challenges Harry to a duel. However, when he and Harry fire curses at each other, their wands connect due to their identical cores. Voldemort's wand releases the most recent spells it performed, resulting in imprints of his last victims appearing in the graveyard, including Harry's parents, who provide a distraction so that Harry can escape back to Hogwarts using the Portkey, taking Cedric's body with him.\\r\\nWhen he returns, Moody takes him to his office, and reveals himself to be Voldemort's 'faithful servant'; he was the one who put Harry's name into the Goblet of Fire, and has been guiding him through the tournament from behind the scenes to ensure that he would grab the Portkey first. Before Moody can kill Harry, Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape intervene. They learn that Moody is in fact Barty Crouch Jr., Mr. Crouch's son, disguised by Polyjuice Potion. Crouch had sentenced Crouch Jr. to life imprisonment in Azkaban over alleged ties to the Death Eaters but smuggled him out as a last favour to his dying wife. Crouch Jr. was the one who set off the Dark Mark at the Quidditch World Cup, doing it to scare the Death Eaters he felt had abandoned Voldemort. Eventually, Voldemort had gotten in contact with Crouch Jr. and had him impersonate Moody as part of his plan. Crouch Jr. also admits to killing Crouch Sr., to prevent him telling Dumbledore about Voldemort. The real Moody is found inside Crouch Jr.'s enchanted trunk and rescued. Harry is then declared the winner of the Triwizard Tournament and given his winnings.\\r\\nMany people, including Fudge, do not believe Harry and Dumbledore about Voldemort's return, and as Fudge has the Dementor's Kiss performed, Crouch Jr. is unable to give testimony. Hermione discovers Rita Skeeter is an unregistered Animagus, who can take the form of a beetle, and blackmails her to force her to stop writing her libellous stories. Not wanting his tournament winnings, Harry gives them to Fred and George to start their joke shop and returns home with the Dursleys.\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth book in the Harry Potter series. The first, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published by Bloomsbury on 26 June 1997; the second, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was published on 2 July 1998; and the third, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, followed on 8 July 1999.[1] Goblet of Fire is considerably longer than the first three; almost twice the size (the paperback edition was 636 pages). Rowling stated that she \\"knew from the beginning it would be the biggest of the first four\\". She said there needed to be a \\"proper run-up\\" for the conclusion and rushing the \\"complex plot\\" could confuse readers. She also stated that \\"everything is on a bigger scale\\" which was symbolic, as Harry's horizons widened both literally and metaphorically as he grew up. She also wanted to explore more of the magical world.[2]\\r\\nUntil the official title's announcement on 27 June 2000, the book was called by its working title, 'Harry Potter IV.' Previously, in April, the publisher had listed it as Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament. However,[3] J.?K. Rowling expressed her indecision about the title in an Entertainment Weekly interview. \\"I changed my mind twice on what [the title] was. The working title had got out? Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament. Then I changed Doomspell to Triwizard Tournament. Then I was teetering between Goblet of Fire and Triwizard Tournament. In the end, I preferred Goblet of Fire because it's got that kind of cup of destiny feel about it, which is the theme of the book.\\"[2]\\r\\nRowling mentioned that she originally had a Weasley relative named Malfalda, who, according to Rowling, \\"was the daughter of the 'second cousin who's a stockbroker' mentioned in Philosopher's Stone. This stockbroker had been very rude to Mr. and Mrs.?Weasley in the past, but now he and his (Muggle) wife had inconveniently produced a witch, they came back to the Weasleys asking for their help in introducing her to wizarding society before she starts at Hogwarts\\".[4] Malfalda was supposed to be a Slytherin and who was to fill in the Rita Skeeter subplot, but eventually was removed as \\"there were obvious limitations to what an eleven year old closeted at school could discover\\". Rowling considered Rita Skeeter to be \\"much more flexible\\".[4] Rowling also admitted that the fourth book was the most difficult to write at the time, because she noticed a giant plot hole halfway through writing.[2] In particular, Rowling had trouble with the ninth chapter, \\"The Dark Mark\\", which she rewrote 13?times.[5]\\r\\nJeff Jensen, who interviewed Rowling for Entertainment Weekly in 2000, pointed out that bigotry is a big theme in the Harry Potter novels and Goblet of Fire in particular. He mentioned how Voldemort and his followers are prejudiced against Muggles and how in Goblet of Fire Hermione forms a group to liberate Hogwarts' house-elves who have \\"been indentured servants so long they lack desire for anything else\\".[2] When asked why she explored this theme, Rowling replied,\\r\\nBecause bigotry is probably the thing I detest most. All forms of intolerance, the whole idea of that which is different from me is necessarily evil. I really like to explore the idea that difference is equal and good. But there's another idea that I like to explore, too. Oppressed groups are not, generally speaking, people who stand firmly together √ø no, sadly, they kind of subdivide among themselves and fight like hell. That's human nature, so that's what you see here. This world of wizards and witches, they're already ostracized, and then within themselves, they've formed a loathsome pecking order.[2]\\r\\nShe also commented that she did not feel this was too \\"heavy\\" for children, as it was one of those things that a \\"huge number of children at that age start to think about\\".[2]\\r\\nGoblet of Fire was the first book in the Harry Potter series to be released in the United States on the same date as the United Kingdom, on 8 July 2000, strategically on a Saturday so children did not have to worry about school conflicting with buying the book.[1] It had a combined first-printing of over five million copies.[1] It was given a record-breaking print run of 3.9 million. Three million copies of the book were sold over the first weekend in the US alone.[6] FedEx dispatched more than 9,000 trucks and 100 planes to fulfill book deliveries.[7] The pressure in editing caused a mistake which shows Harry's father emerging first from Voldemort's wand; however, as confirmed in Prisoner of Azkaban, James died first, so then Harry's mother ought to have come out first.[8] This was corrected in later editions.[9]\\r\\nTo publicise the book, a special train named Hogwarts Express was organised by Bloomsbury, and run from King's Cross to Perth, carrying J.K. Rowling, a consignment of books for her to sign and sell, also representatives of Bloomsbury and the press. The book was launched on 8 July 2000, on platform?1 at King's Cross?√ø which had been given \\"Platform ?9?3?4\\" signs for the occasion?√ø following which the train departed. En route it called at Didcot Railway Centre, Kidderminster, the Severn Valley Railway, Crewe (overnight stop), Manchester, Bradford, York, the National Railway Museum (overnight stop), Newcastle, Edinburgh, arriving at Perth on 11 July. The locomotive was West Country class steam locomotive no.?34027 Taw Valley, which was specially repainted red for the tour; it later returned to its normal green livery (the repaints were requested and paid for by Bloomsbury). The coaches of the train included a sleeping car. A Diesel locomotive was coupled at the other end, for use when reversals were necessary, such as the first stage of the journey as far as Ferme Park, just south of Hornsey. The tour generated considerably more press interest than the launch of the film Thomas and the Magic Railroad which was premired in London the same weekend.[10][11][12]\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has received mostly positive reviews. In The New York Times Book Review, author Stephen King stated the Goblet of Fire was \\"every bit as good as Potters?1 through 3\\" and praised the humour and subplots, although he commented that \\"there's also a moderately tiresome amount of adolescent squabbling...it's a teenage thing\\".[13] Kirkus Reviews called it \\"another grand tale of magic and mystery...and clicking along so smoothly that it seems shorter than it is\\". However, they commented that it did tend to lag, especially at the end where two \\"bad guys\\" stopped the action to give extended explanations, and that the issues to be resolved in sequels would leave \\"many readers, particularly American ones, uncomfortable\\".[14] For The Horn Book Magazine, Martha V. Parravano gave a mixed review, saying \\"some will find [it] wide-ranging, compellingly written, and absorbing; others, long, rambling, and tortuously fraught with adverbs\\".[15] A Publishers Weekly review praised the book's \\"red herrings, the artful clues and tricky surprises that disarm the most attentive audience\\" and saying it \\"might be her most thrilling yet.\\"[16] Writing for The New Yorker, Joan Acocella noted that \\"where the prior volumes moved like lightning, here the pace is slower, the energy more dispersed. At the same time, the tone becomes more grim.\\"[17]\\r\\nKristin Lemmerman of CNN said that it is not great literature: 'Her prose has more in common with your typical beach-blanket fare and the beginning contained too much recap to introduce characters to new readers, although Rowling quickly gets back on track, introducing readers to a host of well-drawn new characters.'[18] Writing for Salon.com, Charles Taylor was generally positive about the change of mood and development of characters.[19] Entertainment Weekly's reviewer Kristen Baldwin gave Goblet of Fire the grade of A-, praising the development of the characters as well as the many themes presented. However, she did worry that a shocking climax may be a nightmare factory for young readers.[20]\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire won several awards, including the 2001 Hugo Award for Best Novel.[21] It won the 2002 Indian Paintbrush Book Award, the third after Philosopher's Stone and Prisoner of Azkaban.[22] The novel also won an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Award for one of the best books, who claimed it was \\"more intense than the first three books\\".[23] In addition, Entertainment Weekly listed Goblet of Fire in second place on their list of The New Classics: Books?√ø The 100 best reads from 1983 to 2008.[24]\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was adapted into a film, released worldwide on 18 November 2005, which was directed by Mike Newell and written by Steve Kloves. The film grossed $102.7 million for the opening weekend,[25] and eventually grossed $896 million worldwide.[26] The film was also nominated for Best Art Direction at the 78th Academy Awards.[27]\\r\\nIt was also made into a video game for PC, PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation Portable by Electronic Arts. It was released just before the film.\\r\\nMuch of the plot of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child involves a revisiting scenes from Goblet of Fire, with younger protagonists born long after these events travelling back in time in a misguided effort to change history and save Cedric Diggory - which only leads to them damaging events in the present and worsening the situation.","input":"What is the fourth book in the harry potter series?"},{"output":"Portree","context":"Skye, or the Isle of Skye (/ska?/; Scottish Gaelic: An t-Eilean Sgitheanach or Eilean a' Che), is the largest and northernmost of the major islands in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland.[Note 1] The island's peninsulas radiate from a mountainous centre dominated by the Cuillins, the rocky slopes of which provide some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in the country.[9][10] Although it has been suggested that the Gaelic Sgitheanach describes a winged shape there is no definitive agreement as to the name's origins.\\r\\nThe island has been occupied since the Mesolithic period, and its history includes a time of Norse rule and a long period of domination by Clan MacLeod and Clan Donald. The 18th century Jacobite risings led to the breaking up of the clan system and subsequent Clearances that replaced entire communities with sheep farms, some of which also involved forced emigrations to distant lands. Resident numbers declined from over 20,000 in the early 19th century to just under 9,000 by the closing decade of the 20th century. Skye's population increased by 4 per cent between 1991 and 2001.[11] About a third of the residents were Gaelic speakers in 2001, and although their numbers are in decline, this aspect of island culture remains important.[12]\\r\\nThe main industries are tourism, agriculture, fishing and forestry. Skye is part of the Highland Council local government area. The island's largest settlement is Portree, known for its picturesque harbour.[13] There are links to various nearby islands by ferry and, since 1995, to the mainland by a road bridge. The climate is mild, wet and windy. The abundant wildlife includes the golden eagle, red deer and Atlantic salmon. The local flora are dominated by heather moor, and there are nationally important invertebrate populations on the surrounding sea bed. Skye has provided the locations for various novels and feature films and is celebrated in poetry and song.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first written references to the island are Roman sources such as the Ravenna Cosmography, which refers to Scitis[14] and Scetis, which can be found on a map by Ptolemy.[15] One possible derivation comes from skitis, an early Celtic word for winged, which may describe how the island's peninsulas radiate out from a mountainous centre.[16] Subsequent Gaelic-, Norse- and English-speaking peoples have influenced the history of Skye; the relationships between their names for the island are not straightforward. Various etymologies have been proposed, such as the \\"winged isle\\" or \\"the notched isle\\"[17] but no definitive solution has been found to date; the place name may be from an earlier, non-Gaelic language.[18][19]\\r\\nIn the Norse sagas Skye is called Ske, for example in the Hkonar saga Hkonarsonar[20] and a skaldic poem in the Heimskringla from c. 1230 contains a line that translates as \\"the hunger battle-birds were filled in Skye with blood of foemen killed\\".[21] The island was also referred to by the Norse as Skuy (misty isle),[16] Skyey or Skuy? (isle of cloud).[1] The traditional Gaelic name is An t-Eilean Sgitheanach (the island of Skye), An t-Eilean Sgiathanach being a more recent and less common spelling. In 1549 Donald Munro, High Dean of the Isles, wrote of \\"Sky\\": \\"This Ile is callit Ellan Skiannach in Irish, that is to say in Inglish the wyngit Ile, be reason it has mony wyngis and pointis lyand furth fra it, throw the dividing of thir foirsaid Lochis.\\"[Note 2] but the meaning of this Gaelic name is unclear.[23]\\r\\nEilean a' Che, which means island of the mist (a translation of the Norse name), is a poetic Gaelic name for the island.[17][Note 3]\\r\\nAt 1,656 square kilometres (639?sq?mi), Skye is the second-largest island in Scotland after Lewis and Harris. The coastline of Skye is a series of peninsulas and bays radiating out from a centre dominated by the Cuillin hills (Gaelic: An Cuiltheann). Malcolm Slesser suggested that its shape \\"sticks out of the west coast of northern Scotland like a lobster's claw ready to snap at the fish bone of Harris and Lewis\\"[9] and W. H. Murray, commenting on its irregular coastline, stated that \\"Skye is sixty miles [100?km] long, but what might be its breadth is beyond the ingenuity of man to state\\".[1][Note 4] Martin Martin, a native of the island, reported on it at length in a 1703 publication. His geological observations included a note that:\\r\\nThere are marcasites black and white, resembling silver ore, near the village Sartle: there are likewise in the same place several stones, which in bigness, shape, &c., resemble nutmegs, and many rivulets here afford variegated stones of all colours. The Applesglen near Loch-Fallart has agate growing in it of different sizes and colours; some are green on the outside, some are of a pale sky colour, and they all strike fire as well as flint: I have one of them by me, which for shape and bigness is proper for a sword handle. Stones of a purple colour flow down the rivulets here after great rains.\\r\\nThe Black Cuillin, which are mainly composed of basalt and gabbro, include twelve Munros and provide some of the most dramatic and challenging mountain terrain in Scotland.[9] The ascent of Sgrr a' Ghreadaidh is one of the longest rock climbs in Britain and the Inaccessible Pinnacle is the only peak in Scotland that requires technical climbing skills to reach the summit.[16][26] These hills make demands of the hill walker that exceed any others found in Scotland[27] and a full traverse of the Cuillin ridge may take 15√ø20 hours.[28] The Red Hills (Gaelic: Am Binnean Dearg) to the south are also known as the Red Cuillin. They are mainly composed of granite that has weathered into more rounded hills with many long scree slopes on their flanks. The highest point of these hills is Glamaig, one of only two Corbetts on Skye.[29]\\r\\nThe northern peninsula of Trotternish is underlain by basalt, which provides relatively rich soils and a variety of unusual rock features. The Kilt Rock is named after the tartan-like patterns in the 105 metres (344?ft) cliffs. The Quiraing is a spectacular series of rock pinnacles on the eastern side of the main spine of the peninsula and further south is the rock pillar of the Old Man of Storr.[30]\\r\\nBeyond Loch Snizort to the west of Trotternish is the Waternish peninsula, which ends in Ardmore Point's double rock arch. Duirinish is separated from Waternish by Loch Dunvegan, which contains the island of Isay. The loch is ringed by sea cliffs that reach 295?metres (967?ft) at Waterstein Head. Oolitic loam provides good arable land in the main valley. Lochs Bracadale and Harport and the island of Wiay lie between Duirinish and Minginish, which includes the narrower defiles of Talisker and Glen Brittle and whose beaches are formed from black basaltic sands.[31] Strathaird is a relatively small peninsula close to the Cuillin hills with only a few crofting communities,[32] the island of Soay lies offshore. The bedrock of Sleat in the south is Torridonian sandstone, which produces poor soils and boggy ground, although its lower elevations and relatively sheltered eastern shores enable a lush growth of hedgerows and crops.[33] The islands of Raasay, Rona, Scalpay and Pabay all lie to the north and east between Skye and the mainland.[1][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nPortree in the north at the base of Trotternish is the largest settlement (estimated population 2,264 in 2011)[34] and is the main service centre on the island. Broadford, the location of the island's only airstrip, is on the east side of the island and Dunvegan in the north-west is well known for its castle and the nearby Three Chimneys restaurant. The 18th-century Stein Inn on the Waternish coast is the oldest pub on Skye.[35] Kyleakin is linked to Kyle of Lochalsh on the mainland by the Skye Bridge, which spans the narrows of Loch Alsh. Uig, the port for ferries to the Outer Hebrides, is on the west of the Trotternish peninsula and Edinbane is between Dunvegan and Portree.[16] Much of the rest of the population lives in crofting townships scattered around the coastline.[36]\\r\\nThe influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream create a mild oceanic climate. Temperatures are generally cool, averaging 6.5?C (43.7?F) in January and 15.4?C (59.7?F) in July at Duntulm in Trotternish.[37][Note 5] Snow seldom lies at sea level and frosts are less frequent than on the mainland. Winds are a limiting factor for vegetation. South-westerlies are the most common and speeds of 128?km/h (80?mph) have been recorded. High winds are especially likely on the exposed coasts of Trotternish and Waternish.[39] In common with most islands of the west coast of Scotland, rainfall is generally high at 1,500√ø2,000?mm (59√ø79?in) per annum and the elevated Cuillin are wetter still.[39] Variations can be considerable, with the north tending to be drier than the south. Broadford, for example, averages more than 2,870?mm (113?in) of rain per annum.[40] Trotternish typically has 200 hours of bright sunshine in May, the sunniest month.[41] On 28 December 2015, the temperature reached 15?C, beating the previous December record of 12.9?C, set in 2013. On 9 May 2016, a temperature of 26.7?C (80.1?F) was recorded at Lusa in the south-east of the island.[42]\\r\\nA Mesolithic hunter-gatherer site dating to the 7th millennium BC at An Corran in Staffin is one of the oldest archaeological sites in Scotland. Its occupation is probably linked to that of the rock shelter at Sand, Applecross, on the mainland coast of Wester Ross where tools made of a mudstone from An Corran have been found. Surveys of the area between the two shores of the Inner Sound and Sound of Raasay have revealed 33 sites with potentially Mesolithic deposits.[45][46] Finds of bloodstone microliths on the foreshore at Orbost on the west coast of the island near Dunvegan also suggest Mesolithic occupation. These tools probably originate from the nearby island of Rm.[47]\\r\\nRubha an Dnain, an uninhabited peninsula to the south of the Cuillin, has a variety of archaeological sites dating from the Neolithic onwards. There is a 2nd or 3rd millennium BC chambered cairn, an Iron Age promontory fort and the remains of another prehistoric settlement dating from the Bronze Age nearby. Loch na h-Airde on the peninsula is linked to the sea by an artificial \\"Viking\\" canal that may date from the later period of Norse settlement.[48][49] Dun Ringill is a ruined Iron Age hill fort on the Strathaird peninsula, which was further fortified in the Middle Ages and may have become the seat of Clan MacKinnon.[50]\\r\\nThe late Iron Age inhabitants of the northern and western Hebrides were probably Pictish, although the historical record is sparse.[51] Three Pictish symbol stones have been found on Skye and a fourth on Raasay.[52] More is known of the kingdom of Dl Riata to the south; Adomnn's life of Columba, written shortly before 697, portrays the saint visiting Skye (where he baptised a pagan leader using an interpreter[53]) and Adomnn himself is thought to have been familiar with the island.[54] The Irish annals record a number of events on Skye in the later 7th and early 8th centuries √ø mainly concerning the struggles between rival dynasties that formed the background to the Old Irish language romance Scla Cano meic Gartnin.[55]\\r\\nThe Norse held sway throughout the Hebrides from the 9th century until after the Treaty of Perth in 1266. However, apart from placenames, little remains of their presence on Skye in the written or archaeological record. Apart from the name \\"Skye\\" itself, all pre-Norse placenames seem to have been obliterated by the Scandinavian settlers.[56] Viking heritage is claimed by Clan MacLeod and Norse tradition is celebrated in the winter fire festival at Dunvegan, during which a replica Viking long boat is set alight.[57]\\r\\nThe most powerful clans on Skye in the post√øNorse period were Clan MacLeod, originally based in Trotternish, and Clan Macdonald of Sleat. Following the disintegration of the Lordship of the Isles, the Mackinnons also emerged as an independent clan, whose substantial landholdings in Skye were centred on Strathaird.[58] Clan MacNeacail also have a long association with Trotternish,[59] and in the 16th century many of the MacInnes clan moved to Sleat.[60] The MacDonalds of South Uist were bitter rivals of the MacLeods, and an attempt by the former to murder church-goers at Trumpan in retaliation for a previous massacre on Eigg, resulted in the Battle of the Spoiling Dyke of 1578.[61]\\r\\nAfter the failure of the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, Flora MacDonald became famous for rescuing Prince Charles Edward Stuart from the Hanoverian troops. Although she was born on South Uist her story is strongly associated with their escape via Skye and she is buried at Kilmuir in Trotternish.[62] Samuel Johnson and James Boswell's visit to Skye in 1773 and their meeting with Flora MacDonald in Kilmuir is recorded in Boswell's The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides. Boswell wrote, \\"To see Dr Samuel Johnson, the great champion of the English Tories, salute Miss Flora MacDonald in the isle of Sky, [sic] was a striking sight; for though somewhat congenial in their notions, it was very improbable they should meet here\\".[63] Johnson's words that Flora MacDonald was \\"A name that will be mentioned in history, and if courage and fidelity be virtues, mentioned with honour\\" are written on her gravestone.[64] After this rebellion the clan system was broken up and Skye became a series of landed estates.[65]\\r\\nOf the island in general, Johnson observed:\\r\\nI never was in any house of the islands, where I did not find books in more languages than one, if I staid long enough to want them, except one from which the family was removed. Literature is not neglected by the higher rank of the Hebrideans. It need not, I suppose, be mentioned, that in countries so little frequented as the islands, there are no houses where travellers are entertained for money. He that wanders about these wilds, either procures recommendations to those whose habitations lie near his way, or, when night and weariness come upon him, takes the chance of general hospitality. If he finds only a cottage he can expect little more than shelter; for the cottagers have little more for themselves but if his good fortune brings him to the residence of a gentleman, he will be glad of a storm to prolong his stay. There is, however, one inn by the sea-side at Sconsor, in Sky, where the post-office is kept.\\r\\nSkye has a rich heritage of ancient monuments from this period. Dunvegan Castle has been the seat of Clan MacLeod since the 13th century. It contains the Fairy Flag and is reputed to have been inhabited by a single family for longer than any other house in Scotland.[67] The 18th-century Armadale Castle, once home of Clan Donald of Sleat, was abandoned as a residence in 1925 but now hosts the Clan Donald Centre.[68] Nearby are the ruins of two more MacDonald strongholds, Knock Castle, and Dunscaith Castle (called \\"Fortress of Shadows\\"), the legendary home of warrior woman, martial arts instructor (and, according to some sources, Queen) Scthach.[16][69] Caisteal Maol, built in the late 15th century near Kyleakin and once a seat of Clan MacKinnon, is another ruin.[50]\\r\\nIn the late 18th century the harvesting of kelp became a significant activity[72] but from 1822 on cheap imports led to a collapse of this industry throughout the Hebrides.[73] During the 19th century, the inhabitants of Skye were also devastated by famine and Clearances. Thirty thousand people were evicted between 1840 and 1880 alone, many of them forced to emigrate to the New World.[2][74] For example, the settlement of Lorgill on the west coast of Duirinish was cleared on 4 August 1830. Every crofter under the age of seventy was removed and placed on board the Midlothian on threat of imprisonment, with those over that age being sent to the poorhouse.[75] The \\"Battle of the Braes\\" involved a demonstration against a lack of access to land and the serving of eviction notices. The incident involved numerous crofters and about 50 police officers. This event was instrumental in the creation of the Napier Commission, which reported in 1884 on the situation in the Highlands. Disturbances continued until the passing of the 1886 Crofters' Act and on one occasion 400 marines were deployed on Skye to maintain order.[76] The ruins of cleared villages can still be seen at Lorgill, Boreraig and Suisnish in Strath Swordale,[75][77] and Tusdale on Minginish.[71][78]\\r\\nAs with many Scottish islands, Skye's population peaked in the 19th century and then declined under the impact of the Clearances and the military losses in the First World War. From the 19th century until 1975 Skye was part of the county of Inverness-shire but the crofting economy languished and according to Slesser, \\"Generations of UK governments have treated the island people contemptuously.\\"[80] a charge that has been levelled at both Labour and Conservative administrations' policies in the Highlands and Islands.[81][Note 6] By 1971 the population was less than a third of its peak recorded figure in 1841. However, the number of residents then grew by over 28 per cent in the thirty years to 2001.[16]\\r\\nThe changing relationship between the residents and the land is evidenced by Robert Carruthers's remark circa 1852 that, \\"There is now a village in Portree containing three hundred inhabitants.\\" Even if this estimate is inexact the population of the island's largest settlement has probably increased sixfold or more since then.[34] During the period the total number of island residents has declined by 50 per cent or more.[16][Note 7]\\r\\nThe island-wide population increase of 4 per cent between 1991 and 2001 occurred against the background of an overall reduction in Scottish island populations of 3 per cent for the same period.[11] By 2011 the population had risen a further 8.4% to 10,008[6] with Scottish island populations as a whole growing by 4% to 103,702.[85]\\r\\nHistorically, Skye was overwhelmingly Gaelic-speaking, but this changed between 1921 and 2001. In both the 1901 and 1921 censuses, all Skye parishes were more than 75 per cent Gaelic-speaking. By 1971, only Kilmuir parish had more than three quarters Gaelic speakers while the rest of Skye ranged between 50 and 74 per cent. At that time, Kilmuir was the only area outside the Western Isles that had such a high proportion of Gaelic speakers.[86] In the 2001 census Kilmuir had just under half Gaelic speakers, and overall, Skye had 31 per cent, distributed unevenly. The strongest Gaelic areas were in the north and south-west of the island, including Staffin at 61 per cent. The weakest areas were in the west and east (e.g. Luib 23 per cent and Kylerhea 19 per cent). Other areas on Skye ranged between 48 per cent and 25 per cent.[86]\\r\\nIn terms of local government, from 1975 to 1996, Skye, along with the neighbouring mainland area of Lochalsh, constituted a local government district within the Highland administrative area. In 1996 the district was included into the unitary Highland Council, (Comhairle na Gidhealtachd) based in Inverness and formed one of the new council's area committees.[88][89] Following the 2007 elections, Skye now forms a four-member ward called Eilean a' Che; it is currently represented by two independents, one Scottish National Party, and one Liberal Democrat councillor.[89]\\r\\nSkye is in the Highlands and Islands electoral region and comprises a part of the Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch constituency of the Scottish Parliament, which elects one member under the first past the post basis to represent it. Kate Forbes is the current MSP for the SNP.[90] In addition, Skye forms part of the wider Ross, Skye and Lochaber constituency, which elects one member to the House of Commons in Westminster. The present MP Member of Parliament is Ian Blackford of the Scottish National Party, who took office after the SNP's sweep in the General Election of 2015. Prior to this, Charles Kennedy, a Liberal Democrat, had represented the area since the 1983 general election.[87]\\r\\nThe largest employer on the island and its environs is the public sector, which accounts for about a third of the total workforce, principally in administration, education and health. The second largest employer in the area is the distribution, hotels and restaurants sector, highlighting the importance of tourism. Key attractions include Dunvegan Castle, the Clan Donald Visitor Centre, and The Aros Experience arts and exhibition centre in Portree.[91] There are about a dozen large landowners on Skye, the largest being the public sector, with the Scottish Government owning most of the northern part of the island.[92][93] Glendale is a community-owned estate in Duirinish and the Sleat Community Trust, the local development trust, is active in various regeneration projects.[94][95][96]\\r\\nSmall firms dominate employment in the private sector. The Talisker Distillery, which produces a single malt whisky, is beside Loch Harport on the west coast of the island. Three other whiskiesMac na Mara (\\"son of the sea\\"), T Bheag nan Eilean (\\"wee dram of the isles\\") and Poit Dhubh (\\"black pot\\")are produced by blender Prban na Linne (\\"smugglers den by the Sound of Sleat\\"), based at Eilean Iarmain.[97][98] These are marketed using predominantly Gaelic-language labels. The blended whisky branded as \\"Isle of Skye\\" is produced not on the island but by the Glengoyne Distillery at Killearn north of Glasgow, though the website of the owners, Ian Macleod Distillers Ltd., boasts a \\"high proportion of Island malts\\" and contains advertisements for tourist businesses in the island. There is also an established software presence on Skye, with Portree-based Sitekit having expanded in recent years.[99]\\r\\nCrofting is still important, but although there are about 2,000 crofts on Skye only 100 or so are large enough to enable a crofter to earn a livelihood entirely from the land.[100] Cod and herring stocks have declined but commercial fishing remains important, especially fish farming of salmon and shellfish such as scampi.[101] The west coast of Scotland has a considerable renewable energy potential and the Isle of Skye Renewables Co-op has recently bought a stake in the Ben Aketil wind farm near Dunvegan.[102][103] There is a thriving arts and crafts sector.[104]\\r\\nThe unemployment rate in the area tends to be higher than in the Highlands as a whole, and is seasonal in nature, in part due to the impact of tourism. The population is growing and in common with many other scenic rural areas in Scotland, significant increases are expected in the percentage of the population aged 45 to 64 years.[105]\\r\\nSkye is linked to the mainland by the Skye Bridge, while ferries sail from Armadale on the island to Mallaig, and from Kylerhea to Glenelg. Ferries also run from Uig to Tarbert on Harris and Lochmaddy on North Uist, and from Sconser to Raasay.[16][106]\\r\\nThe Skye Bridge opened in 1995 under a private finance initiative and the high tolls charged (S5.70 each way for summer visitors) met with widespread opposition, spearheaded by the pressure group SKAT (Skye and Kyle Against Tolls). On 21 December 2004 it was announced that the Scottish Executive had purchased the bridge from its owners and the tolls were immediately removed.[107]\\r\\nBus services run to Inverness and Glasgow, and there are local services on the island, mainly starting from Portree or Broadford. Train services run from Kyle of Lochalsh at the mainland end of the Skye Bridge to Inverness, as well as from Glasgow to Mallaig from where the ferry can be caught to Armadale.[108]\\r\\nThe Isle of Skye Airfield at Ashaig, near Broadford, is used by private aircraft and occasionally by NHS Highland and the Scottish Ambulance Service for transferring patients to hospitals on the mainland.[109]\\r\\nThe A87 trunk road traverses the island from the Skye Bridge to Uig, linking most of the major settlements. Many of the island's roads have been widened in the past forty years although there are still substantial sections of single track road.[4][16]\\r\\nStudents of Scottish Gaelic travel from all over the world to attend Sabhal Mr Ostaig, the Scottish Gaelic college based near Kilmore in Sleat.[110] In addition to members of the Church of Scotland and a smaller number of Roman Catholics many residents of Skye belong to the Free Church of Scotland, known for its strict observance of the Sabbath.[Note 8]\\r\\nSkye has a strong folk music tradition, although in recent years dance and rock music have been growing in popularity on the island. Gaelic folk rock band Runrig started in Skye and former singer Donnie Munro still works on the island.[112] Runrig's second single and a concert staple is entitled Skye, the lyrics being partly in English and partly in Gaelic[113] and they have released other songs such as \\"Nightfall on Marsco\\" that were inspired by the island.[114] Celtic fusion band the Peatbog Faeries are based on Skye.[115] Jethro Tull singer Ian Anderson owned an estate at Strathaird on Skye at one time.[116] Several Tull songs are written about Skye, including Dun Ringil, Broadford Bazaar, and Acres Wild (which contains the lines \\"Come with me to the Winged Isle, / Northern father's western child...\\" in reference to the island itself).[117] The Isle of Skye Music Festival featured sets from The Fun Lovin' Criminals and Sparks, but collapsed in 2007.[118][119] Electronic musician Mylo was born on Skye.[120]\\r\\nThe poet Sorley MacLean, a native of the Isle of Raasay, which lies off the island's east coast, lived much of his life on Skye.[121] The island has been immortalised in the traditional song \\"The Skye Boat Song\\" and is the notional setting for the novel To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf, although the Skye of the novel bears little relation to the real island.[122] John Buchan's descriptions of Skye, as featured in his Richard Hannay novel Mr Standfast, are more true to life.[123] I Diari di Rubha Hunis is a 2004 Italian language work of non-fiction by Davide Sapienza. The international bestseller, The Ice Twins, by S K Tremayne, published around the world in 2015√ø2016, is set in southern Skye, especially around the settlement and islands of Isleornsay.\\r\\nSkye has been used as a location for a number of feature films. The Ashaig aerodrome was used for the opening scenes of the 1980 film Flash Gordon.[109] Stardust, released in 2007 and starring Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer, featured scenes near Uig, Loch Coruisk and the Quiraing.[125][126][127] Another 2007 film, Seachd: The Inaccessible Pinnacle, was shot almost entirely in various locations on the island.[128] Some of the opening scenes in Ridley Scott's 2012 feature film Prometheus were shot and set at the Old Man of Storr.[124] In 1973 The Highlands and Islands - a Royal Tour, a documentary about Prince Charles's visit to the Highlands and Islands, directed by Oscar Marzaroli, was shot partly on Skye.[129]\\r\\nThe West Highland Free Press is published at Broadford. This weekly newspaper takes as its motto An Tr, an Cnan 's na Daoine (\\"The Land, the Language and the People\\"), which reflects its radical, campaigning priorities. The Free Press was founded in 1972 and circulates in Skye, Wester Ross and the Outer Hebrides.[130] Shinty is a popular sport played throughout the island and Portree-based Skye Camanachd won the Camanachd Cup in 1990.[131]\\r\\nThe Hebrides generally lack the biodiversity of mainland Britain,[132] but like most of the larger islands, Skye still has a wide variety of species. Observing the abundance of game birds Martin wrote:\\r\\nThere is plenty of land and water fowl in this isleas hawks, eagles of two kinds (the one grey and of a larger size, the other much less and black, but more destructive to young cattle), black cock, heath-hen, plovers, pigeons, wild geese, ptarmigan, and cranes. Of this latter sort I have seen sixty on the shore in a flock together. The sea fowls are malls of all kindscoulterneb, guillemot, sea cormorant, &c. The natives observe that the latter, if perfectly black, makes no good broth, nor is its flesh worth eating; but that a cormorant, which hath any white feathers or down, makes good broth, and the flesh of it is good food; and the broth is usually drunk by nurses to increase their milk.\\r\\nSimilarly, Samuel Johnson noted that:\\r\\nAt the tables where a stranger is received, neither plenty nor delicacy is wanting. A tract of land so thinly inhabited, must have much wild-fowl; and I scarcely remember to have seen a dinner without them. The moor-game is every where to be had. That the sea abounds with fish, needs not be told, for it supplies a great part of Europe. The Isle of Sky has stags and roebucks, but no hares. They sell very numerous droves of oxen yearly to England, and therefore cannot be supposed to want beef at home. Sheep and goats are in great numbers, and they have the common domestic fowls.\\"\\r\\nIn the modern era avian life includes the corncrake, red-throated diver, kittiwake, tystie, Atlantic puffin, goldeneye and golden eagle. The eggs of the last breeding pair of white-tailed sea eagle in the UK were taken by an egg collector on Skye in 1916 but the species has recently been re-introduced.[134] The chough last bred on the island in 1900.[135][136] Mountain hare (apparently absent in the 18th century) and rabbit are now abundant and preyed upon by wild cat and pine marten.[137] The rich fresh water streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew.[138][139] Offshore the edible crab and edible oyster are also found, the latter especially in the Sound of Scalpay.[140][141] There are nationally important horse mussel and brittlestar beds in the sea lochs[142] and in 2012 a bed of 100 million flame shells was found during a survey of Loch Alsh.[143] Grey Seals can be seen off the Southern coast.\\r\\nHeather moor containing ling, bell heather, cross-leaved heath, bog myrtle and fescues is everywhere abundant. The high Black Cuillins weather too slowly to produce a soil that sustains a rich plant life, but each of the main peninsulas has an individual flora. The basalt underpinnings of Trotternish produce a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal. The low-lying fields of Waternish contain corn marigold and corn spurry. The sea cliffs of Duirinish boast mountain avens and fir clubmoss. Minginish produces fairy flax, cats-ear and black bog rush.[144] There is a fine example of Brachypodium-rich ash woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating silver birch, hazel, bird cherry, and hawthorn.[145]\\r\\nThe local Biodiversity Action Plan recommends land management measures to control the spread of ragwort and bracken and identifies four non-native, invasive species as threatening native biodiversity: Japanese knotweed, rhododendron, New Zealand flatworm and mink. It also identifies problems of over-grazing resulting in the impoverishment of moorland and upland habitats and a loss of native woodland, caused by the large numbers of red deer and sheep.[146]","input":"What is the main town in the isle of skye?"},{"output":"18 to 20 January 1788","context":"The First Fleet is the name given to the 11 ships that left England on 13 May 1787 to found the penal colony that became the first European settlement in Australia. The Fleet consisted of two Royal Navy vessels, three store ships and six convict transports, carrying between 1,000 and 1,500 convicts, marines, seamen, civil officers and free people (accounts differ on the numbers), and a vast quantity of stores. From England, the Fleet sailed southwest to Rio de Janeiro, then east to Cape Town and via the Great Southern Ocean to Botany Bay, arriving over the period of 18 to 20 January 1788, taking 250 to 252 days from departure to final arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConvicts were originally transported to the Thirteen Colonies in North America, but after the American War of Independence ended in 1783, the newly formed United States refused to accept further convicts.[1] On 6 December 1785, Orders in Council were issued in London for the establishment of a penal colony in New South Wales, on land claimed for Britain by explorer James Cook in his first voyage to the Pacific in 1770.[2][3]\\r\\nThe First Fleet was commanded by Commodore Arthur Phillip, who was given instructions authorising him to make regulations and land grants in the colony.[4] The ships arrived at Botany Bay between 18 January and 20 January 1788:[5] HMS Supply arrived on 18 January, Alexander, Scarborough and Friendship arrived on 19 January, and the remaining ships on 20 January.[6][7]\\r\\nThe cost to Britain of outfitting and despatching the Fleet was S84,000[8] (about S9.6 million as of 2015).[9]\\r\\nThe First Fleet included two Royal Navy escort ships, the ten-gun sixth-rate vessel HMS?Sirius under the command of Captain John Hunter, and the armed tender HMS?Supply commanded by Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball.\\r\\nRopes, crockery, agricultural equipment and a miscellany of other stores were needed. Items transported included tools, agricultural implements, seeds, spirits, medical supplies, bandages, surgical instruments, handcuffs, leg irons and a prefabricated wooden frame for the colony's first Government House.[12] The party had to rely on its own provisions to survive until it could make use of local materials, assuming suitable supplies existed, and grow its own food and raise livestock.\\r\\nScale models of all the ships are on display at the Museum of Sydney. The models were built by ship makers Lynne and Laurie Hadley, after researching the original plans, drawings and British archives. The replicas of the Supply, Charlotte, Scarborough, Friendship, Prince of Wales, Lady Penrhyn, Borrowdale, Alexander, Sirius?(1786), Fishburn and Golden Grove are made from Western Red or Syrian Cedar.[13]\\r\\nNine Sydney harbour ferries built in the mid-1980s are named after First Fleet vessels. The unused names are Lady Penrhyn and Prince of Wales.\\r\\nThe people of the fleet included seamen, marines and their families, government officials, and a large number of convicts, including women and children. The majority were British, but there were also African, American and French convicts on board.[14][15] The convicts had committed a variety of crimes, including theft, perjury, fraud, assault, and robbery, for which they had variously been sentenced to penal transportation for 7 years, 14 years, or the term of their natural life.[16][17]\\r\\nThe six convict transports each had a detachment of marines on board. Most of the families of the marines traveled aboard the Prince of Wales.[18] A number of people on the First Fleet kept diaries and journals of their experiences, including the surgeons. There are twelve known journals in existence as well as some letters.[19]\\r\\nThe exact number of people directly associated with the First Fleet will likely never be established, as accounts of the event vary slightly. A total of 1,420 people have been identified as embarking on the First Fleet in 1787, and 1,373 are believed to have landed at Sydney Cove in January 1788. In her biographical dictionary of the First Fleet, Mollie Gillen gives the following statistics:[20]\\r\\nWhile the names of all crew members of Sirius and Supply are known, the six transports and three storeships may have carried as many as 110 more seamen than have been identified √ø no complete musters have survived for these ships. The total number of persons embarking on the First Fleet would, therefore, be approximately 1,530 with about 1,483 reaching Sydney Cove.\\r\\nOther sources indicate that the passengers consisted of 10 civil officers, 212 marines, including officers, 28 wives and 17 children of the marines, 81 free people, 504 male convicts and 192 female convicts; making the total number of free people 348 and the total number of prisoners 696, coming to a grand total of 1,044 people.\\r\\nAccording to the first census of 1788 as reported by Governor Phillip to Lord Sydney, the white population of the colony was 1,030 and the colony also consisted of 7 horses, 29 sheep, 74 swine, 6 rabbits, and 7 cattle.[21]\\r\\nThe following statistics were provided by Governor Phillip:[22]\\r\\nDavid Collins' book An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales gives the following details:[23]\\r\\nThe Alexander, of 453 tons, had on board 192 male convicts; 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 29 privates, with 1 assistant surgeon to the colony.\\r\\nThe Scarborough, of 418 tons, had on board 205 male convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 26 privates, with 1 assistant surgeon to the colony.\\r\\nThe Charlotte, of 346 tons, had on board 89 male and 20 female convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 3 corporals, 1 drummer, and 35 privates, with the principal surgeon of the colony.\\r\\nThe Lady Penrhyn, of 338 tons, had on board 101 female convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, and 3 privates, with a person acting as a surgeon's mate.\\r\\nThe Prince of Wales, of 334 tons, had on board 2 male and 50 female convicts; 2 lieutenants, 3 sergeants, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 24 privates, with the surveyor-general of the colony.\\r\\nThe Friendship,  of 228 tons, had on board 76 male and 21 female convicts; 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 3 corporals, 1 drummer, and 36 privates, with 1 assistant surgeon to the colony.\\r\\nThere were on board, beside these, 28 women, 8 male and 6 female children, belonging to the soldiers of the detachment, together with 6 male and 7 female children belonging to the convicts.\\r\\nThe Fishburn store-ship was of 378 tons; the Borrowdale of 272 tons; and the Golden Grove of 331 tons. Golden Grove carried the chaplain for the colony, with his wife and a servant.\\r\\nNot only these store-ships, but the men of war and transports were laden with provisions, implements of agriculture, camp equipage, clothing for the convicts, baggage, etc.\\r\\nThe Sirius carried as supernumeraries, the major commandant of the corps of marines embarked in the transports* [*This officer was also lieutenant-governor of the colony], the adjutant and quarter-master, the judge-advocate of the settlement, and the commissary; with one sergeant, three drummers, seven privates, four women, and a few artificers.\\r\\nThe chief surgeon for the First Fleet, John White, reported a total of 48 deaths and 28 births during the voyage. The deaths during the voyage included one marine, one marine's wife, one marine's child, 36 male convicts, four female convicts, and five children of convicts.[24]\\r\\nThe First Fleet left Portsmouth, England on 13 May 1787.[25] The journey began with fine weather, and thus the convicts were allowed on deck.[26] The Fleet was accompanied by the armed frigate Hyena until it left English waters.[27] On 20 May 1787, one convict on the Scarborough reported a planned mutiny; those allegedly involved were flogged and two were transferred to Prince of Wales.[27] In general, however, most accounts of the voyage agree that the convicts were well behaved.[27] On 3 June 1787, the fleet anchored at Santa Cruz at Tenerife.[25] Here, fresh water, vegetables and meat were brought on board. Phillip and the chief officers were entertained by the local governor, while one convict tried unsuccessfully to escape.[28] On 10 June they set sail to cross the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro,[25] taking advantage of favourable trade winds and ocean currents.\\r\\nThe weather became increasingly hot and humid as the Fleet sailed through the tropics. Vermin, such as rats, and parasites such as bedbugs, lice, cockroaches and fleas, tormented the convicts, officers and marines. Bilges became foul and the smell, especially below the closed hatches, was over-powering.[29] While Phillip gave orders that the bilge-water was to be pumped out daily and the bilges cleaned, these orders were not followed on the Alexander and a number of convicts fell sick and died.[29] Tropical rainstorms meant that the convicts could not exercise on deck as they had no change of clothes and no method of drying wet clothing.[29] Consequently, they were kept below in the foul, cramped holds. On the female transports, promiscuity between the convicts, the crew and marines was rampant, despite punishments for some of the men involved.[29] In the doldrums, Phillip was forced to ration the water to three pints a day.[29]\\r\\nThe Fleet reached Rio de Janeiro on 5 August and stayed for a month.[25] The ships were cleaned and water taken on board, repairs were made, and Phillip ordered large quantities of food.[26] The women convicts' clothing had become infested with lice and was burnt. As additional clothing for the female convicts had not arrived before the Fleet left England,[26] the women were issued with new clothes made from rice sacks. While the convicts remained below deck, the officers explored the city and were entertained by its inhabitants.[30] A convict and a marine were punished for passing forged quarter-dollars made from old buckles and pewter spoons.\\r\\nThe Fleet left Rio de Janeiro on 4 September to run before the westerlies to the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa, which it reached on 13 October.[31] This was the last port of call, so the main task was to stock up on plants, seeds and livestock for their arrival in Australia.[32] The livestock taken on board from the Cape of Good Hope destined for the new colony included two bulls, seven cows, one stallion, three mares, 44 sheep, 32 pigs, four goats and \\"a very large quantity of poultry of every kind\\".[33] Women convicts on the Friendship were moved to other transports to make room for livestock purchased there. The convicts were provided with fresh beef and mutton, bread and vegetables, to build up their strength for the journey and maintain their health.[32] The Dutch colony of Cape Town was the last outpost of European settlement which the fleet members would see for years, perhaps for the rest of their lives. \\"Before them stretched the awesome, lonely void of the Indian and Southern Oceans, and beyond that lay nothing they could imagine.\\"[34]\\r\\nAssisted by the gales in the \\"Roaring Forties\\" latitudes below the 40th parallel, the heavily laden transports surged through the violent seas. In the last two months of the voyage, the Fleet faced challenging conditions, spending some days becalmed and on others covering significant distances; the Friendship travelled 166 miles one day, while a seaman was blown from the Prince of Wales at night and drowned.[35] Water was rationed as supplies ran low, and the supply of other goods including wine ran out altogether on some vessels.[35] Van Diemen's Land was sighted from the Friendship on 4 January 1788.[35] A freak storm struck as they began to head north around the island, damaging the sails and masts of some of the ships.\\r\\nOn 25 November, Phillip had transferred to the Supply. With Alexander, Friendship and Scarborough, the fastest ships in the Fleet, which were carrying most of the male convicts, the Supply hastened ahead to prepare for the arrival of the rest. Phillip intended to select a suitable location, find good water, clear the ground, and perhaps even have some huts and other structures built before the others arrived. This was a planned move, discussed by the Home Office and the Admiralty prior to the Fleet's departure.[36] However, this \\"flying squadron\\" reached Botany Bay only hours before the rest of the Fleet, so no preparatory work was possible.[37] Supply reached Botany Bay on 18 January 1788; the three fastest transports in the advance group arrived on 19 January; slower ships, including Sirius, arrived on 20 January.[38]\\r\\nThis was one of the world's greatest sea voyages √ø eleven vessels carrying about 1,487 people and stores[33] had travelled for 252 days for more than 15,000 miles (24,000?km) without losing a ship. Forty-eight people died on the journey, a death rate of just over three per cent.\\r\\nIt was soon realised that Botany Bay did not live up to the glowing account that the explorer Captain James Cook had provided.[39] The bay was open and unprotected, the water was too shallow to allow the ships to anchor close to the shore, fresh water was scarce, and the soil was poor.[40] First contact was made with the local indigenous people, the Eora, who seemed curious but suspicious of the newcomers. The area was studded with enormously strong trees. When the convicts tried to cut them down, their tools broke and the tree trunks had to be blasted out of the ground with gunpowder. The primitive huts built for the officers and officials quickly collapsed in rainstorms. The marines had a habit of getting drunk and not guarding the convicts properly, whilst their commander, Major Robert Ross, drove Phillip to despair with his arrogant and lazy attitude. Crucially, Phillip worried that his fledgling colony was exposed to attack from Aborigines or foreign powers. Although his initial instructions were to establish the colony at Botany Bay, he was authorised to establish the colony elsewhere if necessary.[41]\\r\\nOn 21 January, Phillip and a party which included John Hunter, departed the Bay in three small boats to explore other bays to the north.[43] Phillip discovered that Port Jackson, about 12 kilometres to the north, was an excellent site for a colony with sheltered anchorages, fresh water and fertile soil.[43] Cook had seen and named the harbour, but had not entered it.[43] Phillip's impressions of the harbour were recorded in a letter he sent to England later: \\"the finest harbour in the world, in which a thousand sail of the line may ride in the most perfect security ...\\". The party returned to Botany Bay on 23 January.[43]\\r\\nOn the morning of 24 January, the party was startled when two French ships were seen just outside Botany Bay. This was a scientific expedition led by Jean-Fran?ois de La Prouse. The French had expected to find a thriving colony where they could repair ships and restock supplies, not a newly arrived fleet of convicts considerably more poorly provisioned than themselves.[44] There was some cordial contact between the French and British officers, but Phillip and La Prouse never met. The French ships remained until 10 March before setting sail on their return voyage. They were not seen again and were later discovered to have been shipwrecked off the coast of Vanikoro in the present-day Solomon Islands.[45]\\r\\nOn 26 January 1788, the Fleet weighed anchor and sailed to Port Jackson.[25] The site selected for the anchorage had deep water close to the shore, was sheltered, and had a small stream flowing into it. Phillip named it Sydney Cove, after Lord Sydney the British Home Secretary.[43] This date is celebrated as Australia Day, marking the beginning of British settlement.[46] The British flag was planted and formal possession taken. This was done by Phillip and some officers and marines from the Supply, with the remainder of Supply's crew and the convicts observing from on board ship. The remaining ships of the Fleet did not arrive at Sydney Cove until later that day.[47]\\r\\nThe First Fleet encountered indigenous Australians when they landed at Botany Bay. The Cadigal people of the Botany Bay area witnessed the Fleet arrive and six days later the two ships of French explorer La Prouse sailed into the bay.[48] When the Fleet moved to Sydney Cove seeking better conditions for establishing the colony, they encountered the Eora people, including the Bidjigal clan. A number of the First Fleet journals record encounters with Aboriginal people.[49]\\r\\nAlthough the official policy of the British Government was to establish friendly relations with Aboriginal people,[41] and Arthur Phillip ordered that the Aboriginal people should be well treated, it was not long before conflict began. The colonists did not sign treaties with the original inhabitants of the land.[50] Between 1790 and 1810, Pemulwuy of the Bidjigal clan led the local people in a series of attacks against the British colonisers.[51]\\r\\nThe ships of the First Fleet mostly did not remain in the colony. Some returned to England, while others left for other ports. Some remained at the service of the Governor of the colony for some months: some of these were sent to Norfolk Island where a second penal colony was established.\\r\\n1788\\r\\n1789\\r\\n1790:\\r\\nOn 26 January 1842, the Colonial Government in Sydney awarded a life pension of 1 shilling a day to three surviving members of the First Fleet. The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser reported, on Saturday 29 January 1842: \\"The Government have ordered a pension of one shilling per diem to be paid to the survivors of those who came by the first vessel into the Colony. The number of these really 'old hands' is now reduced to three, of whom, two are now in the Benevolent Asylum, and the other is a fine hale old fellow, who can do a day's work with more spirit than many of the young fellows lately arrived in the Colony.\\"[53] The names of the three recipients are not given.\\r\\nWilliam Hubbard: Hubbard was convicted in the Kingston Assizes in Surrey, England, on 24 March 1784 for theft.[54] He was transported to Australia on the Scarborough in the First Fleet. He married Mary Goulding on 19 December 1790 in Rose Hill. In 1803 he received a land grant of 70 acres at Mulgrave Place. He died on 18 May 1843 at the Sydney Benevolent Asylum. His age was given as 76 when he was buried at Christ Church St. Lawrence, Sydney on 22 May 1843.\\r\\nJohn McCarthy: McCarthy was a Marine who sailed on the Friendship.[55] McCarthy was born in Killarney, County Kerry, Ireland, circa Christmas 1745. He first served in the colony of New South Wales, then at Norfolk Island where he took up a land grant of 60 acres (Lot 110). He married the first fleet convict Ann Beardsley on Norfolk Island in November 1791 after his discharge a month earlier. In 1808, on the close of Norfolk Island settlement, he resettled in Van Diemen's Land and later took a land grant (80 acres at Melville) in lieu of the one forfeited on Norfolk Island. The last few years of his life were spent at the home of his granddaughter and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. William H. Budd, at a place called Kinlochewe Inn near Donnybrook, Victoria. McCarthy died on 24 July 1846,[56] six months past his 100 birthday.\\r\\nJohn Limeburner: The South Australian Register reported, in an article dated Wednesday 3 November 1847: \\"John Limeburner, the oldest colonist in Sydney, died in September last, at the advanced age of 104 years. He helped to pitch the first tent in Sydney, and remembered the first display of the British flag there, which was hoisted on a swamp oak-tree, then growing on a spot now occupied as the Water-Police Court. He was the last of those called the 'first-fleeters' (arrivals by the first convict ships) and, notwithstanding his great age, retained his faculties to the last.\\"[57] John Limeburner was a convict on the Charlotte. He was convicted on 9 July 1785 at New Sarum, Wiltshire of theft of a waistcoat, a shirt and stockings.[58] He married Elizabeth Ireland in 1790 at Rosehill and together they establish a 50-acre farm at Prospect.[59] He died at Ashfield in September 1847 and is buried at St John's, Ashfield.\\r\\nJohn Jones: Jones was a Marine on the First Fleet and sailed on the Alexander. He is listed in the N.S.W. 1828 Census as aged 82 and living at the Sydney Benevolent Asylum.[60] He is said to have died at the Benevolent Asylum in 1848.[61]\\r\\nSamuel King: King was a scribbler (a worker in a scribbling mill[62]) before he became a Marine. He was a Marine with the First Fleet on board the flagship Sirius?(1786).[63] He shipped to Norfolk Island on Golden Grove in September 1788, where he lived with Mary Rolt, a convict who arrived with the First Fleet on the Prince of Wales. He received a grant of 60 acres (Lot No. 13) at Cascade Stream in 1791. Mary Rolt returned to England on the Britannia in October 1796. King was resettled in Van Diemen's Land, boarding the City of Edinburgh on 3 September 1808, and landed in Hobart on 3 October.[64] He married Elizabeth Thackery on 28 January 1810. He died on 21 October 1849 at 86 years of age and was buried in the Wesleyan cemetery at Lawitta Road, Back River.\\r\\nJohn Small: Convicted 14 March 1785 at the Devon Lent Assizes held at Exeter for Robbery King's Highway. Sentenced to hang, reprieved to 7 years transportation. Arrived on the Charlotte in First Fleet 1788. Certificate of freedom 1792. Land Grant 1794, 30 acre \\"Small's Farm\\" at Eastern Farms (Ryde). Married October 1788 Mary Parker also a First Fleet convict who arrived on Lady Penrhyn. John Small died on 2 October 1850 at age of 90 years.[65][66]\\r\\nElizabeth Thackery: Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" King (ne Thackery) was tried and convicted of theft on 4 May 1786 at Manchester Quarter Sessions, and sentenced to seven years transportation. She sailed on the Friendship, but was transferred to the Charlotte at the Cape of Good Hope. She was shipped to Norfolk Island on the Sirius?(1786) in 1790 and lived there with James Dodding. In August 1800 she bought 10 acres of land from Samuel King at Cascade Stream. Elizabeth and James were relocated to Van Diemen's Land in December 1807[67] but parted company sometime afterwards. On 28 January 1810 Elizabeth married \\"First Fleeter\\" Private Samuel King (above) and lived with him until his death in 1849. Betty King died in New Norfolk, Tasmania on 7 August 1856, aged 89 years. She is buried in the churchyard of the Methodist Chapel, Lawitta Road, Back River, next to her husband, and the marked grave bears a First Fleet plaque. She was one of the first British women to land in Australia and was the last \\"First Fleeter\\" to die.\\r\\nHistorians have disagreed over whether those aboard the First Fleet were responsible for introducing smallpox to Australia's indigenous population, and if so, whether this was the consequence of deliberate action.\\r\\nIn 1914, J.?H.?L. Cumpston, director of the Australian Quarantine Service put forward the hypothesis that smallpox arrived with British settlers.[68] Some researchers have argued that any such release may have been a deliberate attempt to decimate the indigenous population.[69][70] Others have suggested that live smallpox virus may have been introduced accidentally, when Aboriginal people came into contact with variolous matter brought by the First Fleet for use in anti-smallpox inoculations.[71][72][73] Hypothetical scenarios for such an action might have included: an act of revenge by an aggrieved individual, a response to attacks by indigenous people,[74] or part of an orchestrated assault by the New South Wales Marine Corps, intended to clear the path for colonial expansion.[75][76]\\r\\nOther historians have disputed the idea that there was a deliberate release of smallpox virus and/or suggest that it arrived with visitors to Australia other than the First Fleet.[77][78][79][80][81] In 2002, historian Judy Campbell suggested that smallpox had arrived in Australia through contact with fishermen from Makassar in Indonesia, where smallpox was endemic.[79][82] In 2011, Macknight stated: The overwhelming probability must be that it [smallpox] was introduced, like the later epidemics, by [Indonesian] trepangers ... and spread across the continent to arrive in Sydney quite independently of the new settlement there.[83]\\r\\nThere is a third theory, that the 1789 epidemic was not smallpox but chickenpox √ø to which indigenous Australians also had no inherited resistance √ø that happened to be affecting, or was carried by, members of the First Fleet.[84][85] This theory has also been disputed.[86][87]\\r\\nAfter Ray Collins, a stonemason, completed years of research into the First Fleet, he sought approval from about nine councils to construct a commemorative garden in recognition of these immigrants. Liverpool Plains Shire Council was ultimately the only council to accept his offer to supply the materials and construct the garden free of charge. The site chosen was a disused caravan park on the banks of Quirindi Creek at Wallabadah, New South Wales. In September 2002 Collins commenced work on the project. Additional support was later provided by Neil McGarry in the form of some signs and the council contributed $28,000 for pathways and fencing. Collins hand-chiseled the names of all those who came to Australia on the eleven ships in 1788 on stone tablets along the garden pathways. The stories of those who arrived on the ships, their life, and first encounters with the Australian country are presented throughout the garden.[88] On 26 January 2005, the First Fleet Garden was opened as the major memorial to the First Fleet immigrants. Previously the only other specific memorial to the First Fleeters was an obelisk at Brighton-Le-Sands, New South Wales.[89] The surrounding area has a barbecue, tables, and amenities.","input":"When did the first fleet land on australia?"},{"output":"20 primary","context":"The human teeth function to mechanically break down items of food by cutting and crushing them in preparation for swallowing and digesting. Humans have four types of teeth: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, each with a specific function. The incisors cut the food, the canines tear the food and the molars and premolars crush the food. The roots of teeth are embedded in the maxilla (upper jaw) or the mandible (lower jaw) and are covered by gums. Teeth are made of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness.\\r\\nTeeth are among the most distinctive (and long-lasting) features of mammal species. Humans, like other mammals, are diphyodont, meaning that they develop two sets of teeth. The first set (called the \\"baby\\", \\"milk\\", \\"primary\\", or \\"deciduous\\" set) normally starts to appear at about six months of age, although some babies are born with one or more visible teeth, known as natal teeth. Normal tooth eruption at about six months is known as teething and can be painful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDental anatomy is a field of anatomy dedicated to the study of tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though dental occlusion, or contact between teeth, does not. Dental anatomy is also a taxonomic science as it is concerned with the naming of teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.\\r\\nThe anatomic crown of a tooth is the area covered in enamel above the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) or \\"neck\\" of the tooth.[1][2] Most of the crown is composed of dentin (dentine in British English) with the pulp chamber inside.[3] The crown is within bone before eruption.[4] After eruption, it is almost always visible. The anatomic root is found below the CEJ and is covered with cementum. As with the crown, dentin composes most of the root, which normally has pulp canals. A tooth may have multiple roots or just one root (single-rooted teeth). Canines and most premolars, except for maxillary first premolars, usually have one root. Maxillary first premolars and mandibular molars usually have two roots. Maxillary molars usually have three roots. Additional roots are referred to as supernumerary roots.\\r\\nHumans usually have 20 primary (deciduous, \\"baby\\" or \\"milk\\") teeth and 32 permanent (adult) teeth. Teeth are classified as incisors, canines, premolars (also called bicuspids),[5] and molars. Incisors are primarily used for biting pieces from foods such as raw carrots or apples and peeled but uncut bananas, while molars are used primarily for grinding foods after they are already in bite size pieces inside the mouth.\\r\\nMost teeth have identifiable features that distinguish them from others. There are several different notation systems to refer to a specific tooth. The three most common systems are the FDI World Dental Federation notation, the universal numbering system, and Palmer notation method. The FDI system is used worldwide, and the universal is used widely in the United States.\\r\\nAmong deciduous (primary) teeth, ten are found in the maxilla (upper jaw) and ten in the mandible (lower jaw), for a total of 20. The dental formula for primary teeth is 2.1.0.22.1.0.2.\\r\\nIn the primary set of teeth, there are two types of incisors √ø centrals and laterals, and two types of molars √ø first and second. All primary teeth are normally later replaced with their permanent counterparts.\\r\\nAmong permanent teeth, 16 are found in the maxilla and 16 in the mandible, for a total of 32. The dental formula is 2.1.2.32.1.2.3.\\r\\nThe maxillary teeth are the maxillary central incisor, maxillary lateral incisor, maxillary canine, maxillary first premolar, maxillary second premolar, maxillary first molar, maxillary second molar, and maxillary third molar. The mandibular teeth are the mandibular central incisor, mandibular lateral incisor, mandibular canine, mandibular first premolar, mandibular second premolar, mandibular first molar, mandibular second molar, and mandibular third molar. Third molars are commonly called \\"wisdom teeth\\" and may never erupt into the mouth or form at all. If any additional teeth form, for example, fourth and fifth molars, which are rare, they are referred to as supernumerary teeth (hyperdontia).[6] Development of fewer than the usual number of teeth is called hypodontia.\\r\\nEnamel is the hardest and most highly mineralized substance of the body. It is one of the four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and dental pulp.[7] It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest.[8] The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ.[9] The wear rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors.[citation needed]\\r\\nEnamel's primary mineral is hydroxyapatite, which is a crystalline calcium phosphate.[10] The large amount of minerals in enamel accounts not only for its strength but also for its brittleness.[9] Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support.[10] Unlike dentin and bone, enamel does not contain collagen. Proteins of note in the development of enamel are ameloblastins, amelogenins, enamelins and tuftelins. It is believed that they aid in the development of enamel by serving as framework support, among other functions.[11]\\r\\nDentin is the substance between enamel or cementum and the pulp chamber. It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp.[12] The formation of dentin is known as dentinogenesis. The porous, yellow-hued material is made up of 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight.[13] Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but dentin still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.\\r\\nDentin is a mineralized connective tissue with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border.[14] The diameter of these tubules range from 2.5 m near the pulp, to 1.2 m in the midportion, and 900?nm near the dentino-enamel junction.[15] Although they may have tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other. Their length is dictated by the radius of the tooth. The three dimensional configuration of the dentinal tubules is genetically determined.\\r\\nCementum is a specialized bone like substance covering the root of a tooth.[12] It is approximately 45% inorganic material (mainly hydroxyapatite), 33% organic material (mainly collagen) and 22% water. Cementum is excreted by cementoblasts within the root of the tooth and is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is to serve as a medium by which the periodontal ligaments can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cementoenamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least ? of the root.[16] The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about ? of the root apex.[17]\\r\\nThe dental pulp is the central part of the tooth filled with soft connective tissue.[13] This tissue contains blood vessels and nerves that enter the tooth from a hole at the apex of the root.[18] Along the border between the dentin and the pulp are odontoblasts, which initiate the formation of dentin.[13] Other cells in the pulp include fibroblasts, preodontoblasts, macrophages and T lymphocytes.[19] The pulp is commonly called \\"the nerve\\" of the tooth.\\r\\nTooth development is the complex process by which teeth form from embryonic cells, grow, and erupt into the mouth. Although many diverse species have teeth, their development is largely the same as in humans. For human teeth to have a healthy oral environment, enamel, dentin, cementum, and the periodontium must all develop during appropriate stages of fetal development. Primary teeth start to form in the development of the embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks, and permanent teeth begin to form in the twentieth week.[20] If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.\\r\\nA significant amount of research has focused on determining the processes that initiate tooth development. It is widely accepted that there is a factor within the tissues of the first pharyngeal arch that is necessary for the development of teeth.[21]\\r\\nTooth development is commonly divided into the following stages: the bud stage, the cap, the bell, and finally maturation. The staging of tooth development is an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently it is difficult to decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing tooth.[21] This determination is further complicated by the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing tooth, which can appear to be different stages.\\r\\nThe tooth bud (sometimes called the tooth germ) is an aggregation of cells that eventually forms a tooth. It is organized into three parts: the enamel organ, the dental papilla and the dental follicle.[22] The enamel organ is composed of the outer enamel epithelium, inner enamel epithelium, stellate reticulum and stratum intermedium.[22] These cells give rise to ameloblasts, which produce enamel and the reduced enamel epithelium. The growth of cervical loop cells into the deeper tissues forms Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath, which determines a tooth's root shape. The dental papilla contains cells that develop into odontoblasts, which are dentin-forming cells.[22] Additionally, the junction between the dental papilla and inner enamel epithelium determines the crown shape of a tooth.[23] The dental follicle gives rise to three important cells: cementoblasts, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts. Cementoblasts form the cementum of a tooth. Osteoblasts give rise to the alveolar bone around the roots of teeth. Fibroblasts develop the periodontal ligaments which connect teeth to the alveolar bone through cementum.[24]\\r\\nTooth eruption in humans is a process in tooth development in which the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Current research indicates that the periodontal ligaments play an important role in tooth eruption. Primary teeth erupt into the mouth from around six months until two years of age. These teeth are the only ones in the mouth until a person is about six years old. At that time, the first permanent tooth erupts. This stage, during which a person has a combination of primary and permanent teeth, is known as the mixed stage. The mixed stage lasts until the last primary tooth is lost and the remaining permanent teeth erupt into the mouth.\\r\\nThere have been many theories about the cause of tooth eruption. One theory proposes that the developing root of a tooth pushes it into the mouth. Another, known as the cushioned hammock theory, resulted from microscopic study of teeth, which was thought to show a ligament around the root. It was later discovered that the \\"ligament\\" was merely an artifact created in the process of preparing the slide. Currently, the most widely held belief is that the periodontal ligaments provide the main impetus for the process.\\r\\nThe onset of primary tooth loss has been found to correlate strongly with somatic and psychological criteria of school readiness.[25][26][clarification needed]\\r\\nThe periodontium is the supporting structure of a tooth, helping to attach the tooth to surrounding tissues and to allow sensations of touch and pressure.[27] It consists of the cementum, periodontal ligaments, alveolar bone, and gingiva. Of these, cementum is the only one that is a part of a tooth. Periodontal ligaments connect the alveolar bone to the cementum. Alveolar bone surrounds the roots of teeth to provide support and creates what is commonly called an alveolus, or \\"socket\\". Lying over the bone is the gingiva or gum, which is readily visible in the mouth.\\r\\nThe periodontal ligament is a specialized connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers the root of the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15√ø0.38mm, but this size decreases over time.[28] The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and resorption of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption.[24] The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez.[29] Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers.[30] The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the tooth and forms a network around the tooth toward the crest of the gingiva.[31] When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, the tooth moves slightly in its socket and puts tension on the periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.\\r\\nThe alveolar bone is the bone of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth.[32] Like any other bone in the human body, alveolar bone is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth.[27] As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has a high number of osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.\\r\\nThe gingiva (\\"gums\\") is the mucosal tissue that overlays the jaws. There are three different types of epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the tooth and the mouth.[33] The gingival epithelium is not associated directly with tooth attachment and is visible in the mouth. The junctional epithelium, composed of the basal lamina and hemidesmosomes, forms an attachment to the tooth.[24] The sulcular epithelium is nonkeratinized stratified squamous tissue on the gingiva which touches but is not attached to the tooth.[34]\\r\\nPlaque is a biofilm consisting of large quantities of various bacteria that form on teeth.[35] If not removed regularly, plaque buildup can lead to periodontal problems such as gingivitis. Given time, plaque can mineralize along the gingiva, forming tartar. The microorganisms that form the biofilm are almost entirely bacteria (mainly streptococcus and anaerobes), with the composition varying by location in the mouth.[36] Streptococcus mutans is the most important bacterium associated with dental caries.\\r\\nCertain bacteria in the mouth live off the remains of foods, especially sugars and starches. In the absence of oxygen they produce lactic acid, which dissolves the calcium and phosphorus in the enamel.[12][37] This process, known as \\"demineralisation\\", leads to tooth destruction. Saliva gradually neutralises the acids which cause the pH of the tooth surface to rise above the critical pH, typically considered to be 5.5. This causes 'remineralisation', the return of the dissolved minerals to the enamel. If there is sufficient time between the intake of foods then the impact is limited and the teeth can repair themselves. Saliva is unable to penetrate through plaque, however, to neutralize the acid produced by the bacteria.\\r\\nDental caries (cavities), described as \\"tooth decay\\", is an infectious disease which damages the structures of teeth.[38] The disease can lead to pain, tooth loss, and infection. Dental caries has a long history, with evidence showing the disease was present in the Bronze, Iron, and Middle ages but also prior to the neolithic period.[39] The largest increases in the prevalence of caries have been associated with diet changes.[40] Today, caries remains one of the most common diseases throughout the world. In the United States, dental caries is the most common chronic childhood disease, being at least five times more common than asthma.[41] Countries that have experienced an overall decrease in cases of tooth decay continue to have a disparity in the distribution of the disease.[42] Among children in the United States and Europe, 60√ø80% of cases of dental caries occur in 20% of the population.[43]\\r\\nTooth decay is caused by certain types of acid-producing bacteria which cause the most damage in the presence of fermentable carbohydrates such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose.[44][45] The resulting acidic levels in the mouth affect teeth because a tooth's special mineral content causes it to be sensitive to low pH. Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventative and prophylactic measures, such as regular oral hygiene and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.[46]\\r\\nOral hygiene is the practice of keeping the mouth clean and is a means of preventing dental caries, gingivitis, periodontal disease, bad breath, and other dental disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.\\r\\nThe purpose of cleaning teeth is to remove plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria.[47] Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) in order to prevent formation of plaque and tartar.[46] A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the gum line, where periodontal disease often begins and could develop caries.\\r\\nElectric toothbrushes are a popular aid to oral hygiene. A user without disabilities, with proper training in manual brushing, and with good motivation, can achieve standards of oral hygiene at least as satisfactory as the best electric brushes, but untrained users rarely achieve anything of the kind. Not all electric toothbrushes are equally effective and even a good design needs to be used properly for best effect, but: \\"Electric toothbrushes tend to help people who are not as good at cleaning teeth and as a result have had oral hygiene problems.\\" [48] The most important advantage of electric toothbrushes is their ability to aid people with dexterity difficulties, such as those associated with rheumatoid arthritis.\\r\\nFluoride therapy is often recommended to protect against dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel.[49] The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay.[24] Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.\\r\\nDental sealants are another preventive therapy often used to provide a barrier to bacteria and decay on the surface of teeth. Sealants can last up to ten years and are primarily used on the biting surfaces of molars of children and young adults, especially those who may have difficulty brushing and flossing effectively. Sealants are applied in a dentist's office, sometimes by a dental hygienist, in an procedure similar in technique and cost to a fluoride application.\\r\\nAfter a tooth has been damaged or destroyed, restoration of the missing structure can be achieved with a variety of treatments. Restorations may be created from a variety of materials, including glass ionomer, amalgam, gold, porcelain, and composite.[50] Small restorations placed inside a tooth are referred to as \\"intracoronal restorations\\". These restorations may be formed directly in the mouth or may be cast using the lost-wax technique, such as for some inlays and onlays. When larger portions of a tooth are lost, an \\"extracoronal restoration\\" may be fabricated, such as an artificial crown or a veneer, to restore the involved tooth.\\r\\nWhen a tooth is lost, dentures, bridges, or implants may be used as replacements.[51] Dentures are usually the least costly whereas implants are usually the most expensive. Dentures may replace complete arches of the mouth or only a partial number of teeth. Bridges replace smaller spaces of missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental implants may be used to replace a single tooth or a series of teeth. Though implants are the most expensive treatment option, they are often the most desirable restoration because of their aesthetics and function. To improve the function of dentures, implants may be used as support.[52]\\r\\nTooth abnormalities may be categorized according to whether they have environmental or developmental causes.[53] While environmental abnormalities may appear to have an obvious cause, there may not appear to be any known cause for some developmental abnormalities. Environmental forces may affect teeth during development, destroy tooth structure after development, discolor teeth at any stage of development, or alter the course of tooth eruption. Developmental abnormalities most commonly affect the number, size, shape, and structure of teeth.\\r\\nTooth abnormalities caused by environmental factors during tooth development have long-lasting effects. Enamel and dentin do not regenerate after they mineralize initially. Enamel hypoplasia is a condition in which the amount of enamel formed is inadequate.[54] This results either in pits and grooves in areas of the tooth or in widespread absence of enamel. Diffuse opacities of enamel does not affect the amount of enamel but changes its appearance. Affected enamel has a different translucency than the rest of the tooth. Demarcated opacities of enamel have sharp boundaries where the translucency decreases and manifest a white, cream, yellow, or brown color. All these may be caused by nutritional factors,[55] an exanthematous disease (chicken pox, congenital syphilis),[55][56] undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease,[57][58][59] hypocalcemia, dental fluorosis, birth injury, preterm birth, infection or trauma from a deciduous tooth.[55] Dental fluorosis is a condition which results from ingesting excessive amounts of fluoride and leads to teeth which are spotted, yellow, brown, black or sometimes pitted. In most cases, the enamel defects caused by celiac disease, which may be the only manifestation of this disease in the absence of any other symptoms or signs, are not recognized and mistakenly attributed to other causes, such as fluorosis.[57] Enamel hypoplasia resulting from syphilis is frequently referred to as Hutchinson's teeth, which is considered one part of Hutchinson's triad.[60] Turner's hypoplasia is a portion of missing or diminished enamel on a permanent tooth usually from a prior infection of a nearby primary tooth. Hypoplasia may also result from antineoplastic therapy.\\r\\nTooth destruction from processes other than dental caries is considered a normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth.[61] Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element.[62] If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin.[63] Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension on one side of the tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.\\r\\nDiscoloration of teeth may result from bacteria stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods with an abundance of chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications.[64] Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.\\r\\nTooth eruption may be altered by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth is said to be impacted. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth.[65] Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Tooth ankylosis occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.\\r\\nA technique for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists who wish to delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches ? of its total growth, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if the roots of the permanent tooth are more than ? complete, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be accelerated. Between ? and ?, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.\\r\\nSome systemic disorders which may result in hyperdontia include Apert syndrome, cleidocranial dysostosis, Crouzon syndrome, Ehlers√øDanlos syndrome, Gardner's syndrome, and Sturge√øWeber syndrome.[66] Some systemic disorders which may result in hypodontia include Crouzon syndrome, Ectodermal dysplasia, Ehlers√øDanlos syndrome, and Gorlin syndrome.[67]\\r\\nMicrodontia of a single tooth is more likely to occur in a maxillary lateral incisor. The second most likely tooth to have microdontia are third molars. Macrodontia of all the teeth is known to occur in pituitary gigantism and pineal hyperplasia. It may also occur on one side of the face in cases of hemifacial hyperplasia.\\r\\nThere are many types of dental anomalies seen in cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients. Both sets of dentition may be affected however they are commonly seen in the affected side. Most frequently, missing teeth, supernumerary or discoloured teeth can be seen however enamel dysplasia, discolouration and delayed root development is also common. In children with cleft lip and palate, the lateral incisor in the alveolar cleft region has the highest prevalence of dental developmental disorders.[69] This is important to consider in order to correctly plan treatment keeping in mind considerations for function and aesthetics. By correctly coordinating management invasive treatment procedures can be prevented resulting in successful and conservative treatment.\\r\\nThere have been a plethora of research studies to calculate prevalence of certain dental anomalies in CLP populations however a variety of results have been obtained.\\r\\nIn a study evaluating dental anomalies in Brazilian cleft patients, male patients had a higher incidence of CLP, agenesis, and supernumerary teeth than did female patients. In cases of complete CLP, the left maxillary lateral incisor was the most commonly absent tooth. Supernumerary teeth were typically located distal to the cleft .\\r\\n[70] In a study of Jordanian subjects, the prevalence of dental anomaly was higher in CLP patients than in normal subjects. Missing teeth were observed in 66.7% of patients, with maxillary lateral incisor as the most frequently affected tooth. Supernumerary teeth were observed in 16.7% of patients; other findings included microdontia (37%), taurodontism (70.5%), transposition or ectopic teeth (30.8%), dilacerations (19.2%), and hypoplasia (30.8%). The incidence of microdontia, dilaceration, and hypoplasia was significantly higher in bilateral CLP patients than in unilateral CLP patients, and none of the anomalies showed any significant sexual dimorphism.[71]\\r\\nIt is therefore evident that patients with cleft lip and palate may present with a variety of dental anomalies. It is essential to assess the patient both clinically and radiographically in order to correctly treat and prevent progression of any dental problems. It is also useful to note that patients with a cleft lip and palate automatically score a 5 on the IOTN ( index for orthodontic need) and therefore are eligible for orthodontic treatment, liaising with an orthodontist is vital in order coordinate and plan treatment successfully.","input":"How many teeth does the human body have?"},{"output":"Johannes Gutenberg, a goldsmith by profession, developed, circa 1439","context":"A printing press is a device for applying pressure to an inked surface resting upon a print medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring the ink. It marked a dramatic improvement on earlier printing methods in which the cloth, paper or other medium was brushed or rubbed repeatedly to achieve the transfer of ink, and accelerated the process. Typically used for texts, the invention and global spread of the printing press was one of the most influential events in the second millennium.[1][2]\\r\\nJohannes Gutenberg, a goldsmith by profession, developed, circa 1439, a printing system by adapting existing technologies to printing purposes, as well as making inventions of his own. Printing in East Asia had been prevalent since the Tang dynasty,[3][4] and in Europe, woodblock printing based on existing screw presses was common by the 14th century. Gutenberg's most important innovation was the development of hand-molded metal printing matrices, thus producing a movable type based printing press system. His newly devised hand mould made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities. Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe. In Europe, the two inventions, the hand mould and the printing press, together drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents, particularly in short print runs.\\r\\nThe printing press spread within several decades to over two hundred cities in a dozen European countries.[5] By 1500, printing presses in operation throughout Western Europe had already produced more than twenty million volumes.[5] In the 16th century, with presses spreading further afield, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies.[5] The operation of a press became synonymous with the enterprise of printing, and lent its name to a new branch of media, \\"the press\\".[6]\\r\\nIn Renaissance Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of mass communication, which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information and (revolutionary) ideas transcended borders, captured the masses in the Reformation and threatened the power of political and religious authorities. The sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its peoples led to the rise of proto-nationalism, and accelerated by the development of European vernacular languages, to the detriment of Latin's status as lingua franca.[7] In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by steam-powered rotary presses allowed printing on an industrial scale.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapid economic and socio-cultural development of late medieval society in Europe created favorable intellectual and technological conditions for Gutenberg's improved version of the printing press: the entrepreneurial spirit of emerging capitalism increasingly made its impact on medieval modes of production, fostering economic thinking and improving the efficiency of traditional work-processes. The sharp rise of medieval learning and literacy amongst the middle class led to an increased demand for books which the time-consuming hand-copying method fell far short of accommodating.[9]\\r\\nTechnologies preceding the press that led to the press's invention included: manufacturing of paper, development of ink, woodblock printing, and distribution of eyeglasses.[10] At the same time, a number of medieval products and technological processes had reached a level of maturity which allowed their potential use for printing purposes. Gutenberg took up these far-flung strands, combined them into one complete and functioning system, and perfected the printing process through all its stages by adding a number of inventions and innovations of his own:\\r\\nThe screw press which allowed direct pressure to be applied on flat-plane was already of great antiquity in Gutenberg's time and was used for a wide range of tasks.[11] Introduced in the 1st century AD by the Romans, it was commonly employed in agricultural production for pressing wine grapes and (olive) oil fruit, both of which formed an integral part of the mediterranean and medieval diet.[12] The device was also used from very early on in urban contexts as a cloth press for printing patterns.[13] Gutenberg may have also been inspired by the paper presses which had spread through the German lands since the late 14th century and which worked on the same mechanical principles.[14]\\r\\nGutenberg adopted the basic design, thereby mechanizing the printing process.[15] Printing, however, put a demand on the machine quite different from pressing. Gutenberg adapted the construction so that the pressing power exerted by the platen on the paper was now applied both evenly and with the required sudden elasticity. To speed up the printing process, he introduced a movable undertable with a plane surface on which the sheets could be swiftly changed.[16]\\r\\nThe concept of movable type was not new in the 15th century; movable type printing had been invented in China during the Song dynasty, and was later used in Korea during the Goryeo Dynasty, where metal movable-type printing technology was developed in 1234.[3][4] In Europe, sporadic evidence that the typographical principle, the idea of creating a text by reusing individual characters, was well understood and employed in pre-Gutenberg Europe had been cropping up since the 12th century and possibly before. The known examples range from Germany (Prfening inscription) to England (letter tiles) to Italy.[17] However, the various techniques employed (imprinting, punching and assembling individual letters) did not have the refinement and efficiency needed to become widely accepted.\\r\\nGutenberg greatly improved the process by treating typesetting and printing as two separate work steps. A goldsmith by profession, he created his type pieces from a lead-based alloy which suited printing purposes so well that it is still used today.[18] The mass production of metal letters was achieved by his key invention of a special hand mould, the matrix.[19] The Latin alphabet proved to be an enormous advantage in the process because, in contrast to logographic writing systems, it allowed the type-setter to represent any text with a theoretical minimum of only around two dozen different letters.[20]\\r\\nAnother factor conducive to printing arose from the book existing in the format of the codex, which had originated in the Roman period.[21] Considered the most important advance in the history of the book prior to printing itself, the codex had completely replaced the ancient scroll at the onset of the Middle Ages (500 AD).[22] The codex holds considerable practical advantages over the scroll format; it is more convenient to read (by turning pages), is more compact, less costly, and, in particular, unlike the scroll, both recto and verso could be used for writing ? and printing.[23]\\r\\nA fourth development was the early success of medieval papermakers at mechanizing paper manufacture. The introduction of water-powered paper mills, the first certain evidence of which dates to 1282,[24] allowed for a massive expansion of production and replaced the laborious handcraft characteristic of both Chinese[25] and Muslim papermaking.[26] Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of parchment and then falling further; papermaking centers reached Germany a century later.[27]\\r\\nDespite this it appears that the final breakthrough of paper depended just as much on the rapid spread of movable-type printing.[28] It is notable that codices of parchment, which in terms of quality is superior to any other writing material,[29] still had a substantial share in Gutenberg's edition of the 42-line Bible.[30] After much experimentation, Gutenberg managed to overcome the difficulties which traditional water-based inks caused by soaking the paper, and found the formula for an oil-based ink suitable for high-quality printing with metal type.[31]\\r\\nA printing press, in its classical form, is a standing mechanism, ranging from 5 to 7 feet (1.5 to 2.1?m) long, 3 feet (0.91?m) wide, and 7 feet (2.1?m) tall. Type, small metal letters that have a raised letter on one end, is arranged into pages and placed in a frame to make a forme, which itself is placed onto a flat stone, 'bed,' or 'coffin.' The text is inked using two balls, pads mounted on handles. The balls were made of dog skin leather, because it has no pores,[33] and stuffed with sheep's wool and were inked. This ink was then applied to the text evenly. One damp piece of paper was then taken from a heap of paper and placed on the tympan. The paper was damp as this lets the type 'bite' into the paper better. Small pins hold the paper in place. The paper is now held between a frisket and tympan (two frames covered with paper or parchment).\\r\\nThese are folded down, so that the paper lies on the surface of the inked type. The bed is rolled under the platen, using a windlass mechanism. A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power.\\r\\nJohannes Gutenberg's work on the printing press began in approximately 1436 when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehna man who had previously instructed in gem-cuttingand Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill.[34] However, it was not until a 1439 lawsuit against Gutenberg that an official record existed; witnesses' testimony discussed Gutenberg's types, an inventory of metals (including lead), and his type molds.[34]\\r\\nHaving previously worked as a professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of the knowledge of metals he had learned as a craftsman. He was the first to make type from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books and proved to be much better suited for printing than all other known materials. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what is considered one of his most ingenious inventions,[34] a special matrix enabling the quick and precise molding of new type blocks from a uniform template. His type case is estimated to have contained around 290 separate letter boxes, most of which were required for special characters, ligatures, punctuation marks, and so forth.[35]\\r\\nGutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based ink which was more durable than the previously used water-based inks. As printing material he used both paper and vellum (high-quality parchment). In the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg made a trial of coloured printing for a few of the page headings, present only in some copies.[36] A later work, the Mainz Psalter of 1453, presumably designed by Gutenberg but published under the imprint of his successors Johann Fust and Peter Sch?ffer, had elaborate red and blue printed initials.[37]\\r\\nThe Printing Revolution occurred when the spread of the printing press facilitated the wide circulation of information and ideas, acting as an \\"agent of change\\" through the societies that it reached. (Eisenstein (1980))\\r\\nThe invention of mechanical movable type printing led to a huge increase of printing activities across Europe within only a few decades. From a single print shop in Mainz, Germany, printing had spread to no less than around 270 cities in Central, Western and Eastern Europe by the end of the 15th century.[39] As early as 1480, there were printers active in 110 different places in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, England, Bohemia and Poland.[5] From that time on, it is assumed that \\"the printed book was in universal use in Europe\\".[5]\\r\\nIn Italy, a center of early printing, print shops had been established in 77 cities and towns by 1500. At the end of the following century, 151 locations in Italy had seen at one time printing activities, with a total of nearly three thousand printers known to be active. Despite this proliferation, printing centres soon emerged; thus, one third of the Italian printers published in Venice.[40]\\r\\nBy 1500, the printing presses in operation throughout Western Europe had already produced more than twenty million copies.[5] In the following century, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies.[5]\\r\\nEuropean printing presses of around 1600 were capable of producing about 1,500 impressions per workday.[41] By comparison, book printing in East Asia, did not use presses and was solely done by block printing.[42]\\r\\nOf Erasmus's work, at least 750,000 copies were sold during his lifetime alone (1469√ø1536).[43] In the early days of the Reformation, the revolutionary potential of bulk printing took princes and papacy alike by surprise. In the period from 1518 to 1524, the publication of books in Germany alone skyrocketed sevenfold; between 1518 and 1520, Luther's tracts were distributed in 300,000 printed copies.[44]\\r\\nThe rapidity of typographical text production, as well as the sharp fall in unit costs, led to the issuing of the first newspapers (see Relation) which opened up an entirely new field for conveying up-to-date information to the public.[45]\\r\\nIncunable are surviving pre-16th century print works which are collected by many of the libraries in Europe and North America.[46]\\r\\nThe printing press was also a factor in the establishment of a community of scientists who could easily communicate their discoveries through the establishment of widely disseminated scholarly journals, helping to bring on the scientific revolution.[citation needed] Because of the printing press, authorship became more meaningful and profitable. It was suddenly important who had said or written what, and what the precise formulation and time of composition was. This allowed the exact citing of references, producing the rule, \\"One Author, one work (title), one piece of information\\" (Giesecke, 1989; 325). Before, the author was less important, since a copy of Aristotle made in Paris would not be exactly identical to one made in Bologna. For many works prior to the printing press, the name of the author has been entirely lost.[citation needed]\\r\\nBecause the printing process ensured that the same information fell on the same pages, page numbering, tables of contents, and indices became common, though they previously had not been unknown.[citation needed] The process of reading also changed, gradually moving over several centuries from oral readings to silent, private reading.[citation needed] Over the next 200 years, the wider availability of printed materials led to a dramatic rise in the adult literacy rate throughout Europe.[47]\\r\\nThe printing press was an important step towards the democratization of knowledge.[48][49] Within 50 or 60 years of the invention of the printing press, the entire classical canon had been reprinted and widely promulgated throughout Europe (Eisenstein, 1969; 52). More people had access to knowledge both new and old, more people could discuss these works. Book production became more commercialised, and the first copyright laws were passed.[50] On the other hand, the printing press was criticized for allowing the dissemination of information which may have been incorrect.[51][52]\\r\\nA second outgrowth of this popularization of knowledge was the decline of Latin as the language of most published works, to be replaced by the vernacular language of each area, increasing the variety of published works. The printed word also helped to unify and standardize the spelling and syntax of these vernaculars, in effect 'decreasing' their variability. This rise in importance of national languages as opposed to pan-European Latin is cited[who?] as one of the causes of the rise of nationalism in Europe.\\r\\nA third consequence of popularization of printing was on the economy. The printing press was associated with higher levels of city growth.[53] The publication of trade related manuals and books teaching techniques like double-entry bookkeeping increased the reliability of trade and led to the decline of merchant guilds and the rise of individual traders.[54]\\r\\nAt the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, the mechanics of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press were still essentially unchanged, although new materials in its construction, amongst other innovations, had gradually improved its printing efficiency. By 1800, Lord Stanhope had built a press completely from cast iron which reduced the force required by 90%, while doubling the size of the printed area.[55] With a capacity of 480 pages per hour, the Stanhope press doubled the output of the old style press.[56] Nonetheless, the limitations inherent to the traditional method of printing became obvious.\\r\\nTwo ideas altered the design of the printing press radically: First, the use of steam power for running the machinery, and second the replacement of the printing flatbed with the rotary motion of cylinders. Both elements were for the first time successfully implemented by the German printer Friedrich Koenig in a series of press designs devised between 1802 and 1818.[57] Having moved to London in 1804, Koenig soon met Thomas Bensley and secured financial support for his project in 1807.[55] Patented in 1810, Koenig had designed a steam press \\"much like a hand press connected to a steam engine.\\"[55] The first production trial of this model occurred in April 1811. He produced his machine with assistance from German engineer Andreas Friedrich Bauer.\\r\\nKoenig and Bauer sold two of their first models to The Times in London in 1814, capable of 1,100 impressions per hour. The first edition so printed was on 28 November 1814. They went on to perfect the early model so that it could print on both sides of a sheet at once. This began the long process of making newspapers available to a mass audience (which in turn helped spread literacy), and from the 1820s changed the nature of book production, forcing a greater standardization in titles and other metadata. Their company Koenig & Bauer AG is still one of the world's largest manufacturers of printing presses today.\\r\\nThe steam powered rotary printing press, invented in 1843 in the United States by Richard M. Hoe,[58] allowed millions of copies of a page in a single day. Mass production of printed works flourished after the transition to rolled paper, as continuous feed allowed the presses to run at a much faster pace.\\r\\nBy the late 1930s or early 1940s, rotary presses had increased substantially in efficiency: a model by Platen Printing Press was capable of performing 2,500 to 3,000 impressions per hour.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlso, in the middle of the 19th century, there was a separate development of jobbing presses, small presses capable of printing small-format pieces such as billheads, letterheads, business cards, and envelopes. Jobbing presses were capable of quick set-up (average setup time for a small job was under 15 minutes) and quick production (even on treadle-powered jobbing presses it was considered normal to get 1,000 impressions per hour [iph] with one pressman, with speeds of 1,500 iph often attained on simple envelope work).[citation needed] Job printing emerged as a reasonably cost-effective duplicating solution for commerce at this time.\\r\\nModel of the Common Press, used from 1650 to 1850\\r\\nPrinting press from 1811\\r\\nStanhope press from 1842\\r\\nImprenta Press V John Sherwin from 1860\\r\\nAt the same time, then, as the printing press in the physical, technological sense was invented, 'the press' in the extended sense of the word also entered the historical stage. The phenomenon of publishing was born.\\r\\nGutenberg's invention took full advantage of the degree of abstraction in representing language forms that was offered by the alphabet and by the Western forms of script that were current in the fifteenth century.\\r\\nThe most momentous development in the history of the book until the invention of printing was the replacement of the roll by the codex; this we may define as a collection of sheets of any material, folded double and fastened together at the back or spine, and usually protected by covers. (p. 1)\\r\\nIn the West, the only inhibiting expense in the production of writings for an increasingly literate market was the manual labor of the scribe himself. With his mechanization by movable-type printing in the 1440s, the manufacture of paper, until then relatively confined, began to spread very widely. The Paper Revolution of the thirteenth century thus entered a new era.\\r\\nDespite all that has been said above, even the strongest supporters of papyrus would not deny that parchment of good quality is the finest writing material ever devised by man. It is immensely strong, remains flexible indefinitely under normal conditions, does not deteriorate with age, and possesses a smooth, even surface which is both pleasant to the eye and provides unlimited scope for the finest writing and illumination.\\r\\nFrom old price tables it can be deduced that the capacity of a printing press around 1600, assuming a fifteen-hour workday, was between 3,200 and 3,600 impressions per day.\\r\\nThe outstanding difference between the two ends of the Old World was the absence of screw-presses from China, but this is only another manifestation of the fact that this basic mechanism was foreign to that culture.\\r\\nIn East Asia, both woodblock and movable type printing were manual reproduction techniques, that is hand printing.\\r\\nChinese paper was suitable only for calligraphy or block-printing; there were no screw-based presses in the east, because they were not wine-drinkers, didnt have olives, and used other means to dry their paper.\\r\\nOn the effects of the printing press\\r\\nTechnology of printing","input":"Who invented the printing press and when was it invented?"},{"output":"in the province of Papua in Indonesia near Puncak Jaya, the highest mountain in Papua","context":"The Grasberg Mine is the largest gold mine and the second largest copper mine in the world.[1][2] It is located in the province of Papua in Indonesia near Puncak Jaya, the highest mountain in Papua. It has 19,500 employees. It is mostly owned by Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), which owns 90.64% of PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), the principal operating subsidiary in Indonesia, including 9.36% owned through its wholly owned subsidiary, PT Indocopper Investama.[3] The government of Indonesia owns the remaining 9.36% of PT Freeport Indonesia.[3]\\r\\nFCX operates under a Contract of Work (CoW) agreement with the government of Indonesia, which allows Freeport to conduct exploration, mining and production activities in a 27,400-acre area (Block A).[4][5] It also conducts exploration activities in a 413,000-acre area (Block B).[4] All of Freeport's proven and probable mineral reserves and current mining operations are located in Block A.[4] The mine has three mining operations: the open pit, the Deep Ore Zone underground mine, and the Big Gossan underground mine. A fourth, the Deep Mill Level Zone, is being developed.[4] The 2016 production was 1,063,000,000 pounds (482,000,000?kg) of copper, 1,061,000 ounces (30,100,000?g) of gold; and in 2016 sales of 2,900,000 ounces (82,000,000?g) of silver.[6]\\r\\nIn August 2017, FCX announced that it will divest its ownership in PT-FI so that Indonesia owns 51%. In return the CoW will be replaced by a special license (IUPK) with mining rights to 2041 and FCX will build a new smelter by 2022.[7][1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1936, Dutch geologist Jean Jacques Dozy was a member of an expedition that scaled Mount Carstensz, the highest mountain in the Dutch East Indies. While there, he made notes of a peculiar black rock with greenish coloring, and spent several weeks estimating the extent of the gold and copper deposits. In 1939, he filed a report about the Ertsberg (Dutch for \\"ore mountain\\"). He was working for Nederlandsche Nieuw Guinea Petroleum Maatschappij (NNGPM), an exploration company formed by Shell in 1935, with 40% Standard Vacuum Oil Company interest and 20% Far Pacific investments (Chevron subsidiary).\\r\\nIn March 1959, the New York Times published an article revealing the Dutch were searching for the mountain source of alluvial gold which had been flowing into the Arafura Sea.[8] Geologist Forbes Wilson, working for the Freeport mining company in August 1959 after reading Dozy's 1936 report, immediately prepared to explore the Ertsberg site. In 1960 the expedition, led by Forbes Wilson and President of Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold-George Mealey, confirmed the huge copper deposits at the Ertsberg. It was financed by Freeport Sulphur, whose directors included Godfrey Rockefeller, Texaco chairman Augustus Long, George Mealey, and Robert Lovett.\\r\\nIn 1963 the administration[9] of Dutch New Guinea was transferred[10] to Indonesia, and the mine was the first under the new Suharto administration's 1967 foreign investment laws intended to attract foreign investment to Indonesia's then ruined economy. Built at 4,100 metres (14,000?ft) above sea level in one of West Papua's most remote areas, it involved a capital and technology input well beyond Indonesia's resources at the time. Construction cost was $175 million, $55 million above the original budget.[11] A 116?km road and pipeline, port, airstrip, power plant and a new town called \\"Tembagapura\\" (literally: copper town) were built. It officially opened in 1973 (although the first ore shipment was in December 1972), and was expanded by Ertsberg East, which opened in 1981. Steep aerial tramways are used to transport equipment and people. Ore is dropped 600 metres (2,000?ft) from the mine, concentrated and mixed with water to form a 60:40 slurry. The slurry is then pumped through a 166?km pipeline through mountains, jungle and swamp to the port at Amamapare, dried and shipped. Each tonne of dry concentrate contains 317 kilograms of copper, 30?grams of gold and 30?grams of silver.\\r\\nIn 1977 the rebel group Free Papua Movement attacked the mine. The group dynamited the main slurry pipe, which caused tens of millions of dollars in damage, and attacked the mine facilities. The Indonesian military reacted harshly, killing at least 800 people.[12]\\r\\nBy the mid-1980s, the original mine had been largely depleted. Freeport explored for other deposits in the area. In 1988, Freeport identified reserves valued at $40 billion at Grasberg (Dutch, \\"Grass Mountain\\"), just 3 kilometres (1.9 miles) from the Ertsberg mine. The winding road to Grasberg, the H.E.A.T. (Heavy Equipment Access Trail), was estimated to require $12 million to $15 million to be built. An Indonesian road-builder who had contributed to the Ertsberg road took a bulldozer and drove it downhill sketching the path. The road cost just $2 million when completed.\\r\\nThe 2003√ø2006 boom in copper prices increased the profitability of the mine. The extra consumption of copper for Asian electrical infrastructure overwhelmed copper supply and caused prices to increase from around $1500/ton to $8100/ton ($0.70/lb to $4.00/lb).\\r\\nIn 2005, the New York Times reported that between 1998 and 2004 Freeport had given senior military and police officers and military units nearly $20 million.[13]\\r\\nThe workings include a very large open pit mine, an underground mine and four concentrators. The open pit mine √ø which forms a mile-wide crater at the surface √ø is a high-volume, low-cost operation, producing more than 67 million tonnes of ore and providing over 75% of the mill feed in 2006.\\r\\nOre undergoes primary crushing at the mine, before being delivered by ore passes to the mill complex for further crushing, grinding and flotation. Grasbergs milling and concentrating complex is the largest in the world, with four crushers and two giant semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) units processing a daily average of 240,000 metric tonnes of ore in 2006.\\r\\nA flotation reagent is used to separate a copper-gold concentrate from the ore. Slurry containing the copper-gold concentrate is delivered by three pipelines to the seaport of Amamapare, over 70 miles away, where it is dewatered. Once filtered and dried, the concentrate √ø containing copper, gold and silver √ø is shipped to smelters around the world.\\r\\nThe facilities at the port also include a coal-fired power station, which supplies the Grasberg operations.[14]\\r\\nThe concentrator's tailings, generated at a rate of 700,000 tonnes per day,[13] are the subject of considerable environmental concern, as they wash into the Aikwa riverine system and Arafura Sea. Some 130 square kilometres (50?sq?mi) (eventually 230 square kilometres (89?sq?mi))[15] of lowland areas along the Aikwa River, are covered by braided sedimentary channels indicative of high sediment load (similar to glacial runoff). Native fish have nearly disappeared from now-turbid waters of the Aikwa River which are unsuitable for aquatic life.[13] The overburden (700 kt/d) [16] remains in the highlands, up to 480 m deep and covering 8 square kilometres (3?sq?mi). Its acidic runoff, dissolved copper, and the finer material gets washed into the headwaters of the Wanagon River. It settles out along the river course and then into the ocean, and will continue to do so indefinitely. Freeport's official response is that overburden is placed in the highlands as part of its Overburden Management Plan, at \\"sites capped with limestone and constantly monitored. Tailings are transported to the lowlands in a designated river system. Once reaching the lowlands, they are captured in an engineered system of levees built for that purpose.\\"[17][18] An Indonesian Environment Ministry's field report in 2004, found levels of sediment 37,500 milligrams per litre as the river entered the lowlands and 7,500 milligrams as the river entered the Arafura Sea, while the maximum under Indonesian law is not to exceed 400 milligrams per litre.[13]\\r\\nIn 1995, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) revoked Freeport's insurance policy for environmental violations of a sort that would not be allowed in the US.[13] It was the first action of this sort by OPIC, and Freeport responded with a lawsuit against them.[13] Freeport said an environmental report reached inaccurate conclusions,[13] the result of a single 1994 visit to Grasberg. The company later underwent an independent environmental audit by Dames & Moore and passed. In April 1996, Freeport canceled its policy with the OPIC, stating that their corporate activities had outgrown the policy's limits. However, the OPIC report was later publicly released.[19]\\r\\nThe mine is located within what used to be a small equatorial mountain glacier.[20][not in citation given] Steepening of slopes related to mining activities, as well as earthquakes and frequent heavy rainfall, have resulted in landslides within the open pit mine.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhile landscape reclamation projects have begun at the mine, environmental groups and local citizens[who?] are concerned with the potential for copper contamination and acid mine drainage from the mine tailings into surrounding river systems, land surfaces, and groundwater. Freeport argues that its actions meet industry standards and have been approved by the requisite authorities.[citation needed] It was reported in 2005 that since 1997 Freeport had been breaching Indonesian environmental laws.[13] Freeport estimates it will generate six billion tons of waste.[13]\\r\\nBoth Freeport and its partner Rio Tinto have been excluded from the investment portfolio of The Government Pension Fund of Norway, the world's second-largest pension fund, due to criticism over the environmental damages caused by the Grasberg mine. Stocks at a value of ca. US$870 million were divested from the fund as a result of the decisions.[21][22]\\r\\nViolent ambushes near the Grasberg mine have occurred as early as August 2002, when three contract school teachers were killed. Kopassus, the Indonesian Special Forces, allegedly instigated the incident.[23][24]\\r\\nA series of attacks started on 11 July 2009, and continued for more than five days. A Freeport employee, 29-year-old Australian Drew Grant was shot and killed while sitting in the back of a car on the way to a game of golf. Indonesian police indicated that Grant was killed by five shots he sustained to the neck, chest and stomach by unknown assailants using military-issue weapons. The attack also killed Freeport security guard Markus Ratealo and a number of police officers.[24][25]\\r\\nOn 7 April 2011, two Freeport employees were killed when the company car they were traveling in caught fire. Bullets were found inside the car, giving weight to the suspicion that the car was fired on by unknown gunmen. This incident sparked a protest by hundreds of Freeport employees concerned about the security along the jungle road leading up to the mine.[26][27]\\r\\nThe Grasberg mine has been a frequent source of friction in Papua. Possible causes of friction are the mine's environmental impact on Papua, the perceived low share of profits going to local Papuans (Freeport's annual report shows it made $4.1billion in operating profit on revenue of $6.4billion in 2010) and the questionable legality of the payments made to Indonesian security forces for their services to guard the site.[26]\\r\\nOn May 14, 2013, a training facility tunnel collapsed trapping at least 33 workers underground. A mine official at the mine said three workers were killed, but the main office in Arizona said there were no fatalities.[28] As of 20 May, 10 miners were rescued and 14 bodies were recovered bringing the total deaths to 17. Eleven other men are believed to be buried under the rubble.[29]\\r\\nIn July 2011, Papuan copper miners went on strike in support of increasing their wages up from their rate of about $1.50 an hour. As a result of the industrial action, production at the mine halted for a week.[30]\\r\\nAfter a huge truck collided with a car in an accident, four workers died on 27 September 2014. On 1 October 2014 miners blocked the entrance of the mine demanding more safety.[31]","input":"Where is world's largest gold mine situated?"},{"output":"roughly within the 28 degree latitudes (in the equatorial zone between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn)","context":"Tropical rainforests are rainforests that occur in areas of tropical rainforest climate in which there is no dry season √ø all months have an average precipitation of at least 60?mm √ø and may also be referred to as lowland equatorial evergreen rainforest. True rainforests are typically found between 10 degrees north and south of the equator (see map); they are a sub-set of the tropical forest biome that occurs roughly within the 28 degree latitudes (in the equatorial zone between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn). Within the World Wildlife Fund's biome classification, tropical rainforests are a type of tropical moist broadleaf forest (or tropical wet forest) that also includes the more extensive seasonal tropical forests.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTropical rainforests can be characterized in two words: hot and wet. Mean monthly temperatures exceed 18?C (64?F) during all months of the year.[4] Average annual rainfall is no less than 1,680?mm (66?in) and can exceed 10?m (390?in) although it typically lies between 1,750?mm (69?in) and 3,000?mm (120?in).[5] This high level of precipitation often results in poor soils due to leaching of soluble nutrients in the ground.\\r\\nTropical rainforests exhibit high levels of biodiversity. Around 40% to 75% of all biotic species are indigenous to the rainforests.[6] Rainforests are home to half of all the living animal and plant species on the planet.[7] Two-thirds of all flowering plants can be found in rainforests.[5] A single hectare of rainforest may contain 42,000 different species of insect, up to 807 trees of 313 species and 1,500 species of higher plants.[5] Tropical rainforests have been called the \\"world's largest pharmacy\\", because over one quarter of natural medicines have been discovered within them.[8][9] It is likely that there may be many millions of species of plants, insects and microorganisms still undiscovered in tropical rainforests.\\r\\nTropical rainforests are among the most threatened ecosystems globally due to large-scale fragmentation as a result of human activity. Habitat fragmentation caused by geological processes such as volcanism and climate change occurred in the past, and have been identified as important drivers of speciation.[10] However, fast human driven habitat destruction is suspected to be one of the major causes of species extinction. Tropical rain forests have been subjected to heavy logging and agricultural clearance throughout the 20th century, and the area covered by rainforests around the world is rapidly shrinking.[11][12]\\r\\nTropical rainforests have existed on earth for hundreds of millions of years. Most tropical rainforests today are on fragments of the Mesozoic era supercontinent of Gondwana.[13] The separation of the landmass resulted in a great loss of amphibian diversity while at the same time the drier climate spurred the diversification of reptiles.[10] The division left tropical rainforests located in five major regions of the world: tropical America, Africa, Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and New Guinea, with smaller outliers in Australia.[13] However, the specifics of the origin of rainforests remain uncertain due to an incomplete fossil record.\\r\\nSeveral biomes may appear similar-to, or merge via ecotones with, tropical rainforest:\\r\\nMoist seasonal tropical forests receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season. Some trees in these forests drop some or all of their leaves during the winter dry season, thus they are sometimes called \\"tropical mixed forest\\". They are found in parts of South America, in Central America and around the Caribbean, in coastal West Africa, parts of the Indian subcontinent, and across much of Indochina.\\r\\nThese are found in cooler-climate mountainous areas, becoming are known as cloud forests at higher elevations. Depending on latitude, the lower limit of montane rainforests on large mountains is generally between 1500 and 2500?m while the upper limit is usually from 2400 to 3300?m.[14]\\r\\nTropical freshwater swamp forests, or \\"flooded forests\\", are found in Amazon basin (the Vrzea) and elsewhere.\\r\\nRainforests are divided into different strata, or layers, with vegetation organized into a vertical pattern from the top of the soil to the canopy.[15] Each layer is a unique biotic community containing different plants and animals adapted for life in that particular strata. Only the emergent layer is unique to tropical rainforests, while the others are also found in temperate rainforests.\\r\\nThe forest floor, the bottom-most layer, receives only 2% of the sunlight. Only plants adapted to low light can grow in this region. Away from riverbanks, swamps and clearings, where dense undergrowth is found, the forest floor is relatively clear of vegetation because of the low sunlight penetration. This more open quality permits the easy movement of larger animals such as: ungulates like the okapi (Okapia johnstoni), tapir (Tapirus sp.), Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis), and apes like the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), as well as many species of reptiles, amphibians, and insects. The forest floor also contains decaying plant and animal matter, which disappears quickly, because the warm, humid conditions promote rapid decay. Many forms of fungi growing here help decay the animal and plant waste.\\r\\nThe understory layer lies between the canopy and the forest floor. The understory is home to a number of birds, small mammals, insects, reptiles, and predators. Examples include leopard (Panthera pardus), poison dart frogs (Dendrobates sp.), ring-tailed coati (Nasua nasua), boa constrictor (Boa constrictor), and many species of Coleoptera.[5] The vegetation at this layer generally consists of shade-tolerant shrubs, herbs, small trees, and large woody vines which climb into the trees to capture sunlight. Only about 5% of sunlight breaches the canopy to arrive at the understory causing true understory plants to seldom grow to 3 m (10?feet). As an adaptation to these low light levels, understory plants have often evolved much larger leaves. Many seedlings that will grow to the canopy level are in the understory.\\r\\nThe canopy is the primary layer of the forest forming a roof over the two remaining layers. It contains the majority of the largest trees, typically 30√ø45 m in height. Tall, broad-leaved evergreen trees are the dominant plants. The densest areas of biodiversity are found in the forest canopy, as it often supports a rich flora of epiphytes, including orchids, bromeliads, mosses and lichens. These epiphytic plants attach to trunks and branches and obtain water and minerals from rain and debris that collects on the supporting plants. The fauna is similar to that found in the emergent layer, but more diverse. It is suggested that the total arthropod species richness of the tropical canopy might be as high as 20 million.[16] Other species habituating this layer include many avian species such as the yellow-casqued wattled hornbill (Ceratogymna elata), collared sunbird (Anthreptes collaris), grey parrot (Psitacus erithacus), keel-billed toucan (Ramphastos sulfuratus), scarlet macaw (Ara macao) as well as other animals like the spider monkey (Ateles sp.), African giant swallowtail (Papilio antimachus), three-toed sloth (Bradypus tridactylus), kinkajou (Potos flavus), and tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla).[5]\\r\\nThe emergent layer contains a small number of very large trees, called emergents, which grow above the general canopy, reaching heights of 45√ø55?m, although on occasion a few species will grow to 70√ø80?m tall.[15][17] Some examples of emergents include: Balizia elegans, Dipteryx panamensis, Hieronyma alchorneoides, Hymenolobium mesoamericanum, Lecythis ampla and Terminalia oblonga.[18] These trees need to be able to withstand the hot temperatures and strong winds that occur above the canopy in some areas. Several unique faunal species inhabit this layer such as the crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus), the king colobus (Colobus polykomos), and the large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus).[5]\\r\\nHowever, stratification is not always clear. Rainforests are dynamic and many changes affect the structure of the forest. Emergent or canopy trees collapse, for example, causing gaps to form. Openings in the forest canopy are widely recognized as important for the establishment and growth of rainforest trees. Its estimated that perhaps 75% of the tree species at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica are dependent on canopy opening for seed germination or for growth beyond sapling size, for example.[19]\\r\\nTropical rainforests are located around and near the equator, therefore having what is called an equatorial climate characterized by three major climatic parameters: temperature, rainfall, and dry season intensity.[20] Other parameters that affect tropical rainforests are carbon dioxide concentrations, solar radiation, and nitrogen availability. In general, climatic patterns consist of warm temperatures and high annual rainfall. However, the abundance of rainfall changes throughout the year creating distinct moist and dry seasons. Tropical forests are classified by the amount of rainfall received each year, which has allowed ecologists to define differences in these forests that look so similar in structure. According to Holdridges classification of tropical ecosystems, true tropical rainforests have an annual rainfall greater than 2?m and annual temperature greater than 24 degrees Celsius, with a potential evapotranspiration ratio (PET) value of <0.25. However, most lowland tropical forests can be classified as tropical moist or wet forests, which differ in regards to rainfall. Tropical forest ecology- dynamics, composition, and function- are sensitive to changes in climate especially changes in rainfall.[20]\\r\\nSoil types are highly variable in the tropics and are the result of a combination of several variables such as climate, vegetation, topographic position, parent material, and soil age.[21] Most tropical soils are characterized by significant leaching and poor nutrients, however there are some areas that contain fertile soils. Soils throughout the tropical rainforests fall into two classifications which include the ultisols and oxisols. Ultisols are known as well weathered, acidic red clay soils, deficient in major nutrients such as calcium and potassium. Similarly, oxisols are acidic, old, typically reddish, highly weathered and leached, however are well drained compared to ultisols. The clay content of ultisols is high, making it difficult for water to penetrate and flow through. The reddish color of both soils is the result of heavy heat and moisture forming oxides of iron and aluminium, which are insoluble in water and not taken up readily by plants.\\r\\nSoil chemical and physical characteristics are strongly related to above ground productivity and forest structure and dynamics. The physical properties of soil control the tree turnover rates whereas chemical properties such as available nitrogen and phosphorus control forest growth rates.[22] The soils of the eastern and central Amazon as well as the Southeast Asian Rainforest are old and mineral poor whereas the soils of the western Amazon (Ecuador and Peru) and volcanic areas of Costa Rica are young and mineral rich. Primary productivity or wood production is highest in western Amazon and lowest in eastern Amazon which contains heavily weathered soils classified as oxisols.[21] Additionally, Amazonian soils are greatly weathered, making them devoid of minerals like phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, which come from rock sources. However, not all tropical rainforests occur on nutrient poor soils, but on nutrient rich floodplains and volcanic soils located in the Andean foothills, and volcanic areas of Southeast Asia, Africa, and Central America.[23]\\r\\nOxisols, infertile, deeply weathered and severely leached, have developed on the ancient Gondwanan shields. Rapid bacterial decay prevents the accumulation of humus. The concentration of iron and aluminium oxides by the laterization process gives the oxisols a bright red color and sometimes produces minable deposits (e.g., bauxite). On younger substrates, especially of volcanic origin, tropical soils may be quite fertile.\\r\\nThis high rate of decomposition is the result of phosphorus levels in the soils, precipitation, high temperatures and the extensive microorganism communities.[24] In addition to the bacteria and other microorganisms, there are an abundance of other decomposers such as fungi and termites that aid in the process as well. Nutrient recycling is important because below ground resource availability controls the above ground biomass and community structure of tropical rainforests. These soils are typically phosphorus limited, which inhibits net primary productivity or the uptake of carbon.[21] The soil contains microbial organisms such as bacteria, which break down leaf litter and other organic matter into inorganic forms of carbon usable by plants through a process called decomposition. During the decomposition process the microbial community is respiring, taking up oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. The decomposition rate can be evaluated by measuring the uptake of oxygen.[24] High temperatures and precipitation increase decomposition rate, which allows plant litter to rapidly decay in tropical regions, releasing nutrients that are immediately taken up by plants through surface or ground waters. The seasonal patterns in respiration are controlled by leaf litter fall and precipitation, the driving force moving the decomposable carbon from the litter to the soil. Respiration rates are highest early in the wet season because the recent dry season results in a large percentage of leaf litter and thus a higher percentage of organic matter being leached into the soil.[24]\\r\\nA common feature of many tropical rainforests is the distinct buttress roots of trees. Instead of penetrating to deeper soil layers, buttress roots create a widespread root network at the surface for more efficient uptake of nutrients in a very nutrient poor and competitive environment. Most of the nutrients within the soil of a tropical rainforest occur near the surface because of the rapid turnover time and decomposition of organisms and leaves.[25] Because of this, the buttress roots occur at the surface so the trees can maximize uptake and actively compete with the rapid uptake of other trees. These roots also aid in water uptake and storage, increase surface area for gas exchange, and collect leaf litter for added nutrition.[25] Additionally, these roots reduce soil erosion and maximize nutrient acquisition during heavy rains by diverting nutrient rich water flowing down the trunk into several smaller flows while also acting as a barrier to ground flow. Also, the large surface areas these roots create provide support and stability to rainforests trees, which commonly grow to significant heights. This added stability allows these trees to withstand the impacts of severe storms, thus reducing the occurrence of fallen trees.[25]\\r\\nSuccession is an ecological process that changes the biotic community structure over time towards a more stable, diverse community structure after an initial disturbance to the community. The initial disturbance is often a natural phenomenon or human caused event. Natural disturbances include hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, river movements or an event as small as a fallen tree that creates gaps in the forest. In tropical rainforests, these same natural disturbances have been well documented in the fossil record, and are credited with encouraging speciation and endemism.[10]\\r\\nTropical rainforests exhibit a vast diversity in plant and animal species. The root for this remarkable speciation has been a query of scientists and ecologists for years. A number of theories have been developed for why and how the tropics can be so diverse.\\r\\nInterspecific competition results from a high density of species with similar niches in the tropics and limited resources available. Species which \\"lose\\" the competition may either become extinct or find a new niche. Direct competition will often lead to one species dominating another by some advantage, ultimately driving it to extinction. Niche partitioning is the other option for a species. This is the separation and rationing of necessary resources by utilizing different habitats, food sources, cover or general behavioral differences. A species with similar food items but different feeding times is an example of niche partitioning.[26]\\r\\nThe theory of Pleistocene refugia was developed by Jrgen Haffer in 1969 with his article Speciation of Amazonian Forest Birds. Haffer proposed the explanation for speciation was the product of rainforest patches being separated by stretches of non forest vegetation during the last glacial period. He called these patches of rainforest areas refuges and within these patches allopatric speciation occurred. With the end of the glacial period and increase in atmospheric humidity, rainforest began to expand and the refuges reconnected.[27] This theory has been the subject of debate. Scientists are still skeptical of whether or not this theory is legitimate. Genetic evidence suggests speciation had occurred in certain taxa 1√ø2 million years ago, preceding the Pleistocene.[28]\\r\\nTropical rainforests have harboured human life for many millennia, with many Indian tribes in South- and Central America, who belong to the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, the Congo Pygmies in Central Africa, and several tribes in South-East Asia, like the Dayak people and the Penan people in Borneo.[29] Food resources within the forest are extremely dispersed due to the high biological diversity and what food does exist is largely restricted to the canopy and requires considerable energy to obtain. Some groups of hunter-gatherers have exploited rainforest on a seasonal basis but dwelt primarily in adjacent savanna and open forest environments where food is much more abundant. Other people described as rainforest dwellers are hunter-gatherers who subsist in large part by trading high value forest products such as hides, feathers, and honey with agricultural people living outside the forest.[30]\\r\\nA variety of indigenous people live within the rainforest as hunter-gatherers, or subsist as part-time small scale farmers supplemented in large part by trading high-value forest products such as hides, feathers, and honey with agricultural people living outside the forest.[29][30] Peoples have inhabited the rainforests for tens of thousands of years and have remained so elusive that only recently have some tribes been discovered.[29] These indigenous peoples are greatly threatened by loggers in search for old-growth tropical hardwoods like Ipe, Cumaru and Wenge, and by farmers who are looking to expand their land, for cattle(meat), and soybeans, which are used to feed cattle in Europe and China.[29][31][32][33] On 18 January 2007, FUNAI reported also that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted tribes in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005. With this addition, Brazil has now overtaken the island of New Guinea as the country having the largest number of uncontacted tribes.[34] The province of Irian Jaya or West Papua in the island of New Guinea is home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups.[35]\\r\\nThe pygmy peoples are hunter-gatherer groups living in equatorial rainforests characterized by their short height (below one and a half meters, or 59?inches, on average). Amongst this group are the Efe, Aka, Twa, Baka, and Mbuti people of Central Africa.[36] However, the term pygmy is considered pejorative so many tribes prefer not to be labeled as such.[37]\\r\\nSome notable indigenous peoples of the Americas, or Amerindians, include the Huaorani, Ya?nomam?, and Kayapo people of the Amazon. The traditional agricultural system practiced by tribes in the Amazon is based on swidden cultivation (also known as slash-and-burn or shifting cultivation) and is considered a relatively benign disturbance.[38][39] In fact, when looking at the level of individual swidden plots a number of traditional farming practices are considered beneficial. For example, the use of shade trees and fallowing all help preserve soil organic matter, which is a critical factor in the maintenance of soil fertility in the deeply weathered and leached soils common in the Amazon.[40]\\r\\nThere is a diversity of forest people in Asia, including the Lumad peoples of the Philippines and the Penan and Dayak people of Borneo. The Dayaks are a particularly interesting group as they are noted for their traditional headhunting culture. Fresh human heads were required to perform certain rituals such as the Iban \\"kenyalang\\" and the Kenyah \\"mamat\\".[41] Pygmies who live in Southeast Asia are, amongst others, referred to as \\"Negrito\\".\\r\\nYam, coffee, chocolate, banana, mango, papaya, macadamia, avocado, and sugarcane all originally came from tropical rainforest and are still mostly grown on plantations in regions that were formerly primary forest. In the mid-1980s and 1990s, 40 million tons of bananas were consumed worldwide each year, along with 13 million tons of mango. Central American coffee exports were worth US$3 billion in 1970. Much of the genetic variation used in evading the damage caused by new pests is still derived from resistant wild stock. Tropical forests have supplied 250 cultivated kinds of fruit, compared to only 20 for temperate forests. Forests in New Guinea alone contain 251 tree species with edible fruits, of which only 43 had been established as cultivated crops by 1985.[42]\\r\\nIn addition to extractive human uses, rain forests also have non-extractive uses that are frequently summarized as ecosystem services. Rain forests play an important role in maintaining biological diversity, sequestering and storing carbon, global climate regulation, disease control, and pollination.[43]\\r\\nDespite the negative effects of tourism in the tropical rainforests, there are also several important positive effects.\\r\\nDeposits of precious metals (gold, silver, coltan) and fossil fuels (oil and natural gas) occur underneath rainforests globally. These resources are important to developing nations and their extraction is often given priority to encourage economic growth. Mining and drilling can require large amounts of land development, directly causing deforestation. In Ghana, a West African nation, deforestation from decades of mining activity left about 12% of the country's original rainforest intact.[46]\\r\\nWith the invention of agriculture, humans were able to clear sections of rainforest to produce crops, converting it to open farmland. Such people, however, obtain their food primarily from farm plots cleared from the forest[30][47] and hunt and forage within the forest to supplement this. The issue arising is between the independent farmer providing for his family and the needs and wants of the globe as a whole. This issue has seen little improvement because no plan has been established for all parties to be aided.[48]\\r\\nAgriculture on formerly forested land is not without difficulties. Rainforest soils are often thin and leached of many minerals, and the heavy rainfall can quickly leach nutrients from area cleared for cultivation. People such as the Yanomamo of the Amazon, utilize slash-and-burn agriculture to overcome these limitations and enable them to push deep into what were previously rainforest environments. However, these are not rainforest dwellers, rather they are dwellers in cleared farmland[30][47] that make forays into the rainforest. Up to 90% of the typical Yanamomo diet comes from farmed plants.[47]\\r\\nSome action has been taken by suggesting fallow periods of the land allowing secondary forest to grow and replenish the soil.[49] Beneficial practices like soil restoration and conservation can benefit the small farmer and allow better production on smaller parcels of land.\\r\\nThe tropics take a major role in reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide. The tropics (most notably the Amazon rainforest) are called carbon sinks.[citation needed] As major carbon reducers and carbon and soil methane storages, their destruction contributes to increasing global energy trapping, atmospheric gases.[citation needed] Climate change has been significantly contributed to by the destruction of the rainforests. A simulation was performed in which all rainforest in Africa were removed. The simulation showed an increase in atmospheric temperature by 2.5 to 5 degrees Celsius.[50]\\r\\nEfforts to protect and conserve tropical rainforest habitats are diverse and widespread. Tropical rainforest conservation ranges from strict preservation of habitat to finding sustainable management techniques for people living in tropical rainforests. International policy has also introduced a market incentive program called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) for companies and governments to outset their carbon emissions through financial investments into rainforest conservation.[51]","input":"Where are the world's tropical forests located?"},{"output":"regulates international trade","context":"The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an intergovernmental organization that regulates international trade. The WTO officially commenced on 1 January 1995 under the Marrakesh Agreement, signed by 124 nations on 15 April 1994, replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which commenced in 1948. It is the largest international economic organization in the world.[5][6] The WTO deals with regulation of trade in goods, services and intellectual property between participating countries by providing a framework for negotiating trade agreements and a dispute resolution process aimed at enforcing participants' adherence to WTO agreements, which are signed by representatives of member governments[7]:fol.9√ø10 and ratified by their parliaments.[8] Most of the issues that the WTO focuses on derive from previous trade negotiations, especially from the Uruguay Round (1986√ø1993).\\r\\nThe WTO's current Director-General is Roberto Azevdo,[9][10] who leads a staff of over 600 people in Geneva, Switzerland.[11] A trade facilitation agreement, part of the Bali Package of decisions, was agreed by all members on 7 December 2013, the first comprehensive agreement in the organization's history.[12][13]. On 23 January 2017, the amendment to the WTO Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement marks the first time since the organization opened in 1995 that WTO accords have been amended, and this change should secure for developing countries a legal pathway to access affordable remedies under WTO rules.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe WTO's predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), was established after World War II in the wake of other new multilateral institutions dedicated to international economic cooperation √ø such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. A comparable international institution for trade, named the International Trade Organization never started as the treaty was not approved by the U.S. and other signatories,[16][17][18] and so GATT slowly became a de facto international organization.[19]\\r\\nSeven rounds of negotiations occurred under GATT. The first real GATT trade rounds concentrated on further reducing tariffs. Then, the Kennedy Round in the mid-sixties brought about a GATT anti-dumping Agreement and a section on development. The Tokyo Round during the seventies was the first major attempt to tackle trade barriers that do not take the form of tariffs, and to improve the system, adopting a series of agreements on non-tariff barriers, which in some cases interpreted existing GATT rules, and in others broke entirely new ground. Because these plurilateral agreements were not accepted by the full GATT membership, they were often informally called \\"codes\\". Several of these codes were amended in the Uruguay Round, and turned into multilateral commitments accepted by all WTO members. Only four remained plurilateral (those on government procurement, bovine meat, civil aircraft and dairy products), but in 1997 WTO members agreed to terminate the bovine meat and dairy agreements, leaving only two.[20] Despite attempts in the mid-1950s and 1960s to create some form of institutional mechanism for international trade, the GATT continued to operate for almost half a century as a semi-institutionalized multilateral treaty regime on a provisional basis.[21]\\r\\nWell before GATT's 40th anniversary, its members concluded that the GATT system was straining to adapt to a new globalizing world economy.[24][25] In response to the problems identified in the 1982 Ministerial Declaration (structural deficiencies, spill-over impacts of certain countries' policies on world trade GATT could not manage etc.), the eighth GATT round √ø known as the Uruguay Round √ø was launched in September 1986, in Punta del Este, Uruguay.[24]\\r\\nIt was the biggest negotiating mandate on trade ever agreed: the talks were going to extend the trading system into several new areas, notably trade in services and intellectual property, and to reform trade in the sensitive sectors of agriculture and textiles; all the original GATT articles were up for review.[25] The Final Act concluding the Uruguay Round and officially establishing the WTO regime was signed 15 April 1994, during the ministerial meeting at Marrakesh, Morocco, and hence is known as the Marrakesh Agreement.[26]\\r\\nThe GATT still exists as the WTO's umbrella treaty for trade in goods, updated as a result of the Uruguay Round negotiations (a distinction is made between GATT 1994, the updated parts of GATT, and GATT 1947, the original agreement which is still the heart of GATT 1994).[24] GATT 1994 is not however the only legally binding agreement included via the Final Act at Marrakesh; a long list of about 60 agreements, annexes, decisions and understandings was adopted. The agreements fall into six main parts, the Agreement Establishing the WTO, the Multilateral Agreements on Trade in Goods,[27] the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, Dispute settlement[28] and reviews of governments' trade policies[29]\\r\\nIn terms of the WTO's principle relating to tariff \\"ceiling-binding\\" (No. 3), the Uruguay Round has been successful in increasing binding commitments by both developed and developing countries, as may be seen in the percentages of tariffs bound before and after the 1986√ø1994 talks.[30]\\r\\nThe highest decision-making body of the WTO is the Ministerial Conference, which usually meets every two years.[31] It brings together all members of the WTO, all of which are countries or customs unions. The Ministerial Conference can take decisions on all matters under any of the multilateral trade agreements. Some of these such as the inaugural ministerial conference in Singapore and the Cancun conference in 2003[32] involved arguments between developed and developing economies referred to as the \\"Singapore issues\\" such as agricultural subsidies while others such as the Seattle conference in 1999 created large demonstrations. The fourth ministerial conference in Doha in 2001 approved China's entry to the WTO and launched the Doha Development Round which was supplemented by the sixth WTO ministerial conference (in Hong Kong) when agricultural export subsidies were agreed to be phased out and adoption of the European Union's Everything but Arms initiative to phase out tariffs for goods from the Least Developed Countries.\\r\\nThe WTO launched the current round of negotiations, the Doha Development Round, at the fourth ministerial conference in Doha, Qatar in November 2001. This was to be an ambitious effort to make globalization more inclusive and help the world's poor, particularly by slashing barriers and subsidies in farming.[33] The initial agenda comprised both further trade liberalization and new rule-making, underpinned by commitments to strengthen substantial assistance to developing countries.[34]\\r\\nProgress stalled after over differences between developed nations and the major developing countries on issues such as industrial tariffs and non tariff barriers to trade[35] particularly against and between the EU and the US over their maintenance of agricultural subsidiesseen to operate effectively as trade barriers. Repeated attempts to revive the talks were unsuccessful[36] though the adoption of the Bali Ministerial Declaration in 2013[37] addressed bureaucratic barriers to commerce[38]\\r\\nAs of June?2012[update], the future of the Doha Round remained uncertain: the work programme lists 21 subjects in which the original deadline of 1 January 2005 was missed, and the round is still incomplete.[39] The conflict between free trade on industrial goods and services but retention of protectionism on farm subsidies to domestic agricultural sector (requested by developed countries) and the substantiation of fair trade on agricultural products (requested by developing countries) remain the major obstacles. This impasse has made it impossible to launch new WTO negotiations beyond the Doha Development Round. As a result, there have been an increasing number of bilateral free trade agreements between governments.[40] As of July 2012, there were various negotiation groups in the WTO system for the current agricultural trade negotiation which is in the condition of stalemate.[41]\\r\\nAmong the various functions of the WTO, these are regarded by analysts as the most important:\\r\\nAdditionally, it is WTO's duty to review and propagate the national trade policies, and to ensure the coherence and transparency of trade policies through surveillance in global economic policy-making.[43][45] Another priority of the WTO is the assistance of developing, least-developed and low-income countries in transition to adjust to WTO rules and disciplines through technical cooperation and training.[46]\\r\\nThe above five listings are the additional functions of the World Trade Organization. As globalization proceeds in today's society, the necessity of an International Organization to manage the trading systems has been of vital importance. As the trade volume increases, issues such as protectionism, trade barriers, subsidies, violation of intellectual property arise due to the differences in the trading rules of every nation. The World Trade Organization serves as the mediator between the nations when such problems arise. WTO could be referred to as the product of globalization and also as one of the most important organizations in today's globalized society.\\r\\nThe WTO is also a centre of economic research and analysis: regular assessments of the global trade picture in its annual publications and research reports on specific topics are produced by the organization.[48] Finally, the WTO cooperates closely with the two other components of the Bretton Woods system, the IMF and the World Bank.[44]\\r\\nThe WTO establishes a framework for trade policies; it does not define or specify outcomes. That is, it is concerned with setting the rules of the trade policy games.[49] Five principles are of particular importance in understanding both the pre-1994 GATT and the WTO:\\r\\nThere are three types of provision in this direction:\\r\\nExceptions to the MFN principle also allow for preferential treatment of developing countries, regional free trade areas and customs unions.[7]:fol.93\\r\\nThe General Council has the following subsidiary bodies which oversee committees in different areas:\\r\\nThe Service Council has three subsidiary bodies: financial services, domestic regulations, GATS rules and specific commitments.[54] The council has several different committees, working groups, and working parties.[58] There are committees on the following: Trade and Environment; Trade and Development (Subcommittee on Least-Developed Countries); Regional Trade Agreements; Balance of Payments Restrictions; and Budget, Finance and Administration. There are working parties on the following: Accession. There are working groups on the following: Trade, debt and finance; and Trade and technology transfer.\\r\\nThe WTO describes itself as \\"a rules-based, member-driven organizationall decisions are made by the member governments, and the rules are the outcome of negotiations among members\\".[59] The WTO Agreement foresees votes where consensus cannot be reached, but the practice of consensus dominates the process of decision-making.[60]\\r\\nRichard Harold Steinberg (2002) argues that although the WTO's consensus governance model provides law-based initial bargaining, trading rounds close through power-based bargaining favouring Europe and the U.S., and may not lead to Pareto improvement.[61]\\r\\nThe WTO's dispute-settlement system \\"is the result of the evolution of rules, procedures and practices developed over almost half a century under the GATT 1947\\".[62] In 1994, the WTO members agreed on the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) annexed to the \\"Final Act\\" signed in Marrakesh in 1994.[63] Dispute settlement is regarded by the WTO as the central pillar of the multilateral trading system, and as a \\"unique contribution to the stability of the global economy\\".[64] WTO members have agreed that, if they believe fellow-members are violating trade rules, they will use the multilateral system of settling disputes instead of taking action unilaterally.[65]\\r\\nThe operation of the WTO dispute settlement process involves case-specific panels[66] appointed by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB),[67] the Appellate Body,[68] The Director-General and the WTO Secretariat,[69] arbitrators,[70] and advisory experts.[71]\\r\\nThe priority is to settle disputes, preferably through a mutually agreed solution, and provision has been made for the process to be conducted in an efficient and timely manner so that \\"If a case is adjudicated, it should normally take no more than one year for a panel ruling and no more than 16 months if the case is appealed... If the complainant deems the case urgent, consideration of the case should take even less time.[72] WTO member nations are obliged to accept the process as exclusive and compulsory.[73]\\r\\nAccording to a 2018 study in the Journal of Politics, states are less likely and slower to enforce WTO violations when the violations affect states in a diffuse manner.[74] This is because states face collective action problems with pursuing litigation: they all expect other states to carry the costs of litigation.[74] A 2016 study in International Studies Quarterly challenges that the WTO dispute settlement system leads to greater increases in trade.[75]\\r\\nThe process of becoming a WTO member is unique to each applicant country, and the terms of accession are dependent upon the country's stage of economic development and current trade regime.[76] The process takes about five years, on average, but it can last longer if the country is less than fully committed to the process or if political issues interfere. The shortest accession negotiation was that of the Kyrgyz Republic, while the longest was that of Russia, which, having first applied to join GATT in 1993, was approved for membership in December 2011 and became a WTO member on 22 August 2012.[77] Kazakhstan also had a long accession negotiation process. The Working Party on the Accession of Kazakhstan was established in 1996 and was approved for membership in 2015.[78] The second longest was that of Vanuatu, whose Working Party on the Accession of Vanuatu was established on 11 July 1995. After a final meeting of the Working Party in October 2001, Vanuatu requested more time to consider its accession terms. In 2008, it indicated its interest to resume and conclude its WTO accession. The Working Party on the Accession of Vanuatu was reconvened informally on 4 April 2011 to discuss Vanuatu's future WTO membership. The re-convened Working Party completed its mandate on 2 May 2011. The General Council formally approved the Accession Package of Vanuatu on 26 October 2011. On 24 August 2012, the WTO welcomed Vanuatu as its 157th member.[79] An offer of accession is only given once consensus is reached among interested parties.[80]\\r\\nA 2017 study argues that \\"political ties rather than issue-area functional gains determine who joins\\" and shows \\"how geopolitical alignment shapes the demand and supply sides of membership\\".[81] The \\"findings challenge the view that states first liberalize trade to join the GATT/WTO. Instead, democracy and foreign policy similarity encourage states to join.\\"[81]\\r\\nA country wishing to accede to the WTO submits an application to the General Council, and has to describe all aspects of its trade and economic policies that have a bearing on WTO agreements.[83] The application is submitted to the WTO in a memorandum which is examined by a working party open to all interested WTO Members.[84]\\r\\nAfter all necessary background information has been acquired, the working party focuses on issues of discrepancy between the WTO rules and the applicant's international and domestic trade policies and laws. The working party determines the terms and conditions of entry into the WTO for the applicant nation, and may consider transitional periods to allow countries some leeway in complying with the WTO rules.[76]\\r\\nThe final phase of accession involves bilateral negotiations between the applicant nation and other working party members regarding the concessions and commitments on tariff levels and market access for goods and services. The new member's commitments are to apply equally to all WTO members under normal non-discrimination rules, even though they are negotiated bilaterally.[83]\\r\\nWhen the bilateral talks conclude, the working party sends to the general council or ministerial conference an accession package, which includes a summary of all the working party meetings, the Protocol of Accession (a draft membership treaty), and lists (\\"schedules\\") of the member-to-be's commitments. Once the general council or ministerial conference approves of the terms of accession, the applicant's parliament must ratify the Protocol of Accession before it can become a member.[85] Some countries may have faced tougher and a much longer accession process due to challenges during negotiations with other WTO members, such as Vietnam, whose negotiations took more than 11 years before it became official member in January 2007.[86]\\r\\nThe WTO has 164 members and 23 observer governments.[87] Liberia became the 163rd member on 14 July 2016, and Afghanistan became the 164th member on 29 July 2016.[88][89] In addition to states, the European Union, and each EU Country in its own right,[90] is a member. WTO members do not have to be fully independent states; they need only be a customs territory with full autonomy in the conduct of their external commercial relations. Thus Hong Kong has been a member since 1995 (as \\"Hong Kong, China\\" since 1997) predating the People's Republic of China, which joined in 2001 after 15 years of negotiations. The Republic of China (Taiwan) acceded to the WTO in 2002 as \\"Separate Customs Territory of China: Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu\\" (Chinese Taipei) despite its disputed status.[91] The WTO Secretariat omits the official titles (such as Counsellor, First Secretary, Second Secretary and Third Secretary) of the members of Chinese Taipei's Permanent Mission to the WTO, except for the titles of the Permanent Representative and the Deputy Permanent Representative.[92]\\r\\nAs of 2007, WTO member states represented 96.4% of global trade and 96.7% of global GDP.[93] Iran, followed by Algeria, are the economies with the largest GDP and trade outside the WTO, using 2005 data.[94][95] With the exception of the Holy See, observers must start accession negotiations within five years of becoming observers. A number of international intergovernmental organizations have also been granted observer status to WTO bodies.[96] 12 UN member states have no official affiliation with the WTO.\\r\\nThe WTO oversees about 60 different agreements which have the status of international legal texts. Member countries must sign and ratify all WTO agreements on accession.[97] A discussion of some of the most important agreements follows.\\r\\nThe Agreement on Agriculture came into effect with the establishment of the WTO at the beginning of 1995. The AoA has three central concepts, or \\"pillars\\": domestic support, market access and export subsidies.\\r\\nThe General Agreement on Trade in Services was created to extend the multilateral trading system to service sector, in the same way as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) provided such a system for merchandise trade. The agreement entered into force in January 1995.\\r\\nThe Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights sets down minimum standards for many forms of intellectual property (IP) regulation. It was negotiated at the end of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1994.[98]\\r\\nThe Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measuresalso known as the SPS Agreementwas negotiated during the Uruguay Round of GATT, and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO at the beginning of 1995. Under the SPS agreement, the WTO sets constraints on members' policies relating to food safety (bacterial contaminants, pesticides, inspection and labelling) as well as animal and plant health (imported pests and diseases).\\r\\nThe Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade is an international treaty of the World Trade Organization. It was negotiated during the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO at the end of 1994. The object ensures that technical negotiations and standards, as well as testing and certification procedures, do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade\\".[99]\\r\\nThe Agreement on Customs Valuation, formally known as the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of GATT, prescribes methods of customs valuation that Members are to follow. Chiefly, it adopts the \\"transaction value\\" approach.\\r\\nIn December 2013, the biggest agreement within the WTO was signed and known as the Bali Package.[100]\\r\\nThe procedures for the appointment of the WTO director-general were published in January 2003.[101] Additionally, there are four deputy directors-general.

India has a total water surface area of 360,400?km2[1][2]\\r\\nIndia produces 4 fuels, 11 metallic, 52 non-metallic and 22 minor minerals.[3] India's major mineral resources include Coal (4th largest reserves in the world), Iron ore, Manganese ore (7th largest reserve in the world as in 2013),[4] Mica, Bauxite (5th largest reserve in the world as in 2013),[5] Chromite, Natural gas, Diamonds, Limestone and Thorium (world's largest along coast of Kerala[6] shores). India's oil reserves, found in Bombay High off the coast of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and in eastern Assam meet 25% of the country's demand.[7][8]\\r\\nA national level agency National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS) was established in 1983 for integrated natural resources management in the country. It is supported by Planning Commission (India) and Department of Space.[9]\\r\\nBiotic resources are obtained from the living and organic material. These include forest products, wildlife, crops and other living organisms. Most of these resources are renewable because they can regenerate themselves. Fossil fuels are considered as biotic because they are formed from decayed organic matter. Fossil fuels are non-renewable.[10]\\r\\nIndia's land area includes regions with high rainfall to dry deserts, coastline to mountainous regions. Around 24.02 percent of the total geographical area consists of forests. Due to variations in climatic conditions and differences in altitude, different types of forest are present in India including tropical, swamp, mangrove and alpine. Forests are the main source of firewood, paper, spices, drugs, herbs, gums and more. Forests contribute a significant amount to the nation's GDP.[11]\\r\\nIndia has a long history in fishing and aquaculture. It has rich marine and inland water resources, and an 7516.6 km long coastline. Inland fishery is carried out in Rivers, Resources and Lakes. In Indian rivers more than 400 species of fish are found, many of which are economically important. Shrimp, sardines, mackerels, carangid, croakers and other varieties are available. Major Fish species available are carp, catfish, murrel and Weed fish.[12] India is one of the major marine fish producer. In 2012-2013, 9 lakh tonnes of marine products was exported.[13]\\r\\nCoal mining in India started in 1774 through the East India Company in the Raniganj Coalfield along the Western bank of Damodar River in the Indian state of West Bengal. Growth of the Indian coal mining started when steam locomotives were introduced in 1853. Production increased to Million tonnes. Production reached 30 million tonnes in 1946. After Independence, the National Coal Development Corporation was set up and colleries were owned by the railways. India consumes coal mainly for the power sector. Other industries like cement, fertilizer, chemical and paper rely on coal for energy.[14]\\r\\nIndia had about 750 million metric tonne of proven oil reserves as of April 2014, or 5.62 billion barrels as per EIA estimate for 2009,[15] which is the second-largest amount in the Asia-Pacific region behind China.[16] Most of India's crude oil reserves are located on the western coast (Mumbai High) and in the northeastern parts of the country, although considerable undeveloped reserves are also located in the offshore Bay of Bengal and in the state of Rajasthan. The combination of rising oil consumption and fairly unwavering production levels leaves India highly dependent on imports to meet its consumption needs. In 2010, India produced an average of about 33.69 million metric tonne of crude oil as of April 2010[17] or 877 thousand barrels per day as per EIA estimate of 2009.[15] During 2006, India consumed an estimated 2.63?Mbbl/d (418,000?m3/d) of oil.[18] The EIA estimates that India registered oil demand growth of 100,000?bbl/d (16,000?m3/d) during 2006. As of 2013 India Produces 30% of India's resources mostly in Rajasthan.[18]\\r\\nIndia's oil sector is dominated by state-owned enterprises, although the government has taken steps in past recent years to deregulate the hydrocarbons industry and support greater foreign involvement. India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation is the largest oil company. ONGC is the leading player in India's upstream sector, accounting for roughly 75% of the country's oil output during 2006, as per Indian government estimates.[16] As a net importer of all oil, the Indian Government has introduced policies aimed at growing domestic oil production and oil exploration activities. As part of the effort, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas crafted the New Exploration License Policy (NELP) in 2000, which permits foreign companies to hold 100% equity possession in oil and natural gas projects.[16] However, to date, only a handful of oil fields are controlled by foreign firms. India's downstream sector is also dominated by state-owned entities, though private companies have enlarged their market share in past recent years.\\r\\nAs per the Ministry of Petroleum, Government of India, India has 1,437?billion cubic metres (50.7G10^12?cu?ft) of confirmed natural gas reserves as of April 2010. A huge mass of India's natural gas production comes from the western offshore regions, particularly the Mumbai High complex. The onshore fields in Assam, tripura, Andhra Pradesh, and Gujarat states are also major producers of natural gas. As per EIA data, India produced 996?billion cubic feet (2.82G1010?m3) of natural gas in 2004.[19] India imports small amounts of natural gas. In 2004, India consumed about 1,089G10^9?cu?ft (3.08G1010?m3) of natural gas, the first year in which the country showed net natural gas imports. During 2004, India imported 93G10^9?cu?ft (2.6G109?m3) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.[19]\\r\\nAs in the oil sector, India's state-owned companies account for the bulk of natural gas production. ONGC and Oil India Ltd. (OIL) are the leading companies with respect to production volume, while some foreign companies take part in upstream developments in joint-ventures and production sharing contracts. Reliance Industries, a privately owned Indian company, will also have a bigger role in the natural gas sector as a result of a large natural gas find in 2002 in the Krishna Godavari basin.[19]\\r\\nThe Gas Authority of India Ltd. (GAIL) holds an effective control on natural gas transmission and allocation activities. In December 2006, the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas issued a new policy that allows foreign investors, private domestic companies, and Government oil companies to hold up to 100% equity stakes in pipeline projects. While GAIL's domination in natural gas transmission and allocation is not ensured by statute, it will continue to be the leading player in the sector because of its existing natural gas infrastructure.[19]\\r\\nAbiotic resources are obtained from the non-living and non-organic material. Some of the resources, like water and air, are renewable. Other resources like minerals are non-renewable and exhaustible because they cannot be regenerated. Minerals have many categories like metallic, non-metallic and minor minerals.\\r\\nMetallic minerals are the minerals which contain one or more metallic elements. They occur in rare, naturally formed concentrations known as mineral deposits. Metallic minerals available from India are zinc, iron ore, manganese ore, gold, bauxite, silver, lead, tin, copper and chromite.[20]\\r\\nCopper has been used since ancient times. Details of copper mining and metallurgy are available in ancient works like Arthashastra. Copper is mainly used in industrial applications, electrical/electronic equipment and Consumer products such as utensils. Major resources of copper are available at Rajasthan, Madhya pradesh and Jharkhand. As of 2010, India had 1.56 billion tonnes of copper ore.[21] India is one of the 20 major copper producers. In 2008, India produced 7,10,000 tonnes of copper.[22] Hindustan Copper Limited, a public sector company, is the only producer of primary refined copper. Post-pillar method and blast hole stoping method are used for mining. Some of the domestic demand is met through scrap recycling. In India, copper scrap is recycled through direct melting, which is a hazardous process.[21]\\r\\nZinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, diamagnetic metal. It is also a fair conductor of electricity. References to medicinal uses of zinc are present in the Charaka Samhita. Ancient zinc smelting technique was found at a zinc production site in Zawar, Rajasthan. Zinc is recovered from a number of different zinc ores. The types of zinc ores include sulfide, carbonate, silicate and oxide.[23] It is used in corrosive resistant coatings for iron and steel, and in the automotive, electrical and machinery industries. India is the World's fourth largest zinc reserve as in 2013.[24] Hindustan Zinc Limited is the main producer of zinc in India. Most of the resources are available in Rajasthan. A minor amount of resources are available in Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra states.[23]\\r\\nIndia is the world's third biggest exporter of iron ore as of 2013.[5] As of 2010, India had 27 billion tonnes or resource (including hematite and magnetite). The major amount of hematite is found in Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Goa. Minor amounts of hematite are found in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Most magnetite is found in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. Minor amounts of magnetite are found in Assam, Bihar, Goa, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Meghalaya and Nagaland. Mining is done by the opencast method. Iron ore is mainly used for manufacturing of pig iron, sponge iron and steel. It is also used in coal washeries, cement and glass industries.[25] Public sector companies like National Mineral Development Corporation and Steel Authority of India contribute to 25% of the total production. Private companies including Tata Steel provide major contribution.[26]\\r\\nChromite is an oxide of chromium and iron. It is the only commercial source of chromium. As on 2010, India had 200 million tonnes of resource. Major amount of resources are available from Orissa (Cuttack and Jajpur districts). Minor amount of resources are available from Manipur, Nagaland, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.[27] In 2009-2010, India produced 3.41 million tonnes and ranked second in world production.[28] It is mostly mined by opencast method. Chromium provides additional strength to the alloys and it is resistant to corrosion, so it is mainly used in metallurgical applications. It can withstand sudden temperature changes, so it is used in refractories. It is also used in chemical applications.[27]\\r\\nNon-metallic minerals are those which do not yield new products on melting. They are generally associated with sedimentary rocks. Non-Metallic minerals available from India are phosphorite, dolomite, gypsum, garnet, wollastonite, vermiculite, ochre, perlite, bentonite, asbestos, cadmium, felspar, soapstone, kaolin, sillimanite, limestone, diatomite, pyrophyllite, fluorite, vanadium, dunite, ilmenite, gallium and Zircon[29]\\r\\nIt is a group of complex silicate minerals and has similar chemical compositions. There are three groups of garnet - aluminum-garnet group, chromium-garnet group, and iron-garnet group. The minerals in aluminium-garnet group are almandine, grossularite, pyrope, and spessartine. The mineral in Iron-garnet group is andradite. The mineral in chromium-garnet group is uvarovite. Garnet group minerals occur in different rock types.[30] It is a hard substance. It is resistant to chemical exposure. It is used as a semi-precious stone and also in abrasives, sand blasting, water filtration materials and water jet cutting. Garnets are available in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Orissa, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. It is also found in beach sands of Kerala, Orissa and Tamil Nadu states.[31] In 2007-08, India produced 8,73,000 tonnes.[32]\\r\\nIt is a meta-silicate of calcium. It is mostly white in color and occurs as bladed or needle like crystals. As on 2010, India had 16 million tonnes of resource. Most of the deposits are available in Rajasthan (Dungarpur, Pali, Sirohi and Udaipur districts). Minor amount of deposits are found in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.[33] It is mainly used in ceramic industries and metallurgical applications. It is also used as a filler in wall tiles, paint, rubber and plastic. India is one of the largest reserves. In 2010, India produced 1,45,000 tons.[34] It is mined by opencast method. It is also used as a substitute for short-fibre asbestos in brake-linings. Central Building Research Institute has found that wollastonite can be used as substitute for chrysotile asbestos in cement products.[33]\\r\\nIt is a group of metamorphic minerals - sillimanite, kyanite and andalusite. These are polymorphs of alumino-silicate. These are formed under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. The three minerals are calcined to form mullite. Mainly used as refractory materials.[35] As on 2010, India had 66 million tonnes of sillimanite, 100 million tonnes of Kyanite and 18 million tonnes of Andalusite as resource. Most of the resources are found in Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Assam. Minor amount of resources are found in Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Rajasthan and West Bengal. Granular sillimanite is available in beach sands of South India. Sillimanite refractory bricks are used in steel, glass and petrochemical industries.[36] In 2004, India produced 14,500 tonnes of sillimanite and 6200 tonnes of kyanite.[35]\\r\\nIt is a compound of iron and titanium. It will be iron-black or steel-gray in color. It is a non-toxic material used in biomedical substances. Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology has developed an environmentally friendly technology for processing ilmenite.[37] It is also used in production of titanium dioxide pigment. It is available in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Orissa. Mining is done at Chavara, Chatrapur, Aluva and Manavalakurichi by Indian Rare Earths limited.[38] As on 2013, India has 21% of the world's reserves and constitutes 6% of the world's production.[39]\\r\\nIt is a hydrous alumino-silicate. It is chemically inert, has high melting point and low electrical conductivity. It is used in refractories, foundry dressings, pesticides, ceramics and rubber. It is available as hydrothermal deposits.[40] The physical and optical properties are pyrophyllite are similar to talc. It is also used in electrical insulators, sanitary-ware and in the glass industry. As on 2010, India had 56 million tonnes of this resource. Most of the resources are found in Madhya Pradesh (Chhatarpur, Tikamgarh and Shivpuri districts). The remaining resources are found in Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. In 2010, India produced 1.5 million tonnes.[41]\\r\\nMinor minerals available are building stone, brick earth, quartzite, marble, granite, gravel, clay and sand. These are mainly used in building constructions.[20] Environmental impact of mining these minerals was significant over a period of time even the area was small. Impacts were increasing water scarcity, damage to river beds and adverse effects on biodiversity. So from 2012 onwards, mining of these minerals are to be done after clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests. [42]\\r\\nMarble is a metamorphosed limestone formed by re-crystallization. It is available in different colours and textures. Marble deposits are available in many states of India.[43] It has been used in India for a long time. It was used in construction of Temples, Tombs and Palaces. Now it is also used for flooring in homes and offices. It is preferred for flooring because of its durability and water resistance.[44] Marbles which are economically important are available in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. As on 2010, there was 1931 million tonnes of resource, including all grades of marble. Based on the chemical composition, types of Marble available are Calcite, Dolomitic, Siliceous Limestone, Serpentine and Travertine marbles. Other than construction, it is used in Paint and Agricultural lime.[43]\\r\\nIndia's proven nuclear reserves include uranium and thorium.\\r\\nIn Nalgonda District, the Rajiv Gandhi Tiger Reserve (the only tiger project in Telangana) has been forced to surrender over 3,000?sq. kilometres to uranium mining, following a directive from the Central Ministry of Environment and Forests.[45]\\r\\nIn 2007, India was able to extract 229 tonnes of U3O8 from its soil.[46] On 19 July 2011, Indian officials announced that the Tumalapalli mine in Andhra Pradesh state of India could provide more than 170,000 tonnes of uranium, making it as the world's largest uranium mine. Production of the ore is slated to begin in 2012.[47]\\r\\nThe Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) recently discovered that the upcoming mine in Tumalapalli has close to 49,000 tonne of uranium reserves. This could help India's nuclear power aspirations as it is three times the original estimate of the area's deposits.[48]\\r\\nThe IAEA's 2005 report estimates India's reasonably assured reserves of thorium at 319,000 tonnes, but mentions recent reports of India's reserves at 650,000 tonnes.[49] A government of India estimate, shared in the country's Parliament in August 2011, puts the recoverable reserve at 846,477 tonnes.[50] The Indian Minister of State V. Narayanasamy stated that as of May 2013, the country's thorium reserves were 11.93 million tonnes (monazite, having 9-10% ThO2[51]), with a significant majority (8.59 Mt; 72%) found in the three eastern coastal states of Andhra Pradesh (3.72 Mt; 31%), Tamil Nadu (2.46 Mt; 21%) and Odisha (2.41 Mt; 20%).[52] Both the IAEA and OECD appear to conclude that India may possess the largest share of world's thorium deposits.","input":"How many types of minerals are there in india?"},{"output":"China","context":"The permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (also known as the Permanent Five, Big Five, or P5) are the five states which the UN Charter of 1945 grants a permanent seat on the UN Security Council (UNSC):\\r\\nThese countries were all allies in World War II, which they won.
